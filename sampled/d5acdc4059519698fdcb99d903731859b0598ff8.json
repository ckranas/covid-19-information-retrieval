            "text": "Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common ICU-acquired infection in intubated critically ill patients. Microaspiration of gastric and oropharyngeal contaminated secretions represents the primary mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of VAP. Tracheal cuff plays an important role in stopping the progression of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. In vitro and animal studies suggested that leakage was significantly reduced with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) conical-cuffed tubes compared with barrel (standard) or cylindrical cuffs. Clinical studies found conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the superiority of PVC conical-versus barrel (standard)-cuffed tracheal tube on abundant microaspiration of gastric contents in intubated critically ill patients. Materials and methods BEST CUFF is a prospective multicenter (ten French ICUs) cluster randomized controlled crossover and open-label trial performed in patients with predicted duration of mechanical ventilation \u226548 h. Patients were allocated to be intubated using a PVC standard (barrel)-shaped or a PVC conical-shaped tracheal tube. Prevention measures of VAP were standardized in all ICUs. The main objective was to demonstrate the superiority of conical versus standard cuff shape in reducing abundant microaspiration of gastric contents (pepsin level >200 ng/ml in at least 30 % of tracheal aspirates). After inclusion, tracheal aspirates were collected for 48 h to measure pepsin and salivary amylase, and diagnose gastric and oropharyngeal microaspiration. To diagnose tracheobronchial colonization, quantitative aspirate was performed after intubation and two times a week until extubation. In patients with suspected VAP, quantitative tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage was performed to confirm the diagnosis. We hypothesized that the use of conical-cuffed tracheal tubes would reduce the incidence of abundant microaspiration of gastric contents from 50 to 30 % of study patients. With a two-sided alpha risk of 5 %, a power of 80 %, and to account for an anticipated rate of 10 % of patients without any tracheal secretions, 312 patients had to be recruited. Results A total of 326 patients were included during the study period (June 2014-September 2015). Pepsin and salivary amylase measurement is actually performed, and all results should be available in November 2015. Statistical analyses will be performed in mid-December, and study results will be presented at the 2016 R\u00e9animation Congress. Discussion Our study is sufficiently powered to detect a significant difference in microaspiration of gastric contents between patients intubated with conical-cuffed tracheal tubes and standard-cuffed tracheal tubes. One of the strengths of this study is the use of quantitative measurement of pepsin as a marker of microaspiration. Conclusion BEST CUFF is the first randomized controlled study evaluating the impact of PVC tracheal cuff shape on microaspiration of gastric contents. The results will be presented at the 2016 R\u00e9animation Congress.",

            "text": "Introduction Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) is a ventilatory mode that tailors the level of assistance delivered by the ventilator to the electromyographic activity of the diaphragm. The objective of the present study was to compare the impact of mechanical ventilation with NAVA or pressure support ventilation (PSV) on the early phase of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Patients and methods A multicenter randomized controlled trial of 128 intubated adults recovering from an acute respiratory failure was conducted in 11 intensive care units (ICUs) from April 2010 to June Introduction Few data are available on the pharmacokinetics of \u03b2-lactams in critically ill cirrhotic patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether \u03b2-lactam concentrations were altered in patients with cirrhosis compared with other critically ill patients and to identify the principal risk factors for any differences. Materials and methods We reviewed data from critically ill cirrhotic patients and matched controls in which routine therapeutic drug monitoring of broad-spectrum \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin/ tazobactam; meropenem) was performed. Serum drug concentrations were measured twice during the elimination phase by high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibiotic pharmacokinetics was calculated using a one-compartment model. We considered therapy was adequate when serum drug concentrations were between 4 and 8 times the minimal inhibitory concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during optimal periods of time for each drug \u226550 % for piperacillin/tazobactam; \u226540 % for meropenem). Results We studied 38 cirrhotic patients (16 for piperacillin/tazobactam and 22 for meropenem) and 38 matched controls. Drug dosing was similar in the two groups. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed a lower volume of distribution of meropenem (p = 0.05) and a lower antibiotic clearance of piperacillin/tazobactam (p = 0.009) in patients with cirrhosis when compared to non-cirrhotic patients. Patients with cirrhosis more often had excessive (23/38) than insufficient (5/38) or adequate (10/38) serum \u03b2-lactam concentrations; they also had excessive drug concentrations more frequently than did control patients (23/38 vs. 13/38-p = 0.02), particularly for piperacillin/tazobactam (9/16 vs. 2/16-p = 0.01). The only variable significantly associated with insufficient drug concentrations was the creatinine clearance on the day of the therapeutic drug monitoring. No specific variable was associated with excessive drug concentrations. Conclusion This case-control study shows that standard doses of \u03b2-lactams result in excessive serum concentrations in two-thirds of critically ill patients with cirrhosis, especially in those treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. Our results support routine \u03b2-lactam therapeutic drug monitoring in this patient population.",

            "text": "Introduction Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has been suggested to decrease the accuracy of dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness, especially for the distensibility index of the inferior vena cava (\u2206IVC). The goal of our study was to confirm this limitation in a large series of unselected patients. Materials and methods This is a sub-study of an observational, prospective and multicenter study (Hemopred) that we conducted between November 2012 and November 2014. All sedated patients under mechanical ventilation who required an echocardiographic assessment for an acute circulatory failure, with an inserted central venous catheter and arterial catheter, were eligible. Acute circulatory failure was defined as a sustained hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or mean blood pressure <65 mmHg) and/or the presence of clinical signs of hypoperfusion (e.g., mottled skin, oliguria), metabolic acidosis (pH <7.35 and base excess less than \u22125 mmol/L), elevated lactate (>2 mmol/L) or decreased central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2 <70 %). Dynamic parameters used to predict fluid responsiveness assessed in this study were pulse pressure variations (\u2206PP) and the following echocardiographic indices: respiratory variations of aortic Doppler maximal velocity (\u2206V max ), collapsibility index of superior vena cava (\u2206SVC) and \u2206IVC. At the time of echocardiography, a systematic measurement of the bladder pressure was performed as recommended and elevated IAP was defined as a pressure \u226512 mmHg. Response to fluids was defined by an increase in cardiac output of more than 10 % during a passive leg raising (PLR), as previously validated. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was built for each recorded dynamic parameter. Results Among the 540 patients included in the study, 174 (32 %) had an elevated IAP (group 1). No difference was observed compared with the remaining patients without elevated IAP (group 2), except for patients with an abdominal surgery (32 vs 23 %, p = 0.03). Among group 1, 81 patients had an IAP between 12 and 15 mmHg and 93 patients had an IAP >15 mmHg. Central venous pressure (CVP) was increased in group 1 compared with group 2 (11 \u00b1 5 vs 9 \u00b1 5 mmHg, p < 0.001), as well as plateau pressure (Pplat) (20 \u00b1 5 vs 18 \u00b1 5 cmH 2 O, p < 0.001). In group 1, 81 (46 %) patients were classified as responders by the PLR, compared with 124 (40 %) in group 2 (p = 0.18). No difference between the AUC for \u2206IVC (0.64 vs 0.59, p = 0.46), \u2206PP (0.71 vs 0.66, p = 0.47) and \u2206V max (0.83 vs 0.71, p = 0.06) was observed between groups 1 and 2, respectively, although AUC was increased in group 1 for \u2206SVC (0.72 vs 0.82, p = 0.02). No difference was observed regarding the feasibility between the two groups for any parameters, although feasibility for \u2206IVC was 74 % in group 1 compared with 80 % in group 2 (p = 0.1). Conclusion Thirty-two percent of patients in our series of unselected ventilated patient with shock had an elevated IAP. They demonstrated higher CVP and Pplat and more benefited from abdominal surgery. Elevated IAP did not have significant effect on accuracy of dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness, even though \u2206IVC was less frequently recorded (nonsignificant) and \u2206SVC had a better prediction.",

Hemodynamic status before the initiation of depletion was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Thoracic ultrasound was performed to estimate extravascular lung water.

Median time to initiation of fluid removal was 4 days (IQR 4.5). Fluid removal was performed in nine cases by loop diuretics and in eight cases with renal replacement therapy. The median depletion was 1617.5 ml (IQR 2025.8). Fifty percent were intubated and ventilated. Seven out of eight patients had spontaneous ventilatory cycles. Pulse pressure variation could be calculated in only one patient. Nine patients (56.2 %) did not tolerate fluid removal. The median SOFA at inclusion was significantly higher in patients who had poor hemodynamic tolerance to depletion compared with patients who well tolerated the depletion (9 \u00b1 3 vs 5 \u00b1 5.5, p = 0.036). All patients with catecholamine therapy (n = 4; median posology 0.087 \u00b5g/kg/min) did not hemodynamically tolerate fluid removal. Initial median cardiac index in patients who developed arterial hypotension was 2.7 \u00b1 1.6 l/min/m 2 and 3.6 \u00b1 3 l/min/m 2 among those who did not develop hypotension (p = 0.088). All patients having cardiac index lower than 2.7 l/min/m 2 developed hypotension. Diastolic blood pressure of patients with hemodynamic instability was significantly lower (56 \u00b1 10.5 vs 72 \u00b1 18 mmHg, p = 0.042). Four out of five (80 %) of the patients with positive passive leg raising test showed hemodynamic intolerance to fluid removal, while only one patient (16.7 %) had a positive passive leg raising test in the well-tolerated depletion group (p = 0.58). Patients with well hemodynamic tolerance to fluid removal had approximately twice as many B lines than patients having poorly tolerated fluid removal (14 \u00b1 17 vs 7 \u00b1 13.3, p = 0.152). Discussion Our results suggest that a preload dependence (shown by a positive passive leg raising test) and a lower accumulation of extravascular lung water (shown by fewer B lines) are associated with a poor hemodynamic tolerance to fluid removal. A precarious hemodynamic state (cardiac index lower than 2.7 l/min/m 2 , catecholamines therapy and lower diastolic arterial pressure) also appears predictive of a poor fluid removal hemodynamic tolerance. Patients with poorly tolerated fluid depletion had a higher SOFA score, indicating a greater severity of these patients. These results must be confirmed in a larger cohort.",

Conclusion Our study is one of the first on hypoxemic pneumonia in children. HFNC could be secure, useful and effective in this indication. The successful rate is 67 %. Identification of criteria associated with failure could help the physician to optimize the timing of secondary support, mainly intubation.

All patients were closely monitored for CO 2 (PCO 2 and end-tidal CO 2 ). When feasible, transcranial Doppler was performed in 78 % of patients. Despite the risk of bleeding, eight patients had a monitoring of intracranial pressure. 4-Therapies All patients received heparin therapy, and nine cases had endovascular treatment (21.9 %), osmotherapy (53.7 %), and decompressive craniectomy (16 cases, 39 %) were necessary to control intracranial hypertension. 63.4 % received norepinephrine to improve brain perfusion, and 90.2 % of patients were under mechanical ventilation. Thirty-one patients received antiepileptic drugs. 5-Outcome Ten out of 41 patients (24.4 %) died in ICU, and 18/31 (58.1 %) discharged from ICU had a good outcome (mRS 0-3). After 12 months, 92 % of survivors (23/25) had a mRS between 0 and 3. The proportion of death was 31.7 % at 1 year. Compared with ICU deaths, survivors were: predominance of female (p = 0.039), a worse initial GCS [4 (3-6) ; p = 0.0004], a more frequent mydriasis (100 vs. 32.3 %, p = 0.0001) with more frequent signs of intracranial hypertension on imaging techniques (p = 0.003), with a trend for more frequent use of norepinephrine (90 and 54.8 %, respectively) and an anticoagulation more difficult to be adequate (50 vs. 80.6 %, respectively). Comparing good outcome with poor outcome after 1-year evolution, patients mRS 0-3 appeared with a higher platelets count at day 1 (p = 0.03) and day 5 (p = 0.06) during ICU stay, as a lower D-dimer level after initiation of anticoagulation (p = 0.03).",

Anemia is a frequent underlying condition in such patients who are then likely to receive red blood cell transfusion as part of early hemodynamic resuscitation. However, the optimal threshold and the eventual benefit of red blood cell transfusion in septic acute circulatory failure remain debated. In this study, we investigated the indications of red blood cell transfusion and its impact on outcome in a large cohort of patients with hematological malignancies who were admitted to the ICU for the main diagnosis of severe sepsis and septic shock. Patients and methods TRIAL-OH is a prospective, multicenter observational study that included 1011 patients with hematological malignancies who required ICU admission in 2010-2011 in 17 French and Belgian centers (1) . We focused on patients admitted in ICU with a definite diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock according to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign definitions. We addressed the requirements for red blood cell transfusion during the first 48 h as part of initial resuscitation. [8] [9] [10] ). Early red blood cell transfusion was more likely in patients with myeloid neoplasms and neutropenia. Transfused patients appeared with more severe presentations as assessed by higher admission SOFA scores (8 [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] vs. 6 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , p < 0.001) and blood lactate levels ( , p = 0.03, respectively). Discussion Although early red blood transfusion was provided to the most severe septic patients, it remained associated with a poor prognosis in the multivariate analysis. Whether transfusion may represent a potent marker of severity in this setting or may favor subsequent side effects in septic patients deserves further investigations.",

Data are expressed as numbers (%) and medians (interquartile range 13 (17.6 %) HUS and 10 (13.5 %) other TMA. At ICU admission, hemoglobin rate was 8.2 g/dl (6.8-9.7), platelet rate 17 G/l (9-31), LDH level 1743 U/l (1064-2581) and creatininemia 113.5 \u00b5mol/l (75-184), and 43 patients (64.2 %) displayed elevated troponin levels. Day 1 SAPS2 score was 21.5 and SOFA score was 6 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . ICU length of stay was 7 days (4-11), and hospital length of stay was 16.5 days (12.5-28.5). Five patients (9.4 %) died during hospital stay. Earlier TMA manifestation was neurologic in 25 cases (33. 8 %) , digestive in 20 cases (27 %), uro-nephrologic in 14 cases (18.9 %), dermatologic in 12 cases (16.2 %), cardiologic in ten cases (13.5 %) and respiratory in nine cases ( [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , p = 0.03). First medical contact consisted in hospital consultation in 58 cases (78.4 %) including 45 emergency department (ED) consultations, six direct admissions to specialized ICUs (three neurologic and three cardiologic) and three direct admissions to medico-surgical wards. In 16 (21.6 %) cases, the first medical contact was community based (15 general practice and one cardiology practice). Patients were admitted in one hospital ward (range 0-5) before medical ICU referral. Only 14 patients (18.9 %) were directly admitted to a medical ICU performing PEX, after first medical contact with an ED (11 cases) or hospital-based consultations (three cases). None of these patients died. Prior to ICU admission, 21 patients were managed in the ED (27 cases [34.5 %]), another medical ICU in nine cases (15 %) or a medico-surgical ward (24 cases [40 %]). Secondary referral to ICU where PEX was available was similar in patients first admitted to ED or medico-surgical wards (63 vs 70.8 %), but time to ICU transfer was shorter for patients admitted first to ED than for patients directly admitted to wards (1 days [0-1] vs 3 days [1. [5] [6] [7] , p < 0.01). Patients admitted first to another ICU were secondarily referred to our ICU for refractory TMA within 6 days (0.5-10.5).",

Among the 15 patients included in the study, six patients (40 %) had short weaning period and nine patients (60 %) had prolonged weaning (\u22653 days). Patients with prolonged weaning group had less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep episodes and shorter REM sleep duration than patients with short weaning (0.0 episodes [0.0-2.0] vs 6.0 [4.5-6.8 ] and 0 min [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] vs 43 , p = 0.02 for both). Atypical sleep and/or pathological wake [2] was more likely to be found in the prolonged weaning group: 56 % of the patients (5/9) versus 17 % (1/6) although this difference was not significant (p = 0.29). Patients with absent or altered electroencephalographic reactivity (n = 10/15) were more likely to have prolonged weaning than the others (80 % of the patients with absent/altered reactivity had prolonged weaning vs 20 % of the patients with normal reactivity, p = 0.03). Maximal inspiratory pressure was similar in the two groups as well proportion of delirium. The only difference was a lower peripheral muscular strength in the prolonged weaning group as indicated by a lower MRC score (32 [28-55] vs 59 [55-60], p = 0.02).

Introduction Systemic antifungal therapy of invasive candidiasis needs to be initiated immediately upon clinical suspicion. Unfortunately, no diagnostic tests are available to firmly confirm or discard the diagnosis of IC in the absence of positive blood cultures or non-contaminated positive sample from a sterile site. Controversies exist about adequate time and potential harms of antifungal de-escalation in documented and suspected candidiasis in intensive care unit patients. Our objective was to investigate whether de-escalation within 5 days of antifungal initiation is associated with an increase of the 28-day death in systemic antifungal therapy treated non-neutropenic adult intensive care unit patients. Patients and methods From the 835 non-neutropenic adults recruited in a multicenter prospective observational study, we selected the patients receiving systemic antifungal therapy for a documented or suspected invasive candidiasis in the intensive care units and who were still alive 5 days after systemic antifungal therapy initiation. They were included into two groups according to the occurrence of observed systemic antifungal therapy de-escalation before day 6. The average causal systemic antifungal therapy de-escalation effect on 28-day death was evaluated by using a double-robust inverse probability of treatment weight estimator which is a causal inference method based on observational data. The objective of this estimator is to balance the distribution of baseline confounders across de-escalation groups, in order to reach the condition of a randomized controlled trial. Results Among the 647 included patients, early de-escalation at day 5 after antifungal initiation occurred in 142 patients (22 %), including 48 (34 %) patients whose systemic antifungal therapy was stopped before day 6. Patients in the de-escalation group were younger and had a shorter previous intensive care unit stay, but their SAPSII or SOFA score at intensive care unit admission was similar. The rate of proven invasive candidiasis was not different between de-escalation and no de-escalation groups. After adjustment on the baseline confounders, early systemic antifungal therapy de-escalation was not associated with increased 28-day mortality (RR 1.12, 95 % CI [0.76-1.66]). Subgroup analyses did not show any effect of early de-escalation on mortality, and there was no effect of early stopping on morality either (RR 0.98 [0.71-1.35]) (Fig. 10) . Finally, the number of days alive without SAT at day 28 was higher in the de-escalation group (14 days [5; 23] ) than in the no de-escalation group (10 days [2; 17] p < 0.01) leading to a median cost difference of 1100 euros in favor of de-escalation group.",

However, no study has used the power of genome or exome sequencing in this clinical condition. Hence, we design an exome study to search for genetic factors involved in the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). Patients and methods Patients had been previously participated in Pneumagene study that included 3200 ICU patients, which should be on invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 2 days and had no immunodepression, and no risk factor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP (COPD, Pa colonization). For PaVAP group, inclusion criteria included the presence of two or more VAP due to Pa during the same ICU stay. Control group (C) included patients that had no VAP and have not been colonized by Pa during mechanical ventilation (MV) and that can be matched with one PaVAP patient on values of age, SAPS2, duration of MV, reason for ICU admission, potential risk factors for VAP (coma, ARDS, head trauma) and outcome. The Knome Company performed exome sequencing and analysis with the SKAT Common Rare algorithm. Multiple testing was corrected by bootstrap resampling technique with 1000 resamples and a FWER = 0.05. Results Fifty patients were included in each group. Median age, SAPS2, gender and Pa risk factors were not different between the groups. The control group had higher duration of MV that PaVAP group (59 vs 52.6, respectively, p < 0.05). One thousand genetic variants were finally detected and analyzed. After multiple corrections, 178 loci remain statistically associated with PaVAP risk. Interestingly, two areas appear to be of high interest on the same part of the genome chr 16 p11.2 (26 SNPs and 20 SNPs, respectively, for area 1 and area 2). These two areas are gene deserts but have already been reported in GWAs and seem to be involved in gene regulation. Conclusion This is the first exome study in ICU patients that did not reveal clear significant genetic variant that can be associated with risk of PaVAP, despite the presence of two promising areas on the chromosome 16. This powerful approach may offer new opportunities for understanding infectious disease susceptibility, severity, treatment, control and prevention.",

CMV primoinfection was obtained by intraperitoneal inoculation of 2 \u00d7 10 4 PFU of murine CMV (MCMV) Smith strain. Seropositivity was confirmed by immunofluorescence in serum. MCMV was considered to be latent 4 months later. Reactivation was triggered by cecal ligature and puncture (CLP). Mice were considered to have a CMV reactivation 2 weeks after CLP. After this, 32 MCMV-positive mice underwent an intranasal inoculation with 5 \u00d7 10 8 CFU of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) to induce pneumonia. Twenty-nine MCMV-negative BALB/c mice were treated according to the same protocol, including CLP (control group). Daily weight, signs of sepsis and spontaneous mortality were noted. After 15 days, surviving mice were euthanized. Blood and lung were collected for bacterial culture. Interferon alpha and gamma were assessed in the serum of both groups. MCMV reactivation was assessed by PCR in the lungs. A second cohort of 26 mice was treated according to the same protocol (13 MCMV positive and 13 control) but were killed at day 2 and day 5 after pneumonia. The same samples were performed after killing. Results No mortality from staphylococcal pneumonia was observed in the control group, whereas the mortality rate was of 9 % in the MCMV group (p = 0.09). The weight loss at day 3 after pneumonia was higher in MCMV mice than in the control group (2.2 vs 0.7 g, respectively; p = 0.005). Macroscopic observation and bacteriological analysis of lungs showed staphylococcal abscesses in 5/32 mice in MCMV group as compared to 0/29 in control group at day 15. At day 5, 3/8 mice had lung abscesses in MCMV group as compared to 0/6 in control group. Overall, 8/40 (20 %) mice had lung staphylococcal abscesses in MCMV group as compared to 0 % in control group (p = 0.011). Lung bacterial count (median (interquartile range) was significantly higher in MCMV-positive mice as compared to control mice at day 2 [5 \u00d7 10 3 (10 3 -3 \u00d7 10 5 ) CFU/lung vs 10 2 (0-4 \u00d7 10 2 ) CFU/lung; p = 0.007] and day 5 [2.5 \u00d7 10 4 (1.6 \u00d7 10 3 -6.5 \u00d7 10 5 ) vs 15 ; p = 0.005].

In a recent study focused on relatives' experience and grieving process after request for organ donation, relatives were followed up for 9 months to complete instruments measuring the risk of presenting anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms as well as complicated grief. After this follow-up, in-depth interviews were led with voluntary relatives in order to permit a better understanding of their experience: understand how they construct and frame their experience 1 year after the patient's death; analyse the meaning they give to their decision; draw parallels, regarding experiences and feelings, between the experience of donor versus non-donor relatives; and qualify the impact of the decision on the grieving process.",

Search for continuity Relatives stress the importance of being able to follow-up the transplantation process. If some relatives want news, they must get it; if others do not, they need to know they can. Ambiguity is central, as relatives are incapable of considering a possible failure of the organ donation process. With failure comes the risk of dehumanising the organ donation process. Impact on the grieving process Organ donation decision impacts on relatives' experience at two levels. First, on a personal level, accepting organ donation can help give meaning to the patient's death (\"He did not die for nothing\") but can also be experienced as a moral duty (\"I respected my son, there was no choice\"). Second, on a social level, relatives who accepted become organ donation \"ambassadors\" by encouraging discussions about organ donation and by expressing their positive perspective on the subject. Conclusion Relatives invest strong meaning into organ donation decision-making. The decision requires reflection prior to the experience and is made with respect to the patient and to the relative him/herself. Relatives cannot afford ambiguity as the decision impacts on their grieving process and on the meaning they give to the patient's death.",

During the study period, booklets were provided freely to patients' relatives and ICU staff members as a practical tool to help accompanying children who were likely to visit a patient. We used a prospective before-after study design with a questionnaire at baseline and 1 year post-intervention to assess the impact of the booklet on practices in ICU staff members (nurses, auxiliary nurses and physicians). The participants were split into an intervention centre (booklet available) and a control centre (booklet not available). Both centres were general ICUs and were part of a same university hospital. These ICUs were comparable regarding the nurse-to-patient ratio, the number of visiting hours and the admission policy for family visits. Primary endpoints were the proportion of participants who supported visiting children over the 3 months prior to the questionnaire, and the Moral Distress Scale Revised (MDS-R) to evaluate the emotional experience of staff members in this setting. Results Fifty-seven booklets were distributed in the intervention ICU (8 % of admitted patients). During the study period (07/2014-07/2015), 93 children were likely to visit their relative.

Among them, 77 % mentioned a discomfort when confronted to gasps, when 43 and 91 % of the respondents think that gasps are uncomfortable for the dying child and for the parents, respectively. Consequently, 83 % of the respondents declare that gasps should be ceased, primarily for the parents or the child discomfort, but also for the healthcare providers. According to the respondents, the efficient treatments against gasps are sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockers. About one-third and twothirds of the respondents reported that gasps are interfering with their accompaniment of the dying child and of their parents, respectively. Finally, one-third of the respondents declare that they are personally emotionally affected by the occurrence of gasps. Most of the respondents (78 %) state that parents should be informed before the onset of gasps. Avoiding words with negative meanings, they suggest explaining that gasps are not associated with a willingness to survive and are not respiratory movements and further that their occurrence and their length are unpredictable and above all that they are not uncomfortable or painful. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents declare not knowing the mechanism leading to gasps when 60 % think that gasps are secondary to severe brainstem hypoxia or decerebration. Discussion The prevalence of gasps is not found in the literature but seems to be high according to pediatricians and neonatologists. Gasp is a reflex of auto-resuscitation that follows a functional decerebration induced by a severe brainstem hypoxia. It is believed that gasps are not painful or uncomfortable for the dying patient although this is debated. Nonetheless, in our study, 43 % of the healthcare providers declare that gasps are uncomfortable for the patient, which is indicating a treatment to stop them. Moreover, 91 % think that they provoke discomfort for the parents and 77 % for the healthcare providers. There exist some case reports about the negative feelings of the parents witnessing gasps, but no studies addressing how healthcare providers confronted to sign of end-of-life in dying child react. Even if gasps are not uncomfortable for the dying child, a treatment would seem to be required to avoid distress of the witnessing parents. However, neuromuscular blockers, the only active compounds against gasps, are related to active euthanasia in ventilator-free children. No official instructions exist on the timing and the content of information to be given to the parents. Some recommendations about the sign of end-of-life suggest informing the family before their onset. Only onethird of the respondents, although working in intensive care units, followed a specific formation for palliative cares or end-of-life. This could explain that more than one-third does not know the mechanisms leading to gasps, resuscitating in part their discomfort. Conclusion Gasps seem to be frequent at the time of end-of-life, and they can be very impressive for the parents. In our study, we show that gasps provoke discomfort to the healthcare providers too and complicate their accompaniment of the parents and the dying child. Almost half of the healthcare providers think that gasps should be prevented, mainly for the well-being of the parents. A lack of specific formation is likely a source of the difficulties of the healthcare providers. A dedicated formation would allow the healthcare providers to better assist the parents and diminish their distress. Finally, studies on the prevalence of gasps in pediatric population and on how the parents are dealing with them, depending upon the information given by healthcare providers would help us to limit parental and professional distress.",

Malignant primary brain tumors (MPBT) are rare tumors representing <2 % of all new cancer cases in Europe in 2012.

Median GCS score was 12 (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Mechanical ventilation was required in 124 (55 %) patients, catecholamine support in 93 (41 %) and dialysis in 25 (34 %). Eleven (5 %) received chemotherapy during their ICU stay. Neuroimaging, lumbar puncture and EEG were performed in 113 (50 %), 73(32 %) and 63 (28 %) patients and were deemed contributive to final diagnosis in 51 (45 %), 18 (25 %) and 24 (38 %) cases, respectively. Finally, a neurosurgical biopsy was performed in only one patient providing the cause of neurological impairment. Topographic localizations of the cause of neurological failure were as follows: encephalic in 200 (88 %), meningeal in 5 (2 %), brainstem in 2, cerebellar and/or medullary in 1, and undetermined in 17 (8 %) . According to the direct/indirect classification, malignancy involvement was sought being direct in 11 (5 % Background Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a complication of cirrhosis, presents clinically from mild neuropsychiatric symptoms to coma. It is a major public health problem, it is associated with a poor prognosis, one-half of the patients presenting HE will die in the following year. The physiopathology of HE is complex and multifactorial. Since decades, a relationship between ammonia and the occurrence HE has been proposed, but remains still controversial. The correlation between the severity of HE and the ammonia levels is thus still debated. Often in clinical practice, the serum ammonia is not measured in cirrhotic patients with altered neurological examination.",

            "text": "Methods We included prospectively all cirrhotic patients hospitalised in Liver ICU for severe cirrhosis decompensations. Serum ammonia was measured at admission, during the hospitalisation and at the discharge from ICU. Neurological status was assessed by West-Haven (WH) and Glasgow scores. Overt HE was diagnosed as a West-Haven score ranging between 2 and 4. Results Ninety-eight cirrhotic patients hospitalised in ICU between May 2014 and September 2015 were included. The main clinical characteristics were as follows: mean age was 58 \u00b1 13 years, 74 patients were male, and the aetiology of the liver cirrhosis was: alcoholic (48 %), virus (12 %), mixed (alcool + virus/metabolic) (22 %) and other (15 % Results Forty-seven patients were included in the study. Median age was 54 (inter-quartile range 35-67) years and 22 (47 %) were male. Thirty-nine patients (83 %) reported an underlying cause of immune deficiency. The three main causes of immune deficiency were malignancy (12, 31 %) solid organ transplantation (10, 26 %) and HIV infection (8, 21 %) . Long-term exposure to steroids was reported in 19 (49 %) patients. Patients were admitted to the ICU 2 (1-6) days after the onset of the first neurological symptoms. Altered mental status at ICU admission was constant. The other symptoms were focal neurological signs (17, 36 %), seizure (13, 34 %) and status epilepticus (9, 19 %) . Thirty-three (70 %) patients had a rash. The median coma Glasgow score (CGS) at ICU admission was 12 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) ; 12 (27 %) patients had a CGS \u2264 8. Two-third of the patients had fever. The median white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 59 (16-116)/mm3 with 73 (67-84) % of lymphocytes and 21 (8-67) % of neutrophils. Median CSF protein level was 1.4 (0.7-3.8) g/L, and median CSF glucose level was 3.7 (2.5-5.0) mmol/L. CSF PCR for VZV was tested in 37 (79 %) patients and positive in 89 % of the cases. Thirty-two (68 %) patients had a central nervous system imaging, 27 (57 %) a computed tomography (CT) and 21 a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Twenty (74 %) CTs were reported as normal. Main abnormal findings reported with CT were cerebral edema (2, 7.4 %) and petechial hemorrhages (2, 7.4 %) . When performed, most MRI reported abnormal findings (16, 76 %), including brainstem lesions (5, 29 %), arteritis and ischemic infarctions (4, 20 %) and demyelinating lesions (4, 20 %). The median SOFA score at day 1 was 7 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Patients were treated intravenously with 10 (10-15) mg/kg/8 h of acyclovir during a median of 14 (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) days. In addition, three (6 %) patients received intravenous globulins. During ICU stay, 41 (87 %) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, 20 (43 %) received vasopressors, and RRT was implemented in 14 (30 %) patients. The median ICU length of stay was 16 (6-39) days. Thirty-six (77 %) patients were alive at ICU discharge. By univariate analysis, two factors were associated with an increased likelihood of ICU mortality: a SOFA score \u22657 at day 1, odds ratio (OR) 28. 8 Introduction In immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), invasive mechanical ventilation remains associated with high mortality. Choosing the adequate device for oxygenation is of the utmost importance in that setting. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been associated with decreased mortality in ARF. In this study, we assess outcomes of immunocompromised patients treated with HFNC.",

However, the benefits of noninvasive ventilation in immunocompetent patients with acute respiratory failure are debated. High-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula may offer an alternative in hypoxemic patients. We recently found in a randomized controlled trial including 310 patients with acute respiratory failure (FLORALI study) that as compared to noninvasive ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy decreased mortality. Immunocompromised patients could also be included in this study, except for those with profound neutropenia. Therefore, we assessed the benefits of high-flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation in this subgroup of patients. Our objective was to compare intubation and mortality rates in the subset of immunocompromised patients admitted to ICU for acute respiratory failure.",

            "text": "Introduction Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PjP) occurs increasingly in non-AIDS immunocompromised patients, chiefly those with HMs. Delayed implementation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is associated with increased mortality. A clinical score to early assess at the bedside the clinical pretest probability of PjP before proceeding with diagnostic testing would allow avoiding missed diagnosis and delayed treatment. Patients and methods Last year, we presented at REANIMATION 2015 the PASTEIL score (see Table 5 ) that was developed in 1092 HM patients with ARF (134 [12. 3 %] with proven PjP) admitted to eight ICUs between 2006 and 2012 (\"learning set\"). First, variables were identified through a multivariable logistic regression model after multiple imputation of missing confounders, and then, the score described below was derived from mean of beta regression coefficients and validated by bootstrap (resampling). Discrimination (i.e., ability of the score can separate PjP from non-PjP patients) was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC, c statistic). Calibration (i.e., how well predicted probabilities agree with actual observed risk) was measured by the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic (goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves) that compares the average predicted risk within subgroups to the proportion that actually develops disease. The score was performing very well in the learning set, with a very good discrimination (AUC was 0.87 saying that predicted values for cases are all higher than for non-cases) and a very good calibration (mean goodness of fit of \u22120.75 and calibration curves suggesting applicability of the models to individual cases in this learning set). Here, we sought to further validate this score in a prospective and independent reliability cohort. We first imputed the missing data using mice (multiple imputation algorithm), based on 30 multiple imputed datasets. On each complete imputed dataset, the score was computed for each patient and averaged; lastly, for each patient, the predicted probability of PjP was derived from the average score and its performance assessed. Results To validate the diagnostic score, we collected data from an independent dataset of 238 patients with HMS admitted to 26 ICUs for ARF (iVNIctus trial), including 15 (6.3 %) patients with PjP. When compared to patients with other ARF etiologies, PjP patients were younger (33 aged <50 vs. 20 %, P = 0.02), had more frequently a lymphoproliferative disorder (93.3 vs. 45.7 %, P = 0.0003), never received prophylaxis (vs. 36 % in other ARF etiologies, P < 0.0001) and had more frequently an interstitial pattern on chest imaging (67 vs. 32 %). The three other components of the score, namely time since respiratory symptoms onset, shock at admission and pleural involvement, were not significantly different between PjP patients and those with other ARF etiologies. In this reliability cohort, the score has a very good discrimination [AUC was 0.83 (95 % CI 0.73-0.93, DeLong estimates)]. However, the calibration was suboptimal with predicted probabilities of PjP above the observed proportions of actual PjP in the low deciles of the score. Introduction Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been proposed as a possible therapeutic option for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who have refractory hypoxemia or excessively high inspiratory airway pressures as well as being unable to tolerate volume and pressure limited strategy. This device also permits \"ultraprotective\" mechanical ventilation with further reduction in volume and pressure that might ultimately enhance lung protection and improve clinical outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. In addition, high level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during the first day on ECMO may be associated with better outcome. On the other hand, inappropriate high PEEP level may also lead to overdistension, hyperinflation and definitive lung damage. Because of these considerations, continuous monitoring of harmful effects of PEEP appears relevant. Considering the high severity of these patients, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) could allow an individual, noninvasive, real-time, bedside, radiation-free imaging of the lungs, with global and regional dynamic analysis. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the ability of EIT to monitor a PEEP trial in patients with severe ARDS on ECMO and ventilated with very low tidal volume and (2) to evaluate the benefits of EIT to provide tools to individualize and match PEEP with the regional distribution of ARDS lesions.",

Analysis was conducted after a median time of mechanical ventilation of 8 (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) days and 4 (2-6) days of ECMO. Compared with PEEP 20, decremental PEEP trial led to a decrease in EELI of 14, 37, 60 and 96 % at PEEP 15, 10, 5 and 0, respectively. Regional analyses of EELI and \u0394z illustrated that \"ultraprotective\" ventilation of the most dorsal region of the lungs did not participate in ventilation regardless the level of PEEP. However, midventral and mid-dorsal regional ventilations were more dependent on PEEP. Meanwhile, pulmonary compliance was 13.4, 18.7, 18.6, 18.7 and 12.1 mL/cmH 2 O at the five decreasing PEEP levels, respectively, resulting to median tidal volumes ranging from 2.8 to 4 ml/kg. Median overdistension decreased from 37 to 0 % and collapsed area of the lung increased from 0 to 50 % while decreasing PEEP level. Based on the best compromise between low overdistension and low collapse, EIT provided \"best PEEP level\" for each patient on ECMO. These results were variable, and depending on patients, optimal PEEP was between 5 and 15 cmH2O (see Fig. 12 ). Conclusion Our study is the first using EIT on severe ARDS with ECMO.",

This level was very variable from patient to patient, illustrating the need to individualize mechanical ventilation settings based on monitoring the effects of PEEP. Conclusion A liberal oxygenation strategy does not induce higher systemic inflammation neither other complication in comparison with a conservative oxygenation strategy in ICU patients. However, despite nonsignificant, sRAGE, a marker of epithelial pulmonary injury, has tendency to stay at high level at day 6, there is tendency to have more ARDS, and SOFA score at day 6 has tendency to be higher in patients exposed to liberal oxygenation strategy in comparison with conservative oxygenation strategy.

In that way, \"Septiflux 1, \" a single-center trial (Guerin et al., Crit Care Med, 2014) on \"selected septic patients, \" demonstrated that immature granulocyte CD10dim/CD16dim level at acute phase of sepsis can predict early clinical deterioration.

Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, progressive neoplastic disease, HIV, history of hematological or inflammatory disease, immunosuppressive treatment and hospitalization in ICU for more than 48 h. Within 8 h after admission, flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate immature granulocytes CD10dim/CD16dim but also T-lymphocytes CD3pos, expression of CD24, CD64 and CD11b on granulocytes, and pro-inflammatory monocytes CD16pos. As regards their organ failure, all patients were classified as sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock using the international sepsis classification. Sepsis deterioration was evaluated 48 h after inclusion and was defined as followed: sepsis developing to severe sepsis or septic shock; severe sepsis developing to septic shock. Death occurring before 48 h was also considered as clinical deterioration. Patients were followed until D-28. SOFA score was also calculated at inclusion and after 48 h. Results From November 2013 to June 2015, at 11 university sites, 1062 patients were included in this trial. Recruitment has now ended and 780 patients have been kept for final analysis, the remaining being secondary excluded mainly because sepsis was not confirmed by the adjudication committee. At inclusion, 523 (67 %) were hospitalized in the ICU and 257 were from the ED. All the sites have performed the related flow cytometry according to a standardized protocol. The database cleaning process and locking should be done in the coming weeks followed by the statistical analysis. Results will be available in the coming 2 months. Conclusion Septiflux 2 is the larger multicenter trial that has evaluated the prognostic value of immature granulocytes and the overall interest of flow cytometry at the acute phase of sepsis. Introduction Early and appropriate antibiotic therapy is a prognostic factor in patients presenting with severe sepsis and septic shock. Incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB), especially Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), continuously increases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful technique that enables sequencing the complete genome of bacteria, thus giving access to their precise identification and potential antibiotic resistance genes. However, this technique is currently too cumbersome and expensive to be implemented in routine practice. Accordingly, the feasibility of NGS has been scarcely assessed on biological samples obtained from patients with sepsis. This study aimed at evaluating the feasibility and the diagnostic capacity of NGS in patients with urosepsis using the detection of bacterial microbiome and resistome from urine samples. Results were compared with those of conventional microbiology.",

Results For the microbiome (Table 6) , NGS showed a total concordance for the detection of bacterial species (mainly Escherichia coli), in samples with single isolated bacteria. NGS enabled the identification of bacteria potentially responsible for urosepsis in three out of four urine samples with negative conventional culture. For the resistome, NGS enabled the identification of all genes explaining the acquired resistance phenotypes (n = 18) and especially all ctx-m genes which give MRB phenotype to bacteria (ESBL, n = 11).

Introduction In stress situation, inflammation causes several metabolic modifications. To give energetic substrate to vital tissues, an activation of proteolysis, lipolysis and hepatic gluconeogenesis occurs and, at cell level, the main energy source comes from anaerobic reactions. The metabolomic analysis is an approach that enables to study many products from metabolic pathways [1] . We aimed to study metabolic profile of patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) to identify potential biomarkers of patients' outcome. Patients and methods This is a prospective study in a medico-surgical ICU. We included adult patients admitted in ICU for <24 h and healthy volunteers. At admission, the sera of the patients were analysed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. We first compared patients and volunteers by multivariate analysis. The patients were divided into four groups based on their diseases: sepsis, septic shock, shocks from other origins than sepsis and other pathologies. We realized a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn correction to analyse the metabolites between the different groups. After identification of relevant metabolites, we search correlations between these and the mortality and the length of stay.",

Mean age was 67 \u00b1 14, mean SOFA score was 5 \u00b1 3, and mean APACHE II score was 20 \u00b1 9. The 90-day mortality was 30 %. We first identified a significant difference in metabolic profile between volunteers and ICU patients (CV-ANOVA, p < 0.001). When septic shock patients were compared with non-septic patients, some significant differences in the metabolome were observed (p < 0.05): pyruvate, lactate, carnitine, creatine, myo-inositol, creatinine, urea, phenylalanine and mannitol. Despite all these changes, there was no correlation between metabolomic profile and patients prognosis. Discussion These metabolic differences indicate a profound change in energetic metabolism in septic shock patients. The high ratio lactate/ pyruvate indicates a trend towards anaerobic glycolysis. The lactate increasing comes from hypoxic area and can serve for hepatic gluconeogenesis via Cori cycle. The increase of carnitine reflects the free fatty acids oxidation to be used as energy source. A reflect of proteolysis is observed by the rise of phenylalanine. The amino acids are used in the Krebs cycle or are degraded in urea, which is also increased in our study. We also observed a rise of creatine-energetic substrate of muscles-and its degradation product, creatinine. The myo-inositol increase reflects an activation of intra-cellular messages. Finally, the mannitol, which does not come from human metabolism, could perhaps reflect bacterial translocation. Conclusion Metabolomic approach is a new interesting way to characterize metabolic changes in ICU patients at their admission. In the group of septic shock, we observed an increase in anaerobic glycolysis, proteolysis, lipolysis and gluconeogenesis. Nevertheless, the differences are not correlated with prognosis.",

Early death (<7 days) and late death (>7 days) must be then distinguished. The immune deficiency concerned both innate and adaptive system and represents a potential indication for immunostimulation therapy (IFN-\u03b3, IL-7, PD-1 antagonists, etc.). Finding immune parameters to be used as a monitoring of inflammatory status becomes a major goal for research. Lymphocyte as a source of mediators for innate immunity has a phenotype in severe septic patients that is not well characterized. The objective was to describe and compare lymphocyte phenotypes to healthy volunteers, measured early (<7 days) in the course of severe sepsis with or without shock, and to study the relationship of this phenotype with prognosis. (Table 7) . Lymphocyte phenotype was not related to the severity scores (IGS2 SOFA). Lymphocyte phenotype was not related to early (<day 7) and late death (day 28). Conclusion T lymphopenia (whatever the sepsis severity) is associated with a decreased monocytic HLA-DR expression suggesting a synergistic change in both innate and adaptive immunity. This phenomenon can be physiologic, but could be a marker of immunosuppression associated to secondary infections.

Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, end-stage renal disease and RRT initiation before ICU admission. Reference creatinine was retrieved from blood samples at steady state during the year preceding admission. AKI was defined and classified according to the KDIGO criteria (both diuresis and serum creatinine). Early group was defined as an initiation of RRT within 12H after admission or AKI stages 0-1 at initiation. Delayed group was defined as an initiation of RRT >12H after admission and AKI stages 2-3 at initiation. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 312 patients were treated by RRT during the study period. Two hundred and four patients suffered from severe sepsis or septic shock, and 169 patients were included in the study. In the early group (n = 79), SOFA score (12 vs 10, P = 0.01) and serum creatinine level (174 \u00b5mol/L [123-283] vs 154 \u00b5mol/L [102-229], P = 0.003) were higher at ICU admission. One hundred and fifty-eight (93 %) patients were receiving norepinephrine and mechanical ventilation when EER was initiated. The KDIGO score at RRT initiation was higher in the delayed group (3 vs 2; P < 0.0001) on both creatinine and diuresis criteria. The crude hospital mortality was 58 % in the early group versus 54 % in the delayed group (P = 0.6). A Cox regression model showed a better probability of survival adjusted to the SOFA score at ICU admission in the early group (P = 0.003, Fig. 15 ). Risk factors for mortality analyzed by logistic regression were the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and lactate level at initiation of RRT. Survivors had a similar renal recovery in both groups, but the hospital length of stay was longer in the delayed group (51 vs 34 days, P = 0.05).

We used the NURSE acronym, the Ask-Tell-Ask concept and the VALUE strategy depending on the type of conferences. The primary outcome was the score on the Impact of Events Scale-revised (IES-R) (for posttraumatic stress-related symptoms) completed by the family member 3 months after the death or discharge of the patient. Secondary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression in family members 3 months after patient death or ICU discharge. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of perceptions by family members of nurse participation in the family conferences at ICU discharge using interview guides. Each interview was transcribed verbatim and evaluated using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Competing interests None.",

Conversely, when compared to lung cancer, other types of tumours were found to be protective from poor outcome with odds ratio ranging from 0.25 to 0.52 (P < 0.05 for each). A prediction model (Oncoscore) was then built ranging from 0 to 11. In the studied population, Oncoscore was 6 (3-7). The overall model area under ROC curve in predicting day-120 outcome was fair (0.74; 95 % CI 0.71-0.77). A score of 4 was found to be sensitive of poor outcome (sensitivity 0.84), while a score of 8 was specific (specificity 0.92). According to these cut-offs, day-120 mortality was of 40 % (n = 111), 70 % (n = 363) and 87 % (n = 216) with Oncoscore <4, of 4-7 and >7, respectively. Cumulative survival is reported in Fig. 17 . Conclusion Critically ill patients with solid cancer have a meaningful day-120 survival. Conversely to critically ill patients with haematological malignancy underlying malignancy and extension of the disease seems to be independently associated with day-120 mortality. The Oncoscore developed in this study, although performing fairly in the studied population remains to be validated in an external population of solid cancer patients requiring ICU admission. There was no delayed graft function. One liver was explanted and grafted with success. During the same period, our team accomplished 17 donation after brain death and six uncontrolled DCD (Maastricht II). Conclusion The understanding of the cDCD protocol by relatives was good. The discussion of donation options was frequently initiated by family request for information. There was no procedure failure due to delayed cardiac arrest or prolonged hypoperfusion period. These results could be explicated by our procedures for WLST with titrated sedation, analgesia and comfort care. Our policies and procedures for WLST are the same for both donation and non-donation cases. Our team met technical difficulties for percutaneous RNR. This percutaneous approach needs to be evaluated in the future. cDCD represents 18 % of our recovery activity for transplantation. After an intense preparation phase, essential to the proper understanding of the protocol, the establishment of a cDCD activity in our center led to six kidney and one liver transplants. On this short cohort, we had no grafts dysfunction. These data showed promising results concerning cDCD program but need further evaluation (Fig. 18 ).",

Discussion When excluding the seven deaths influenced by pre-transplant acute respiratory failure, the overall remote mortality is decaying to 25 %, which is close to post-transplant survival rates observed nationwide in liver transplantation for stable chronic liver disease. Moreover, in our cohort, long-term morbidity for survivors was low if compared to data from the literature. Conclusion Our data suggest that liver transplantation can be safe and successful despite critical care criteria and poor underlying conditions (i.e., a context of circulatory failure requiring infusion of high doses of norepinephrine, septicemia or renal replacement therapy). They also suggest that liver transplantation should cautiously be advised in the presence of preoperative acute lung injury criteria. In the latter case, liver transplantation should (at least) temporarily be discouraged.

The most common mechanism was the road traffic accident (78 % of cases). All transport was non-medicalized. So there was no intubation-ventilation at the site of trauma. The takeover delay was 78 min. The average age of patients was 43 \u00b1 16 years with extremes ranging from 19 to 83 years. The sex ratio was 4.3. The state of consciousness was evaluated by the GCS with an average of 5 \u00b1 2. Sixty-six percent of patients had a pupillary anomaly, 19 % had a neurological deficit, and 81 % had associated lesions. The most frequent CT lesions were subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral contusions. All patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation with an average duration of hospitalization of 9 \u00b1 2 days. The prognosis, assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), was correlated with several factors. The takeover delay (p < 0.02), the GCS (p < 0.01), the presence of pupillary anomaly (p < 0.01), the presence of associated lesions (p = 0.01), the ISS score (p < 0.01) and the CT scan score (p < 0.01) were considered as outcome indicators in univariate analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a correlation between the age, the takeover delay and the outcome of the patients. Correlation with secondary systemic insults was not established in our study. Multivariate analysis showed a correlation between the Glasgow coma scale and mortality. Conclusion The profile of TBI in ICU of Zaghouan is similar to data in recent literature.

In order to improve the outcome of TBI, we need to use multimodal monitoring.",

In multivariate analysis, a low coma scale and the onset of septic shock during the evolution were the only factors associated independently with increased ICU mortality among patients admitted for stroke. Discussion Withhold and withdrawal treatment decisions in severe stroke are related mainly to neurological status and advanced age (1) . The absence of reversible complications and a deep coma (GCS <9) shall qualify the usefulness of the resuscitation (2) . Also, the use of mechanical ventilation is associated with high mortality (3) . In this study, advanced age and mechanical ventilation were not associated with a significant mortality. For against a Glasgow score of <6 is associated with 100 % mortality. This could be a major criterion in therapeutic decisions limiting serious stroke and help Tunisian health authorities to improve the standards established in the management of severe stroke. Conclusion The severity of the stroke at admission is related to the depth of the coma which depends on withhold and withdrawal treatment decisions. However, prognosis mainly relies on the improvement in the quality of stroke management and the prevention of its complications.",

There is a linear relationship between the ICP and the pulsatility index since the correlation coefficient was 0.43 and p = 0.019965 and between the CFC and the pulsatility index since the correlation coefficient: r 2 = 0.60 and p = 0.000613. The literature is contradictory on this issue. Discussion A study was conducted in 1994 by Boishardy and collaborators in France, out of a total of ten serious head trauma whose age was between 17 and 37 years and that benefited dice admission and then twice a day, of a simultaneous measurement SV, DV, PI and ICP by means of an intraparenchymal catheter to show a significant correlation between mean ICP and PI r = 0.837 and between the PI and CPP (r = 0.563; p < 0.001) [1] . By against the US study conducted by Thomas in California on a group of 99 severe TBI patients showed that the correlation between ICP and PI was classified as moderate to zero [2] . Conclusion All severe TBI monitoring means have their place, with superior non-invasive tests on simple clinical surveillance, and indicate the need for the installation of the monitoring of the ICP in due time, since many patients can develop at any time during their stay an ICHT. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The most frequent indication was ultra-protective ventilation for ADRS (54 %). Other indications were: failure of non-invasive ventilation during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (30 %), weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients (12 %) and miscellaneous (4 %). Among ICUs using ECCO 2 R, 22 (63 %) reported at least one complication. The most frequent complications were bleeding (45 %) and membrane failure (18 %). Satisfaction rates were: in terms of decarboxylation 7.9 \u00b1 2.4; tolerance 6.9 \u00b1 2.6; and overall satisfaction 6.8 \u00b1 2.2. Twenty-one (63 %) of the 35 ICUs using ECCO 2 R also used ECMO. The main reasons for not using ECCO 2 R were the lack of trained staff, unavailability of the device and the lack of scientific evidence (for, respectively, 53, 39 and 17 % of responders). Among 204 ICUs not using ECCO 2 R, 20 (10 %) had the project to start ECCO 2 R in the coming months.",

The microparticles (MPs) are proinflammatory and procoagulant nanovesicles derived from circulating cells, and their circulating levels may be elevated in many pathologies associated with inflammatory, thrombotic and infectious disorders. The main objective of our study is to quantify the presence and to characterize the cellular origin of MPs in patients treated by vvECMO for severe ARDS.

Leukocyte-derived (p = 0.01) and endothelial-derived (p = 0.001) MPs were higher in patients who needed a circuit change. Discussion There are subpopulations of MPs associated with the prognosis of patients with severe ARDS treated with veno-venous ECMO. Conclusion This pilot study suggests a potential role of these biomarkers as diagnostic or prognostic factor in the occurrence of complications related to the technique. Results During this period, ten of the 348 patients admitted to our ICU have received ECCO2R therapy. We included five patients with ARDS (we laid the device because tidal volume (V t ) was 6 ml/kg PBW with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio between 80 and 150, after at least one prone position session, and with a plateau pressure between 25 and 30 cm of water and high level of PaCO 2 ). We included three COPD patients in failure of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in a hypercapnic coma, one asthmatic patient in severe respiratory acidosis under invasive ventilation (IV) and one severe COPD patient unweaning of the IV. Patients with ARDS normalized arterial pH, and we decreased V t (3-4 ml/kg) and respiratory rate. Three of them are alive at J28 and had received 5, 7 and 14 days of ECCO 2 R, and two of them died under ECCO2R after 16 and 9 days of ECCO 2 R. The reason of the death was nosocomial lung infection. None of the COPD patients with hypercapnic coma were intubated, and they received 5, 3 and 6 days of ECCO 2 R and were alive at J28. The asthmatic patient received 7 days of ECCO 2 R, was extubated under ECCO 2 R and was alive at J28. The unweaning COPD patient was extubated two times and reintubated two times due to severe neuropathy and tracheal inhalation. He was tracheotomized and weaned from the ECCO 2 R after 19 days, and he was alive at J28, but died at J76. There was no bleeding leading by catheter but one hemothorax requiring a blood transfusion during an overdose of heparin Conclusion The ECCO 2 R in a general ICU could have multiple indications in COPD and ARDS patients. These indications remain to be validated, but ECCO 2 R could improve the management of those patients. The implementation of ECCO 2 R is possible but requires a great investment, a training of the medical and the paramedical team and a written detailed procedure. Nevertheless, the installation of the device for each patient must for now be discussed in a team taking into account the risk-benefit ratio of each procedure.",

Our goal was to use HFOV not as a surrogate to CMV but as a recruitment process during only 6 h a day alternating with the CMV and to test whether this new sequential HFOV use could increase the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and the respiratory system compliance (used as recruitment markers) and thus improve the oxygenation. Patients and methods Interventional prospective study, in singlecenter ICU, was performed in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <150 after a 6-h period of optimized CMV for maximal alveolar recruitment). Patients were placed under HFO sequentially (6 h a day) up to 4 days in a row, as long as PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was <200. The primary endpoint was the before/after HFO session EELV difference measured by the nitrogen wash-in/wash-out technique. Secondary endpoints were the before/after HFO session PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and respiratory system compliance differences. Results Twenty-two patients (mean IGS 55 \u00b1 14) were enrolled between November 2012 and May 2015 for a total of 29 sessions. Three of these (10 %) were stopped (two for hemodynamic failure and one for respiratory failure). After the 6-h HFOV session, the EELV increased significantly by more than 30 %, while the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and the respiratory system compliance increased significantly by more than 90 % and more than 20 %, respectively. By considering as responder to the HFOV session a patient with an EELV increase of more than 15 % after the HFOV, we obtained 19 responders (66 %) for 10 non-responders. By considering as responder to the HFOV session a patient with an EELV increase of more than 15 % and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio increase of more than 30 % after the HFOV, we obtained 16 responders (55 %) for 13 nonresponders. No significant change in hemodynamic parameters was found, except the significant 10 \u00b1 6 % cardiac index decrease after 1 h of HFOV for the 15 sessions monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution.

All consecutive patients present between May 1 and October 31, 2013, and between May 1, and October 31, 2014, were enrolled. The prescription help-guide was displayed in each patient room from May 2, 2014. Physicians were encouraged to rely on this help-guide for laboratory tests prescription, once patients stabilized. The primary outcome measure was the variation of routine laboratory tests per patient ICU day, before compared with after guidelines. Secondary outcomes were the number of ICU days, the mortality, the variation of blood transfusion, the variation of nosocomial infections potentially related to blood samplings and the economic impact after guidelines implementation. We also assessed the variation of laboratory tests per patient ICU day, during the same periods, in the medical ICU of the university hospital, without any guidelines. Results A total of 274 patients were admitted, staying for 3167 ICU days during Period-1, and 342 patients were admitted, for 2799 ICU days during Period-2. The patients' general characteristics were similar, except for the ICU days significantly shorter for Period-2. A 27.21 % relative reduction in routine laboratory tests per patient ICU day was observed after guidelines implementation. A 27.45 % relative reduction in blood transfusion was also observed, without difference neither on mortality in ICU, nor on nosocomial infections potentially related to blood samplings. The mean decrease per laboratory test was significantly more important in the surgical ICU than in the medical ICU (27.21 vs. 15.13 %, p = 0.00837).

Cartographic representation shows that none of the mean residual criticalities of those previous steps has reached the threshold of unbearable residual criticality. Hygiene/isolation has the worst mean residual criticality (18). Inside every steps but one (blood purification) of the process, some individual risks reached the threshold of unbearable residual criticality, requiring correcting measures. Many actions, including additional lecture of previous procedures, creation of new procedures, creation of healthcare pathways, and training courses for nurses and physicians, were recorded in the 2015 action plan.

It has shown that many point of our practice can be improved rapidly, without waiting for the undesirable event to occur, avoiding potential iatrogenic complications for patients. Furthermore, it is a complete match with the current French trend, commanded by our healthcare authorities, of healthcare management through security culture and risk management. However, the results of this cartography cannot be applied directly to any ICU: The identified risks are specific only to the ICU where has taken place the study.

Frequently family members go on home and make internet searches concerning the terms they have heard. Concordance between information obtained on the internet, medical publications and social media channels have rarely been studied. Materials and methods We used the Google Trend application to retrieve search volumes about the aforementioned diagnosis and complications. We compared search volumes on Google to the number of publications on PubMed from 2004 to 2015. In addition to that, a search through Ritetag (a site for trends in tweets) was conducted. Results 'Cardiac arrest' and 'septic shock' searches on Google had a constant distribution over the years. Meanwhile, searches conducted for 'artificial ventilation' , 'acute respiratory distress syndrome' and 'tracheal intubation' had a burst starting in 2008. Occurrences in PubMed followed a similar distribution with the exception of 'cardiac arrest' that showed two downfalls in 2008 and in 2010. The trends over the time period were, however, different between Google and PubMed. For Tweeter, we have found a median of four tweets per hour for the term 'cardiac arrest' , whereas for the other terms it was difficult to retrieve any viable information (Fig. 24) . Conclusion This preliminary study suggests that searches for medical terms related to intensive care unit show similar results in Google and PubMed. This could suggest that intensivists and family members tend to have access to similar information. Meanwhile, the social media channels have yet to catch up in this domain.",

All caregivers who gave their approval to participate were enrolled in the study. Each caregiver answered to a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics (age, sex, marital status) and the work conditions (intensive care unit conditions, number of hours of work per day, the number of on-call duty hours at the hospital). The Malasch Burn Inventory score was used to assess the burnout syndrome in our sample. Results One hundred questionnaires were distributed in the departments of EMICU, surgery and pediatrics. Only 79 were collected, registered and then analyzed. The participation rate was about 79 %. We found that 58 % of all caregivers working in EMICU had a burnout syndrome and 26 % of them were seriously affected. Forty-two percent of the affected caregivers had a high level of emotional distress, 43 % had a high level of depersonalization, and 39 % had a low level of professional fulfillment. The mean average age of our sample was 33 years with a standard deviation of 9. We have a female predominance with a sex ratio of 0.46. Fifty-six percent of the caregivers enrolled in the study were married. From all the persons who answered to the questionnaire, 47 % chose their department of work. More than half of our population (72 %) works in the hospital from < 10 years. The average number of hours of work per week was 41 h. Twenty-seven percent of all caregivers had to work at least two on-call duties per week. Analytical study showed that among the socio-demographic characteristics, the female sex was significantly associated with the lowest score of professional fulfillment (p = 0.03). Seventy-two percent of caregivers affected by burnout were male with 40 % who were seriously affected. Sixty-one percent of our affected population was married with a severe score in 22.7 % of cases. General surgery department had the highest level of emotional distress and depersonalization (73 and 64 %) followed by our EMICU department (56 and 60 %), while the level of professional fulfillment was the lowest in pediatric department (14.3 %) followed by our EMICU department (23.5 %). Conclusion As expected, the prevalence of burnout syndrome is particularly high in our Tunisian emergency and intensive care unit. We found also that it was correlated with socio-demographic characteristics. Our department had one of the highest levels of burnout syndrome in the hospital. We are trying to identify the causes of this high level. Preventive and interventive measures against burnout syndrome should be started. This work is the first step of a multicenter Tunisian study. Introduction Increase in resistance of endotracheal tube (RETT) during mechanical ventilation in ICU should reflect reduction in internal diameter due to accumulation of secretions. The aim of this study was to measure RETT after extubation in ICU patients. Our hypothesis was that RETT increased with the length of use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients and methods The study was performed over patients intubated for at least 1 day in our ICU. Once the patient was extubated, the tube was immediately stored in a plastic bag at room temperature and kept in a safe place until bench assessment. This was performed maximal 24 h after extubation as follows. The endotracheal tube was attached to a filter (Hygrobac), and both were set to ASL 5000 active servo lung (IngMar Medical). The lung model was set in passive condition in order to deliver two consecutive breaths at constant flow from 2 to \u22122 L/s. The filter was tested first, and then, the filter and the endotracheal tube were run. The relationship of pressure (P) to flow was fitted to the following equation P = K1 flow + K2 flow2, where K1 and K2 are constants. P pertaining to endotracheal tube was obtained by subtracting P from filter to P from filter and endotracheal tube. Dividing P by flow led to RETT = K1 + K2 flow. RETT at 1 L/s (cm H 2 O) was equal to K1 + K2. The relationships of K1, K2 or RETT to length of intubation was analysed by linear mixed model where tube brand and size were factors with random effects. Results We included 52 patients (34 male) of median (first-third quartiles) age 68 (61-78) years. The median duration of intubation was 5.5 (2-9) days (min 1-max 19 days). Endotracheal tubes were from Mallinckrodt (n = 45), TaperGuard (n = 4) or Rush (n = 3) brands and internal diameter 7.0 (n = 10), 7.5 (n = 39), 8.0 (n = 3) mm. The relationships of K1, K2 or RETT to length of intubation were not significant taking into account both brand and size of endotracheal tubes (Fig. 25) . Conclusion Increase in resistance of endotracheal tube used in the ICU is not related to the length of tracheal intubation.",

This rise in airway resistance is associated with the presence of the endotracheal tube, a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) and/or any another tubing in the breathing circuit. During assisted ventilation or in spontaneously breathing patient, these high resistances will increase the work of breathing and negatively impact the chance of weaning. To limit this elevation in resistance, the endotracheal tube is sometime shortened and a heated humidifier used instead of a HME. The aim of this study was to evaluate the actual effect of these strategies on the airway resistance. Materials and methods A two-compartment model of adult lung (DTL: TTL 1600 Dual Test Lung, Michigan Instrument) was connected to a Drag\u00ebr Evita 4 \u00ae Ventilator. The ventilator was set in volume-controlled mode (V t : 0.5 L; respiratory frequency: 20 bpm; inspiratory flow: 70 L/min). To simulate normal and obstructive clinical conditions, two different resistances were placed at the entry of the airline connected to DTL by using Pneuflo \u00ae (parabolic resistor, Michigan Instrument; mean \u00b1 SD: 2.5 \u00b1 0.06 and 17.04 \u00b1 0.03 cmH 2 O/L s \u22121 ). Compliance of the artificial lung was set to 70 ml/cmH 2 O. The airline was compounded of an endotracheal tube and a humidification system. Three different inside diameters (ID) (Portex \u00ae endotracheal tube of 7, 8 and 9 mm) and two humidification systems (HME (Gibbeck Humid Vent \u00ae Adult) or Fisher and Paykel MR850 Heated Humidifier \u00ae ) were evaluated before and after shortening of the tube at 10 cm length. The change in pressure was measured by an analog Statistical test (Student's test) was performed. Values are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation.",

However, endobronchial injection of important volumes of saline serum may cause hypoxemia. This risk is particularly important to consider in ICU patients. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value and to identify incidents attributable to BAL in intensive care unit. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study conducted from January 2011 to December 2014 at the respiratory ICU of the Abderrahmen Mami Hospital in Ariana (Tunisia). Were included all patients who underwent BAL in intensive care unit. We recorded demographic, On chest X ray, alveolar and/or interstitial damage was found in 93 patients; 78 were bilateral. BAL was performed under invasive ventilation in 20 patients, under NIV in 20, on oxygen in 54 and for six patients in ambient air. BAL was contributory to diagnosis in 77 patients: 28 cases of intra-alveolar hemorrhage, 26 cases of bacterial pneumonia (ten communityacquired pneumonia and 16 nosocomial), eight cases of pulmonary pneumocystosis, six cases of active pulmonary tuberculosis, six cases of malignant pulmonary infiltrate, two cases of eosinophilic pneumonia and one case of histiocytosis X. The major occurring incident was severe hypoxemia in four patients among which three had required endotracheal intubation. In the 96 remaining patients, BAL was safe and harmless. Conclusion In ICU, BAL is a good and safe tool; it contributes to diagnosis in 77 % of cases. However, the risk of worsening breathing after BAL should be evaluated, especially in critically ill patients.",

The main evaluation criterion was the incidence of intubation after FOB within 48 h. Secondary criteria were ICU mortality, predictive factors for intubation and ICU mortality, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic yield of FOB. Results Ninety-two patients were included. In the FOB-NIV, 14 of 39 patients were intubated (36 %) versus 8 of 53 patients in the FOB-O2 group (17 %) (HR 2.58; p = 0.03). Mortality in the FOB-NIV group was 46 versus 12 % in the FOB-O 2 group (HR 1.66; p = 0.29). Patients in the FOB-NIV group were older (64 vs 60, p = 0.028), more severe (SAPS2, SOFA, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio) on admission or the day of FOB. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors for intubation were higher heart rate (HR per heart beat: 1.03, p = 0.02), SpO2 <95 % (HR 5.07; p = 0.001) and SAPS2 score the day of FOB (HR per unit: 1.06; p < 0.0001). The type of ventilatory support during FOB was not found as an independent predictive factor for intubation (p > 0.05). Conclusion Performing FOB under NIV in hypoxemic ARF patients seems to be associated with an increased risk of intubation as compared to FOB with O 2 , but without increase in their ICU mortality. As the ventilatory support used during the FOB does not appear as a predictive factor for intubation within the 48 h after the FOB, this risk appears closely related to the underlying severity of patients. Finally, the choice to perform FOB under NIV by the clinician appears to be guided by this severity.",

            "text": "Introduction Bronchoscopy can be particularly challenging in patients with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) who required lungprotective ventilation strategies. In a previous study, we showed that a bronchoscope with an external diameter of 4 mm (or less) would allow safer bronchoscopic interventions. Diameter reduction cannot be at the expense of the suction channel which needs to be sufficient to easily removed thick secretion. From the single-use bronchoscope technology, we proposed an innovation of flexible bronchoscope with a variable outer diameter as follows: a proximal 4 mm diameter for the part inserted in the endotracheal tube, distal head camera with classical diameter (5.3 mm), and 2 mm diameter for the suction channel. The aim of our study was to demonstrate that our prototype of flexible bronchoscope: (1) does not disrupt the protective ventilation, while it is in place in the endotracheal tube (ETT); and (2) enables an efficient suctioning capacity. Materials and methods In vitro We simulated ARDS lungs mechanically ventilated according to actual guidelines. We used four models of flexible bronchoscope (FB): reusable adult, single-use adult, reusable paediatric, and prototype. All combinations between FB and ETTs (7.0-8.0 mm of internal diameters) were evaluated in pressure-controlled ventilation mode (inspiratory pressure of 22 cmH 2 O for a target tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate at 27/min, PEEP at 10 cmH 2 O, inspiratory flow at 60 L/min, compliance at 35 mL/cmH 2 O, inspiratory/ expiratory 1:2). We measured the percentage of minute ventilation (MV) delivered compared with baseline and the increase in total positive end-expiratory pressure (\u0394totalPEEP). To test the capacity of the suction channel, we measured the suction flow (water and viscous fluid) with two vacuum levels. In vivo We described and compared the consequences of bronchoscopy during protective ventilation on two ventilated pigs with a single-use FB and our prototype of FB. Results In vitro Inserting adult FB in ETTs severely altered ventilation: 19-61 % of the baseline MV was delivered (7.0-8.0 ETTs). On the contrary, the modifications on the ventilation were reduced with the prototype FB (72-87 % of the baseline MV). When the inspiratory pressure was set to guaranty the targeted tidal volume, the \u0394totalPEEP was +13 and +11 cmH 2 O, respectively, for the reusable and for the single-use adult FB (ETT 7.0), whereas totalPEEP was unmodified for the prototype (as for the paediatric FB). At \u2212150 mmHg vacuum level, prototype FB suction flow was identical (247 ml \u00b1 12 mL/min for water and 176 mL \u00b1 4 mL/min for viscous fluid) to the adult FB and was clearly superior to the suction flow provided by paediatric FB (147 \u00b1 10 mL/ min for water and 100 \u00b1 6 mL/min for viscous fluid). Similar observations were made for the 300 mmHg vacuum level. In vivo When the adult FB was inserted in the 7.0 ETT of the ventilated pigs, it was not anymore possible to ventilate them with the initial settings (inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH 2 O, respiratory rate at 27/min, PEEP at 10 cmH 2 O). Indeed, the inspiratory pressure was increased up to 52 cmH 2 O to deliver the targeted tidal volume, leading to a total PEEP of 16 cmH 2 O. On the contrary, no significant difficulties were observed with the prototype of FB. Conclusion Our prototype of single-use FB did not disrupt the lungprotective ventilation strategies and had still efficient capacity of suction.",

Though its incidence and risk factors are well described in anesthesiology, few authors studied difficult airway management in ICU patients (1) . The aim of our study was to describe the incidence and risks factors for DI in our ICU. Patients and methods We conducted a monocentric, prospective observational study between January 2014 and May 2015. All patients admitted to our ICU and requiring intubation were included in the study. Exclusion criteria comprised age under 18 and refusal from the patients or their relatives to participate. An intubation procedure was defined as difficult whenever it required more than two laryngoscopic attempts by a senior intensivist or the use of a different technique (stylet, gum bougies, laryngeal masks, fiberoptic intubation, cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy). Patients' comorbidities, demographic data and classical risk factors for difficult intubation in anesthesiology, as well as the MACOCHA score, were collected on admission. For each intubation, modalities of the procedure were recorded. A multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for DI. Variables were selected after univariate analysis with a significant association (p < 0.20). Results During the study period, 263 intubation procedures were studied. Patients were mostly men (n = 173, 65.3 %), with a mean IGS II of 54 (52-56). The cause of ICU admission was medical for the great majority of them (n = 239, 90 %). A total of 33 (12.6 % [8.8-17.2]) procedures out of 263 turned out to be difficult. When the MACOCHA score was recorded (n = 153, 58 %), it was significantly higher in the DI group (median = 2 [1-7] vs 1 [1] [2] Discussion In our study, the incidence of DI was comparable to previous studies. Predictive independent factors for DI (Mallampati score higher than 2 and limited mouth opening) differed from those which recently led to the validation of the MACOCHA score in a medico-surgical ICU population 1. In our medical ICU population, the MACOCHA score often showed to be difficult to record. The Mallampati classification, which represents one of its fundamental items, was not hardly ever feasible in emergency in medical patients, nor was it predetermined by the anesthesiologist (as in scheduled surgery patients). Conclusion Two clinical items predictive of difficult intubation were identified in our study. The MACOCHA score seemed to be difficult to record in a medical ICU population, but confirmed to be a helpful score when available.",

On univariate analysis, the need for RI was associated with a prolonged ICU LOS (p = 0.003), an increased ICU mortality (p = 0.03) and a trend for an increased pulmonary infection (p = 0.08). Analysis of specific circumstances before ESE highlights a shorter time from the beginning of weaning (p = 0.03) and a higher pressure support level (p = 0.05) in case of CO. Discussion Most of ESE occurred during the weaning period and around some critical hours during the day, particularly during the work shifts in the morning and the evening, and at noon. Risk factors associated with a CO, like a shorter time from the beginning of weaning and a higher pressure support level, might reflect insufficient preparation for extubation. Conclusion ESE is a common and serious adverse event in the ICU, and the need for RI may potentially be associated with higher morbidity and mortality. A prevention policy of ESE is warranted to minimize ESE, particularly in patients at risk of CO.",

Evaluation is based on the search of weaning criteria allowing the start of a T-piece trial and the assessment of patient tolerance during spontaneous breathing. Nonetheless, reintubation occurs in 5-10 % of cases [1] , increases the duration of MV and ICU stay and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Failure to wean patients may result from respiratory failure (high respiratory workload, poor gas exchange) or extubation failure (inability to clear secretions, laryngospasm). Weaning criteria commonly used are poor predictors of extubation failure. We have tested the interest of adding to our weaning test-specific criteria to assess muscle strength, cough effectiveness, airway patency and patient's consciousness (Table 11) . Patients and methods We have retrospectively reviewed charts of all patients mechanically ventilated in the 24-bed MICU of Cochin University Hospital from 01/2007 to 12/2013. These patients were assessed twice a day by nurses who look for the presence of weaning criteria. Patients who met those criteria underwent a spontaneous breathing trial on T-piece during which tolerance was assessed. All patients data were continuously recorded in a clinical information management system (Clinisoft \u00ae , GE Healthcare), including data related to weaning success/failure. In 08/2008, we progressively introduced a fiveitem new component to our weaning protocol to improve our ability to test muscle strength, cough effectiveness, airway patency and patient's consciousness. To evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy, we assessed the incidence of weaning failure (defined as respiratory or extubation failure requiring reintubation within 48 h), the incidence of self-extubation, the duration of MV and ICU stay, and survival before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) implementation of the new component.

Our aim is to describe the epidemiological profile of the accidents during the school holidays Materials and methods It is a descriptive observational cohort study during the school holidays from December 2014 to January 2015, at the pediatrics hospital in Canastel in Oran. All children under age of 15 years who are victims of accident were included. Results One hundred and fifteen children were enrolled. The mean of age was 5.2 years (\u00b14.1) with sex ratio of 1.78. The most frequent consultation in the pediatric emergency was the traumatology (62.6 %) of the cases followed by the burn (32.2 %) of the cases. The majority of the children are from Oran (63.5 %). Eight couples were divorced. The child was alone at the time of the accident in 80.3 % of the cases. 61.3 % of the children live with the big family. The age of the father was between 30 and 40 years in 46.2 % and more than 40 years in 41.5 %, while the age of the mother was between 20 and 30 years in 49.2 % of the cases and between 30 and 40 years in 43.1 %. No attempts of suicide or voluntary accident were noted. The children required a hospitalization in 24.3 % and stay in pediatric intensive care in 4.3 % of the cases. A 9-month-old child died following an inhaled foreign body. Conclusion The most of the accidents could be avoided.

Sometimes, VV ECMO has been used to rescue patients suffering from pulmonary failure unresponsive to conventional therapies (2) . Due to high risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications, its duration and effectiveness may be limited. Prone position (PrP) and lung-protective and ultraprotective mechanical ventilation (tidal volume <2 ml/kg with Peep >10 cmH 2 O, \u00b1HFOV) are recognized pulmonary rehabilitation strategies. The increase in oxygenation has been reported, associated with VILI reduction and improvement in alveolar recruitment (1) . The main objective of the study was to reduce the duration of VV ECMO and ARDS morbi-mortality, by using these respiratory strategies in pediatric ARDS, requiring VV support. Patients and methods Following the recommendations of Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus conference, we used double-lumen venous cannula VV support, in right internal jugular vein, with echographic control (3) . During ECMO, the respiratory strategies were: ultra-protective controlled ventilation (UCV), PrP for 12 h daily, early reversal neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and spontaneous neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) ventilation. Durations of ECMO, UCV and NMB were collected, as well as the time of introduction of NAVA during ECMO and extubation after the weaning off ECMO. Results Six patients suffering from ARDS were admitted in our ICU and included in this study. The age ranged from 21 days to 4 years. The diverse causes of ARDS were VRS bronchiolitis, Enterobacter cloacae pneumonia, systemic inflammatory reaction syndrome (SIRS) and stage 4 drowning and macrophage activation syndrome. No increased cannulation site bleeding and flow issues, notably during the PrP procedure, were observed. The reversal NMB was at 3.7 days (\u00b12.3) during the ECMO. NAVA ventilation was initiated also during the ECMO at 7 days (\u00b12.6), and the duration of VV support was 7.3 days (\u00b13). The patients were extubated 3.9 days (\u00b12.6) after decannulation. All children survived. Discussion The durations of ECMO and invasive ventilation observed in our study were dramatically short regarding the severity of ARDS (2) . Our study showed the successful of respiratory rehabilitation strategies during VV support that included rapid improvement in oxygenation, early NMB weaning, using NAVA ventilation before decannulation and then decrease ECMO duration. Conclusion VV ECMO, with double-lumen venous cannula, in severe ARDS in pediatric patients, can be optimized by respiratory rehabilitation strategies such as prolonged PrP, UCV and early respiratory weaning with NAVA ventilation. All these strategies seem to improve outcomes of these patients. However, further studies still required to confirm our encouraging results (Table 12) . Introduction In critically ill patients, noninvasive ventilation is classically set on a variable association of clinical parameters. However, this \"clinical\" setting provides no accurate data regarding the improvement in the respiratory effort and the synchronization of the patient with the ventilator. Esophageal pressure and gastric pressure have been shown to be useful in the ventilatory management of adult patients with acute respiratory failure. The aim of the present study is to describe the value of esophageal pressure and gastric pressure measurements for determining the usefulness and optimal setting of noninvasive ventilation in children with respiratory failure admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).",

Four patients were assisted by CPAP ventilation and two with BiPAP ventilation. In these four patients, two died and one was still on noninvasive pressure ventilation (NPPV) at PICU discharge. This decrease in respiratory effort was associated with a decrease in RR and PvCO 2 . NPPV non-indication was proved by esophageal pressure measurement in two patients. In these two patients, despite the physiological findings, NPPV was continued in one patient after esophageal pressure and gastric pressure measurements because of an important clinical improvement.

In France, the Leonetti law was promulgated in 2005 to clarify medical practices regarding this topic. It draws attention to the aspect of unreasonable obstinacy and authorizes withholding or withdrawal of treatments such as mechanical ventilation, vital drugs or artificial nutrition when they appear \"useless or disproportionate. \" It also emphasizes the necessity to alleviate pain, even when doing so could result in shortening life. Ten years after its promulgation, this law still seems not fully implemented in French Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). The aim of this study is to assess the implementation of the Leonetti law in our NICU and PICU and to study the evolutions of this implementation over time.",

This classification has been done by a physician outside our unit, unaware of the child's situation, in order to lead to a consensual classification. The interpretation of the data was based on univariate analysis, descriptive at first. We then compared those data year by year. Results Over this period, 94 cases out of 119 were included. The four criteria were met in 40 % of the cases, and this value significantly improved over time [8- Discussion Despite the biases caused by its retrospective nature, our study allowed us to confirm the improvement in our practices in children end of life. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly regarding collegiate decision (e.g., systematic presence of an external consultant) and assessment of pain and discomfort in end-oflife situations. Conclusion Laws and medical recommendations cannot bring all answers to end-of-life situations.

The most common method used for attempted suicide was drug ingestion (85.5 %). The majority of cases attempted suicide at home. Marriage frustration, work and study problems, family fanaticism and conflict, somatic disease, and history of mental disorders were all significantly associated with suicide attempts. The ratio of patients to be discharged or to die was similar in occupation, marital status, and the place of suicide attempt; however, the results were different in gender, age, educational level, methods used for suicide, time of day, and reason.

Experimental research showed that these benefits are associated with a down-regulation of inflammatory pathways. However, the specific impact of heart rate reduction on the inflammatory pathways remains unknown. Ivabradine is a pure heart rate-lowering drug that acts specifically on the sinoatrial node by selectively inhibiting the If current. The present study was designed to assess the effects of heart rate reduction by ivabradine on cardiovascular function and on the inflammatory pathways involved in peritonitis-induced septic rats. Materials and methods Sixteen Wistar male rats were treated with cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) to evoke peritonitis. Four hours after CLP, rats were randomly allocated to CLP (n = 8) and ivabradine (n = 8, administrated per os at H4) groups. Another eight Wistar male rats underwent sham operation.

In a rat model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, we investigated the effect of an intravenous bolus of omega-3, associated or not with iodinated contrast media (used for reperfusion process during coronarography), at reperfusion time, so as to mimic emergency clinical management of myocardial infarction and reperfusion-induced shock. Materials and methods A myocardial ischemia-reperfusion model was performed by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in rats. After a 30-min ischemia, but before reperfusion, an intravenous bolus of EPA and DHA (6:1), associated or not with iodinated contrast media, was administered. After a 4-h reperfusion, circulating procoagulant microparticles were quantified phenotyped. Vascular and heart inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stresses were assessed. Ex vivo vascular reactivity was performed with a pharmacological selective inhibitor of iNOS. Infarct size was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Results Treating rats with an EPA/DHA bolus before reperfusion significantly improved the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, increasing mean arterial pressure (151 \u00b1 13 vs 122 \u00b1 17 mmHg, p < 0.05), coronary and carotid blood flow, and decreasing infarct size (39.9 \u00b1 2.3 versus 26.8 \u00b1 5.7 % of left ventricle, p < 0.05). Moreover, ex vivo mesenteric resistance artery sensitivity to phenylephrine was improved. Finally, endothelial CD54+ microparticle release was decreased (9.1 \u00b1 2.5 vs. 4.8 \u00b1 2.0 nM EqPhtdSer, p < 0.05), as well as vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, reflecting a reduced vascular dysfunction. Discussion In our model, the omega-3 vascular beneficial effects may partly result from endothelial protection. Indeed, ischemia-reperfusion-induced endothelial dysfunction results in phenotypic and physical changes in the endothelium, with a deregulated release of potent vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin, reduced vascular reactivity to vasoconstrictors, associated with leukocyte and platelet aggregation and deregulation of nitric oxide signaling. Rat hemodynamic parameters were subsequently improved. Associating omega-3 to iodinated contrast media in the reperfusion process therefore deserves further investigating and might be a promising line of development in humans.",

Duration of hospitalization before ICU admission, and the main risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens were collected. Results Between January 2014 and May 2015, 114 patients developed ventilator-acquired pneumonia in the ICU. There were 69 (61 %) early-onset pneumonia and 45 (39 %) late-onset pneumonia. Bacterial diagnoses were made on tracheal aspirations (99.1 %) and broncho alveolar lavages (35.9). There were no significant differences in the bacteriology of early-and late-onset VAP. Gram negative bacteria were predominant (30.4 vs 31.1 %, p = 0.94). There were 18.4 % of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the overall population. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were mainly gram-negative bacteria (four BLSE, 11 cephalosporinase, four multiresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, one stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 SARM). There was a trend toward a higher prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogen among patients with late-onset VAP (13 vs 27 %, p = 0.07).

Introduction Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection in hospitalized adults and is a leading cause of death among critical infections. To face the dramatically increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant pathogen-related HAP, new therapeutic options are currently in development. The evaluation of these new treatments will require properly designed studies with appropriate inclusion criteria and endpoints. During the past 10 years, the regulatory agencies repeatedly updated guidance for the design of randomized controlled trials (RCT) aiming to evaluate the efficacy of antimicrobials for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). However, our hypothesis is that, to date, HAP/VAP RCTs greatly differ in population enrolled, in HAP/VAP definition criteria used and in primary and secondary outcomes assessed. Such differences between studies may be of importance because they may impact results of studies. Thus, we performed a systematic review of characteristics of enrolled populations, inclusion/exclusion criteria and endpoints in RCT addressing the efficacy of antimicrobials for HAP/VAP treatment. Microbiological criteria were required in only 48 % (with a microbiological threshold in 36 % of studies). Severe patients (APACHE score >25) were excluded in 24 % of studies. Most studies tested a hypothesis of non-inferiority (36 %) or equivalence (24 %), while 16 % of studies aimed to demonstrate superiority. Surprisingly, statistical hypothesis was not clearly defined and sample size calculation not mentioned in 28 and 64 % of studies, respectively. Clinical cure was considered as a primary endpoint in 92 % of studies. However, the primary endpoint was dual and even triple in, respectively, 40 and 12 % of studies because it was studied in different analysis population (28 % of studies) or it was associated with microbiological cure (16 %) and/ or safety. Assumed clinical cure rate was anticipated in only one-third of manuscripts. Mortality was used as a primary endpoint only in two studies and safety in one. Definitions of clinical cure consisted in complete or partial remission of clinical signs and symptoms associated with pneumonia in 100 % of studies, but improvement in chest radiography was associated in only two-third of the studies. Interestingly, the lack of additional antibiotic requirement during follow-up was included in clinical cure definition in 29 % of studies. The test-of-cure visit evaluating the clinical cure ranged from the end of treatment to 28 days later.",

Early antimicrobial therapy, initiated before the results of pulmonary specimen cultures, seems to improve outcome (1).

Blindly inserted telescoping plugged catheter (TPC) sampling seems reliable and is recommended methods for the bacteriological diagnosis of VAP. The threshold of 10 3 colony-forming units (cfu) mL \u22121 provides a good sensitivity and specificity. Because 24-to 48-h delay is needed for quantitative cultures, early Gram's stain identification performed upon TCP samples could guide empirical antibiotic therapy. However, accuracy of such strategy is controversial because true sensitivity and specificity of Gram's stain for diagnosis of VAP remain questionable. In the present study, we evaluate whether the Gram stain upon initial TPC samples could predict the results of quantitative culture and identification of pathogens in patients suspected for VAP.

The presence of leukocytes on TPC results of Gram's stain improves sensitivity for VAP-positive culture. Taking Gram's stain information into account for establishing empiric antibiotic treatment may generate non adapted therapy. Results must be confirmed by prospective and multicenter studies.",

First, it is well known that hypernatremic metabolic alkalosis may occur under CBA-CRRT in case of using trisodium citrate, which contains a high sodium load (408 mmol/L) as compared to 18/0 citrate (140 mmol/L of sodium), but the mild risk of alkalosis due to hypochloremia using dilute citrate (86 mmol/L in 18/0) is mostly unrecognized. However, no patient presented severe metabolic alkalosis, but natremia was significantly higher in group A and chloremia lower in group B. Second, hypophosphoremia rate, which has been diagnosed in as many as 65 % of the patients undergoing CRRT when using dialysis or replacement solutions without phosphate, is effectively decreased by using phosphate containing solutions. Finally, attention must be drawn on the high proportion of hypomagnesaemia, even if dialysis and replacement solutions contain magnesium, as citrate creates complex with magnesium as well as calcium.",

Antifungal drugs have considerably evolved, with new molecules, whose choice depends on spectrum and adverse effects. Amphotericin B is an old drug, with a wide spectrum and highly efficient, but associated with renal toxicity. Liposomal amphotericin B is supposed to be less nephrotoxic, but other molecules may be preferred in case of renal dysfunction. We aimed to assess the impact of liposomal amphotericin B administration on renal function in critically ill patients. Patients and methods A retrospective single-center cohort study was performed, including consecutive patients admitted to our intensive care unit between 31/01/2008 and 12/07/2014, and receiving liposomal amphotericin B for at least 2 days. Acute kidney injury was defined using the KDIGO criteria. Patients were divided into four groups: those who did not develop any acute kidney injury, those who developed acute kidney injury 1 day or more after liposomal amphotericin B initiation (de novo), those who had acute kidney injury at initiation and worsened their renal function 1 day or more after initiation and those who had acute kidney injury at initiation and did not worsen their acute kidney injury. Patients with worsening renal function after liposomal amphotericin B (de novo or on previous acute kidney injury) were compared to patients without worsening renal function (no acute kidney injury or not worsening previous acute kidney injury). The analysis of factors associated with liposomal amphotericin B-related acute kidney injury was performed in a competing risks framework (death and discharge without acute kidney injury considered as competing events).

            "text": "Introduction Regional citrate-based anticoagulation (RCA) has proven effective to increase the filter lifespan during continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) [1] whenever performed by experienced practitioners in highly specialized teams. Moreover, from the perspective of beginners, such technique may seem to require more nursing time give to the numerous interventions to modify citrate doses and/or calcium intake. In our 23-bed ICU (University Teaching Hospital, Saint-Denis, Reunion island, France), at the decision to initiate RCA for CVVH, we had no medical expertise in dealing with the protocol, technical issues and training nurses. Therefore, we looked at reaching the same results as an experienced team with regard to the filter lifespan and the nursing workload. Patients and methods A homemade protocol primarily tested on five patients was used in all patients meeting the criteria for CVVH with no contraindication for RCA. This protocol contained a target-oriented algorithm for post-filter ionized calcium concentration (between 0.15 and 0.4 mmoL L \u22121 ) and arterial ionized calcium concentration (between 1.00 and 1.15 mmoL L \u22121 ). Primary endpoints were filter lifespan and number of handlings for RCA therapy's adaptation (changes in citrate anticoagulation and calcium compensation). Secondary endpoints were safety, changes in biological parameters and reasons to terminate the technique. Discussion Our \"RCA for dummies\" protocol fulfilled its objectives far beyond our expectations. The median filter lifespan (51 h) was surprisingly as high as that of reported by experts (49 h) [1] . The number of RCA therapy's adaptation was low (one intervention every 20 h) with no significant nursing overwork. These first results are promising ones for a non-expert team, and we wonder whether we were not too cautious than needed with this new technique. As RCA is a routine technique on our hands, we are conducting a second survey in order to rule out a \"starter effect. \" Conclusion We confirm that RCA is both efficient and safe since its early use in ICUs by inexperienced practitioners, with fairly acceptable achievements in terms of filter lifespan, number of handlings and nursing overwork. Introduction Liver transplantation (LT) is the reference treatment for hepatocellular terminal chronic diseases. Early postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI), which incidence varies between 29 and 60 % depending on the definitions and cohorts, is a factor of poor prognosis, especially when renal replacement therapy (RRT) is necessary. The objective of this study is to assess the incidence of early AKI (in the first 48 h) of a LT considering AKIN classification with consideration of diuresis and to identify associated risk factors. Patients and methods Patients who received a first non-emergency LT orthotopic cadaveric graft between January 2011 and December 2014 at Grenoble University Hospital were included in this retrospective study. Eleven patients were excluded because of the need for RRT before the LT or related kidney transplant. Demographic and clinical and biological parameters pre-, intra-and postoperative, including comorbidities, etiology and staging of liver disease, anesthetic management, graft function, use of renal replacement therapy, diuresis by 6 h and evolution, were collected. Serum creatinine at 24 h was considered to reflect kidney function between H0 and H24 and 1-48 h to reflect that between H24 and H48. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis (alpha risk 0.05).",

Patients and methods After informed consent of the patient initially scheduled for elective AANI was obtained, those with previous failed ML, showing inter-incisor distance of >20 mm, with no expansive tumoral process in the upper airway and those with easy identification of anatomical cricothyroid membrane landmarks were proposed F2F-VAQ-TI in sitting position. An Eschmann stylet (ES) was systematically armed in the tracheal tube inserted in the VAQ channel. Preoxygenation and anesthesia induction techniques were standardized. Filmed TI maneuver was started 30 s after succinylcholine IV bolus (1 mg kg \u22121 ) was injected. Insertion of an LMA Fastrach was considered as a Plan B in case of difficulty to maintain SaO 2 > 90 %. The fiberscope used with VAQ or LMA Fastrach was recommended as impossible tracheal access Plan B. In the PACU, the patients were asked to evaluate the level of comfort of the proposed airway management strategy using a visual analogue scale (VAS 0-100). For those patients that had previously been proposed AANI, they were asked to quote their comfort during both previous AANI and F2F-VAQ-TI. Moreover, they were asked to choose for the next surgery step the airway management technique among the two proposed options. Results Over 3 years, 106 F2F-VAQ-TI were performed. The surgical indications requesting TI were as follows: maxillofacial reconstruction (41 %), orthopedic (32 %), neurological and visceral. The reported reasons for previous ML failure were as follows: restricted mouth aperture of below 25 mm, major abnormality of anterior neck structure, severe cervical spine ankylosis, previous causes combined with post-surgery/ radiation sequels or unknown non-tumoral causes. All the patients (n = 36) that had received AANI for previous surgery would ask F2F-VAQ-TI for the next surgery. The mean (SD) comfort of F2F-VAQ-TI was remarkably high: 90 (6).",

It is the result of several mechanisms such as hemodilution, hemorrhage or inflammation consequences. Blood spoliation due to repeated blood punctures is also one of the factors leading to anemia. The reference method to determine the hemoglobin concentration is the cyanohemoglobin method performed with an automatic hematology analyzer (HA). The main pitfalls of this method are to require a certain volume of blood, further enhancing the blood spoliation, and to be completed in a laboratory, increasing the lag time to diagnosis. Alternate methods such as HemoCue\u00a9 (HC) or spectrophotometry with the blood gas analysis (BGA) have been developed to address these issues. Nevertheless, accuracy of these methods remains debatable. Therefore, we conducted a study to compare the aforementioned techniques agreement, completion time and costs in ICU. Patients and methods This is a single-center prospective study. All patients undergoing both a blood cell count and an arterial blood gas analysis were included. A capillary HemoCue\u00a9 was performed just after the blood puncture and the capillary hemoglucotest. The completion time was registered, as well as the hour of the blood puncture. We also registered the hours at the blood sample arrival at the laboratory and at the availability of the result on the hospital intranet. The HA was considered as the reference method. Costs were estimated according to the French health system charts. Agreement between the methods has been estimated with Bland and Altman test. Results are given in mean \u00b1 SD. Comparisons have been made with Student's t test, ANOVA or Chi square test as appropriate. Results Fifty-one samples have been compared in 37 patients (age 70 \u00b1 15 years, SAPS II 48 \u00b1 20). We found a difference when comparing the hemoglobin concentration with HA, BGA and HC (respectively, 9.9 \u00b1 1.8, 10.2 \u00b1 2.1 and 9.5 \u00b1 2.5 g/dl, p = 0.003). The comparison between HA and BGA evidenced a systematic positive deviation (+0.25 g/dl). Limits of agreement (\u00b12 SD) were \u00b11.94 g/dl. Three measurements were outside these limits. The comparison between HA and HC evidenced a systematic negative deviation (\u22120.4 g/dl). Limits of agreement were \u00b12.92 g/dl. Three measurements were outside these limits. A transfusion was indicated once according to recommended transfusion thresholds by HA. This transfusion was also indicated by BGA. HC would have indicated nine transfusions, only one being confirmed by HA. HC was performed in 1.2 \u00b1 0.5 min (min). The time between the blood sample and the result's availability was significantly lower for the BGA as compared to HA (34 \u00b1 19.9 vs. 54.5 \u00b1 32.6 min; p = 0.01). It was the result of a faster laboratory technique (23.7 \u00b1 15.5 vs. 31.6 \u00b1 20.2 min; p = 0.03), whereas the transport time of both samples was not different. The costs of HA, BGA and HC were estimated to be, respectively, 426.87, 1032.75 and 45.9 euros. Nevertheless, when summing these \"direct costs\" with the price of the transfusions that would have been indicated according to the tests, HC became the most expensive tool (5022.9 euros) as compared to HA (979.87 euros) or BGA (1585.75 euros). Discussion Among the three methods, HC was the fastest to perform, but seemed to be the less accurate as well. Its precise position in the ICU setting must be discussed, since the reference test appears to be mandatory to indicate a transfusion. Its utility may be more substantial in the pre-hospital setting where no other hemoglobin measurement tool is available. The blood gas analysis, often performed in ICU, offers the advantage to be more accurate than HemoCue\u00a9 and to provide other useful information.",

This monitoring can be done by the mean of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or by anti-Xa level measurements. Compared with anti-Xa levels testing, aPTT is more frequently impacted by preanalytic variables and biologic factors (increased levels of acute-phase reactants, consumption coagulopathy) often encountered among critically ill patients. We studied the agreement of both test results in unselected critically ill patients. Patients and methods aPTT and anti-Xa levels were simultaneously monitored in patients treated by continuous intravenous infusion of UFH. Blood samples were drawn into sodium citrate tubes (Greiner Bio-One SAS, France). aPTT was measured with TriniCLOT Automated aPTT reagent (Tcoag, Ireland) and anti-Xa levels with Biophen Heparin (LRT) (HYPHEN Biomed, France). An aPTT of 2-3 times the control and anti-Xa levels between 0.3 and 0.7 IU/ml were defined as therapeutic. Results Forty-four patients (mean age 71.13 \u00b1 15.7 years; mean SAP-SII 39.1 \u00b1 14.4) were included. Reasons for admission were medical in 31 and surgical in 13. The indications for UFH therapy were atrial fibrillation (26), venous thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism (13), thrombophilia (2), acute coronary syndrome (1), and arterial thrombosis (2) . Paired measurements of aPTT and anti-Xa were taken on 353 samples. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between aPTT and anti-Xa. The correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa levels was low (r = 0.495). The concordance of tests results is shown in Table 17 . Concordant aPTT and anti-Xa values were observed in 213 (60.3 %) data pairs. aPTT was discordantly high in 96 (29.9 %) data pairs and discordantly low in 44 (12.5 %) ones. Discussion In an unselected population of critically ill patients, the concordance of aPTT and anti-Xa levels was low. Considering anti-Xa as gold standard, monitoring anticoagulation treatment by aPTT leads to a high risk of misdosing. aPTT is frequently impacted by biologic factors. Although less commonly, anti-Xa levels can also be influenced by biologic cofounders. Poor correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa could result from alterations in FII and FVIII activity. Conclusion Use of aPTT and anti-Xa levels to guide heparin therapy may lead to different estimates of UFH concentration in the same patient.",

The aim of this study is to describe the rate and the patterns of hyper-eosinophilia in a population of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for severe AECOPD requiring ventilatory support. Table 20 compares the characteristics of patients with and without hyper-eosinophilia. Conclusion Hyper-eosinophilia (>2 %) appears to be common in patients admitted for AECOPD (52.4 % of patients in our study) and seems associated with inflammation markers and a trend toward longer ventilation and ICU length of stay durations. A policy of corticosteroids prescription guided by blood eosinophilia count seems reasonable in our population.",

The phenotype of frequent exacerbator (FE) has been recently described. No existing study has evaluated the rate of patients called 'FE' among COPD patients requiring pulmonary resection and the relations between exacerbations history and the incidence of acute respiratory postoperative complications (ARPC). The main objective was to determine the frequency of ARPC (atelectasis, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia) following lung resection in COPD patients. The secondary objectives aimed to determine the frequency of extra-pulmonary postoperative complications and the prevalence of the 'FE' phenotype in this population, as well as its relation with the risk of ARPC. Patients and methods It was a prospective, observational, singlecenter study of patients with COPD hospitalized for elective thoracic surgery in the center of H\u00f4pital Cochin, Paris, France. The inclusion criteria were as follows: male or female adults, permanent airflow obstruction (VEMS/CV < 70 %), scheduled oncologic pulmonary resection. Collected data were as follows: COPD symptoms and severity scores, preoperative severity scores, comorbidities, per operative data, postoperative complications and 30-day mortality. Results Since July 2014 to September 2015, 98 COPD patients were included for analysis. Twenty-one were considered as FE (21.6 %). COPD classification was as follows: I-5 (%), II-11 (%), III-2 (%). There was no difference in demographic or COPD severity score (CAT score, IPAQ, MRC) between FE and the rest of the population. There was no difference in the 30-day mortality.

Since the recourse to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) has rarely been reported in this setting, we reviewed the presentation and outcomes of patients admitted to our ICU for pheochromocytomainduced refractory cardiogenic shock that was rescued by VA-ECMO. Introduction Since 2004, patients needing heart transplantation in emergency benefit from national prioritization \"super urgency 1\" (SU1) for graft attribution. The efficiency of this new modality of access to transplantation in emergency is uncertain. Several transplantation teams report increased transplantation survey in patients assisted previously with ventricular device (VAD). The aim of this work was to compare the survey of patients in SU1 who were transplanted during this period in comparison with patients who failed to be transplanted and who benefited of VAD treatment in bridge to transplantation. Patients and methods This monocentric retrospective study included all the patients in SU1 between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2013. Primary endpoint was the hospital mortality after either transplantation or VAD treatment. The second endpoint was the 1-year mortality. Data are expressed to median (25th-75th quartile) and percentage. Groups were compared using Mann-Whitney and Fischer tests. Results During the period study, 227 patients were included in SU1 program. In total, 162 patients received a cardiac graft and 65 failed to be transplanted during the SU1 period. In failed attempt group, 33 were treated with VAD therapy [22 biventricular assist device (BiVAD) and 11 left ventricular assist device (LVAD)], 15 patients died without transplantation or any other device and 15 patients were excluded of the study because they were transplanted after the \"SU1\" period. One patient survived without any transplantation or device at 1 year. Between transplanted and VAD groups, there was no difference in terms of age Conclusion Heart transplantation is the best treatment in SU1 conditions for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. In case of failed attempt in SU1, VAD implantation needs meticulous revaluation in particular of BiVAD because of high mortality.",

Since major improvement in the prognosis of immunocompromised patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has been reported in recent years, our objective was to analyze short-and longterm outcomes of immunocompromised refractory cardiogenic shock patients supported by VA-ECMO. Patients and methods We retrospectively collected demographic, admission severity scores, pre-and post-ECMO data, ECMO-related complications, and 6-month survival of immunocompromised patients who received VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock in our 26-bed intensive care unit (ICU) from June 2006 to June 2015. Immunocompromised status was defined as hematological malignancy, solid cancer <5 years, solid organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, long-term corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies. Patients who received ECMO within 1 year after cardiac transplantation or after left ventricular assist device were excluded from this cohort. Patients who survived were contacted in September 2015 and assessed for health-related quality of life, psychological and post-traumatic stress disorder status. Results Eighty-two immunocompromised patients were included (median age 43 years, [interquartile range 30-60]; 54 % male, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) 72 [55-89]). Reasons for immunodeficiency were hematological malignancies (n = 17), solid cancers (n = 14), HIV (n = 8), solid organ transplantation (n = 17) and autoimmune connective tissue disorders or vasculitis or long-term corticosteroid therapy (n = 26). Main causes of cardiogenic shock were myocarditis (n = 24), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 12), acute myocardial infarction (n = 10), septic shock (n = 8), cardiac graft rejection (n = 8) or post-cardiotomy (n = 5). Conclusion Despite extreme disease severity and major underlying comorbidities, we observed that 32 % of immunocompromised patients rescued with VA-ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock were alive at 6 months with acceptable long-term quality of life. Higher severity score and profound cardiac impairment at ECMO initiation were independently associated with poor outcomes. Although survival was less in this group of patients than in non-immunocompromised patients, recourse to this salvage therapy should not be denied based only on this pre-morbid condition. Lastly, the type of immunosuppression might also impact on the outcomes of these patients.

Introduction Many studies have shown a good correlation between the value of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) score, diagnosis of severe coagulopathy and mortality, especially during severe sepsis and polytrauma. However, physiological changes in hemostasis during pregnancy probably alter the significant thresholds of the ISTH score compromising the application and interpretation of it for the diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). The morbidity and mortality associated with severe hemorrhage and consumption coagulopathy leading to DIC during pregnancy emphasize the need for the adjustment of this ISTH DIC score to these patients On this basis, an Israeli team recently created from a large retrospective database study (n = 24,693 deliveries), a score of DIC. The components and the coagulation parameter thresholds were determined according to the physiological changes of the coagulation of pregnant women. Primary objective of the study was to test a new scoring system for diagnosing disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), which is adapted to hemostasis changes in pregnant women and to compare this new score to the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) score. Secondary objectives were to explain differences in diagnostic predictive value between the two scores and to assess DIC and its evolution of DIC according to the main obstetrics diseases causing ICU admission. Materials and methods This is a population-based retrospective study of 154 patients admitted for severe postpartum complications from 2008 to 2014 at intensive care center in Lille University Hospital. The new score (based on 3 components: platelet count, prothrombin time difference and fibrinogen) and the ISTH score (based on 4 components: platelet count, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, and fibrin-related marker) were calculated from biological data on the day of delivery and repeated at ICU admission (day 0) until second day included (day 2) with reference to the consensus diagnostic analysis by two experts. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) for each score were calculated for each time and overall by generalized linear mixed model. The agreement between the two scores was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient.",

Their Kappa correlation coefficient was 0.35. The discriminating thresholds of the components of the new score had a good correlation with the expert analysis regarding the difference in prothrombin time and fibrinogen while the platelet count threshold was less adapted. Analysis of ISTH score thresholds showed a high prevalence of DIC for high-weighted thresholds and also a significant prevalence for the thresholds considered as not markers of DIC. DIC complicated mostly acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) and postpartum hemorrhage and especially if it was associated with HELLP syndrome. The correction of the DIC was faster in the postpartum hemorrhage compared with preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome or AFLP.

Ninety-four patients (13 %) had the acute pulmonary edema. The acute renal failure was observed in 367 patients (50.6 %). Two hundred and one patients (27.7 %) had intravenous disseminate coagulation. Eighty-five patients (11.7 %) had disorders of consciousness. All these systemic complications were significantly associated with high mortality. The childbirth was by cesarean section in 462 patients (63.7 %). Mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h was performed in 233 women (32.1 %). The average stay of our patients was 2.8 \u00b1 4.2 days. Mortality has affected 44 patients (6 % (Fig. 31) . SMR was close to 1 for SAPS II and MPM II 24 scores (respectively, 0.90 and 0.97), whereas it was 0.53, 0.54 and 0.6, respectively, for APACHE II, MPM II 0 and ODIN scores. The value of H was 13.65 (P > 0.05) and 2.14 (P > 0.05), respectively, for scores SAPS II and MPM II 24, while it was 32.48 (P < 0.001), 32.47 (P < 0.001) and 37.56 (P < 0.001), respectively, for scores APACHE II, MPM II 0 and ODIN. Conclusion For each of the 5 studied scores, we found an excellent discriminatory power in terms of mortality. SAPS II and MPM II 24 had a perfect calibration to predict satisfactorily the probability of death. Other scores APACHE II, MPM II 0 and ODIN give an overestimation of the mortality.",

The role of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs), without TOF monitoring, was recently enhanced in acute respiratory distress syndrome (2). Our objective was to compare the results of a TOF with a clinical assessment of a neuromuscular blockade in ICU patients treated with recommended doses of benzylisoquinoliniums. Patients and methods Design: An observational prospective study. Setting: Two polyvalent ICUs. Patients: A total of 119 critically ill patients who required a neuromuscular blockade for more than 24 h. Interventions: None. Measurements: Based on recommendations (1), three levels of neuromuscular blockade were defined: \"over-paralyzed\" (TOF = 0), \"wellparalyzed\" (TOF = 1-2), and \"under-paralyzed\" (TOF = 3-4). Similarly, physicians were asked to classify patients as \"over-, \" \"well-, \" or \"under-\" paralyzed. Two measurements per day of the TOF on the facial nerve were taken and compared to the clinical assessment made by physicians who were blinded to the TOF results. Results During the study period, 996 measurements of the facial TOF were taken, and only 8.8 % of them were in the category \"well-paralyzed. \" The agreement between the facial TOF and clinical assessment was very poor (kappa: 0.06; weighted kappa: 0.09). The proportion of \"under-paralyzed\" TOF measurements increased with the duration of the neuromuscular blockade (p < 0.05), suggesting tachyphylaxis. No significant difference was found when the plateau pressure and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio were compared between the three levels of muscle relaxation defined by the TOF in the subgroup of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The risk of ICU-acquired weakness was associated with a median infusion rate of NMBAs. It was also associated with a higher number of \"over-paralyzed\" TOF measurements (p < 0.05). Conclusion Our results suggest that, according to the facial TOF, less than 10 % of patients are \"well-paralyzed\" with recommended doses of benzylisoquinoliniums and that the clinical evaluation of neuromuscular blockades is inaccurate. However, the clinical impact of adjusting doses of NMBAs according to the TOF is still a matter of debate.",

At 72 h of admission, we considered eligible for enteral route patients receiving enteral nutrition, presenting without shock, small bowel disease, hematological disease, or severe sepsis requiring specifically the parenteral route. Results Seventy-two hours after ICU admission, 45 % of patients were eligible for the use of enteral route. Ineligibility to the enteral route was most often due to either hemodynamic instability (patients with vasopressors) or a non-fed enterally patient. 18.6 % of patients (n = 40) received no drug of interest enterally. Linezolid was the only drug that was never switched from parenteral to enteral route. Among patients eligible for enteral route, 14 % of patients were using enteral route from the beginning of treatment and 25 % with a switch from parenteral to enteral route. For patients ineligible for enteral route, only 22.6 % have received their medication by strict parenteral route throughout the duration of treatment. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of enteral route for drug administration in ICU. It included 215 patients representing 13,660 drug administrations. It was neither eligibility to enteral route (14 % of eligible patients had no drug of interest enterally, whereas 77.4 % of non-eligible patients received at least one drug of interest enterally) nor the bioavailability of the drug of interest (drugs selected for this study had excellent bioavailability) or the severity of the patient (patients receiving amiodarone had higher SAPS II score than the general population of the study, whereas the drug was one of the most enterally given) that dictated the primary or secondary use of the enteral route in critically ill patients. This suggests that there are barriers against the use of enteral route in ICU: ignorance of practices, human factors, and ethical considerations.",

Questionnaires such as HADS (anxiety and depression), the IES-R (post-traumatic stress disorder) and the SF-36 (quality of life) were sent to be completed and returned on the day of the clinic. On the day of the IFUDC, patients had a measurement of vital parameters, fasting blood and urine collection (dipstick test, blood and urine electrolytes and creatinine, proteinuria, blood count, hemostasis, lipid status, iron status, liver function test), electrocardiogram, pulmonary function test (spirometry) and a chest X-ray. Breakfast was then served. They were then received in consultation by an intensivist to detail the history of their ICU stay, a therapist doctor and a psychiatrist. All data and observations were gathered in a computer form specifically designed for IFUDC program. After lunch, Bags patients and accompanying persons were invited (all patients agreed) to return to visit the ICU in which they were admitted. They were able to meet the team that cared for them. This visit was each time seen as very positive and full of emotions as by caregivers as by patients and their families.

Introduction Patient-ventilator asynchrony is defined as a mismatch between patient and ventilator inspiratory and expiratory times and is associated with negative outcomes such as longer duration of mechanical ventilation and higher mortality and tracheotomy rates. To date, 5 major patterns of asynchrony are described. However, there is no universal agreement on the definition of these patterns, resulting in heterogeneity of the prevalence of asynchrony and of the association between asynchrony and outcome. The aim of our study was to prospectively and noninvasively compare the prevalence of patientventilator asynchrony according to two distinct methods. In addition, we determined the factors associated with asynchrony and the prognostic impact of asynchrony. Patients and methods This is a ancillary study of a multicentre, randomized controlled trial comparing neurally adjusted ventilator assist to pressure support ventilation during the early phase of weaning. Airway flow and pressure and (EAdi) were recorded during 4 sequences of 20 min. Main asynchronies were further quantified according to two methods: (1) using electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) as a reference and (2) based on the only visual inspection of the flow and airway pressure signal traces. The 5 main asynchronies were quantified, and the asynchrony index defined as the proportion of asynchronous cycles was calculated. Introduction Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated in the treatment of acute respiratory failure associated with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist with a unique mechanism of action providing sedation and anxiolysis via receptors within the locus ceruleus. The aim of the study was to show the feasibility and the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine for patients with NIV. Patients and methods It was a prospective clinical investigation performed in the medical teaching department of emergency and intensive care medicine in Zaghouan in Tunisia from January to June 2015. All patients had acute respiratory failure due to CPE or COPD and required NIV but could not continue NIV sessions because of discomfort and agitation. They had 1 on the Ramsay score and +1 on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). We excluded patients with contraindications to NIV. The experimental protocol was approved by our local review board.",

The mean age was 65. The indications of NIV were CPE in five cases and hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD in seven cases. All patients received an initial loading dosage of 3 yg/kg/h followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 yg/kg/h. At baseline, all patients showed response levels of Ramsay score 1 and RASS score 1.5. Maintenance of Ramsay score at 2.9 \u00b1 1 and RASS score at 1.2 \u00b1 1 and obtainment of effective sedation were reached in all cases during dexmedetomidine infusion. All settings of NIV were in bilevel-PAP. Baseline measures were made at an average of 6 h from the time NIV was started. The total infusion time of dexmedetomidine was about 12 h. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure and respiratory rate decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the infusion of dexmedetomidine. Blood gas exchange (PaO 2 and PaCO 2 ) improved significantly 3 h after the start of infusion (p < 0.05). All patients were weaned successfully from NIV, and we did not need endotracheal intubation for all our patients. All patients were discharged from intensive care and from hospital alive. They could cough and expectorate without assistance. No patients had respiratory infections or presented adverse effects like vomiting and no patients from those who developed bradycardia needed an intervention. Conclusion It is at our knowledge the first Tunisian study of dexmedetomidine in patients requiring NIV in a medical intensive care department. This study shows that we can use this drug for patients presenting difficulties to perform NIV because of agitation. This drug appears to provide several advantages and safe control for NIV sedation in patients with CPE and COPD. Comparative studies are needed to assess these findings.",

However, NIV still fails in one-third of patients. Even if the causes of NIV failure are not totally cleared, patient and interface selection seem to be the major determinant (2) . The aim of this study was to compare the tolerance of 4 interfaces used during preventive NIV in intensive care units (ICUs), assessed both by patients and by caregivers. Patients and methods Patients admitted to the ICU after abdominal surgery for preventive NIV were included in a prospective, monocenter, randomized, crossover study. Four interfaces (Helmet \u00ae , Bacou \u00ae , Intersurgical \u00ae , and Respironics \u00ae ) were studied. The general patient characteristics and physiological parameters (saturation, respiratory rate) were collected. Patients and caregivers estimated with a visual numeric scale (VNS) tolerance parameters: comfort (0 = maximum discomfort, 10 = perfect comfort), leaks (0 = maximum leaks, 10 = no leak), and communication (0 = no communication, 10 = optimal communication). Positioning (0 = very difficult, 10 = very easy) was estimated by caregivers.",

All patients receiving dexmedetomidine were included, and data sheets notably including assessment of sedation, indication, dosage, duration and adverse effects were completed in a prospective way. Results A total of 87 patients were enrolled and 83 were analyzed. The assessment of sedation through RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) score was performed at initiation of dexmedetomidine therapy in 49 patients (59 %). The definition by the clinician of the RASS target objective appeared in 50 % of the prescriptions. There was a significant relationship between define a RASS target and assess it (p = 0.006). Treatment indications were gradual awakening in 44 % (with and without agitation history, 22 % each), respiratory weaning in 39 % and maintaining light sedation to better tolerate orotracheal intubation in case of laryngeal edema in 13 %. Initial and mean dosages varied significantly between services (p < 0.001). Mean treatment duration was 3.0 days, and mean daily treatment cost was 166 \u20ac. Dexmedetomidine was prescribed as second line in 80 % of patients. Over the first 5 days of treatment, 72 % of RASS scores were within the therapeutic range (RASS 0 to \u22123). Extubation was possible under dexmedetomidine (21 extubations on 25 attempts), and no withdrawal symptoms have been reported. Self-extubation rate was 11 %. Agitation rate under dexmedetomidine was 22 %, and it could necessitate discontinuation of treatment but was associated with surgical profile (p = 0.03). It was also related to gradual awakening with agitation history (p = 0.049). The incidence of adverse cardiovascular effects (bradycardia and hypotension) was 23 %. There was a significant association between incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects and hypertension (p = 0.016). Medical satisfaction was good for the patient's ability to communicate his pain (7.1/10), to cooperate to care (6.9/10) and quality of waking (6.9/10). Discussion The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events was high, according to literature descriptions. However, these effects, due to the molecule pharmacology, are predictable, dose-dependent, and no clinical consequences were reported. Sedation assessment through RASS score was not always carried out, representing the opportunity to remind good sedation practices and use of validated scale to adjust dosage. Conclusion This descriptive study reflects the complexity and heterogeneity of mechanically ventilated patients. It evaluated dexmedetomidine effectiveness in maintaining a target level of sedation and prescribers adaptation to this new \u03b1-2 agonist treatment. This work is an opportunity to formalize dexmedetomidine sedation by protocol. At ICU admission, patients suffered from pain (median VAS: 8/10), confused (median CAM-ICU: 2) and agitated (median RASS: 2). These complaints have gradually improved in an inverse way than pH Conclusion Our study shows that pain, confusion, and agitation were common in patients receiving NIV.

This study investigated the time course of septic shock-induced mitochondrial respiration alterations of human PBMC. Patients and methods Septic shock patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital were included following the 2012 Surviving Sepsis Campaign diagnosis criteria and compared to healthy volunteers. After isolating PBMC using Ficoll separation medium, we evaluated PBMC mitochondrial capacities by measuring oxygen consumption in several plasma media, following two steps: firstly a \"cellular\" step and secondly a \"plasmatic\" step. The cellular step of our work measured septic PBMC mitochondrial respiration at days 1, 2 and 7, compared with healthy PBMC. Two plasma treating methods were used at this cellular step: fresh homologous plasmaplasma from same donor used immediately-and frozen heterologous plasma-frozen plasma from another donor from same group and time. The plasmatic step compared effect of day 1 septic plasma versus non-septic plasma on oxygen consumption of three types of cells: septic PBMC at day 1, U937 and CEM cell lines. All oxygen consumption measures, expressed in pmol/s/million cells, were done using high-resolution oxygraphy (oxygraph-2k, Oroboros Instruments, Austria). We assessed also PBMC apoptosis by annexin V, quantified with flow cytometry, plasma pH, and superoxide (O 2 \u2212\u00b7 ) production in whole peripheral blood using electron spin resonance. Results We investigated 22 septic shock patients and 12 healthy volunteers. Our cellular step showed an increased mitochondrial respiration of septic PBMC compared to healthy volunteers: at days 1, 2 and 7 PBMC from septic shock patients consumed, respectively, 8.18 \u00b1 2.77, 9.50 \u00b1 1.60 and 10.72 \u00b1 2.34 pmol O 2 /s/millions cells, significantly higher than healthy volunteers at 4.56 \u00b1 1.29 pmol O 2 /s/millions cells (p < 0.01), in fresh homologous plasma. Similar results were observed in frozen heterologous plasma, showing septic PBMC oxygen consumption of 9.65 \u00b1 6.34, 11.32 \u00b1 5.27 and 11.65 \u00b1 5.28 pmol, respectively, at days 1, 2 and 7, significantly higher (p < 0.05) than healthy PBMC at 5.45 \u00b1 0.98 pmol O 2 /s/millions cells. The plasmatic step showed an inhibitory effect of day 1 septic plasma compared with non-septic plasma: On day 1 septic PBMC, we observed a nonsignificant higher oxygen consumption in healthy plasma versus septic shock plasma from day 1 (14.02 \u00b1 10.12 vs 9.65 \u00b1 6.34; p = 0.13). On both cell lines, oxygraphy showed a significant increase of oxygen consumption in healthy versus septic shock plasma from day 1: 13.11 \u00b1 0.59 versus 9.67 \u00b1 1.77 (p = 0.002) in U937 cells, and 7.54 \u00b1 1.39 versus 6.87 \u00b1 1.11 (p = 0.03) in CEM cells. No significant differences in terms of plasma pH, superoxide (O 2 \u2212\u00b7 ) production or lympho-monocytes apoptosis were observed in healthy or septic shock patients. Conclusion Our study showed a significant increase of lympho-monocytes mitochondrial respiration of septic patients, from day 1 to day 7, compared with healthy volunteers, whereas the septic plasma has an inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiration, suggesting a mitochondrial compensatory process, probably by mitochondrial biogenesis, in response to sepsis process. The inhibitory role of septic plasma points out that this initial sepsis insult on mitochondrial respiration seems to be mediated by circulating plasma factors, which are not determined yet. Further investigations will allow us to better understand the involved mechanisms in both initial mitochondrial injury and secondary mitochondrial compensation during CARS.",

Based on experimental and sublingual capillaroscopy-based studies, we speculated that both skin disorders are due to skin hypoperfusion and local endothelial dysfunction. The goal of this study was to confirm this hypothesis and to investigate skin endothelial functions in ICU patients admitted for severe infections and to compare forearm and knee skin area. Patients and methods In a prospective monocentric observational study including patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in an 18-bed ICU in a teaching hospital 6 h after resuscitation, we recorded global hemodynamic and organ perfusion parameters, demographic data and severity of illness evaluated by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Skin endothelial functions were evaluated by local administration of acetylcholine by iontophoresis. Iontophoresis is a technique that uses an electric current to transport drugs in ionic form across the skin. In combination with laser Doppler, the vascular reaction was studied by measuring changes in microcirculatory blood flow. Global skin microcirculatory blood flow was measured at the baseline and monitored after acetylcholine challenge during 10 min. The peak of skin blood flow and the area under the curve on both forearm and knee sites were computed. Introduction Microcirculatory disorders leading to tissue hypoperfusion play a central role in the physiopathology of organ failure during septic shock and have been identified as strong outcome predictive factors. It is therefore important to develop accurate parameters at the bedside to evaluate tissue perfusion. The objectives were to evaluate whether Central-to-Toe, Central-to-Knee, Toe-to-Room and Knee-to-Room temperature gradients are related to sepsis severity and could predict ICU outcome in critically ill patients with severe infection. Patients and methods This is a prospective monocentric observational study including patients with severe infections. During a 10-month period, all patients, older than 18 years, admitted for a severe infection were included. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were classified as sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock according to 2001 International Sepsis Definitions conference. Patients were included at admission for patients with sepsis and severe sepsis, and when vasopressors were started (within 24 h of admission) for patients with septic shock. General characteristics of the patients were recorded: demographic data, diagnoses, severity of illness evaluated by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (within the 6 h of inclusion) and Simplified Acute Physiologic Score II (SAPS II). We collected data that reflected macrocirculation and organ perfusion at inclusion, corresponding to admission or vasopressors infusion for septic shock, and at 6, 12 and 24 h after inclusion. Global hemodynamic status was assessed using mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac index. Microcirculatory dysfunction and organ perfusion were assessed through arterial lactate level, urinary output, mottling score and knee capillary refill time. Toe and knee skin temperature were measured using skin temperature sensor applied at patient inclusion and let in place during the first 24 h. Central body temperature was measured with an electronic rectal thermometer, and room temperature was also recorded. Results One hundred and twenty-five patients were enrolled, 22 sepsis, 40 with severe sepsis and 63 with septic shock. Temperature gradients were significantly different according to infection severity; Central-to-Toe and Central-to-Knee temperature gradients increased with disease severity, but Toe-to-Room and Knee-to-Room temperature gradients decreased. During septic shock, mortality due to multi-organ failure (MOF) occurred in 31 % of the cases. After initial resuscitation, Toe-to-Room temperature gradient was significantly lower in the MOF death group than in the survivors (\u22120.3 [\u22121.0; +1.1] vs +2.4 [+0.3; +5.8] \u00b0C, P < 0.01) and differences increased during the first 24 h. There was no correlation between Toe-to-Room temperature gradient and cardiac index or vasopressor doses. However, Toe-to-Room temperature gradient was related to tissue perfusion parameters like arterial lactate level (r = \u22120.42, P = 0.001), urinary output (r = 0.29, P = 0.02), capillary refill time (r = \u22120.39, P = 0.004) and mottling score (P = 0.004). Conclusion Toe-to-Room temperature gradient reflects tissue perfusion at the bedside and is a strong prognosis factor in septic shock patients.",

Patients and methods Eight recipients were prospectively included in ICU, 5 with septic risk: 3 with left ventricular assist device (LVAD), 1 with biventricular assist device and 1 with extracorporeal life support. Infection was controlled in LVAD patients. Expression of mHLA-DR was measured by flow cytometry on whole blood. A single measure was performed between day 12 and day 30 post-HTx. Immune failure was classified according to mHLA-DR expression: severe if antibody bound per cell (AB/C) <5000, marked if 5000-10,000, moderate if 10,000-15,000. Immune response was considered normal up to 20,000 with a grey zone between 15,000 and 20,000. Immunosuppressive therapy was standard. Follow-up was 2 months. Results Five HTx recipients had marked immune failure, and they present neither sepsis nor rejection, patients with LVAD belonged to this group. Two patients had severe immune failure (2700 and 4400 AB/C) and presented nosocomial infections. One patient without immune failure (17,755 AB/C) presented acute antibody-mediated rejection. All patients were discharged from hospital. Conclusion The grading of immune failure according to a single measure of monocytes HLA-DR expression between day 12 and day 30 after HTx is clearly correlated with clinical outcome, infection or rejection. It allows to adapt the immunosuppressive therapy to individual patient immune status. Immune monitoring with several measures mHLA-DR is probably useful in case of sepsis, and it should be investigated in further study. Conclusion POCUS use in pediatric and neonatal ICUs for diagnosis is high and impacts the management of patients, but POCUS use for procedural guidance remains low. Impact of US in PICUs and NICUs seems to be quite similar than in adult population but some more investigations are necessary. Introduction The provision of adequate sedation and analgesia is required in critically ill children to reduce anxiety, pain, and enable synchronization during mechanical ventilation. This is commonly achieved through a combination of opioids and benzodiazepines. Prolonged use of these agents is associated with tolerance and withdrawal. Recent literature suggests that sedation regimens incorporating \u03b12-adrenergic agonists may offer several benefits. In 2013, we introduced a new sedation protocol including clonidine as an adjunctive sedative agent. We aim to report our experience with clonidine used as a sedative in combination with morphine and midazolam and to prevent withdrawal syndrome. Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients admitted in our 20-bed tertiary paediatric intensive care unit between November 2013 and April 2015, who received clonidine. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. We recorded demographic data, indications for intensive care admission, paediatric index of mortality 2, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, morphine and midazolam doses, clonidine indications and doses, side effects, efficacy and withdrawal symptoms. To asses level of sedation in ventilated patients, we used the COMFORT behaviour scale. We hypothesized a potential opioid-and benzodiazepine-sparing effect of clonidine, and we analysed morphine and midazolam consumption during two time periods: 18 months before and 18 months after the introduction of clonidine in the unit. Data are expressed as numerical values and percentages for categorical variables, and as means and standard deviations for continuous variables. Results During the study period, 57 patients received clonidine and 48 were enrolled. Mean age at admission was 2.3 years, 36.9 % were male. Reasons for intensive care admission were mainly respiratory failure (46 %) followed by haemodynamic failure, postoperative care, and neurologic failure. Mean paediatric index of mortality 2 was 10.2 %. Mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 10.2 days. The main reasons for clonidine administration were: increasing morphine and midazolam (>100 \u00b5g/kg/h) requirements (64 %), difficulties in achieving optimal level of sedation (38 %), difficult management of sedation and analgesia in the post-operative period (38 %), preventing withdrawal syndrome after prolonged administration of opioids and benzodiazepines (7.7 %), and treatment of withdrawal syndrome (5.13 %). The mean duration of clonidine infusion was 8 days. Mean COMFORT score value was 15.02 before clonidine was started and 13.69 after beginning of clonidine infusion. The clonidine dose range used was 0.2-2 \u00b5g/kg/h. During clonidine infusion, 4 patients (10.2 %) experienced bradycardia, 3 (7.7 %) hypotension and 5 (12.8 %) both. Fifty-eight per cent of patients who showed haemodynamic instability were less than 1 year old. These effects did not result in increased demand for intravenous fluid or catecholamines. We observed a significant lower consumption of morphine and midazolam after clonidine was introduced. Compared with the 18-month pre-study period, the consumption decreased by 9.3 % for morphine and by 47.1 % for midazolam (calculated as mg/months/hospitalized patients). Discussion Adequate sedation is important in paediatric intensive care. By contrast, oversedation promotes drugs tolerance and withdrawal leading to a delayed recovery. In the effort to reduce prolonged opioid and benzodiazepine exposure, we introduced clonidine in our sedation protocol. We found an acceptable side-effects profile and a clinical efficacy both in ventilated and in non-ventilated patients. Our data also confirm a benzodiazepine and opioid sparing effect of clonidine, with significant reduction in midazolam and morphine consumption. Conclusion The use of clonidine in critically ill children is safe and effective. Clonidine can be beneficial to reduce the complications associated with prolonged use of opioids and benzodiazepines, and in the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndrome. A prospective study is needed to better define the role of clonidine in paediatric intensive care.",

            "text": "Introduction Vancomycin is commonly administered for methicillinresistant staphylococcal infections. Resulting plasmatic vancomycin concentration is associated with clinical outcome. While continuous infusion for adult severe infection was previously described, very poor data related to paediatric population are available. The aim of the present study is to (i) describe and investigate continuous infusion vancomycin therapy in critically ill children; (ii) to assess exposure and proper dosing taking into account estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. Discussion This is the first study to focus on the use of a loading dose of vancomycin followed by continuous infusion in critical ill children. Initial vancomycin loading and continuous doses were very similar among the patients. Loading dose seems adequate to achieve a sufficient vancomycin level, but the following continuous dose was too low to maintain a level >15 mg/L and to achieve the target of AUC24/ MIC-1 > 400 for most of patients. In addition, the various practices in dosing adjustment failed to reach these objectives for half of the patients after several days of therapy initiation. Conclusion Continuous infusion vancomycin therapy in critically ill children dosing as well as adjustments could not to be appropriate and lead to under exposure. Using pharmacokinetics models should be useful to achieve target concentration and AUC. Introduction The fight against nosocomial infections is a public health issue. Nosocomial infections increase patient's morbidity and mortality and are expensive to treat. The risk of nosocomial infection is higher with patients in intensive care unit (ICU) than those hospitalised in conventional unit (respectively, 23 vs 5 % according to the national survey (adult and paediatric) executed in France in 2012 in 1938 institutions). Identified risks factors are mainly due to invasive equipments, such as central venous catheter (CVC). In French paediatric ICU, the incidence of CVC-associated bacteraemia is not described. The aim of this study was to define the incidence of CVC-associated bacteraemia per 1000 CVC-days in a French paediatric ICU (PICU). Patients and methods This study was retrospective, descriptive, and monocentric in a PICU (14 beds) between the 01/01/2012 and the 01/09/2014. Inclusion criteria were patients with 1) a short-or longterm CVC and 2) a bacteraemia during hospitalisation, according to the National Healthcare Safety Network definition. Exclusion criteria were separated into (1) clinical aspect: patient with a bacteraemia related to an other infection site than the CVC (non-CVC-associated bacteraemia) (a) and (2) bacteriological analyses: epidemiological duplicates (b), non-nosocomial bacteraemia (c), bacteraemia induced by a common commensal not cultured from two or more blood cultures, drawn on separate occasions (d), patient without a CVC at the time of the bacteraemia (e). Clinical and biological results were collected by using ICCA \u00ae software (Philips Society) and bacteriological results by using MOLIS \u00ae software (Vision4health Society). Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The CVC utilisation ratio was calculated by dividing the number of CVC-days by the number of patient-days. Results During the time period (33 months), 1898 patients were eligible and 99 patients with 221 bacteraemia were included. The following were excluded: 17 non-CVC-associated bacteraemia (a), 73 epidemiological duplicates (b), 61 non-nosocomial bacteraemia (c), 52 bacteraemia induced by a common commensal not cultured from two or more blood cultures, drawn on separate occasions (d) and 4 bacteraemia in patients without CVC at the time of the bacteraemia (e). For the 1898 patients, the median age was 33 months (IQR 9-113), the median weight was 12 kg (IQR 7-25), the mean PICU length of stay was 5.7 days (SD 18), the mean length of invasive ventilation was 6.4 days (SD 20), and the mortality rate was 4.6 % (87/1898). There was 439 CVC and 14 CVC-associated bacteraemia corresponding to 11 patients. The incidence of CVC-associated bacteraemia was 3.9 per 1000 CVC-days (95 % CI 2.1-6.5). The CVC utilisation ratio was 0.75. Between patients without CVC-infections (n = 366) and patients with CVC-associated bacteraemia (n = 11), the median PICU length of stay and the median length of invasive ventilation were statistically longer for patients with CVC-associated bacteraemia (respectively, p = 0.0001 and p = 0.025). There was no statistical difference concerning the age and the mortality between the two groups. Ann. Intensive Care 2016, 6(Suppl 1):S50 Discussion According to the National Healthcare Safety Network report realised in 2011 in 300 medical and surgical PICU in the USA, the incidence of CVC-associated bacteraemia was 1.8 per 1000 days with short-and long-term CVC [median (IQR) 1.3 (0.0-2.6) and 90th percentile 4.1]. Our results are closer to the 90th percentile of this American study. However in our study, the CVC utilisation ratio was higher (0.75 vs 0.47 in the National Healthcare Safety Network study), showing a longer use of CVC and therefore an increased risk of presenting a CVC-associated bacteraemia during hospitalisation. Conclusion This study helped define the incidence of CVC-associated bacteraemia in a French paediatric intensive care unit and to find the measurement tools required for an automised extraction of the data. The prospect is to create an informatic tool allowing a continuous surveillance of the CVC-associated bacteraemia in a paediatric intensive care unit.",

Outborn neonates with RDS may require mechanical ventilation (MV) and surfactant therapy before their transportation to the tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). High-frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV) has previously been used for management of RDS in neonates hospitalized in NICU. The aim of the present study was to assess the feasibility and safety of HFPV for the management of neonatal RDS during transportation. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective observational monocentric study from September 2008 to August 2011. All outborn neonates requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for RDS before their transportation were included. Neonates with severe malformations and those transported after 48 h of life were not included. When required, HFPV was provided by the Sinusoidal Bronchotron \u2122 device (IMAPe \u00ae ). For each infant, we recorded the mode of mechanical ventilation (conventional vs. HFPV), the evolution of SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, and maternal and neonatal characteristics. Our main outcome was SpO 2 / FiO 2 ratio, 1 h after initiation of either conventional mechanical ventilation or HFPV (M60). The comparison was stratified by range of gestational age: <28, 28-31, 32-37, >37 weeks GA. In order to examine SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in relation to mode of ventilation, we defined potential confounding variables: baseline SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio observed at the initiation of MV, obstetrical, maternal and neonatal characteristics. Categorical variables were compared using Chi square or Fisher's test as needed while continuous variables were compared using Student's t test. For main outcome, a multivariate analysis was performed using linear regression. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Out of the 169 neonates included in the study, 57 received HFPV while 112 were placed on conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV). Univariate analysis for obstetrical, demographic and neonatal data showed no statistical difference between HFPV and CMV group whatever the gestational age, except for Apgar score at 1\u2032 and 5\u2032 which was significantly lower in the neonates aged 37 weeks or more and receiving HFPV. In 28-31 and 32-37 weeks subgroups, baseline SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was found significantly lower in infants receiving HFPV and this ratio remained lower after 1 h of ventilation. In the more mature infants, HFPV was associated with a higher increase in SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio when compared to CMV, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. After multivariate analysis, the main determinant for SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at M60 was the baseline value of this ratio. Noteworthy that complications usually associated with mechanical ventilation were not reported in this study. Discussion This observational study emphasizes the feasibility and safety of HFPV in neonatal transportation. The use of both HFPV and CMV resulted in favorable respiratory outcome. The significant initial lower values of SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in neonates between 28 and 37 weeks requiring HFPV may be explained by the retrospective design of the study. It is indeed reasonable to suspect that the more severe forms of RDS were immediately ventilated with HPFV. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the feasibility and safety of HFPV during neonatal transportation. More studies are necessary to confirm these results and define the indications for HFPV. Introduction To describe the time course of lymphocytes in children with severe infectious shock and to search for an association between persistent lymphopenia, initial severity and risk for nosocomial infection. Patients and methods This monocentric retrospective study enrolled all children aged less than 18, admitted to PICU for severe infectious shock between January 2011 and September 2014, excluding immunosuppressed and died within the first day. Results are expressed in percentages, medians and interquartile ranges. Fisher's exact test was used to compare groups. Results One hundred and six patients were analysed: 27 (25.4 %) with severe sepsis (S), 42 (39.6 %) with septic shock (SS) and 37 (34.9 %) with toxic shock (TS). Eight cases were fatal (7.5 %) and 15 patients developed a nosocomial infection (14.2 %). Initial lymphopenia was found, respectively, in 17 (63 %), 35 (83.3 %) and 36 (97.3 %) children with S, SS and TS. Day3 lymphopenia was found in 6 (22.2 %), 19 (45.2 %) and 13 (35.1 %) patients, respectively. Only 6 patients (5.6 %) presented neutropenia. An association was found between initial severity scores (PIM2, PELOD2, Goldstein) and initial lymphopenia. The most severe patients were more prone to develop day 3 lymphopenia. The rate of nosocomial infections was 10 % in the group without day 3 lymphopenia compared to 23 % in the day 3 lymphopenia group (p = 0.14). Conclusion Initial lymphopenia in children with infectious shock was linked to initial severity of shock, and the most severe patients were more at risk of day 3 lymphopenia. The higher rate of nosocomial infections found in children with day 3 lymphopenia should be confirmed in a larger study.",

One-third of the envenomed population corresponds to children under the age of 15 years which is constitute a vulnerable population group and consequently displayed greater frequency of serious complications. The cardiogenic shock that accompanies the motion of enzymes affects the prognostic of this pathology and grafts pediatric patients with a significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study was to analyze the correlation between admission troponin levels and patient outcomes. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study, spread over a period of 2 years (2012-2013) and conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit of a University Hospital Mohammed VI Marrakech. We included all patients admitted to pediatric intensive care unit for scorpion envenomation. The management of patients was codified according to a national protocol, and the troponin level was assessed in all the patients on admission. The cutoff level is 0.003 UI/L. The statistical program used was SPSS version 21. Results Among the 252 of envenomed children, the troponin assay is performed for 172 cases (68.2 %). Males were predominant, and the mean age was 6 years. On admission, 24.5 % of patients had a pulmonary edema, and 21.8 % of patients had signs of collapse. Neurological manifestations were observed in 36.4 % of patients. Troponin levels were positive in 69.8 % on admission. All patient received dobutamine, 15 % of them epinephrine with or without noradrenaline, while 18 % of patients required mechanical ventilation. The average length of stay in hospitals was 50 h. Favorable evolution was noted in 901 %. The correlation between the troponin levels and the severity of clinical situation, the need for mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, the length of hospitalization and the unfavorable evolution is positive and statistically significant. Conclusion As a myocardial enzyme marker, the troponin levels seem to be an interesting element in the immediate assessment of patients with severe envenomation and in the identification of people at risk.",

Pediatric guidelines have highlighted the lack of pediatric literature on the effectiveness of hyperosmolar agents in TBI management and stressed the need for further studies to support their use. The specific objective of this study was to describe the use of hyperosmolar therapy in pediatric TBI and examine its effect on intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). In addition, the study will aid in assessing feasibility and preparation of a future controlled trial. Patients and methods A retrospective revue of all TBI patients admitted to CHU Sainte-Justine between 2007 and 2014 was conducted. Eligible patients were age 1 month to 18 years old, had severe TBI as defined by GCS \u2264 8 on admission, and were admitted to the critical care unit. Specific inclusion criteria were invasive intracranial pressure monitoring and administration of a hyperosmolar agent within 48 h of admission to pediatric intensive care unit. Hyperosmolar agents included boluses of 20 % mannitol or 3 % hypertonic saline received after ICP placement. For the first 2 boluses received for increased ICP (>20 mmHg), the impact on ICP and CPP was assessed during the following 4 h. Co-interventions to control ICP (additional hyperosmolar agent, propofol or barbiturate bolus), diuresis and serum sodium were also documented. Missing values at 4th hour (n = 3 values) for ICP and CCP were treated by imputation. Repeated measure ANOVA was used for analysis of trending mean ICP and CPP post bolus, with significance set at p = 0.05. Results Sixty-four patients were eligible, of which 16 met inclusion criteria. Average age was 11 years (SD \u00b1 4), and median GCS was 6 (range 4-7). Thirteen patients were stabilized in another center prior to transfer, and median time from Trauma to ICP monitor was 8.5 h (range 7-12 h). Average number of hyperosmolar boluses per patient was 6.6 (SD \u00b1 3.4) over 48 h; 70 % of these were 3 % hypertonic saline and 30 % were 20 % mannitol. There was no difference in patient characteristics between the two groups. For the first two boluses received, both mannitol and hypertonic saline were followed by a decrease in ICP in the following 4-h period (mannitol n = 8, p < 0.05 and hypertonic saline n = 14, p < 0.05), see Table 29 . There was no significant change in CPP post-bolus (mannitol p = 0.8 and hypertonic saline p = 0.4). Eleven patients received a co-intervention to decrease ICP within the 4 h post-hyperosmolar agent. Diuresis was not significantly increased post-mannitol or hypertonic saline. Conclusion In pediatric TBI patients with intracranial hypertension, mannitol and hypertonic saline are commonly used, and we did not identify clear determinants of the choice of the solute. The use of both agents was associated with a reduction in ICP. The sample size, retrospective design and non-randomized choice of the treatment limit further interpretation. This study provides an important basis for the development of a future controlled, prospective study, which is needed to determine the respective effects of mannitol and hypertonic saline on intracranial hypertension in pediatric TBI. The high proportion of non-eligible patients and frequent co-interventions will be potential barriers of crucial importance in such trial. Introduction Cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) in children is a rare disorder. However, it is increasingly recognized and diagnosed in children with the advent of new technical means both the imaging plane as clinically, allowing an early and adapted medical care. Patients and methods It is a retrospective and descriptive study based on cases of children hospitalized over 7 years from January 2008 to December 2014. All children having a CSVT in the imagery were included. Results Seven cases were reported. The mean age was 5.3 years, with predominance in males (sex ratio = 1.3). 71.4 % of case with CSVT presented with an underlying disease: The infection was most frequently noted in all age groups (57.1 %), the dehydration is more common in infants (28.57 %), and the Behcet's disease in 14.2 % of cases. The CVST were acute in 57 % of cases, subacute in 42.8 % of cases, with a polymorph clinical expression: intracranial hypertension syndrome (42.8 %), seizures (42.8 %), focal neurologic signs (85.7 %) and disturbances of consciousness (71.4 %). The CVST diagnosis was made by a cerebral CT (computed tomography) (direct or indirect signs) in 71.4 % of case and by a CT angiography (when CT was non conclusive) in 51.4 % of cases. The superficial venous systems was involved in 42.8 % of cases and extended in 28.5 % of cases. The antithrombin therapy was prescribed in 28.5 % of children, corticosteroid therapy in 14.2 % of cases and an etiologic treatment (antibiotic treatment for cases involving infection + correction of rehy-dration\u2026) in 85.7 % of cases. The evolution was favorable in 28.5 % of cases. Death occurred in 14 % of cases, and 42.8 % of children kept neurological sequelae damage. Conclusion Compared to the data of the literature, the CVST is characterized by the large diversity of clinical presentations and etiologies. The small number of patients who received a treatment by antithrombotic does not provide a conclusion based on statistically solid results. However, the prognosis remains dreadful against the death risk and the sensorineural sequelae. Introduction pCRRT use has grown in recent years in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and with the demands for adequate intensive care staffing levels. Because pCRRT number per year is low, the weight range of patients is very large (from <3 to >60 kg), and the turnover of nurses is high, the provision of a safe and sustainable pCRRT service, is a big challenge in PICUs. A pCRRT working group was created in August 2014 to perform a training programme and to go with a switch in CRRT device. We evaluated this programme after the first operating year. Materials and methods Staff (doctors and nurses) training programme was organised twice a year (2 sessions each time). Each session (7 h and 30 min) consisted of theoretical aspects of CRRT and practical simulation (low-fidelity) with peer feedback about assembly and troubleshooting of alarms and presentation of new visual tools. Fifty-two nurses (80 %) with more than 6-month experiences were trained during the first year. Results A test (n = 29 nurses) was realised in September to evaluate theory and practical knowledge (6 months after the last session). Questions concerning theory of pCRRT were correct in 38 % and incomplete in 45.7 %. Questions about alarms management had the lowest ratio of correct answers with only 16.5 and 61.4 % of incomplete answer. However, a majority was more confident to manage children on pCRRT after theoretical teaching (72.1 %) and simulation (86.2 %). Conclusion Post-programme assessment was positive, but anxiety about knowledge and practice persisted. Consolidation of skills and implementation of the training course with high-fidelity simulation, especially alarms management scenario, will be interesting to offer the opportunity for doctors and nurses to progress into expert CRRT users in PICU.",

Ideally, neonates or children candidates for ECMO support should be transferred to a referral ECMO center. However, sometimes patients are too ill to be safely moved with conventional ventilator support. In these situations, ECMO cannulation at the referring facility and transfer by a transport ECMO team is a potentially lifesaving intervention. With a 25-year experience on neonatal and pediatric ECMO, the pediatric intensive care unit and the pediatric surgery unit of the Armand-Trousseau Hospital in Paris developed in November 2014 a transport ECMO team.

Reviewed data included referring facility, mode and duration of transport, type of ECMO, clinical severity score (PaO 2 /FiO 2 , inotrope score) and laboratory tests (lactate, pH) before and after transport. Results Twenty-two requests for intervention of the mobile team were received. In 8 cases, the team intervention was not deemed necessary or exceeded status. In 14 cases, the mobile team travelled to the referring center. In one case the child was transported on conventional ventilation, and in 2 patients ECMO cannulation was not possible because of vascular problems. Eleven patients, including 4 neonates and 7 children, were transported on ECMO support. One patient was cannulated in our PICU and then transported to a pulmonary transplantation center. Introduction Synthetic cathinones, beta-keto-amphetamine derivates, are new psychoactive and stimulant substances with exponentially increasing use since 10 years. Bath salts, often sold legally, contain mixtures of several cathinones like 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and mephedrone (4MMC). Toxicity of combination of two cathinones, mimicking their real use in humans, has never been studied. Our objective was to investigate possible synergy of MDPV/4MMC combination on their stimulant effects in the Sprague-Dawley rat and analyze their mechanisms of interaction. Materials and methods MDPV and 4MMC were synthesized in our laboratory. The effects of MDPV/3MMC mixture (administered by the intragastric route) were studied on rat locomotor activity in an openfield using videotaping. Plasma concentrations of MDPV, 4MMC and their 3 major metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Brain monoamine concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fluorometry. For each animal and each time, we calculated the difference between the parameter value at that time and baseline and the area under the curve of its time course. Comparisons were made using two-way ANOVA followed by posttests using Bonferroni correction. Pharmacokinetics (PK) was modeled and parameters calculated using WinNonlin \u00ae software. Results MDPV (3 mg/kg)/4MMC (30 mg/kg) combination was responsible for a significant increase in rat locomotor activity in comparison with saline, MDPV and 4MMC alone (p = 0.02), with a synergic interaction between the two drugs. 4MMC PK was not altered in the presence of MDPV, while MDPV absorption was reduced in the presence of 3MMC without significant modifications in its half-life and clearance. The neurochemical study revealed significant increase in dopamine and serotonin but not in norepinephrine concentrations in the prefrontal cortex, when combining both drugs in comparison with each drug administered separately.",

            "text": "Conclusion MDPV/4MMC mixture as found in bath salts significantly increases locomotor activity in rats in comparison with each substance administered alone. Mechanisms of interaction include significant decrease in MDPV gastrointestinal absorption and significant increase in monoamine reuptake inhibition in the brain with reinforcement of both the dopaminergic and serotonergic profiles. However, further investigations at the level of the involved gastrointestinal transporters and monoamine transporters are required. Muscarinic syndrome was present in 100 % of cases, followed by nicotinic syndrome (60 %) and then encephalic syndrome (20 %). The most frequent complications were acute pancreatitis (16 %), circulatory failure (13 %) and pulmonary edema (5 %). Mechanical ventilation was required for thirteen patients for neurological distress (n = 10) and respiratory distress (n = 3). The serum acetylcholinesterasic activity (AChE) rate was 571 \u00b1 1399 UI/l (Nl 5000-12,000 UI/l), and the erythrocyte acetylcholinesterasic (AChE-Er) rate was 3 \u00b1 1 UI/ml (Nl 6-9 UI/ml of red blood cell). Pralidoxime was given to 25 patients (treated group) over 24 h as bolus of 5 mg/kg and continuous infused dose of 50 mg/kg. The comparison between the treated group and the control showed no difference in complications occurrence, requiring atropine dose, mechanical ventilation necessity and prognosis. Conclusion The regimens of pralidoxime use in the present study do not seem to be necessary in moderate dichlorvos poisoning. Introduction 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), a synthetic cathinone with important reported toxicity and high abuse potential, has been increasingly used since the last 5 years. To date, scarce experimental studies have investigated MDPV-related behavioral effects. We aimed at studying MDPV-related neurobehavioral effects according to various modalities of administration, mimicking human uses. Materials and methods Sprague-Dawley rat investigation of MDPVinduced effects on the locomotor activity, anxiety (openfield), resignation (forced swimming), memory (Y-maze), hedonic status (sucrose consumption) and brain neurochemistry (monoamines content in the prefrontal cortex), using three different administration patterns including acute (3 mg/kg IP), binge-like (MDPV 3 mg/kg IP, 3 times per day, 3 days) and prolonged treatment (MDPV 1 mg/kg IP, 10 days). Plasma concentrations of MDPV and its two major metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography coupled to highresolution mass spectrometry. Brain monoamine concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to fluorometry. For each animal and each time, we calculated the difference between the parameter value at that time and baseline and the area under the curve of its time course. Comparisons were made using two-way ANOVA followed by posttests using Bonferroni correction. Results Acute MDPV administration was responsible for locomotor hyperactivity with onset of stereotypies, significant decrease in anxiety, anhedonic status and memory impairment (p < 0.05 for each neurobehavioral measurement). Following binge-like MDPV administration, tolerance to immediate locomotor effects after drug withdrawal and significant decrease in anxiety, hedonic status and food consumption were observed (p < 0.05 for each neurobehavioral measurement). Increase in the prefrontal cortex serotonin levels occurred, in accordance with the observed behavioral effects. Prolonged MDPV treatment resulted in tolerance development after 1 week of drug withdrawal. Conclusion Our results suggest MDPV-induced marked neurobehavioral effects in the rat with the development of tolerance after bingelike and prolonged repeated administration.",

Clinical symptoms worsen by coingestants, especially hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas in 9.2 % of cases (n = 7), hypotension and bradycardia with cardiotropics (n = 2). Digestive decontamination was performed for 17.5 % of patients (n = 13): gastric lavage (n = 9) and activated charcoal in a single dose (n = 5). Conservative therapies were sufficient in 96 % of cases. The hemodialysis was performed only for three cases with severe acidosis. The median of hospital stay was 24 [18; 38] h. There was no death in our cases. Discussion The prevalence of metformin poisoning is 6.4 % of hospitalizations in our center. Lactic acidosis, due to impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory function, is the most serious complication. But it was often spontaneously reversible with conservative therapies in our patients. These favorable outcomes may be explained by the absence of previous chronic conditions in our population. Conclusion Metformin overdose is characterized by digestive symptoms and high plasma lactate levels. Although lactic acidosis is considered to be a serious condition, it was easily managed with conservative therapy. Discussion L. pneumophila CAP remains a serious condition frequently requiring admission to the ICU, with hemodynamic, ventilatory, and renal support, particularly those with preexisting lung disease. Some of these patients also required specific therapies such as inhaled NO, prone positioning, and glucocorticoids. Patients admitted to the ICU were also severely hypoxemic. Conclusion High plasma urea, band forms, and a multilobar pneumonia are independent risk factors for ICU admission in patients presenting with L. pneumophila CAP. In contrast, the CURB65 score did not identify high-risk patients. Mortality of patients admitted to the ICU was 3.1 times higher than that of patients admitted to the ward.",

            "text": "Introduction Leptospirosis is a major public health concern in Reunion Island and in the other French overseas territories. The clinical manifestations are extremely varied (from flu-like condition to multiorgan failure), and significant mortality is described in some parts of the world. The pulmonary forms have a major impact on patients' prognosis. The objective of this study is to describe characteristics of patients with leptospirosis presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) criteria, therapeutic approach and mortality risk factors in this specific population. Introduction Leptospirosis is the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world. Its incidence is particularly important in the French overseas territories, including Guadeloupe. This study aims to characterize organ failures in patients with severe forms of leptospirosis. Patients and methods This is a retrospective study conducted between November 2009 and November 2014 in the ICU of Pointe \u00e0 Pitre University Hospital in Guadeloupe. All patients admitted to intensive care during this period with a confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis were included. We collected demographic, physiological, biological and radiographic data for each patients as well as sequential assessment of SOFA score of each organ on D1, D3, D6, D9, D12 and D15. Severe organ failure was defined by a SOFA score of 3 or 4. Univariate analysis was performed to identify organ failures associated with mortality. Results Sixty-one patients were included, of whom 90.2 % were male, with a median age of 54 years [41-66]. A severe organ failure was met in renal, liver, hematological and hemodynamic failure in 66, 58, 53 and 39 % of the patients, respectively. Mechanical ventilation was needed in 38 % patients, renal replacement therapy in 48 % and vasoactive drugs in 52 %. ICU and hospital mortality were 20 % and 23 M %, respectively. In univariate analysis, factors associated with hospital mortality were SASP II, chronic hypertension, hyperlactatemia, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Organ dysfunctions associated with mortality are given in Table 30 . Conclusion Organ failure predominantly met in severe forms of leptospirosis is kidney, liver and hematological failure as historically described in Weils triade. All but respiratory failure at day 1 is associated with mortality but none of them at day 3. Introduction Treatment of pre-eXtensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (pre-XDR-TB, i.e., resistant to isoniazid, rifampicin and fluoroquinolone or second-line injectables) and eXtensively drugresistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB, i.e., resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectables) is a challenge because it needs a networking and a specific organization of care, to avoid the spread of mycobacteria, like it is specified in several reports, like that of the Haut Conseil de Sant\u00e9 Publique of December 2014. Pre-XDR and XDR-TB patients are managed in our university medical ICU, in negative pressure containment rooms with reverse air. We report our experience for the management of this population of pre-XDR and XDR-TB patients. Patients and methods We collected data carried on pre-and XDR-TB patients hospitalized in our university medical ICU, between July 2012 and July 2015: epidemiology, tuberculosis and treatment history, indication of surgery if required, events during post-surgery period, delay of sputum smear conversion and mortality. Results Twenty-one tuberculosis patients were hospitalized in our ICU since 3 years: 11 XDR-TB (52 %) and 10 pre-XDR-TB (48 %). Two lived in France since more than 10 years, while others came from the Caucasus. The mean age was 34.8 \u00b1 9 years. The body mass index was 19.75 \u00b1 4.12. Fourteen percentage did not receive any treatment before the diagnosis in France; 86 % received at least five antibiotics molecules and on average 7.93; the mean period of antibiotic treatment before ICU admission was 112 \u00b1 74 days. On admission, 6 patients (39 %) had converted their sputum smear. Among the 21 patients, 5 were admitted for vascular access complications and 1 for acute respiratory distress. Fifteeen patients (71 %) were admitted for surgical reasons: The using of surgery was decided because the sputum cultures remained positive for 66 % of them and for irreversible pulmonary damages in the other cases. The surgery consisted of a lobectomy for 9 patients and pneumonectomy for 6 patients. One patient had a life-threatening complication during the surgery (bleeding by artery wound). Thirteen (87 %) were extubated in few hours, while 2 patients have been intubated for 6 and 20 days. During the immediate post-surgery period, 2 patients experienced an extra-pulmonary complication, while 4 had postoperative complication: 2 atelectasis, treated with medical care, 1 fistula and 1 pleural bleeding, needed a second surgery. Among the 21 patients, 5 were admitted for vascular access complication and 1 for acute respiratory distress. Ninety-five percentage of patients were alive on leaving the ICU. For now, 1 medical patient died because of a septic shock; 2 surgical patients (13 %) died, 3 (20 %) are cured, 1 is lost sight and 8 (53 %) are always under treatment and are followed. Among 10 surgical patients whose sputum smear remained positive, 9 converted their sputum smear in a median time of 45 days. Among 5 medical patients, the median sputum smear conversion was observed in 143 days after the beginning of treatment. Among every patient, there was no complication attributable to the specific organization of care, in particular the conditions of containment. Conclusion The management of pre-and XDR-tuberculosis patients is binding, time-consuming and resources consuming, needing a very specific organization of care. Experience shows that an ICU stay does not generate more complications for these tuberculosis patients and can improve their global outcome.

It took place within the reanimation multiservice room of the provincial general referral hospital of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (August 2013 through September 2015). All the consecutive patients, of over 15 years of age, admitted for tetanus management during the study period were included, without any selection. Patients with kidney failure, shock or well known as allergic to magnesium sulfate were all excluded. Apart from the treatment of muscular spasm, all the patients in both groups were identically managed in accordance with their usual treatment as provided by the unit. The collected data were performed retrospectively from the medical forms of all the control patients and prospectively for the study group. The decisional main criterion was the total end of muscular spasm for effectiveness delay and the occurring frequency of adverse reactions for tolerance. The statistical data were obtained via SPSS software 21.0. This study was recorded at the Ethical Office of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa, approval date: ESP/CE/043/2014. Results Between the two groups, all the patients globally presented the same features. The average age was 31.54 y-o \u00b1 16.56, and 72 % of those patients were males. The complete spasm stops were obtained in short course when treated by magnesium sulfate (5.8d \u00b1 1.5 vs 9.8d \u00b1 2.6; p = 0.000). The occurrence of respiratory depression was minimally observed in the category treated by magnesium sulfate (19 vs 46.3 %, p = 0.001). This situation clearly showed the decrease use of mechanically based ventilation (12.7 vs 35.8 %, p = 0.002). Moreover, the duration of stay in resuscitation room decreased for this category (9.3d \u00b1 1.8 vs 22.6d \u00b1 10.1; p = 0.000), with the reduced risk of sepsis (14.3 vs 31.3 %; p = 0.023). Finally, the hospital mortality of any origin was also significantly weak for this group of patients treated by magnesium sulfate (25.4 vs 50.7 %; p = 0.004). Conclusion During our study, the balance profit risk was favorable to magnesium sulfate comparatively with diazepam. This molecule, even though slightly expensive, requires a good monitoring and frequent and rigorous control of tendinous reflexes, the respiratory beats, as well as the diuresis in order to primarily detect any overdosage.",

We compared with reports on the 2014 West African outbreak with previous publications and describe historical trends in monitoring, treatment and prognosis. Results Since 1976, monitoring and treatment of patients treated within Ebola treatment units have not evolved. Monitoring of vital signs after the day of admission is never documented. Supportive care measures, such as fluid and electrolyte therapy, titrated to compensate losses, are also not mentioned. Survival has not significantly improved over time. In contrast, in another filovirus infection, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, which is very like Ebola fever, mortality rate was approximately 25 % in Germany (1967), but approximately 80 % in sub-Saharan Africa. Discussion As reported, monitoring and treatment of patients isolated in Ebola treatment units have not evolved since early reports. This potentially explains why mortality rates have remained high. Failure to ensure proper monitoring of vital signs and correction of fluid losses and electrolytes anomalies appears suboptimal and misaligned with clinical description of severe shock that are consistent across time. Expert recommendations for monitoring and treatment remain unchanged since 1976. Our inability to comply with these recommendations in Africa may explain why outcomes are poor, whereas survival was much higher, even during early outbreaks, in Europe. Conclusion Improving the delivery of care for the next outbreak or a resurgence of the current Ebola fever outbreak will require that we collectively address the issues of accountability. Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains a significant complication of mechanically ventilated patients. VAP is associated with costs, increased duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), ICU stay and mortality. Our project aimed at decreasing the incidence of VAP using a multifaceted quality program, a bundle of care composed of 10 measures introduced stepwise, including selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD) with topical antibiotics. Patients and methods The incidence density of VAP (number of VAP/1000 ventilation days in patients ventilated for \u226548 h) was measured monthly before the introduction of the VAP bundle (baseline period, 8 months) and every month thereafter (implementation period, 11 months). VAP was diagnosed as \"probable\" if the patient had clinical, biological, and radiological signs of pneumonia (CPIS \u2265 6), and a potential pathogen in tracheal aspirates after 48 h of MV. VAP was \"certain\" if a pathogen was cultured \u226510E3 in BAL fluid obtained by a protected Combicath \u00ae catheter or \u226510E4 by bronchoscopy. The bundle was introduced sequentially in blocks: first block: hand hygiene, bed head >30\u00b0, oral care using chlorhexidine mouth wash, daily evaluation of separation from the ventilator, daily awakenings, early mobilization, and use of the Combicath \u00ae to diagnose VAP; second block: implementation of endotracheal tubes with subglottic aspiration and cuff pressure maintained \u226530 cmH2O using an automatic controller; third block: SOD administration TID containing colistin, tobramycine and nystatin. Small groups teaching allowed to train >90 % of the caregivers to the bundle within 3 months after the beginning of the implementation period. The compliance of the nurses to each measure of the VAP bundle was assessed 4 days per week during all study period in all intubated patients. A prevalence study of antibiotic resistance in stool bacteria was performed each month in all ICU patients. Results Episodes of intubations \u226548 h were 318 (baseline period) and 468 (implementation period). The compliance of nurses to the elements of bundles significantly increased during the implementation period for bed head >30\u00b0, oral care, cuff pressure \u226530 cmH 2 O, evaluation of extubability, daily awakenings, use of subglottic endotracheal tube, and use of SOD. The monthly incidence density of VAP (\"probable\" + \"certain\" VAPs) was 21.5 \u00b1 7.8 before versus 10.8 \u00b1 5.6 VAP/1000 days of ventilation after the implementation of the bundle (p = 0.003). During the last 4 months, after the introduction of the SOD, the incidence density of VAP was 5.3 \u00b1 1.4 VAP/1000 ventilation days. The number of first episode of VAP fell from 20.1 to 9 % (p < 0.0001). The median duration of mechanical ventilation in patients intubated \u226548 h fell from 7.14 (before) to 6.36 (after) days (p = 0.004). The use of Combicath \u00ae to diagnose VAP increased from 54 (before) to 81 % (after, p = 0.003), with a concomitant increase in \"certain\" VAP diagnoses, from 56 to 88 % (p = 0.001). In monthly prevalence studies, the rate of fecal multiresistant bacteria was similar before and after the beginning of the SOD. Discussion The implementation of VAP bundles based on measures recognized to prevent the development of VAP has invariably shown to decrease the incidence of VAP. Herein, we show that it is possible to significantly decrease the incidence density of VAP using a block of \"classical\" preventive measures, including the use of endotracheal tubes with subglottic aspiration and cuff pressure controller. The addition of SOD to the preventive measures was associated with further decrease of the VAP incidence density, constantly below 10 VAP/1000 ventilation days since SOD introduction. This resulted in a significant decrease in the duration of mechanical ventilation in this patient population. The increase in the use of Combicath \u00ae in patients suspect of having VAP resulted in an increase of the diagnosis of \"certain\" VAP. Conclusion A multifaceted program implementing sequentially measures known to prevent VAP was able to significantly decrease the incidence of VAP by more than half and to significantly decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation.",

            "text": "We conducted a before-after study including all the patients admitted to our ICU and submitted to MV for at least 48 h during the \"before\" (April 1 to December 31, 2013) and the \"intervention\" period (April, 1 to December 31, 2014). Standard care in our ICU relied on basic oral care with chlorhexidine 0.5 % 6 times a day. Intervention consisted on the implementation of a new oral care kit including tooth brushing and oral cleansing solution containing chlorhexidine 0.12 % (Q-Care \u00ae , Sage products, Cary, IL). Other infection control interventions were not modified between the 2 study periods. VAP occurrence was recorded prospectively during both periods as well as relevant clinical data. The primary outcome was VAP density of incidence expressed as the number of episodes/1000 MV days. The secondary outcomes were ICU LOS and mortality. Results Three hundred and three patients (2714 MV days) and 304 patients (3032 MV days) were analyzed during the \"before\" and the \"intervention\" periods, respectively. According to the study period, they were comparable regarding age, gender, main diagnosis and SAPS II value. Fifty-eight VAP episodes were recorded before the intervention as compared to 41 after. As a result, VAP incidence was significantly lower after intervention (13.5 vs. 21.4/1000 MV-days; odds ratio = 0.63 [0.42-0.94], 95 % CI; p = 0.029). However, neither LOS (9.9 [13.0] vs. 8.7 [10.4] ; p = 0.21) nor mortality (39.1 vs. 33.0 %; p = NS) was significantly reduced. Conclusion Implementation of a new oral care kit including tooth brushing in our ICU was likely to significantly reduce VAP incidence, highlighting the need for a tight control of oral hygiene in the patients subjected to MV, as part of VAP prevention bundles. Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent nosocomial infection in the ICU and has a clear impact on patient outcome (duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay and mortality). The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted VAP prevention program on VAP rates in a medical-surgical ICU in a secondary care hospital. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective observational monocentric study for two 6-month study period (from January to June, 2013 and 2014). All patients admitted in the ICU for more than 48 h were included. The \"Bundle\" program involved all healthcare workers and included educational sessions, direct observations with performance feedback, and reminders. The bundle focused on a few number of targeted measures: Subglottic aspiration, tracheal cuff pressure monitoring, gastric overdistension avoidance, backrest elevation, chlorhexidine oral hygiene, nonessential tracheal suction elimination, sedation protocols, hand hygiene and glove and gown use. VAP was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological criteria and quantitative cultures of distal specimens. The primary outcome was the VAP rate. Secondary outcomes included compliance rates with bundle measures, patient outcome and risk factors for VAP in our population. Results We included 189 patients in 2013 and 171 in 2014. Patient characteristics and comorbidities were similar between the two study periods (average age 62 years, average IGS2 = 44.8, average SOFA max = 6.35). Our population was composed of 64 % of medical patients, with 40 % of them admitted for respiratory failure as main diagnosis. Our ICU also had trauma patients, with 6 % of them admitted for severe head injury. Compliance with preventive measures significantly increased between the study periods (overall compliance: 2.2 % versus 38.8 %; p < 0.001). Among intubated patients (105 in 2013, 108 in 2014), mechanical ventilation duration was higher during the intervention period (9.7 \u00b1 6.9 vs 7.4 \u00b1 5.5 days; p < 0.05). Baseline and intervention VAP rates were 18.7 and 24.4 per 1000 ventilator days, respectively (p = 0.71). However, duration of mechanical ventilation without VAP was longer in the intervention group (8.7 \u00b1 7.5 vs 6.9 \u00b1 5.0 days; p < 0.05). VAP risk factors in our population were: ARDS, severe head injury, duration of mechanical ventilation. The only protective factor was antibiotic therapy at admission. Conclusion A multifaceted bundle program for VAP prevention did not reduce VAP rates but increased duration of mechanical ventilation without VAP and had a significant effect on VAP prevention measures adherence. Introduction Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and mostly caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) bathing on HAI and MDR bacteria acquisition incidence rates. Patients and methods This observational prospective study was conducted in an ICU over a 10-month period, divided into two 5-month periods: a control period (CP: September 9, 2013, to January 30, 2014) during which patients were bathed in the traditional manner with soap and water, an intervention period (IP: September 9, 2014, to January 30, 2015) during which patients were bathed daily with 2 % CHX-impregnated wipes. Incidence rates of ICU-acquired bloodstream infection (BSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter colonization, and MDR bacteria acquisition were collected and compared among the 2 study periods. Results Two hundred and fifty-three patients were included in the study with 121 during the CP and 132 during the IP. Age, sex, SAPSII score, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay did not differ significantly across the 2 periods. ICU-acquired BSI rates per 100 patients were 7.6 in IP versus 12.4 in CP (p = 0.2). Infections rates stratified by type were as follows: catheter-associated BSI: 3 cases in CP and none in IP; VAP per 100 ventilated patients: 19.5 in IP and 16.3 in CP (p = 0.6). During the CP, BSIs (15) were caused in 41 % of cases by gram-positive, in 35 % by gram-negative species, and in 24 % by fungi. During the IP, BSIs (10) were caused in 50 % of cases by gram-positive, in 40 % by gram-negative, and in 10 % by fungi. Rates of colonized central lines per 100 catheters were 1.8 in IP versus 5.5 in CP (p = 0.07). MDR bacteria acquisition rates were 6.1 and 9.1 % in IP and CP, respectively (p = 0.33). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta lactamase bacteria, MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii accounted, respectively, for acquisition incidence rates per 100 patients of 0.8, 4.9, 3.3, 2.5 and 2.3, 2.3, 1.5, 0 % in CP and IP; differences were not statistically significative. Overall mortality rates of patients of CP and IP were 22 and 17 %, respectively. Conclusion CHX daily cleansing did not induce a significant but only a slight reduction of ICU-acquired BSI, catheter colonization, and MDR bacteria acquisition incidence rates. Further and larger studies are required to confirm its effect as a component of an infection prevention bundle in ICU settings. Introduction Multi-drug-resistant pathogens, and specifically thirdgeneration cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, represent a major issue in hospital. In intensive care unit (ICU), Gram-negative pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics by production of extendedspectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) are responsible for longer hospitalizations and poorer outcomes. The epidemiology of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (PE) has been recently modified by the emergence of new ESBL. In the absence of new broad-spectrum molecules, it is crucial to control antibiotic consumption and prevent transmission between ICU patients. Our 12-bed ICU is made of three units of 2 twin bedrooms each so that recommendations on contact precautions cannot be thoroughly followed, since patients cannot be isolated in a single room. In our unit, contact precautions focus on hand washing with hydro-alcoholic solutions, on wearing a single-use gown before entering the room and on the use of gloves for soiled contacts. In this prospective study, we report the colonization and transmission rates of ESBL-PE in order to study whether this peculiar form of ICU with twin bedrooms could be responsible for increased transmission rates of ESBL-PE among ICU patients. Our secondary objectives were to describe the epidemiology of ESBLs in our ICU and to identify risk factors for their transmission. Patients and methods This pure observational study based on our usual practices was prospectively conducted in the 12-bed ICU of a university hospital (Ambroise Par\u00e9, Boulogne-Billancourt, France), organized as a six twin bedrooms divided into three units. Inclusion criteria were: 1) adult patients and 2) a hospitalization for a period during which the patient was nursed by at least two paramedical teams. Characteristics of patients at admission (age, sex, SAPSII) and clinical data during hospital stay (duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, outcome) were collected. Microbiological data concerning colonization and/or acquisition of ESBL-PE were monitored, as usually done in our unit, by rectal swabs collected at admission and once weekly for the whole duration of the ICU stay. Each strain of ESBL-PE was then identified and the enzyme type sequenced by PCR. Results From June 2014 to April 2015, 580 patients were admitted in the ICU, among which 448 (77 %) were included in the study. On the 132 patients excluded, 27 patients were admitted for a conventional hemodialysis, which is conducted in a special room and 105 patients (among which 29 died) were nursed only by one paramedical team. Mean age was 65 \u00b1 16 years, and mean IGS II was 47 \u00b1 21. Sixty-one percent were male. The mean duration of ICU stay was 7.4 \u00b1 8.8 days, and the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 4.5 \u00b1 8.1 days. Origin of patients was home/emergency for 49 % of them and another unit or hospital in 51 %. The rate of ESBL colonization at admission was 13.2 %, mainly with Escherichia coli. The incidence of ESBL transmission among patients who were monitored by two or more rectal swabs was 4.3 % (11 patients on 251), also mainly with Escherichia coli. Mortality did not differ for patients colonized or not with ESBL at admission, nor for patients for whom a transmission occurred during the ICU stay. In this cohort, neither the colonization with ESBL-PE, nor the transmission of ESBL-PE was associated with antibiotic exposure or hospitalization during the three months before admission. Conclusion Prevalence of ESBL colonization in our ICU was 13.2 %, Escherichia coli being the most frequent bacteria identified. This rate of ESBL carriage on admission was comparable to other rates in French ICUs (15 %). Despite the unfavorable twin-bed architecture of our ICU, the incidence of ESBL acquisition was 4.3 %, which was actually lower than transmission rates previously published in other ICUs. Our results question whether the strict isolation in single bedrooms plays a major role for the prevention of ESBL transmission in ICU. They rather put forward the crucial role of hand washing with hydroalcoholic solutions and of the gown for the prevention of ESBL-PE transmission. This study seems to corroborate many studies, suggesting that the routine contact isolation could be challenged in a non-epidemic setting and that environmental contamination may not play a substantial role in the transmission of ESBL-PE. Introduction Patients benefiting from a liver transplantation are systematically placed in a postoperative protective confinement during 5 days (unit protocol, no institutional guideline). This confinement is realized for a variable period according to the teams on the grounds that immediate postoperative period is a time of major pharmacologic immunodepression and acquired because of the surgical stress. Literature's data do not allow to standardize these measures. Patients and methods We have retrospectively analyzed data from liver transplant recipients from January 2012 to December 2013 in our intensive care unit. The type of hepatopathy and the severity at admission were collected. We have also gathered bacterial colonization data before and after the transplantation by distinguishing the multiresistant bacteria and the sensitive germs. Finally, we have recorded the time for these bacteria to appear after surgery. Results During this period, 32 patients benefited from a liver transplant. Among them, 9 (28 %) had fulminant hepatitis and 23 (72 %) an acute-on-chronic liver disease decompensation. The IGS II score upon admission was, respectively, 48 and 51. Bacterial colonization before and after surgery is shown in Table 31 . Twenty-one (66 %) patients acquired new germs during isolation time. The unit protocol of 5 days was followed in 7 (22 %) cases. Discussion Patients having a chronical hepatopathy have a more frequent bacterial colonization due to preoperative sensitive germs. Indeed, infection is often the triggering factor of decompensation. This difference is not significative for resistive germs. The confinement period was often extended arbitrary (i.e.,: without reason justifying not to respect the protocol); nonetheless, we observe the acquisition of a lot of new bacteria during this time independently of the initial hepatopathy. Conclusion An early postoperative protective confinement immediately after liver transplant does not prevent the acquisition of new bacteria. The reason behind this practice is therefore questionable, and randomized trials are necessary to allow a conclusion on the interest of such a practice.",

            "text": "The cranberry fruit (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is particularly rich in polyphenols (tannins), and among these, the primary active compound is the A-type proanthocyanidin (cPAC), which exhibit potent antibacterial properties. In a previous study, we have made evidence of the strong inhibitory effect of cPAC on growth, adhesion and virulence of oropharyngeal and lung isolates of E. coli [1] . The present study was undertaken to establish a baseline of knowledge of the molecular responses of the highly virulent E. coli strain 536 during growth in the presence of cPAC. We employed proteomic analysis and made complementary experiences to characterize the global response of exponential and stationary phases E. coli 536 grown in a nutrient-rich broth medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL, cPAC as compared with a reference culture grown without cPAC. Materials and methods E. coli 536 exposed or not to 1 mg/ml of cPAC proteome was obtained in exponential and stationary growth phase by mass spectrometry proteomic analysis LC-MS/MS. Evaluation of the intracellular ROS level by the dichlorofluorescein diacetate DCFH-DA method was evaluated using a spectrofluorimeter. Membrane potential, cell size and cell viability were evaluated using a flow cytometer (Guava EasyCyte Plus, Millipore). To examine the changes of membrane potential after cPAC exposure, the cells were stained with DiOC6(3) (3,3\u2032-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide) and then immediately analyzed using a flow cytometer. The fluorescence-based LIVE/DEAD kit was used to examine the cell viability. Results A total of 641 proteins were detected, and among these, 483 were in both exponential and stationary growth phases, whereas 506 and 618 proteins were detected only during the exponential and stationary growth phases, respectively. Proteins were manually grouped into 25 metabolic pathway categories. Among the 641 identified proteins, 117 had a significant effect, and among these, 11 were in both exponential and stationary growth phases, whereas 68 and 60 proteins were detected only during the exponential and stationary growth phases, respectively. Considerable differences were also observed in protein abundances between the untreated and treated cells. During the exponential and stationary growth phases, many proteins were over-abundant (31 and 29, respectively) and under-abundant (37 and 31, respectively). The characterization of 117 proteins with a significant effect revealed that more proteins were over-abundant in different functional categories, especially those involved in glycolyse, fermentation, iron metabolism and detoxification. In contrast, the under-abundant proteins were mainly implicated in transport, TCA cycle and respiration. cPAC exposure mainly affected the pathways of iron metabolism with strong evidence of iron privation, cellular detoxification as response to the oxidative stress exerted by cPAC and a redirection of respiratory metabolism through the fermentative pathways. cPAC treatment also alters many membrane functions by the strong inhibition of membrane proteins transport and secretion, affecting the respiratory chains, fimbrial expression, cell division and proton-motrice force. Supplementary experiments showed no effect of cPAC on bacterial viability, a size increase as result of cellular division inhibition and a drastic reduction of the proton-motrice force. ROS dosage showed a significant decrease during stationary phase of growth in cPAC treated bacteria as response to the oxidative stress exerted by proanthocyanidins. Conclusion Proteomic analysis indicates the metabolic pathways affected by cPAC and E. coli adaptation. Treated bacteria are in a state of iron limitation, energy metabolism is redirected to fermentation and membrane proteins secretion and transport systems strongly inhibited. As a result, we observe a fimbriation inhibition affecting bacterial mobility, adhesion and virulence and alteration of the proton-motrice force and cellular division in E. coli. Our results highlight strategy adapted by E. coli 536 to resist the toxicity of tannins. During exposure to cranberry, E. coli is subjected to complex metabolic adaptations that aim to reduce the rate of intracellular ROS. The lack of production of fimbriae caused by cranberry contributes to the permanent activation of the oxidative stress response. Introduction C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely used as a biomarker of infection in ICU patients in spite of a lack of data supporting this practice. We evaluated whether the routine measurement of CRP could be a tool to detect ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in a 12-bed unit where VAP is diagnosed using bronchoscopy and where CRP was measured on a daily routine in all patients until January 2015.",

We compared 1) the delay between intubation and the diagnosis of VAP and 2) the number of bronchoscopy performed during the two periods. Results In total, 152 and 153 patients were included during the periods with and without daily CRP measurement, respectively. Mortality rate was 16 and 20 % (p 0.47). The number of patients who developed VAP during the two periods was 12 and 19 (p 0.19), and the mean time between intubation and VAP was 6.3 and 8.9 days (p 0.52). The proportion of contributive bronchoscopy was 18 and 26 % (p 0.25). Conclusion We could not identify any significant difference in the delay of diagnosis and the use of bronchoscopy during the periods with and without daily measurement of CRP. However, there is a trend toward an earlier diagnosis with an increased use of endoscopy when CRP is routinely measured. Further studies including more patients and evaluating cost-effectiveness should be performed to assess this hypothesis. Introduction Healthcare-associated meningitis is described as indolent, with poor symptomatology and mildly inflammatory biology [1] . Bacteria responsible belong mostly to cutaneous commensal flora, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS); these germs have the ability to adhere to indwelling medical devices and to persist in biofilms, but lack classical virulence factors. Thus, they are considered as low or accidental pathogens and could be the reason behind those clinical and biological features. The main objective of this study was to compare clinical and biological characteristics of CNS meningitis with those of real pathogens healthcare-associated meningitis. The secondary objectives were to collate their bacteriological data and their outcome.",

Introduction Norepinephrine is a widespread used catecholamine in the hemodynamic management of septic shock. As under-dosage or overdosage can be harmful for the patients, it is necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) in preset bounds. We hypothesized that setting a MAP alarm on the cardiovascular monitor could lead to a better correlation between effective MAP and prescribed targets. Patients and methods During two successive periods (P1 and P2), patients treated with norepinephrine for a septic shock for at least 24 h were included (n = 50 per period). The protocol of norepinephrine's administration was similar during the two periods including the prescription of MAP targets for all patients with a 10 mmHg range (e.g., 65-75 mmHg). Effective MAP and doses of norepinephrine were stored every hour. During P2, a MAP alarm was set on the cardiovascular monitor with upper and lower bounds corresponding with prescribed MAP targets. Results During the study period, 460 patients were admitted in the ICU. Of them, 134 (29 %) had a septic shock.

MAP alarm did not decrease norepinephrine dose during the first day of administration as compared to P1 (0.50 \u00b1 0.07 vs 0.47 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcg/kg/min, p = 0.75). In the same way, MAP alarm did not accelerate withdrawal of norepinephrine and did not reduce length of stay and mortality (p = NS). Conclusion Our study suggests that setting MAP alarm could enhance time within a MAP target range and therefore may prevent patients from pernicious effects of hypotension and side effects of norepinephrine overdose.",

            "text": "Within the scope, the interest of monitoring continuously right atrial pressure (RAP) and periodically pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) has been challenged. Dynamic change of pulse pressure during a respiratory cycle (\u0394PP) has been proposed as an alternative in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients. However, in postoperative cardiac surgery, the consequences of the extracorporeal circulation on lung compliance and the thoracic effusion/drainage may alter the relationships between intra-alveolar and heart extra-wall pressures. We designed this study to assess the predictability of monitorable preload indices to changes in cardiac performance during a fluid challenge. Patients and methods This is a single-centre prospective cohort study. We included all consecutive patients who required a pulmonary artery catheter according to our standard protocol. We performed a complete hemodynamic analysis immediately after surgery, while patients were still under anaesthesia (baseline, H0). Three sequential fluid boluses of 5 ml/kg were eventually performed if RAP or PWP < 20 mmHg. After each fluid bolus, another hemodynamic standpoint was collected (H1, H2 and H3). For each fluid challenge, initial preload indices were RAP, PWP and \u0394PP. The fluid-induced cardiac performance changes were: cardiac output (\u0394CO), mean aortic pressure (APm), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm), left ventricle power (\u0394LVPW) and right ventricle power (\u0394RVPW). LVPW was derived as CO x APm and RVPW by CO x PAPm. In order to identify the best possible predictor, a systematic analysis of all possible couples of thresholds was done using the S ratio [1] . Results Forty-two fluid challenges were realized in 17 patients. Twelve were men (66 %), and age was 68.9 \u00b1 11.4 y. The number of grafts, valves, and combined surgery were 7, 6, and 4, respectively. Left ventricle ejection fraction was 37 \u00b1 15. Right ventricle function was considered normal in 14 patients, 14 patients received inotropic support. Table 32 summarizes the R values of correlations between initial preload indices (columns) and fluid-induced change in cardiac performance (lines), *p<0.05, ** p<0.01. The best correlation was observed between RAP and \u0394LVPW. Among all possible couples of thresholds, the S ratio selected RAP < 10 mmHg as predicting \u0394LVSW > 42 g.m. with a selectivity of 0.63 and a specificity of 0.61. Discussion Although the small number of patients limits the analysis, possibly leading to a bias of selection, the number of correlated variables was suitable for showing a clinically relevant correlation, which was not observed. The systematic analysis of best couples of thresholds did not allow identifying a good predictor of fluid responsiveness. [1] . Nevertheless, testing its reliability depending on the hemodynamic conditions of use remains poorly studied. Norepinephrine as a vasoactive drug interferes on both systemic arterial rigidity and pulse pressure (PP). These changes might subsequently alter PPV's ability to predict fluid responsiveness. We therefore thought to study the prediction's accuracy of this test among a very homogenous selected group of ICU patients with PPV's validity criteria and mean arterial pressure (MAP) restored between 65 and 90 mmHg using norepinephrine. PPV was therefore modified into a new index called \"optimized PPV\" in which diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) was integrated, considering that it can account for the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine. We then compared the respective performances of these two tests in this specific ICU population. Patients and methods Patients monitored by transpulmonary thermodilution PiCCO 2 \u00ae system and whose MAP was between 65 and 90 mmHg using norepinephrine were prospectively included. Hemodynamic parameters (as well as arterial pressure, cardiac index (CI) and PPV) were collected serially in six different conditions: at baseline, before and after an end-expiratory occlusion (EEO) test, before and after a passive leg raising (PLR) test, and lastly after volume expansion (VE) (500 mL saline). We studied the diagnostic accuracy of PPV, stroke volume variation (SVV), EEO test and PLR test for predicting the response to volume expansion (i.e., VE-induced increase in CI \u226515 %). From PPV, we performed two additional tests: -the product of PPV by DAP (PPVxDAP), -a composite index obtained from a logistic regression model adjusted on PPV and DAP called \"optimized PPV. \" For each test, we evaluated its diagnostic accuracy using its area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI).",

            "text": "Thirty-four VE tests were collected, concerning 26 VE responders (76 %) and 8 VE non-responders in 25 patients (age 62 \u00b1 13 years; SAPS 2 61 \u00b1 21). At baseline, mean MAP, PPV and CI were, respectively, 77 \u00b1 7 mmHg, 11 % \u00b1 5 and 2.94 \u00b1 0.93 L min \u22121 m \u22122 for a mean norepinephrine dose of 1.09 \u00b1 3.06 \u00b5g kg \u22121 min \u22121 . During the 34 procedures, EEO test, PLR test and VE increased significantly the CI by 8 \u00b1 8 %, 12 \u00b1 23 and 22 \u00b1 15 %, respectively. With a threshold of 13 %, PPV showed the lowest sensitivity of all tests (see Table 33 ). The sensitivity was increased when reducing the threshold to 8 %. Taking into account DAP as well as PPV increased both sensitivity and specificity: \"Optimized PPV\" (given by the formula: 0.57xDAP + 0.56xPPV) reached the best performance with a AUC of 94 % (95 % CI 87-100 %), while PPV got only 75 % (95 % CI 49-100 %), p < 0.05. Conclusion In a selected group of ICU patients with PPV's validity criteria and whose MAP is restored between 65 and 90 mmHg using norepinephrine, PPV is an inefficient test to predict fluid responsiveness. Optimizing the PPV through a composite index including DPA, seen as a reflection of the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine, improves its performance under such conditions of use.",

Patients and methods Thirty patients with septic shock were prospectively enrolled. All patients were resuscitated following the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) was used to monitor CI, oxygen delivery (DO 2 ) and consumption (VO 2 ). Simultaneous blood samples were obtained from a central venous line and an arterial catheter. Correlations between macrohemodynamic and metabolic parameters were explored with the Pearson test. Two-tailed P < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. Results Between March 2015 and August 2015, 30 septic shock patients (sex ratio M/W 1.5) were studied. The average age of the patients was 57 \u00b1 19 years. The sources of infection were as follows: the lungs (n = 13), the urinary tract (n = 10), the abdomen (n = 5) and the central nervous system (n = 2). The mean SOFA score at T0 was 10 \u00b1 4 points, and the mean IGS2 score was 54 \u00b1 23. We investigate the relationship between hemodynamic variables and metabolic parameters (Table 34) .

Both parameters showed strong correlations with oxygen extraction OER (Table 35) Introduction Volume status is difficult to predict in patients with chronic renal failure before hemodialysis. This parameter is very important to know and to define the volume of fluid to be removed during dialysis. We undertook this study to measure baseline N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) plasma concentration and weight gain derived for \"dry weight\" and to correlate their levels with changes in levels of NT-pro-BNP and weight before and after dialysis. Patients and methods Over 8 months (February 2014-September 2014), a prospective, observational study was performed in an 18-bed medical surgical intensive care unit at Tunis Military Hospital. Patients under hemodialysis (HD) treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were included in this study. All patients were on regular dialysis treatment for at least 6 months, had no residual kidney function and underwent a 4 h HD session 3 times a week. Patients with clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) (NYHA class III and higher) were excluded. Dry weight was determined by a clinical approach. Weight and levels of NT-pro-BNP were measured immediately before and after hemodialysis. The correlation between weight changes during the session and variation of levels of NT-pro-BNP before and after hemodialysis was studied. Results A total of 22 patients were included. The mean age was 50 years. There was a significant reduction in the values of weight after HD compared to the values before HD (p = 0.001). There was a significant reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels after HD compared to the values before HD (p = 0.03). Using regression analysis, we found a weak correlation between change in NT-pro-BNP and weight loss (r 2 = 0.43, p = 0.04) before and after HD. There was also a correlation between levels of NT-pro-BNP and weight gain relative to the dry weight before dialysis (r 2 = 0.63, p = 0.02). Conclusion NT-pro-BNP can be used in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis for the assessment of volume status, especially if patient's dry weight is unknown. But it must be interpreted according to clinical settings, particularly in case of heart disease. Introduction In intensive care units, life-threatening bacillus infections may occur. It is a very common situation. Probabilist extendedspectrum antibiotic therapy has to be promptly instituted. The spectrum of this antibiotic should include extended-spectrum betalactamases enterobacteria. Because of their broad spectrum of action, carbapenems are the standard treatment, especially in cases of nosocomial infections. Lately, bacterial strains have acquired resistance mechanisms to carbapenems, including carbapenemase production. Because of few therapeutic options, the occurrence of bacterial resistance to carbapenems is a real public health problem. The use of carbapenem is limited by expert's recommendations to limit the risk of therapeutic impasse. The aim is to preserve their effectiveness. The objective of this work was to assess the incidence and risk factors for resistance acquisition in an intensive care unit, while rigorously good use of these antibiotics was applied.",

However, while ESBL-PE-related infections rarely occur in patients without prior colonization, infections occurring among colonized patients may be due to other less resistant pathogens. In this view, it would be interesting to be able to predict, which patients will actually develop ESBL-PE-related infections, so as to control the increasing use of carbapenems that may jeopardize their efficacy in a near future.

These multistate models seem to be underused in the literature on this subject. A wider use of these models should be obtained by teaching them in statistical classes and by using statistical software including them like R or SAS \u00ae .

Because their diagnosis is not well defined, epidemiologic data vary between studies, and their impact on the prognosis of critically ill patients remain unclear. The objectives of this study were to describe the incidence and the prognosis of catheter-associated UTI in a medical intensive care unit. In univariate and multivariate analyses, the occurrence of catheter-associated UTI was not found as an independent risk factor associated with mortality, unlike age and SAPS II score at ICU admission. Conclusion Development of catheter-associated UTI is common in critically ill patients. Classic criteria for diagnosis have, however, a poor specificity. These infections are not associated with increased mortality, and related morbidity seems to be low. Because incorrect diagnosis of catheter-associated UTI treatment may have economic and ecologic impacts, in particular by the selection pressure induced by unnecessary prescription and improper use of antibiotics by patients, diagnostic criteria in the ICU setting need to be better defined, and catheter-associated UTI screening could be limited to a second step of evaluation of fever of unknown origin.

Results The FreeO2 system was modified to allow a mixture of oxygen and air administration with a constant gas flow. The proportion of oxygen is based on an advanced closed loop to maintain a constant SpO 2 . We compared in healthy subjects this new prototype with Airvo2 set with minimal FiO 2 of 30 % (3L/min of oxygen). Both devices were set at 30L/min, and we plan to recruit 10 healthy subjects. The experimental conditions were the following: healthy subjects will initially breath with high-flow therapy in normoxic conditions (5 min), followed by 5 min of induced hypoxemia (nitrogen administration), and return to initial conditions for 5 min. We record SpO 2 , respiratory rate, heart rate and FiO 2 delivered. We conducted an evaluation of automated oxygen titration during a longer period of 30 min with induced hypoxemia. Discussion Data concerning the first 5 healthy subjects are presented here healthy subjects. Initial data demonstrate the feasibility to deliver variable oxygen flows administered with air at high flows (from 20 to 60 L/min). In this study, the flow was maintained constant at 30L/min. During nitrogen administration to the healthy subjects, with the new prototype controlling oxygen/air administration, the oxygen increases (leading to a FiO 2 increase) to maintain constant the SpO 2 level (set at 96 % in this study), and the air flow decreases to maintain constant the total flow (30L/min). After cessation of nitrogen, the oxygen flow (and FiO 2 ) is automatically reduced. The percentage of time in the SpO 2 target (96 \u00b1 2 %) was significantly more important with automated titration during the induced hypoxemia (50 vs. 24 %, P < 0.05), and the percentage of time with hypoxemia was reduced with automated oxygen titration (11 vs. 55 %, P < 0.05). In 4 subjects, the mean time in the target during the 30-min evaluation was 94.4 %.",

Given the nature of the investigation, i.e. a bench experiment, low within-ventilator variability for the values of VT was anticipated, and hence, we a priori decided not to perform statistical tests if this assumption was verified. Therefore, any observed differences in means for VT were considered as true. We a priori defined a \u00b110 % VT error as a threshold for accuracy range limit.",

Introduction Nasal high flow (NHF) is increasingly used in the management of acute respiratory failure.

Four sessions of 15 min were conducted under various conditions: a baseline period with conventional oxygen therapy (nasal cannulas or face mask), followed by three periods of NHF set at 20, 40 and 60 L/min and delivered in a randomized order. During the whole protocol, FiO 2 was continuously adjusted to achieve a target SpO 2 of 94 % in hypoxemic and 90 % in hypercapnic patients. Work of breathing (WOB) was computed from esophageal pressure and tidal volume, which was estimated by respiratory inductive plethysmography. Calibration of the flow with a pneumotachograph was conducted at the end of each condition and used to optimize the plethysmography accuracy. We also measured and calculated the esophageal pressure-time product (PTPeso), minute ventilation, capillary blood gases at the end of each tested condition, airway resistance and compliance.",

Endpoints were the in-ICU and in-hospital vital status. Results We identified 48 patients [26 males/22 females; median age 59 years (range 21-79)] from 5 centers. The median SOFA score at the time of admission was 4 (range 0-10). The causes of admission were acute respiratory failure (n = 37, 77 %), thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 3, 6 %), septic shock (n = 2, 4 %), coma (n = 2, 4 %), hypercalcemia (n = 1, 2 %), cardiac arrest (n = 1, 2 %), acute kidney injury (n = 1, 2 %), and acute liver failure (n = 1, 2 %).

However, it is difficult to predict the outcome of these patients at their admission. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics and hospital outcomes of critically ill patients with HMs admitted to ICU to identify risk factors for mortality. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study, over 2010-2014, in a medical ICU of the University Hospital of Rouen. We analyzed 134 patients with HMs admitted to ICU. Data included: demographic characteristics, hematologic diagnosis, reasons for ICU admission, transplant status, the presence of neutropenia, number of organ failures and level of organ support. Results The mean age was 57 \u00b1 14.5 years, and the sex ratio was 1.48. The hematologic disease represented was the LAM (37 %), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (31 %) and LAL (10 %). Ten percentage had undergone an autologous stem cell and an allograft 6 %. At the time of ICU admission, sixty-one patients (46 %) were at the stage of diagnosis and/or initial treatment of their disease, 32 (24 %) in complete remission, 11 (8 %) in partial remission and 30 (22 %) had relapsed. The main indication for admission was: acute respiratory failure in 65 cases (49 %), septic shock in 30 patients (22 %), severe sepsis in 15 patients (11 %) and acute renal failure for 13 patients (10 %). Sixty-seven patients (50 %) were neutropenic at admission, 87 (65 %) during the ICU stay. The average SAPS II score on admission was 60 \u00b1 21, the SOFA score was 10 \u00b1 4 at day 1 and 9.5 \u00b1 5 at day 3. Sixty-seven patients were intubated, and the average duration of ventilation was 9.5 \u00b1 11.7 days, 51 (38 %) underwent non-invasive ventilation, as exclusive treatment of respiratory failure for 19 patients (14 %), 44 patients (33 %) required dialysis, 84 patients (63 %) received vasopressors. The average length of ICU stay was 10.3 \u00b1 13 days, the average length of stay in hospital 20.6 \u00b1 17.2 days. Mortality in the ICU was 37 %, in-hospital mortality was 52 %, mortalities at day 28, day 90, 6 months and 1 year were, respectively, 43, 56, 64 and 71 %. Use of invasive mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressors were associated with higher ICU mortality (69, 64 and 55 % respectively, p < 0.001). Patients with SOFA score increased at least 2 points over the third day had a mortality rate significantly higher (68 %, p < 0.001) while those with SOFA score decreased at least 2 points had lower mortality (10 %, p < 0.001). Conclusion The prognostic factors of in-hospital death were the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, the need for vasopressors and the need for renal replacement therapy in patients with hematologic malignancy admitted to ICU. The trend of organ failures in the first days of ownership also determines the outcome of these patients in ICU. Introduction Prognostic impact of neutropenia in critically ill cancer patients (CICP) remains controversial. Hence, although neutropenia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the general ICU population with severe sepsis or septic shock, several studies in critically ill cancer patients failed to demonstrate impact of neutropenia on outcome [1, 2] . This lack of statistical association might, however, reflect a lack of statistical power. The aim of this study was to assess influence of neutropenia on mortality of critically ill cancer patients. Secondary objectives were to assess influence of neutropenia on mortality of critically ill patients while taking into account underlying malignancy or changes related to period of admission. Materials and methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statements. Public domain databases including PubMed and the Cochrane database were searched by using predefined keywords. The research was restricted to articles published in English and studies focusing on critically ill adult patients from May 2005 to May 2015. Results were analyzed using Review Manager 5.1 software. Overall, mortality is reported as median (IQR). Publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting the funnel plot. Then, summary estimates of risk difference were then calculated using the random-effect model. Mortality in studies with inclusion period before 2005 was higher in the overall population and in non-neutropenic patients (Fig. 33) . The overall impact of neutropenia on outcome was, however, unchanged by the inclusion period (respective risk difference of mortality in neutropenic patients of 10 % [95 % CI 4-15] before 2005 vs. 10 % [95 % CI 3-17]). Conclusion This systematic review suggests a meaningful survival in neutropenic critically ill cancer patients despite an 11 % (95 % CI 9-14) raw increase in mortality compared to non-neutropenic critically ill cancer patients. Neither underlying malignancy nor period of admission was associated with the prognostic impact of neutropenia. The meaningful survival in neutropenic critically ill patients strongly suggests that ICU admission denial based upon neutropenia should be discouraged. Introduction While n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids interfere with immune and inflammatory processes, the l-arginine deficit during sepsis impairs the arginine/NO pathway, setting off a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome leading to poor clinical outcomes in septic shock. However, there is no clear clinical benefit in supplementing septic patients with either n-3 PUFAs and/or l-arginine. The aim of our work was to assess the effects of different enteral nutrition formulations containing n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids and/or l-arginine on septic shock-induced vascular dysfunction in rats. Materials and methods Healthy rats were fed with different enteral products: Peptamen \u00ae HN (HN group), Peptamen \u00ae AF containing n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (AF group) or Peptamen \u00ae AF enriched with l-arginine (AFA group). After 72 h of nutritional pretreatment, peritonitis by cecal ligation and puncture was performed (CLP group) and compared to a SHAM group. Once septic shock was set, rats were actively resuscitated and monitored during 4 h. At the end of the experiment, vessels and organs were harvested to assess inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and ex vivo vascular reactivity was studied.",

Norepinephrine infusion rates to reach the mean arterial pressure objective were significantly increased in septic rats treated with n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid (AF and AFA groups), compared to SHAM and septic HN rats. Both AF and AFA significantly reduced mesenteric resistance arterial contractility, decreased vascular oxidative stress, but increased NF-\u03baB and pI\u03baB expression, nitric oxide and prostacyclin production in septic rats. Discussion In this experimental septic shock model, an immunonutrition diet enriched with l-arginine or n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids failed to improve septic shock-induced hemodynamic dysfunction. Moreover, l-arginine supplementation seems to increase septic rat mortality. The need to assess the relevance of these results in septic patients, calls for further studies, and the place for so-called immunonutrition shall be questioned. Conclusion Although immunonutrition with n-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acid or l-arginine supplementation exhibited an antioxidant effect, it failed to improve the septic shock-induced vascular dysfunction. Introduction Hyperglycemia is a feature of septic patient and has been associated with poor outcome and higher mortality. In contrast, insulin has been shown to decrease mortality and to prevent the incidence of multi-organ failure but is often associated with deleterious hypoglycemia. Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and NO production. We found that PTP1B inhibition or gene deletion improved mesenteric endothelial function and reduced cardiac and vascular inflammatory markers, leading to reduced cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of the present study was to assess the potential therapeutic effect of total PTP1B invalidation on glucose metabolism and cardiovascular insulin resistance using experimental model of sepsis. Materials and methods Thus, in order to address this question, we developed a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. CLP is followed by subcutaneous fluid resuscitation at 1, 5 and 9 h after CLP. Introduction Although polymyxin-B hemoperfusion is supposed to improve outcomes in patients with sepsis by adsorbing endotoxin and decreasing systemic inflammation, the recent ABDOMIX study did not demonstrate any beneficial effect of polymyxin-B hemoperfusion in patients with septic shock due to peritonitis. In this context, cytokine clearance induced by polymyxin-B hemoperfusion is debated. The objectives of the study were to assess the influence of polymyxin-B hemoperfusion on plasma cytokine concentrations and to identify the cytokines associated with day 28 mortality. Patients and methods This ancillary study of the ABDOMIX study investigated the impact of two polymyxin-B hemoperfusion sessions on day 28 mortality in peritonitis-induced septic shock. Blood samples were taken within 10 h post-surgery (P1), at the end of the first hemoperfusion session in the experimental group or 2 h after P1 in the control group (P2), 24 h after P1 (P3), and at the end of the second hemoperfusion session in the experimental group or 2 h after P3 in the control group (P4). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interferon \u03b3, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-1\u03b1, interleukin-1RA, interleukin-6, interleukin-4, interleukin-10, interleukin-17A and interleukin-22 were assessed using magnetic bead-based immunology multiplex assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Among the 232 patients included in the ABDOMIX study, 19 patients were excluded due to missing sampling and 213 patients (109 in the hemoperfusion group and 104 in the control group) were consequently included in the analysis. Postoperative P1 cytokine concentrations were not different between the 2 groups. Cytokine variation between P1 and P2 was not different between the 2 groups except for interleukin-1RA and interleukin-10, which decreased more pronouncedly in the control group than in the hemoperfusion group (p = 0.016 and 0.047, respectively). Cytokine variations between P3 and P4 were not different between the 2 groups except for IL-10 and IL-22, both of which decreased in the control group, whereas both of them increased in the hemoperfusion group (p = 0.002 and 0.04, respectively). Using a logistic stepwise regression model, the absence of decrease in interleukin-10 and interleukin-22 between P1 and P3 was associated with day 28 mortality independently from Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (p = 0.002 and 0.04, respectively). Conclusion Polymyxin-B hemoperfusion was not associated with a decrease in cytokine concentrations as compared to the control group.",

The aim of our work was to determine the in-hospital mortality rate of cirrhosis and to identify predictive factors among our cirrhotic patient. Introduction Constipation (or paralysis of lower gastrointestinal tract) in intensive care is multifactorial and is defined as the absence of stool for more than 3 consecutive days without mechanical obstruction. The incidence of constipation in intensive care patients is more than 60 %. Constipation is associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer stay in intensive care unit and increased mortality (1) . The Working Group on Abdominal Problems (WGAP) of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed recommendations on the constipation management in intensive care, but their implementation varies among intensivists (2) .

The average knowledge score among all respondents is 7.5/13 (minimum 2/13, maximum 12/13). The average the case among all respondents is 2.3/5 (minimum 0/4, maximum 4/4). These two scores are statistically associated with the number of beds in the respondent's unit, meaning that a better knowledge score is associated with a respondent working in an important intensive care unit (regarding the number of beds in the unit), but is not related to age, sex, teaching status, or seniority of medical practice. The intensivists do not know neither drugs, nor clinical and biological disorders which promote constipation in intensive care patients (1.4 and 2.8 %, respectively); 77.1 % (n = 444) underestimate the incidence of constipation in intensive care unit and only 62.7 % believe that constipation affects mortality. Only 7 % (n = 41) of intensivists declare having a written protocol for constipation management in their unit, while 93 % (n = 536) have a systematic monitoring of transit in their service and 72 % (n = 415) initiate a treatment of constipation in the 6 days following the admission in intensive care unit. Although 60.6 % of intensivists (n = 349) consider that constipation is a daily concern in their unit, only 5.2 % (n = 30) of them plan to attend a session on gastrointestinal motility impairment during a national convention. Conclusion This is the first national survey assessing the knowledge, attitudes and practices of French intensivists in the field of constipation management. Their knowledge is insufficient and is related to the lack of interest of intensivists in the subject. This is a matter of concern, and corrective actions are needed to improve constipation management in intensive care units, such as implementation of written protocols and evaluation of implementation programs.

Aspiration may result in pulmonary injury due to chemical and/or bacterial aggression. No reliable clinical or biological criteria are available to ensure diagnosis of bacterial infection on patient admission. Antibiotics in AP are thus widely prescribed, although theoretically effective only in bacterial AP. We defined a new protocol for management of comatose patients with the aim to reduce antibiotics use by treating only patients with suspected AP and by stopping antibiotics in case of negative bacteriological samples. The aim of our study was to assess effectiveness and safety of this protocol. Patients and methods This prospective survey started in November 2012 and ended in December 2014. All the patients admitted in ICU for coma (Glasgow coma score \u22648) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation were included. Respiratory specimen was obtained, and antibiotic treatment was began when an AP was suspected (two of the following criteria: temperature \u226538.5 ou \u226435.5 \u00b0C, leukocytosis or leukopenia, purulent tracheal aspirates) and new infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Patients were divided into 3 groups: no AP, chemical AP (infiltrates on chest X-ray but negative respiratory specimen) and bacterial AP (positive respiratory specimen). of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. Only 2 patients of the 34 with a chemical AP had a confirmed relapse of pneumonia after antibiotic treatment had been interrupted after initial negative respiratory specimen. They do not need invasive mechanical ventilation (Table 39) . Conclusion AP chemical or bacterial is associated with increase morbidity without increase mortality. Systematic bacterial sampling and antibiotic withdrawing in case of negative culture lead to antibiotic interruption in 1/3 of AP cases without increased risk in AP relapse. patients. Lung opacities were bilateral (97 %), located in the superior parts of the lungs, and 45 % (n = 30) had no pleural effusion. Pneumothoraces were rare [n = 5 (7.5 %)]. The lung opacities on HRCT were distributed similarly among the three immunocompromised groups as none of these patterns (topographic involvement and localization) were significantly different across the three groups. Consolidations and nodular opacities were significantly associated with the existence of coinfection (p 0.03). Conclusion During PCP disease, the most frequent HRCT pattern is bilateral diffuse ground-glass opacities or crazy paving with no pleural space involvement. Alveolar or nodular opacities are less frequent but may be encountered. Therefore, despite striking differences in pathophysiology and clinical presentation between AIDS and non AIDS patients, HRCT patterns are similar. Other HRCT findings such as consolidations and nodules might be ascribable to lung super infection. Introduction In severe sepsis and septic shock patients, respiratory failure usually occurs within 72 h following admission into intensive care unit. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to play a major role in its occurrence and prognosis. Endocan is an anti-inflammatory molecule produced by the lung endothelium and released in the circulation in response to an infectious or inflammatory insult. The main action of endocan relates to the inhibition of leukocyte diapedesis. By preventing leukocytes accumulation in the lung, endocan reduces excessive pulmonary inflammation. Thus, a high circulating level endocan in septic patients would protect the lung from excessive inflammation and would be of better prognosis. This hypothesis has been comforted by 2 pilot studies. In the context of severe polytrauma, high blood levels of endocan at ICU admission (>7 ng/mL) are observed in patients who do not develop respiratory failure (1). We found a similar profile in severe septic patients with a cutoff of 3.55 ng/mL best distinguishing patients with ARDS in the 3 first day of ICU from patients who do not develop ARDS (2).",

This improves VA/Q ratio (Guerin 2014), ventilator-patient synchrony (5), lowers VO 2 (6) and controls H+. Mortality is halved (3). As ARDS is caused by a reduction of the surface offered for O 2 diffusion, failure of the respiratory generator or the ventilatory muscles spontaneous ventilation (SV), with conditionalities, may offer to the lung better circulatory and ventilatory conditions to allow for healing. Patients and methods A series of 6 patients in which the Berlin criteria (7) were fulfilled, and sufficient details gathered were retrospectively analyzed. P/F on PEEP \u2265 5 cmH 2 O was <100 with one exception (117). The patients were already present in the critical care unit (CCU) or admitted to the CCU following tracheal intubation for pulmonary/extrapulmonary ARDS. Management was: imaging, fiberoptic bronchoscopy if needed, repeated transthoracic echocardiography (absence of right ventricular dilatation or reduction of tricuspid annular systolic excursion), venous and arterial lines insertion, circulatory optimization (8) Results P/F increased > 200 over 12-72 h followed by improvement and then disappearance of bilateral diffuse opacities. Overall reduction in vasopressor/inotropic requirements, markers of inflammation, etc. allowed one to extubate the trachea after 72-96 h following the beginning of said management. In some instances, the improvement of P/F was from \u2248 50 to > 300 over \u226424 h. One patient was re-intubated because of re-infection in the presence of interrupted NIV and normothermia. Discussion The limitations are: non-prospective non-randomized design; n = 6 although <50 patients were treated without full details (CCU mortality \u2248 5 %); H+ should be controlled before SV. The rationale behind CMV + proning (introduction) can be achieved with lowered temperature with alpha-2 agonists (10, 11), adequate SV (12) without ventilatory depression (13) . SV improves circulatory stability and uses much higher PEEP + lower driving pressure. Fast-track extubations were observed. Conclusion Provided stringent physiological principles are met severe ARDS may be handled with CMV + muscle relaxation + proning (state-of-the-art) or SV. Evidence-based demonstration is required.",

Despite the life-threatening nature of these exacerbations, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear although a high number of neutrophils in the lungs of COPD patients are known to correlate with poor prognosis. We and others previously demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-22 protects and regenerates respiratory epithelial cells upon virus infections and also limits secondary bacterial infections. Indeed, IL-22, through its receptor (IL-22R), is a cytokine that plays a pivotal role in lung antimicrobial defence and tissue protection. Regarding the IL-22/IL22R antimicrobial pathway, we hypothesized that any alteration of IL-22R in the lungs of COPD patients may compromise innate defence mechanisms and enhance susceptibility to infections. More specifically, we examined whether IL-22R expressed on lung epithelial cells is targeted by the neutrophil proteases present at the surface of lung mucosa. Materials and methods We exposed human bronchial epithelial cells and BALB/c mice to viral, bacterial agents or cigarette smoke and assessed IL-22R expression by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. IL-22R expression was also examined in the lung tissue of COPD and control individuals. We also analysed the effect of neutrophil serine proteases on the expression, structure and function of IL-22R by flow cytometry and western blotting in mouse lungs, human epithelial cells and sputa from COPD patients with or without exacerbations. Results Using in vitro and in vivo approaches as well as RT-qPCR, flow cytometry and/or western blotting techniques, we first showed that pathogens such as influenza virus promote IL-22R expression in human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial LPS, do not. We also investigated whether IL-22R lung expression was impaired by cigarette smoke in epithelial cells or in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. Finally, we examined lung tissue from 129 patients (11 % nonsmokers, 41 % \"healthy\" smokers, 48 % COPD patients). IL-22R1 RNA expression was neither associated with the cigarette smoke exposure nor the COPD status.",

            "text": "In view of the foregoing data and the evidence that neutrophilia is a pathological hallmark of COPD, we hypothesized that neutrophils induce posttranslational modifications of IL-22R expression and function. We first exposed human epithelial cells to supernatant from activated neutrophils and observed that IL-22R1 protein expression was strongly decreased under these conditions, whereas \u03b1-1 proteinase inhibitor prevented the disappearance of the receptor. Most importantly, neutrophil proteases impaired IL-22-dependent immune signalling and expression of antimicrobial effectors such as \u03b2-defensin-2. This proteolysis resulted in the release of a soluble fragment of IL-22R, which was detectable both in cellular and animal models as well as in sputa from COPD patients with acute exacerbations. Conclusion Hence, our study reveals an unsuspected regulation by the proteolytic action of neutrophil enzymes of IL-22-dependent lung host response. This process likely enhances pathogen replication and ultimately COPD exacerbations.",

Conclusion Needle aspiration was effective in a third of primary spontaneous pneumothorax treated in our institution.

The delay between admission and incision was inferior to 5 min for all patients. Results are reported in Table 42 .

A sustained spontaneous circulation was achieved in one patient: multiple organ failure occurred and the patient died in ICU 15 h after the procedure. Discussion Although resuscitative thoracotomy has been performed very quickly after admission, all our patients died. This result can be explained, at least partially, by the prolonged time of cardiac arrest before admission and the frequency of blunt trauma among our patients. Some of the procedures we performed may even be considered as futile according to recommendations suggesting not to realize thoracotomy in case of blunt chest trauma or cardiopulmonary resuscitation lasting more than 10 min without returning to circulatory activity [2] . However, other centers have reported such a large proportion of inadequate procedure.

Introduction Heart diseases are not uncommon in pregnancy (0.5-2 %) (1). Physiological changes, including cardiovascular and respiratory ones observed during pregnancy, may exacerbate preexisting heart disease. The aim of our study was to describe the epidemiological, clinical profile, paraclinical and therapeutic cardiac decompensation in peripartum and to analyze the factors influencing prognosis. Patients and methods Transversal retrospective study spread over 13 years, from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2013, including all women in labor admitted in obstetrical ICU for heart failure, with or without known heart disease. Results During the study period, 223 patients have been collected, with an incidence of 2.5 %. The average age was 32.77 \u00b1 6.74, the medical story of rheumatic fever was frequently found (75 %), and 79 % of women in labor were followed for rheumatic valve diseases. About 38.1 % were followed by a cardiologist, while 23.8 % of heart diseases have been discovered only during pregnancy.

Introduction Diabetes mellitus affects 10 % of the general population worldwide, 10-25 % of critically ill patients, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Sepsis is among the main complications of diabetes. Patients with hematologic malignancies also are immunocompromised because of underlying disease and treatments. Intensive care unit-acquired infections, especially bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia, are challenging complications in critically ill patient. To our knowledge, no study reported the influence of diabetes mellitus on acquired sepsis in this setting. This study is a post hoc analysis of the prospective cohort TRIAL-OH to determine whether diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk for intensive care unit-acquired infections in patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients and methods TRIAL-OH is a prospective multicenter cohort of patients admitted to 17 intensive care units in France and Belgium. We studied the subgroup of patients with intensive care length of stay superior to 3 days and who needed invasive mechanical ventilation within the first 3 days of their admission. Patients with diabetes mellitus under treatment were compared to patients without diabetes or with only diabetic diet. A propensity score for diabetes was constructed using multivariable logistic regression and used to match patients with and without diabetes mellitus and to determine the influence of diabetes on hospital mortality and intensive care unitacquired infections (as defined by bacterial or fungal infections occurring later than the second day of intensive care unit admission). Introduction Candidemia has a poor prognosis and is associated with a high mortality in part because of delayed diagnosis. There is no optimal tool and, despite a rather low sensitivity, gold standard for candidemia diagnostic and follow-up still relies on blood cultures. The use of blood culture-specific media is not clearly addressed in guidelines.",

The agreement study showed that when the sampling was done the same day, on both resins and Mycosis blood cultures, in the absence of systemic antifungal therapy, 13 (19 %) and 15 (22 %) bottles were positive only on resin or only on Mycosis bottles, respectively, and in the presence of systemic antifungal therapy, 9 (41 %) and 5 (23 %) bottles were positive only on resins or only on Mycosis bottle, respectively (Fig. 35) . Thus, systemic antifungal therapy decreased the agreement rate between the bottles. Discussion Systemic antifungal therapy modifies significantly the blood culture results independently of the presence of resin in the bottles in intensive care units patients with candidemia.

Patients and methods A retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients admitted to our ICU between January 2012 and March 2015 with invasive Candida infection, defined by a positive blood culture for Candida species and/or the presence of 50 % or more colonized sites with Candida (Pittet index). Results During the study period, invasive Candida infection was identified in 40 patients (median age 65 years, IQR 53.5-72, 55 % male, median SAPS III: 63, IQR 58-70.5). The most common underlying disease was diabetes present in 65 %. The main reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure in 30 patients (75 %); 80 % of patients were invasively ventilated at a moment of their ICU stay. Septic shock and ARDS were observed in 62.5 and 42.5 %, respectively.

While many studies have found an association between UE and increased time spent under mechanical ventilation (MV) or delayed ICU discharge, UE has also been described to carry a beneficial effect on length of MV and ICU outcome in a subgroup of patients not requiring re-intubation. We aimed to describe the incidence, characteristics and outcomes of patients experiencing UE (UE patients) and to compare these issues with patients undergoing a planned extubation (non-UE patients). Patients and methods This is a prospective single-center study in a 15-bed university-affiliated mixed ICU, over an 18-month period. All adult patients undergoing tracheal intubation were included. A nurse driven sedation protocol based on RASS score was used in most mechanically ventilated patients. Tracheal tubes were fixed with tape. The tape is fixed on the tracheal tube and wrapped around the neck. One strand of the tape sometimes passes on the bridge of the nose before reaching the neck, according to the patient's morphology. The use of physical restraints is prescribed by the attending physician but is widely used in our unit. Characteristics of UE were registered. Demographic characteristics and ICU outcomes were compared between UE and non-UE patients. Results During the study period, 882 patients were admitted and 580 patients required tracheal intubation (65.7 %). All the patients were orally intubated. Forty-six UE occurred in 42 patients (55.1 \u00b1 20.6 years, SAPS II 46 \u00b1 17). Mechanical restraints were present in 89 % of the episodes. The incidence density was 10.3 events every 1000 days of MV. UE occurred equally during night and day and four times during nurse shift. Caregivers were aware of the UE risk in onethird of cases. UE was not associated with MV settings. Among the UE episodes, 21 % occurred in agitated patients and 15 lead to re-intubation, within the following hour in most of the cases. Not re-intubated UE patients were younger (49.4 \u00b1 20.1 vs. 65.3 \u00b1 18.6 years, p < 0.05), had a shorter ICU LOS (2.8 \u00b1 4.1 vs. 9.4 \u00b1 11.1 days, p < 0.05) and a better survival (100 vs. 79.2 %, p < 0.5) as compared to non-UE patients. Re-intubated UE patients were more likely to have a longer time under MV (21.9 \u00b1 12.8 vs. 9.4 \u00b1 11.1 days, p < 0.05) and ICU LOS (21.9 \u00b1 12.8 vs. 9.4 \u00b1 11.1 days, p < 0.05) than non UE patients (Table 43) . Age, underlying systemic hypertension, time between admission and UE and between sedation withdrawal and UE were risk factors for reintubation. Voluntary intoxication as admission diagnosis was associated with UE good outcome. Discussion Patients may self-extubate because they were not extubated in an appropriate timing. Rapid modifications of consciousness can lead them to waken in the unfriendly environment of ICU in between the nurse rounds, when deliberate UE might be unnoticed. Only one-fifth of UE patients was agitated. Nevertheless, RASS score was evaluated every 4 h, at nurse round. Agitation may occur within these rounds. The impact of physical restraints on UE remains unclear. Conclusion UE might lead to a better outcome in the subset of not re-intubated patients. Altogether, UE underscores the need for a better involvement in sedation withdrawal, MV weaning and agitation screening. Introduction The association between mortality and time of admission to ICUs has been extensively studied but remains a matter of debate. We aimed therefore to reassess the impact of time of admission on ICU mortality by retrospectively investigating a recent (2006-2014) and large ICU cohort. Patients and methods All adults (\u226518 years) admitted between January 2006 and December 2014 to a French tertiary care medical ICU (staffed by onsite intensivist 24 h a day and 7 days a week) were included in the study. Patients' characteristics, medical management, and mortality were extracted from our prospective ICU database. Patients were grouped according to their admission time: weekday, weeknight, and weekend. ICU mortality was the primary outcome, and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of death were analyzed by multivariate Cox model. Results A total of 2.428 patients were included: age 62 \u00b1 18 years, male: 1515 (62 %), and median SAPSII score: 38 (IQ, 27-52). A total of 1.449 (59.7 %) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, 790 (32.5 %) patients received vasopressors (epinephrine or norepinephrine) and 162 (6.7 %) patients required renal replacement therapy. The overall ICU mortality rate was 13.7 % (332/2428). Admissions to ICU occurred during weekdays in 680 cases (28 %), during nighttime in 1.461 cases (60 %), and during weekends (Saturday and Sunday) in 611 cases (25 %). Baseline characteristics patients were similar between groups except that patients admitted during the second part of weeknight have a significantly higher SAPS II score than those admitted during weekdays (41, 28-56 vs 38, 26-51; p = 0.034, respectively). Patients admitted during weekdays have a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay as compared to others (7, 3-15 days vs 5, 3-13 days, p < 0.001 and 8, 3-20 days vs 7, 3-15 days, p < 0.01 respectively). ICU mortality was comparable for patients admitted during weekdays (95/680, 14 %), weeknights (142/1099, 12.9 %) and weekends (94/649, 14.5 %). Univariate analysis showed that admission during the second part of the night was associated with a higher ICU mortality (HR, 1.39; 95 % CI 1.06-1.81) as compared to other time admissions. However, multivariate Cox model controlling factors associated with mortality such as SAPS II score, ICU admission source, and intensity of treatment demonstrated that admission during weeknights and weekends was not associated with an increased risk for death. During the first part of the night, the adjusted HR was 0.95 (95 % CI 0.66-1.37) p = 0.80 and during the second part of the night the adjusted HR was 1.24 (95 % CI 0.85-1.81) p = 0.25 in comparison with the weekdays admissions. During the weekend, the HR was 1.05 (95 % CI 0.82-1.33) in comparison with the rest of the week (p = 0.71). Conclusion Time of admission, especially weeknight and weekend (off-hours admissions), did not influence the prognosis of ICU patients. The higher illness severity of patients admitted during the second part of the weeknight may explain the observed increased mortality in this part of population. Introduction Decisions on whether to admit a critically ill patient to ICU are complex, since they need to balance the potential risks and benefits for the individual patient with the limited bed availability and thus the implication for future patients. Although recommendations for ICU triage are available, compliance with them has been shown to be poor. Decisions regarding ICU admission are currently not based on scientific evidence, yet refusal is associated with increased mortality. Aim To analyze determinants and outcomes associated with decisions to deny or to delay ICU admission in critically ill patients. Patients and methods This is an observational prospective study over a 6-month period, between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2015, in a 7-bed medical intensive care unit. Patients' characteristics, reasons for requesting ICU admission, severity of underlying disease, severity of acute illness and mortality were recorded. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with ICU admission refusal. Introduction ICU bed shortage and extremes in clinical status are among other reasons of refusals of patients proposed for ICU admission. The outcome of such patients relies heavily on local organization of healthcare facilities. The aim of this study is to describe characteristics and outcomes of non-admitted patients in a Tunisian ICU. Patients and methods Observational prospective cohort study conducted from January 1, 2015, to August 30, 2015. All ICU admission proposals were analysed, and patients' outcome was collected after 48 h regardless of the type of decision: ICU admission or refusal.",

Studies that have investigated long-term outcome in this population suggest that these patients have a poor prognosis and highlight the need for further investigation of factors associated with long-term outcome. Patients and methods This is a retrospective single-centre study of patients admitted to the medical ICU of a tertiary hospital and who received RRT for AKI, between January 2008 and December 2011. AKI was defined and classified at ICU admission based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification using both creatinine and urine output. In order to identify predictors for death at 1 year of follow-up, a univariable analysis and a subsequent multivariable analysis were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Renal function recovery at 1 year was calculated using the following formula: [(estimated glomerular filtration Rate (e GFR) at 1 year minus baseline e GFR)/baseline e GFR], where e GFR was determined using the simplified modification of diet in renal disease equation using creatinine values within the 3 months prior to ICU admission to define baseline. patients (21 %) had a renal recovery between 50 and 89 %, 3 (16 %) had a renal recovery less than 50 %, and 12 (63 %) had a complete renal recovery (more than 90 % of recovery as compared to baseline e GFR).",

Diabetic patients had foot burns in 24, 3 %. The average healing time was 103.1 days. The healing failure rate was 30 %, and the death rate was 30 %. A poorly balanced diabetes before hospitalization doubles healing time, lengthens five times risk of sepsis and was associated with mortality in 50 % of cases. Poor glycemic control during hospitalization is multiplied by 2.5 healing period, risk of sepsis and risk of death. Increasing amounts of insulin in response to the continued high blood glucose levels was associated with lengthening healing time, a greater risk of sepsis and mortality. Severe hyperglycaemia at admission was difficult to control during hospitalization and was a marker of poor prognosis. Conclusion Diabetics patients have a higher propensity for infection which worsens prognosis. The glycemic control during hospitalization is a first-order goal.

The words used to characterize the image were distributed in 2 groups: one with 8 neutral meaning words and the other one with 10 emotional meaning words. A constant number of neutral words were used to characterize the images (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , while the number of emotional words varied from 6 to 28 from an image to the other one. For 3 images, the prognostic evaluation agreed with the real clinical evolution. For one image, which was characterized by 6 emotional words, the suspected prognosis was \"good\" or \"doesn't know\" for 14/15 doctors. Only one doctor suspected a bad prognosis and proposed a WWLST. This patient drowned and died after a WWLST decision. For the last two images, who were characterized by 24 and 28 emotional words, respectively, the suspected prognosis was \"dead\" for 8 and 9/15 doctors, respectively. Respectively 5 and 10/15 proposed a WWLST. These two patients are alive after several years, respectively, without or with minor sequela. To the question \"Do you think that a visually impressive image but without pejorative prognosis value for the radiologist risks to weigh wrongly in a decision of WWLST?\", the mean response from 1 (not at all) to 10 (completely) was 5.7. To the question \"Do you think that a not very impressive image which has a pejorative prognosis value for the radiologist has less impact on a WWLST decision than a visually impressive image with the same prognosis?\", the mean response was 5.6. Moreover, the doctors express the fact that for every situation clinical assessment is much more important than imaging and express the need to have a radiologist's and an expert's point of view for every situation. Discussion On the basis of our quiz, we could suspect that a rather unimpressive image, characterized by few emotional words, risks to lead to an excess of optimism, while a very impressive image, characterized by numerous emotional words, risks to lead to an excess of pessimism, which could lead to inadequate WWLST decisions. Our quiz overlines that the doctors are conscious of this risk and that to protect them against this risk, their WWLST decisions are based mostly on clinical examination, are helped by radiologists and experts and are always collective. In fact, real decisions for these patients weren't influenced by the impressive character of the image, as the patients with the most impressive image are alive, and the patient with the less impressive one is dead after a WWLST decision. Conclusion Our study underlines a real risk of an excessive influence of the image on the evaluation of the patient's prognosis, which could lead to inadequate WWLST decisions. The consciousness of this risk can help the physicians to develop strategies to protect themselves against this risk, first of which is the collegiality of the process decision making during WWLST.",

Characteristics of these patients on ICU admission and during ICU stay and modalities for withholding or withdrawing LST were recorded. Two analyses were performed: the first concerned all patients who died; the second, patients dying in the 72 h following ICU admission. Results During the study period, 177 (79 %) of 224 patients dying in our unit had treatment withheld or withdrawn after a mean ICU stay of 12 \u00b1 14.1 days, whereas 54 (24.1 %) patients had treatment(s) withheld (i.e., not started or not increased if already engaged), 62 (27.7 %) had one or more treatment(s) withdrawn (i.e., invasive procedures engaged were stopped) and 61 (27.2 %) had a decision to withdraw LST preceded by a withholding procedure. Mean ICU stay was, respectively, 10.3 \u00b1 13.7 days and 11.1 \u00b1 11.7 days for withheld and withdrawn patients. Withdrawal procedures occurred after a mean of 4 \u00b1 3.2 days following the decision to withhold LST in concerned patients. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was the most frequent withheld procedure (91.3 %) followed, respectively, by \"not started or not increased\" vasopressor treatment (80 %) and renal replacement therapy (68.7 %). Terminal weaning from mechanical ventilation was the most frequently withdrawn procedure (73.9 %) followed by discontinuation of vasopressor treatment (65.8 %). Therapeutic failure explained DFLST in 121 (68.3 %) patients, followed by an expected poor functional autonomy (47.4 %) and by the severity of underlying diseases (40.6 %). Factors associated with a decision of withholding or withdrawing LST were: cirrhosis [OR 11.7, 95 % CI (1. 4-19) ; p = 0.01] were associated with a decision of withholding/withdrawal of LST. Discussion Withholding and/or withdrawal of LST in European ICUs are common and variable. They are associated with age, diagnoses, ICU stay, geographic and religious factors. In our unit, we have not identified age, presence of cancer or severe co-morbidities as conditions associated with LST procedures. This is probably due to the decision making of admission or non-admission in ICU appropriate to each hospital. Cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU have high mortality rates, but recent literature recommends to actively manage these patients in ICU during few days. This approach is applied in our unit and explains our result concerning patients with cirrhosis. Withholding RRT within 3 days following ICU admission suggests that RRT is a LST seeming excessive in some patients whose characteristics must be specified. Conclusion Withholding/withdrawal of LST is common in ICU dying patients. Cirrhosis, poor previous functional status and occurrence of medical complications during ICU stay are associated with DFLST.",

He had written a letter explaining clearly that he did not wanted any resuscitation. His clinical status was a coma (Glasgow scale 7), and he would require ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. Semi-directive interviews were conducted in five ICU-practitioner volunteers who were not prepared with the clinical case. Physicians were asked to comment and justify their decision to admit or not such a patient. Interviews were conducted by a psychologist (DA), recorded and analysed using semantic analysis content (Tropes VF8) Results 'Difficult' was the mostly used word to qualify the current case and similar situations for which the interviewed physicians used to be faced in their clinical practice. Even though they actively set out their arguments about the case, some hesitations and contradictions were pointed out to justify the 'good' choice and the criteria proposed to evaluate this choice. Thus, pro and con factors used to present a rationalized final decision were associated with subjective factors. The very old age of the patient was discussed a little. In contrast, the advanced directives were intensively debated. In the context of suicide attempt, they were perceived as a 'trap' or a 'alarm for help' signal.",

The possibility of further collegial discussion after the admission was considered as an efficient safeguard to neutralize the doubts and the risks of an individual wrong decision.

It's hard for patients to write advance directives because it's not easy to formalize thoughts in writings and also to predict all possible clinical situations. Another issue is that treating physicians aren't used to talk about end of life and wait for their patients to ask about it. Discussion A stay in an intensive care unit is a good opportunity to talk about advance directives because of the lack of opportunities and all the more since those patients have a high risk to be hospitalized again in the next few months. In interviews, treating physicians admit that the talk about advance directives is often too late in the evolution of diseases. One of the reasons for the unpopularity about advance directives: physicians aren't bind by them in the French law, but they are asked to take them into account for medical decisions. Conclusion An ICU stay is a major event. Ideally, advance directives should have been made before that the ICU stay. That event is then an opportunity to revise them. The problem is complex and requires a solution at various levels: political, societal, economic, ethical, educational and relational. Various media coverage should allow to change mentalities. A bill is under discussion (2) , and it should allow a partial response to some reluctance in the writing of advance directives.",

The referrals were internal in 91 (81.3 %) cases and from other institutions in 21 (18.7 %) cases. The reasons for the refusal were: supportive care deemed \"futile\" in 58 (51.5 %) cases, supportive care deemed unnecessary in 39 (35 %) cases, inadequate technical facilities in 10 (9 %) cases and no ICU box available in 5 (4.5 %) cases. Among patients refused for \"futility, \" one or more criteria leaded to the decision: age (21.4 % of cases), acute pathology not curable (18.8 % of cases), multiple comorbidities (17.9 %), patient bedridden or suffering from severe dementia (17.9 %) and \"terminal\" comorbidity with poor short-term prognosis (11.6 % of cases). The outcome of the refused patients was evaluable in 79 of them hospitalized in the hospital. Among them, 5 patients were secondarily admitted to the ICU: 3 for worsening clinical status and 2 after revision of the initial assessment of \"futility. \" Thirty-two patients were refused for unnecessary supportive care and 4 (12.5 %) died in the hospital. Forty-seven patients were not admitted to the ICU because supportive care was deemed \"futile, \" and 31 (66 %) of them died in hospital. Among the 47 patients refused because supportive care was deemed \"futile, \" 25 (53.2 %) referrals were motivated by the need of a second doctor for ethical advisory. The intensivist called felt \"alone to decide\" in 9 (19 %) cases, and these 9 patients died (Fig. 36 ). Discussion Refusals are common in our practice. Supportive care deemed \"futile\" represents the leading reason for these refusals. In these settings, the outcome of refused patients is dark, similar to that of critically ill patients with decisions of therapeutic limitations. The ICU physician was called for ethical advisory in only half of these cases and was therefore the only decider of the therapeutic limitation in a large proportion of these patients. Conclusion Our experience highlights the need of rethinking the process leading to ICU refusal in order to promote collegiality in these decisions of therapeutic limitation. : \"the patient goes alive from the ICU so for us it's a success\".

We fail to look further than the ICU doors and to plan downstream management. 8th (5 votes): \"we will see -the problem/the family-tomorrow\". Trad: we sometimes postpone difficulties and evade our responsibilities, waiting for someone else to do it later.

Diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients during the ICU stay is a factor involved in weaning failure. It is difficult to diagnose because of a poor nonspecific and noninvasive complementary examinations carried out routinely. It therefore seems appropriate to focus on the diaphragmatic ultrasound as additional diagnostic tool, achievable by any practitioner. Discussion The ability of the EDEmax predict weaning failure was not lower than the CV, MRC score, PIM, with a threshold \u22642.7 cm in women and \u22643.5 cm in man, similar thresholds being found as predictors of CVTh \u226430 %. These thresholds were sensitized in the analysis excluding patients with cardiogenic cause of failure. In addition, the MRC score in our study appeared to underestimate isolated diaphragmatic dysfunction without associated peripheral muscle deficit. The diagnosis of diaphragmatic dysfunction, associated with weaning failure, should result in a therapeutic approach to prevent this failure, such as the prophylactic administration NAV post-extubation. Conclusion Our results confirm that the EDEmax is a useful measure to predict weaning failure, as well as the CV or PIM. In centers without access to the measurement of CV or PIM in patients intubated for resuscitation, EDEmax is probably preferable, MRC score may prove defective in patients with isolated diaphragmatic dysfunction and so does not predictive of weaning failure.",

The variability of tidal volume, inspiratory time and mean inspiratory flow is reduced during mechanical ventilation (MV). In MV patients, breathing variability has been mostly quantified with two indices: the coefficient of variation (CV) that is defined as the standard deviation to the mean ratio and the amplitude ratio of the first harmonic peak to that of zero frequency (H1/DC). Previous reports have suggested that a low variability was associated with higher rate of weaning failure and mortality. However, these studies have quantified variability either on very specific time points or on the contrary on the whole intensive care unit stay. The aim of our study was to quantify breathing variability early in the intensive care unit stay according to two different indices: the CV and the H1/DC.

Length of mechanical ventilation prior to inclusion was 5 days long . Sensitivity and specificity were plotted as functions of the ability of the coefficient of variation of the tidal volume, respiratory rate and mean inspiratory flow to predict day-28 mortality. The curves intersected at a coefficient of variation of 0.16 for tidal volume, 0.21 for respiratory rate and 0.14 for mean inspiratory flow (Fig. 38) . Mortality was significantly reduced in patients with a high coefficient of variation of tidal volume (12 vs 31 %, p = 0.024) and in patients with a low H1/DC ratio (16 vs 60 %, p = 0.04). No significant difference was observed in terms of hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator free days and duration of mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary gas exchanges were better in patients with a high coefficient of variation of tidal volume (PaO 2 /FiO 2 = 193 (88-390) vs 230 (87-395), p = 0.04). Conclusion In MV patients reaching the early phase of weaning, low variability is associated with higher mortality. High variability is associated with better oxygenation. Whether a low variability is a causative factor of mortality or a consequence of severity remains to be determined.",

The reference diagnosis of WIPO was established on the evaluation by 4 experts who were blind for the lung ultrasound results. It was based on clinical, biological, chest X-ray and echocardiography data and on clinical evolution. Lung ultrasound was performed by two investigators (AF and MG) and analysed by four authors (AF, MG, DL, and GAM). Each lung was divided into 3 areas. WIPO was diagnosed if a B profile appeared during SBT. The B profile usually indicates hemodynamic interstitial syndrome. It was defined by 1) the presence of three or more B lines associated with lung-sliding between two ribs and 2) this pattern being disseminated at the anterior chest wall. Introduction Pleural effusions (PE) are common in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, especially in patients under mechanical ventilation. Since PE can alter gas exchanges, one could hypothesize that PE could play a role in the outcome of weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, no study has yet reported the incidence and characteristics of PE in the specific context of weaning failure. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to describe the incidence of PE in patients who failed a first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). We also compared the incidence of PE in patients who failed and who succeeded their first SBT. Introduction Sepsis induces a systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction. Echocardiography is widely used to assess left ventricular (LV) diastolic function at patients' beside. The incidence of LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with sepsis ranges between 37 and 62 %. The prognostic impact of LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with septic shock remains controversial. This study aimed at evaluating a potential association between LV diastolic dysfunction identified during the initial phase of septic shock and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Conclusion These results suggest that LV diastolic dysfunction is marginally associated with ICU mortality of septic shock patients. A larger prospective multicenter study is required to confirm these results due to the selection bias of this single-center study.",

An increase in cardiac output (CO) with NE has been reported in patients with septic shock, when administered early (1) . This increase in CO was suggested to be mainly On the one hand, the sensitivity of beta1-adrenergic receptors can be abnormally reduced in septic conditions. On the other hand, the down-regulation of beta1-adrenergic receptors may occur relatively late (2) and thus could be not seen when NE is administered early. Our study was designed to examine the inotropic effects of NE when administered in the early phase of septic shock. Patients and methods We prospectively included patients suffering from septic shock and presenting with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) lower than 65 mmHg despite initial hemodynamic resuscitation and for whom the physician planned either to initiate Ne or to increase its dosage. Echocardiographic measurements were performed before (T0) and after either initiating NE or increasing its dosage in order to achieve a target MAP above 65 mmHg ( In the other 22 patients, the mean dose of NE was 0.17 \u00b1 0.45 \u00b5g/ kg/min at T0. At T1, the mean dose of NE was 0.58 \u00b1 0.54 \u00b5g/kg/min for the whole population. From T0 to T1, MAP increased significantly from 56 \u00b1 7 to 80 \u00b1 9 mmHg, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures increased from 85 \u00b1 12 to 124 \u00b1 15 mmHg and from 45 \u00b1 6 to 60 \u00b1 10 mmHg, respectively, and lactate decreased from 3.2 \u00b1 2.0 to 2.5 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/L (p < 0.05). We observed significant increases (p < 0.05) from T0 to T1 of: LVEF (from 49 \u00b1 13 to 56 \u00b1 13 %), Sm (from 10.8 \u00b1 5.1 to 12.1 \u00b1 5.0 cm/s), VTI (from 18 \u00b1 5 to 20 \u00b1 6 cm), E (from 81 \u00b1 27 to 92 \u00b1 28 cm/s), TAPSE (from 18.3 \u00b1 5.1 to 20.4 \u00b1 4.9 cm), and Sa (from 13.0 \u00b1 5.6 to 15.1 \u00b1 6.4 cm/s). Even for the 15 patients with a LVEF \u2264 45 % at T0, LVEF and VTI increased significantly from 36 \u00b1 7 to 44 \u00b1 9 % and from 16 \u00b1 6 to 18 \u00b1 7 cm, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion In spite of the increase in arterial blood pressure and thus in left ventricular afterload, NE administration at the early phase of septic shock increased the indices of left ventricular systolic function, even when the left ventricular systolic function is impaired. This suggests that NE actually exerted a significant inotropic effect at the early phase of septic shock in addition to the effect on preload.",

We recorded clinical parameters (mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR)) as well as ejection fraction (EF) using 2D echocardiography, mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) with M-Mode echocardiography, aortic velocity time integral (using pulsed Doppler) (VTI), systolic lateral LV annulus velocity using spectral tissue Doppler imaging (S) and left ventricular longitudinal stress (LVLS) using speckle tracking at baseline, during the recruitment maneuver at 40 cm H2O and 2 min after this maneuver at the chosen best PEEP. Introduction In France, children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes present often with diabetic ketoacidosis. In these circumstances multiple complications can occur as hydro-electrolytic disorders, hypoglycaemia and cerebral oedema, which is the most serious complication. Several potential risk factors for cerebral oedema have been identified; in particular, an early decrease in serum effective osmolality has been proposed as a possible mechanism. Thus, fast blood glucose drop, which is linked to osmolality, is supposed to be cerebral oedema main risk factor, although no evidence has yet been proven. The International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) recommends capillary blood glucose not to fall more than 5 mmol/l/h, and this threshold is found in several care protocols. Even though diabetic ketoacidosis complications are well known, treatment remains controversial and there is no national protocol to guide for the initial care of these patients. ",

Conclusion The patients admitted in intensive care unit for an intraabdominal surgery were more subjects to experience a secondary invasive candidiasis than other patients. Conventional risk factors for invasive candidiasis were unable to differentiate the two groups of patients, with and without secondary documented invasive candidiasis. (Table 51) . AUC/dose were not different between route (p = 0.6). Mean voriconazole absolute bioavailability was 106 % and range from 77 to 135 %. All subjects completed the study without any adverse effects. Conclusion In tube-fed ventilated critically patients, a switch to NG voriconazole after initial IV therapy to simplify the treatment of IFI could be used. Furthermore, it suggests that concurrent enteral feeding does not interfere with the absorption of voriconazole and, thus, does not have to be interrupted during voriconazole administration. All trough concentration patients were superior to the efficacy target (2 mg/L). However, after 6 days of treatment, 4 patients had trough concentration superior to upper therapeutic range target 5 mg/L. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed to avoid supratherapeutic concentration and potential neurotoxicity.",

Optimal dosing of antibiotics requires adjustment to large variability in distribution volume and renal elimination, which are characteristic of ICU septic patients. Beta-lactams (BL) are the most frequently prescribed antibiotics because of their broad-spectrum activity and low toxicity. They are time-dependent antibiotics, meaning that their trough level should be at least 5 times over the minimal inhibitory concentration of the targeted bacteria. Supra-therapeutic serum levels have been suggested to be associated with clinical-mainly neurological-toxicity. Serum levels of BL are unpredictable during acute renal failure (ARF) and renal replacement therapy (RRT).

This was a retrospective analysis of data prospectively collected into the French multicenter Outcomerea database and into the databases of the microbiological and pharmacological laboratory of the hospital. We included consecutive patients with sepsis and ARF, who had been sampled for a BL trough serum level assessment within 7 days of sepsis and 3 days after intermittent dialysis. Sera were sampled before the next administration in case of intermittent infusion and at 24 h in case of continuous infusion. Assays were performed with a microbiological method (measuring the active part of the antibiotic). Table 52 shows the BL assessed, the thresholds used and the distribution of the observed trough levels. We searched an association between overdose and clinical toxicity (coma, seizures, length of mechanical ventilation, mortality) with univariate analyses. Results One hundred and eight patients, developed 180 sepsis. 460 serum BL assessments (BL inhibitor in combination with BL antibiotic is considered as 2 assays) were performed. Most assayed antibiotics were piperacillin (25 %), tazobactam (20 %) and cloxacillin (18 %). They were delivered as follows: the mode of infusion and the interval time being decided by the attending physician according to patients characteristics: piperacillin/tazobactam: 4 g/0.5 g in 30 min, every 8, 12 or 24 h; cloxacillin: 2-8 g per 24 h by continuous infusion, or 2 g in 30 min, every 6, 8 or 12 h. The distribution of the serum levels was very scattered (see Table 52 , 3rd column). A supra-therapeutic serum level for at least one BL was observed in 96/108 (89 %) patients and 156/180 (86 %) septic events. A level in the highest quartile was observed for at least one BL in 54/108 (50 %) patients and 80/180 (45 %) septic events. Supra-therapeutic serum levels of piperacillin, tazobactam and cloxacillin were observed in 66, 55 and 31 and were in the highest quartile in 33, 23 and 14 septic events, respectively. We did not observe a statistical link between serum overdose and clinical toxicity. Conclusion Supra-therapeutic serum levels of beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly observed in our ICU patients with ARF and RRT. We could not find an association between supra-therapeutic levels and clinical toxicity. Introduction After cardiac arrest (CA) and therapeutic hypothermia (TH), a persisting coma despite discontinuation of sedatives is commonly considered as a trigger for initiation of neuro-prognostication. However, a persisting coma can also result from transient impairment of brain function. This study reports factors associated with delayed awakening in resuscitated patients treated with TH. Patients and methods All consecutive patients admitted after CA and still alive after TH were studied. Using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) assessed every 3 h, awakening was defined as 3 consecutive measurements higher than -2 and was considered delayed when occurring later than 48 h after discontinuation of sedation. Factors associated with duration of coma and delayed awakening were identified using multivariate analysis. Introduction Acute coronary syndromes are one of the main causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. These patients are at high risk of persistent platelet reactivity under aspirin treatment. We herein evaluate the biological response to aspirin and ADP inhibitors in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated by either oral or intravenous aspirin, with or without an ADP inhibitor. Patients and methods Patients were randomized to receive longterm antiplatelet treatment with either 100 mg oral or 100 mg intravenous aspirin and when necessary dual antiplatelet therapy after emergency coronary angiography. Patient's blood samples were obtained at day 3 and day 7 after cardiac arrest. Biological response to aspirin was assessed 24 h after last aspirin intake using light transmission aggregometry with arachidonic acid and the whole blood point-of-care assay PFA-100 \u00ae system with collagen-epinephrin. Biological response to ADP inhibitors was assessed using flow cytometry (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein platelet reactivity index), light transmission aggregometry with adenosine diphosphate and PFA-100 \u00ae system with collagen-adenosine diphosphate. Results Twenty-two consecutive patients were prospectively included. Thirteen patients received aspirin in the intravenous route and 9 patients in the oral route. Clinical, demographical, biological and angiographical characteristics were similar in both groups. Using light transmission aggregometry with arachidonic acid, 10 patients had persistent platelet reactivity, corresponding to 45 % of the total population. At day 3 after cardiac arrest, we found a significantly higher maximum intensity in the oral group when compared to the IV group (29 vs. 15 %, p = 0.04). The same way, closure time was significantly faster in the oral group when compared to the IV group (155 vs. 277 s, p = 0.04). We found no difference at day 7 after cardiac arrest.",

In Spl, there was no difference in the expression of surface markers between the 3-glycemic conditions. 3. The expression of surface markers in NG + Spl collapsed compared to Hpl. The DOG + Spl vs. Hpl induced increased expression of CD11b for both Monos and PMNs (p < 0.05); expression of CD62L was collapsed (10-15 times) for all conditions in Spl vs. Hpl (p < 0.05 for each one).

The incubation in plasma seemed to favor septic \"activated\" phenotypes for both granular and T Ly independently of the use of glucose (no impact of HG on phenotypes of immune cells).

            "text": "Introduction Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) play a central role in acute inflammatory and innate immune responses through production of antibacterial peptides, cytokines, pro-inflammatory mediators such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extracellular traps. PMN activation and involvement in immune defense against pathogens during septic shock have been well described. However, despite evidences showing that PMN dysfunction could be found in patients with nosocomial infections, very few studies have focused on PMN function after septic shock. Herein, we examined the hypothesis that HMGB1 could induce a PMN dysfunction after septic shock which could be reversed using an anti-HMGB1 antibody. Materials and methods In a first set of experiments, we explored PMN functions (ROS production, NETosis and bacteria killing ability) during late phase of sepsis in a murine model of CLP-induced sepsis. In a second set of experiments, we compared PMN function in patients admitted in ICU for sepsis to patients admitted for non-septic reason (control) and healthy donors. Results We found a marked PMN dysfunction after sepsis, characterized by a decreased ability to produce ROS and NETs and to kill bacteria (Fig. 42) . We also found that HMGB1 induced PMN dysfunction since plasma of septic patients induced PMN dysfunction in PMN isolated from healthy donors (Fig. 43) . Lastly, we found that anti-HMGB1 specific antibody could restore ROS production (Fig. 43) . Conclusion PMN dysfunction is evident after septic shock, induced by HMGB1. Specific inhibition could restore ROS production of PMN after septic shock and could be an interesting therapeutic approach. Introduction Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an immature leukocyte subset composed of granulocytic (GrMDSC) and monocytic (MoMDSC), are well described in neoplastic diseases as an immunosuppressive actor. This population is also present in various clinical situations marked by activation of inflammation as trauma, burns or sepsis. During sepsis this leukocyte subset could play a key role in immunosuppressive states by killing T lymphocyte. To date, only few studies specifically focused on the potential role of this leukocyte subset in sepsis. Mechanisms linked to MDSC mobilization in peripheral bloods and their origins need also to be explored to better understand their role in sepsis. The main objective of our study was to approach the kinetic of expression of MDSC in septic patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary objectives were to assess the origin of production of MDSCs and their potential association with clinical course. Materials and methods Patients hospitalized in our medical-surgical ICU for less than 24 h at inclusion with a confirmed sepsis associated with a thrombocytopenia have been prospectively studied from October 2014 to August 2015. We followed the level of MoMDSC (CD45+, CD11b+, CD14+, CD33+, HLA-DR\u2212) and GrMDSC (CD45+, Lin\u2212, HLA-DR\u2212, CD33+, CD14\u2212, CD11b+) by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood (leftover from complete blood count performed as part of routine care) at D0, D3, D7, D10 and D14. We analyzed the same populations in the leftover of bone marrow (BM) samples performed in thrombocytopenic septic patients at Day 0. We recorded the site of infection, the onset date and the microorganisms involved. Each infection was adjudicated and validated according to the diagnostic criteria of the international sepsis forum consensus conference. Clinical progression during ICU stay, occurrence of secondary infection and hospital discharge were also noted. Outpatients without any hematological or infectious disorders who were recruited at the time of anesthesia evaluation (peripheral blood analysis) or after a BM aspirate analysis considered as normal by hematologist were used as controls for comparison. MDSC results were expressed as percentages of CD45+ or as gram per liter (G/L). Results A total of 16 patients (15 septic shocks, 1 severe sepsis) with sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia were studied, and for 7 of them kinetic of MDSCs in the peripheral blood was available. Of them, 9 patients suffered from community infections. Main sites of infection were intra-abdominal (n = 8), urinary tract (n = 3) and lung infections (n = 2). All infections were documented (10 gram-negative bacilli, 6 gram-positive cocci). Median ICU stay was 8 days. ICU and hospital mortality were 31 and 44 %, respectively. At early phase of sepsis, levels of MoMDSC subset in the BM and in peripheral blood of septic patients were increased compared to controls (BM 1.31 vs 0.39 %, peripheral blood 0.36 vs 0.05 G/L). This increase was not correlated with the severity of initial sepsis. When compared to controls, septic patients had higher BM expression of GrMDCS (3.78 vs 0.18 %) but no significant increase in peripheral blood (0.06 vs 0.01 G/L, p = 0.09). During sepsis course, most of patients exhibited an increase in MDSC mobilization in peripheral blood until D7 (mean level D0: 0.23 G/L, D3: 0.72 G/L, D7: 1.1 G/L, D14: 0.34 G/L). MDSC level seems to be related to clinical course, patients with major organ failure exhibiting a higher overall MDSC level (Fig. 44) . These leukocyte subset levels did not seem to be related to the site of infection, microbiological species or specific organ failure. Conclusion During the early phase of sepsis associated with an excessive systemic inflammation, MDSC level increased secondary to a BM excretion. This result suggests that pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms overlap during the early phase of sepsis. MDSC level which appears to be correlated with clinical severity could be a regulation factor of immune reaction during sepsis. These hypotheses need to be confirmed in a larger prospective study.",

Moreover, the composition and abundance of immune cells in blood, BM, spleen and lungs did not differ between groups. Trem-1 deletion altered inflammatory cells mobilization and recruitment in lungs and spleen and favours the accumulation of reparative cells (Ly6Clow monocytes and M2 macrophages) in the lungs. This effect was even more pronounced in EndoTrem1\u2212/\u2212.

Beyond the often fatal short-term outcome, the sepsis-induced immune dysfunctions may also directly impact on the prognosis of the underlying malignancy in survivors. We are currently developing a research project in order to investigate the reciprocal relationships between bacterial sepsis and malignant tumor growth. We already reported that sepsis promoted malignant tumor growth when tumor cells were inoculated in post-septic mice. However, whether a previously established tumor might alter the septic response or whether sepsis may impact the growth of previously established tumor remains unclear. To this aim, we set up a relevant double-hit animal model through tumor inoculation followed by polymicrobial sepsis. Materials and methods We used 8-to 12-week old female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were first subjected to malignant tumor inoculation by either subcutaneous (model of local tumor) or intravenous (metastatic model) injections of the MCA205 fibrosarcoma cell line. Seven and 14 days after tumor inoculation, respectively, corresponding to early and advanced stages of malignancy, mice were subjected to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), without any subsequent antibiotic treatment. Controls comprised both noncancer mice subjected to CLP and sham-operated counterparts cancer mice subjected to sham surgery. The main endpoints were survival to polymicrobial sepsis as well as local and metastatic tumor growth. The features of anti-tumoral immune response were compared between CLP-and sham-operated cancer mice and included immune cell infiltration within tumor tissues and draining lymph nodes through flow cytometry. Results The mortality rate of polymicrobial sepsis was about 50 % in non-cancer mice and was similar in cancer mice, regardless of the inoculation route and the stage of the tumoral model. However, the 24-h bacteremia was dramatically increased in cancer mice while blood cultures remained negative in non-cancer ones. As compared to their sham-operated counterparts, the local tumor growth was strongly inhibited in CLP-operated septic mice. In the same way, polymicrobial sepsis inhibited the pulmonary metastatic spread as assessed by macroscopic lung pathology and lung infiltration onto histological slides. With respect to the distribution of immune cells within tumor tissues, we observed no differences in the proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD45+ hematopoietic cells between sham-and CLP-operated mice. However, tumors from septic mice comprised an increased proportion of monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Mo-MDSC). Sepsis also altered the cell distribution in draining lymph nodes, with a decrease in the proportion of B cell lymphocytes while the proportion of monocytes and Mo-MDSC were increased. Discussion The cellular and molecular mechanisms that account for sepsis-induced tumor inhibition are under investigation. We are currently addressing the respective contributions of host's immune response and pathogens in the control of tumor growth. Conclusion Sepsis applied to cancer mice inhibits both local and metastatic tumor development. The current results along with our previous experiments suggest a dual impact of sepsis on tumor growth depending on the sequence of the double-hit model.

            "text": "Introduction One of the major issues of the access to urgent health for patients with stroke in acute phase is the implementation of telehealth networks. Looking back on the numerous telestroke deployments already at work, there are grounds for identifying 4 critical issues as being the 4 key success factors for achieving such project as follows: training and skills maintenance of the actors, feedback about the care of stroke, ergonomic perception of telehealth tools, actual practice analysis and any updating and adjustments of protocols in different places. Telehealth platform ORTIF has been implemented since January 2015 in one of the biggest French regions and concerns 12 M inhabitants. It involves 43 hospitals, with a final objective of 100 expert and demanding hospitals, and covers the whole field of emergency neurology (neurosurgery, stroke, exacerbation of chronicle neurological disease). It enables through a digital interface on the web net, to share health and care contextual data, to transfer native radiology image data and to organize medical consultations on vid\u00e9o-link between multiple actors from multiple remote locations. Considering the multiplicity of actors involved, the GCSDSISF*in charge of the management of the project had to design a whole industrialization process of the project, including definition of guidelines, implementation, assistance and mentoring. Materials and methods A scientific committee has defined the elements of the telemedical record and the organizational and medicoeconomic methods. A hotline user was put at disposal as of actors and of the protocols of formalized degraded procedures. A person receiving benefits specialized in ergonomics met the teams implied on the pilot phase of the project to define specifications of the evolutions desired on the product and the organizations. Meetings involving the doctors, the persons in charge, the actors of the information systems and the directions of establishment made possible to define the format of the initial and the following trainings. These formations were systematically evaluated by the listeners. A site of formation e-learning was deployed. It centralizes the whole of the documents of formation, the reference frames of operation and an access to videos of demonstration of use of the platform. An analysis of impact of the implementation of these actions is carried out over the first 7 months of operation between the months of January and July 2015 on the 43 establishments deployed in completion date of analysis. Results Five hundred and fifteen actors could profit from an individual initial training to the tool and the procedures for use. The note of average satisfaction was of 3.43/4. After 7 months of use, 1271 sessions of telemedicine proceeded: 1043 for neurosurgical expertise, 66 for neurovascular expertise and 162 for expertise of neuroradiology which they are diagnostic or interventional. Increasing number of procedure was on average of 177 % between the months of April and May to the profit especially the neurosurgical expertise which profited from a preliminary experiment of telemedicine. The uses fewer in the field of emergency neurology are explained by the low number of neurovascular expert centers deployed during the first 5 months of the project but show also the importance of an accompaniment of the professionals in these new methods of medical evaluation. The proportion of recourse to the hotline (many incidents/number functional establishments) was of 2.4 at the end of the first month of the deployment and 0.78 in the last month of the analysis objectifying the functional quality of the platform. Conclusion Telemedicine must be a tool support with the beforehand definite medical organizations to allow an improvement of accessibility the care and thus of their quality. The professionals must perceive these tools like a help and not a constraint. The accompaniment of the structures and their actors is a strong challenge of the success of the deployment of such projects particularly when they imply very many establishments. The industrialization of these processes is the key.",

Haemolysis and vaso-occlusive phenomena account for acute, like vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS), and chronic complications associated with SCD. Oxidative stress has been shown to play a key role on red blood cell rigidity. Free haemoglobin (FHb) resulting from haemolysis is a powerful oxidizing agent. We aimed to analyse the usefulness of FHb concentration for stratifying SCD patients initially referred to the Emergency Room (ER), according to their definite site of care. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective monocentric observational study in all consecutive SCD patients with VOC or ACS presenting at the ER of a French university teaching hospital in Paris, between January 2013 and December 2014. The considered genotypes included HbSS and the compound heterozygous SC disease. Patients with no blood collection, or with unavailable or uncompleted medical records, were not included in the study. Plasma FHb concentration was determined by a photometric method. The healthcare pathways from the ED were separated into home discharge, hospitalization in acute wards or in intensive care unit (ICU). Demographics and clinical data are described with median [interquartile range 25-75] and number (percentage). Between groups comparisons used analysis of variance. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of 506 visits to the ED during the study period, 105 were excluded due to a lack of medical records. Altogether 277 patients presenting at the ED (401 visits) were analysed, and 215 patients (78 %) were hospitalized either in the wards (n = 184) or in the ICU (n = 31). Most of them (n = 125; 58 %) were treated with hydroxyurea. The main diagnosis at the ER guiding the decision to hospitalization was VOC (n = 204; 95 %) evolving for 1 [0] [1] Introduction Since the 2000s, the development of bacterial resistance has become a major public health problem due to unreasonable use of antibiotics despite the introduction national and international action plans.

Results On 100 patients (56 % of men) with a median age of 62 years, 34 % suffered from respiratory tract infection, 17 % of infections were digestive, 16 % of urinary origin, 14 % from skin, and more rarely stomatological or neurological origin. Penicillin were the most prescribed (approximately 40 %) with cephalosporin (only in 13 % of cases and in combination in 27 % of cases) and quinolones. 70.7 % of prescriptions were classified Gyssens I (i.e., in accordance with current recommendations). Non-compliance was essentially explained by the existence of a more effective alternative agent (16.1 % class IV), inappropriate dosage (3 % class IIa), improper route (3 % class IIc), and use of any antimicrobial not indicated (3 % class V). Most errors in prescription dealt with penicillins. Twenty-nine percentage of the patients had clinical signs of severe sepsis and 4 % of septic shock (based on the surviving sepsis campaign), but nearly half of the patients with clinical signs of severity had an error antibiotic prescription due to underestimation of the severity. Median time of prescription and administration was 3.7 and 3.9 h, respectively (significantly lengthened if the prescriber was a junior).

Use of ECMO support is associated with significant neurological complications, which may significantly impact on prognosis. Neurological status of adult patients on ECMO is hard to assess, as most of these patients are deeply sedated at the initial phase of resuscitation. Moreover, transportation for brain imaging is not easily feasible and brain MRI is contraindicated in those patients. The usefulness of electroencephalography (EEG) to predict neurological complications or outcome is poorly studied in these patients. We aimed to assess the prognostic contribution of continuous EEG monitoring (cEEG) recordings over intermittent EEG (iEEG) on outcome. . 46 The predictive role of PCC-mPFC coupling measured during coma state and neurological outcome. Functional connectivity strength between PCC-mPFC assessed at the scan time (right panel) was significantly different between comatose patients who recovered consciousness (REC) and those who evolved toward a minimally conscious state (MCS) or an vegetative state (VS) 3 month after the brain injury. PCC posterior cingulate cortex, mPFC medial prefrontal cortex Introduction Acute brain injury in neurological critical care is commonly associated with an early rise of intracranial pressure (ICP). In some patients, ICP rises sharply during a secondary stage of hypertension between 7 and 15 days. This delayed intracranial hypertension (ICHP) often evolves into a dramatic refractory edema, unresponsive to heavy therapeutic measures (deep sedation, hypertonic saline solutions, hypothermia, and decompression surgery) eventually leading to death. Many studies have shown that glucocorticoids (GC) therapy at the early stage of acute brain injury is associated with a significant rise in death rate or disability (1). However, GC therapy has not yet been investigated for treating this delayed, refractory ICHP after acute brain injury. We hypothesized that GC therapy is associated with a reduction of ICP, better cerebral perfusion pressure and survival improvement.

Patients were excluded if GC therapy was started prior to the admission in ICU for any other reason. ICP measurements were recorded every 4 h for each patient beginning 3 days before the GC therapy and ending 5 days after the GC therapy. Then, we studied the evolution of the median and the maximal value of ICP daily during those 8 days using pairwise comparisons (Friedman test). Results Eighteen patients met inclusion criteria. Seven were excluded, due to GC being administered prior to the admission in order to treat preexistent neoplasic or parasitic diseases. Five were admitted in the ICU for intracerebral hemorrhage, four for severe traumatic brain injury, one for acute ischemic stroke, and one for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Introduction The aim of the early talks (ET) to the relatives is to introduce organ donation (OD) before the occurence of brain death (BD) and to search intent of the potential donor not to be a donor. This paper aims at describing the results of ET method compared to the standard practice that introduces OD once BD has occured. Patients and methods In 2012, ET procedures have been employed among intensive care unit (ICU), emergency room (ER) and stroke unit. The ET method is used when patients are diagnosed with unrecoverable brain damage, possibly leading to BD, with close relatives made aware of the situation and have agreed to withdraw invasive treatments. The interview highlights several points among which are patients' current state, the believed evolution of that state, OD in case of BD, its approval or disapproval from close relatives as well as a time frame of 72 h after which withdrawal of treatments will be done if BD doesn't occur. All the collected information from potential donors is registered and helps to provide a comparison between the ET and the standard BD practice. III) . Twenty-three patients were in this case, and 9 were less than 60 years old (between the ages of 40-56), 5 of which cardiac arrest happened within 3 h after withdrawal of treatments (Table 56) . Discussion The ET method has become a common practice when the decision has been made to withdraw intensive treatments for patients who can potentially become brain dead. It helps providing clearer information to relatives and the disapproval rate has not risen with the ET methods. It allows an earlier withdrawal of treatments if OD was disapproved while pursuing care for a potential donor, thus increasing the chances to provide viable organ. The outcome of using ET seems overall positive for both the close relatives and medical staff. However, further study is needed to evaluate the relatives' satisfaction. Conclusion ET has become a common practice in our unit, and it is not a associated with increasing of OD denial and has helped increasing the number of donors. The procedures were performed completely without any additional drugs in 73 patients (92 %), whereas propofol was added in 6 (8 %). Six patients presented side effects including bradypnea (n = 5) and hypotension (systolic arterial pressure of 70 mmHg, n = 1) that occured during the procedure and were completely reversible with TCI goal decrease. Thus, the procedures were performed entirely without additional anesthesia or complication in 67 patients (87 %). Confort was assessed in 52 patients (66 %): 43 patients (8 %) stated that they felt comfortable and experienced a bearable pain or no pain at all, 9 patients (17 %) had a moderate pain, and none felt severe pain. Among the 49 patients who were asked, 43 (88 %) answered that they would agree to have the same procedure in the same conditions. Conclusion Our findings suggest that TCI of Remifentanil may be useful and safe for performing procedures generating pain or discomfort in the ICU, with acceptable patient's comfort and tolerance, even in those with respiratory failure. The study completion should strengthen these preliminary results.",

We identified the following risk factors for mortality in univariate analyses: hematological underlying disease and factors at RRT initiation including: fluid overload \u226520 %, PELOD score \u226520 and higher creatinine. Of those risk factors, only PELOD score \u226520 was significant in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 4.5; 95 % CI 1.4-14.1; p = 0.01).

As for epinephrine, they recommend its use as a first-line drug in cold shocks resistant to a well-conducted fluid resuscitation or as a second-line drug in \"cold\" shocks resistant to dopamine or \"warm\" shocks resistant to norepinephrine. However, those recommendations are only based on adult or neonatal references that can hardly be applied to children as the physiopathology of children's septic shock is different on several aspects. Thus, our study constitutes the first specifically pediatric work on epinephrine use in septic shock. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center, observational study of all children (newborn excluded) treated for septic shock, upon admission or during their hospitalization in our ward, between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2013. The patients were divided in two groups: \"with\" and \"without\" epinephrine use. Medical and paramedical files were reviewed for a complete description of each group: sociodemographic, clinical and biological data, vasoactive drugs (especially epinephrine) modality of prescription, patients' outcome (mortality at 28 days) were collected. We then performed a comparison between the two groups in univariate and multivariate analysis. Results One hundred and seventeen patients corresponded to the pediatric definition of septic shock and were included: 68 (51.8 %) in the group without epinephrine use, 49 (41.9 %) in the group with epinephrine use. 78.6 % of the patients had an underlying comorbidity, immunodeficiency concerned almost half of them (46.2 %). More than half of the septic shocks were nosocomial (59.8 %), acquired in our PICU or in another ward of the hospital. Epinephrine was prescribed for myocardic dysfunction (36.7 %), cardiac arrest (30.6 %) and persistent hypotension (24.5 %). Compared to patients without epinephrine use, patients treated with epinephrine were more severe at the onset of the septic shock, both clinically (with 4-6 organ dysfunction in 68.7 vs 45.2 % cases; p = 0.02) and biologically (lactate level of 4.15 vs 2.20 mmol/l; p = 0.0008). Our delay before initiating epinephrine was four times longer than the one prescribed in the international pediatric guidelines, and patients were then in a severe clinical and biological state. Above all, patients treated with epinephrine had a worse outcome than patients treated without. Not only did they need continuous renal replacement therapy more frequently (32.7 vs 6 %; p = 0.0002), but they also had a higher mortality rate at 28 days (63.3 vs 16.2 %; p < 0.0001) in univariate and multivariate analysis after adjustment on the initial gravity. Finally, we highlighted a potential association between the maximum epinephrine dose used and death with a 100 % death rate for an epinephrine maximum dose over 1.90 mg/kg/min. Conclusion Acknowledging the fact that patients treated with epinephrine have a higher mortality rate than patients treated without three questions can be raised in order to improve the patients' outcome. Isn't a better initial monitoring of our patients necessary to determine their hemodynamic profile at best and prescribe the most appropriate drug? As patients were clinically and biologically severe when epinephrine was prescribed, would an earlier initiation of epinephrine have a beneficial effect on the mortality rate of these patients? As a potential relation exists between the maximum dose of epinephrine used and the mortality rate, would alternative therapeutics such as the ECMO be beneficial beyond a given maximum dose of epinephrine?",

Adult and paediatric data suggest that goaldirected sedation algorithms allow a more appropriate adaptation of the treatment to the patient's need and permit a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a nurse-driven sedation protocol in our paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) on duration of mechanical ventilation, total doses and duration of medications, PICU length of stay, incidence of ventilator-associated-pneumonia and occurrence of withdrawal. Patients and methods After development of the sedation protocol in January 2014, we realised a before and after protocol implementation study in a 23-bed medical-surgical PICU at a university children's hospital. We included all children aged from 0 to 18 years, requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 24 h. Prior to implementation of the protocol, analgesia and sedation were managed by the attending physician's order. Afterwards, post-implementation, nurses managed analgesia and sedation following an algorithm, including COMFORT-B scale. Data were collected from computerised medical chart, and descriptive and comparative analyses were done. Results We included 200 patients, 107 who were consecutively admitted before the implementation of the protocol between January and December 2013 and 93 who were admitted after the implementation, between May 2014 and March 2015. The characteristics of the two populations were similar, except that there was significantly more patients admitted for chirurgical pathology in the period \"after\" (38 vs 24 %, p = 0.04). Median duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly reduced in the group subjected to the nurse-driven protocol: 4. was also reduced (17 vs 28 mg/kg, p = 0.05), and duration of sufentanil administration (112 vs 157 h, p = 0.05). We observed fewer withdrawal's symptoms (14 vs 24 %, p = 0.09) in the period \"after, \" but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The use of the protocol improved sedation evaluation by increasing the number of total scores and of scores indicating adequate sedation (COMFORT-B between 11 and 17); but was, on the contrary, not associated with more agitation episodes or unplanned endotracheal extubation. Discussion These preliminary results are promising and allow us to think that implementation of a nurse-driven sedation protocol in a PICU is feasible and present a lot of advantages. To our knowledge, this is the first study, showing a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation. It would have to be confirmed on a larger cohort and after a longer use of the protocol. Adjusted analysis would have to be done on confounding factor like age or diagnosis at admission. In the future, it could be relevant to make a staff survey about the use of the algorithm, corresponding to a deep change in practices. Conclusion One of the actual challenges is to enhance the sedation management of the critically ill patients. Implementation of a nursedriven sedation protocol in a PICU seems to be associated with shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, lower total doses of benzodiazepine, shorter administration of opioid and stricter evaluation of the sedation scores.",

Box plots illustrate the median values, interquartile range, and spread Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs in intensive care units (ICU) and is associated with poor outcomes, including persistent kidney injury evolving to chronic kidney disease. If sepsis is the main cause for AKI, diagnostic procedures and drugs, may also contribute to renal failure. Aminoglycosides, such as Amikacin (AMK), are potent, highly bactericidal antibiotics, increasingly used in ICU to broaden the spectrum against gram-negative bacilli during septic shock. They may have an acute tubular toxicity leading to AKI. Recently, French practice guidelines recommended using AMK with once-daily dosing regimen of 25 mg/kg over 30 min in order to reach a peak plasma concentration ranging from 60 to 80 mg/l 30 min after the end of injection. No AMK dose adjustment is recommended for the first dose in patients with acute or chronic kidney failure. The oncedaily regimen is known to be protective for kidneys. Whether this high dose implies a greater risk of nephrotoxicity or not remains unknown. Thus, we performed a retrospective study to assess the association between the peak concentration of AMK and the class of AKI at day 90.",

Clinical and biological features, including severity scores and nephrotoxic use, were recorded. Creatinine plasma levels were followed until 90 days after the first injection of AMK. We assessed the association between peak concentration of AMK and kidney function at day 90. A negative binomial model was used to compute the KDIGO class at day 90. Discussion In our study, following guidelines, 75 % of patients had a peak concentration of AMK above minimal concentration targets. AMK was used, regardless of kidney function at the time of the first dose. AKI class at day 90 was associated with initial intensity of extra-renal failures and kidney injury but not with the peak concentration of amikacin. The small number of patients enrolled and the high number of early death limit the power of our study. Conclusion High-dose short-course once-daily regimen for treatment with AMK reaches the peak concentration target and may not worsen renal recovery at day 90.",

The aim of the present analysis was to determine the MAP target for a specific patient profile, during septic shock resuscitation. Patients and methods Six hundred and seventy-four of the 776 patients from SEPSISPAM prospective cohort were analyzed in per protocol, excluding patients with major protocol deviation (target pressure not reached because the vasopressor treatment was not adjusted; no septic shock) and patients for whom a decision not to resuscitate was taken after the inclusion.",

Chronic hypertensive patients resuscitated with a low-MAP target had a significantly increased risk of doubling of plasma creatinine (HR 2.14, p = 0.01). Hypertensive patients without acute kidney injury at admission had a lower risk of doubling of creatinine (p = 0.01) when they were resuscitated with a high-target MAP compared to those in low-target group. Conversely, in patients with already installed acute kidney injury at inclusion, a high-target MAP was not associated with a better renal outcome as compared to the low-MAP target. Discussion The MAP that should be targeted in patients with septic shock is still matter of debate. The main issue is probably that the optimal MAP target differs among patients, according to his/her medical history, and this is the point we specifically examined in the present analysis. When acute kidney injury is already installed, increasing MAP target might be detrimental due to increased vasopressor load, which in turn may increase adverse events and especially cardiac side effects. Conclusion Chronic hypertensive patients without acute kidney injury at admission benefit from resuscitation with high-MAP target during septic shock. Instead, when acute kidney injury is diagnosed, increasing MAP target might be detrimental.",

Discussion We confirm that fibrinolysis assessed by ECLT is altered in critically ill patients, and this alteration is more pronounced in septic patients. ECLT does not correlate with mortality or organ dysfunction in our study, which could be due to low mortality rate and severity score of included patients. ECLT does, however, correlate with ICU length of stay. Interestingly, fibrinolysis impairment correlates with CRP levels. This relationship could be part of the link between inflammation and coagulation in critically ill patients, as suggested by murine and in vitro data. Indeed, specific effects of CRP on the fibrinolytic system were reported, including increased expression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 gene and decreased activity of tissue plasminogen activator. Conclusion ECLT correlates with ICU length of stay but not with mortality or organ dysfunction.

            "text": "Early detection of disseminated intravascular coagulation during septic shock: a multicentre prospective study Discussion DIC remains a challenge for many clinicians and biologists. Since coagulation constitutes a first line of defence in sepsis, accurate DIC diagnosis is essential to distinguish an appropriate patient to treat with an appropriate treatment at the right moment. DIC can be efficiently diagnosed on admission with JAAM 2006 score. Among patients who had not developed patent DIC on admission (JAAM < 4), some would present a so-called preDIC state retrospectively diagnosed during the following hours (JAAM \u2265 4). Early recognition of patients who will not develop DIC with a new score would be a valuable tool to avoid inappropriate antithrombin or thrombomodulin therapy. In our study, they represented about one-third of all DIC patients. ISTH \"non-overt\" score is not useful for DIC prediction as assessed by our false-positive and false-negative results. Non-overt DIC (according to ISTH) and non-patent DIC on admission (DIC-D2) may represent two different states of coagulopathy. Conclusion Procoagulant MPs from endothelial cells and leucocytes reflect a vascular injury during sepsis-induced DIC that precedes obvious activation of coagulation. A combination of prothrombin time, endothelium-derived CD105+-MPs and platelet count on admission could predict the absence of DIC and allow a better stratification in future RCTs.",

            "text": "Introduction Septic shock is associated with activation/dysregulation of blood coagulation, but assessment of this (unbalanced) adaptive response is still matter of debate and a clinical challenge. Despite experimental proof-of-concept, anticoagulant treatments failed to improve survival in large, randomised, placebo-control trials. Regarding coagulation, the inadequate stratification of septic shock patients could, at least in part, explain these negative results. This study was designed to evaluate haemostasis activation/dysregulation using routine and non-routine tests eventually combined according to DIC scoring systems. Patients and methods Two hundred and sixty-five patients with septic shock were included in 3 medical intensive care units. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial prothrombin time, fibrinogen, D-dimers, fibrin monomers, antithrombin, protein C and prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 were measured at admission. Results DIC was present in 102/265 patients according to JAAM score. ISTH 'overt' and 'non-overt' scores allowed to diagnose 90 DIC and 88 pre-DIC, respectively, with a relative accordance between scores (k values were 0.78 (JAAM/'overt') and 0.70 (JAAM/'non-overt'). DIC diagnosis was associated with mortality when JAAM score was \u22655 points (HR 0.53 [0.30-0.75], p = 0.006). Patients were thereafter allocated to 3 groups according to their JAAM score as follows: 1-2 points (minimal, n = 128), 3-4 (intermediate, n = 54) and 5-8 (patent, n = 83). Patients in the third group were more severely ill (SAPS2 and SOFA) with higher 28-day mortality, impaired fibrin formation and decreased inhibitors. Fibrinogen, FV, AT, PC and FM (not included in JAAM score) were not associated with DIC diagnosis in multiple logistic regression analysis. Nevertheless, abnormal values were frequently observed in septic shock patients regardless of DIC diagnosis: 56.2 % for AT (47.2 % and 70.6 % for non-DIC and DIC patients, respectively), 73.6 % for PC (63.8 and 92.2 %) and 65.3 % for FM (63.8 and 67.6 %). Fibrinogen was elevated (above 4 g/L) in 73.6 % of patients (84.0 and 56.9 %, respectively). A low fibrinogen (<1 g/L-ISTH 'overt' cut-off ) was present in seven patients (2.6 %), all of whom were diagnosed with DIC according to JAAM, ISTH 'overt' and 'non-overt' scores. Generated thrombin (evaluated by prothrombin fragments 1 + 2) was elevated in two-thirds of the patients regardless the occurrence of DIC. Discussion Physiology could explain why clinical trials, aiming at down-regulating thrombin generation, have been unsuccessful: thrombin is fundamental for survival during septic shock; it has multiple cellular and extracellular effects and may not be considered as a 'murderer' during septic shock. Excessive thrombin generation appears to play a different role in patients with or without DIC, and the lack of soluble fibrin monomers polymerization could be one. Fibrin polymerisation requires an activated transglutamase (FXIIIa) to bridge soluble FM. Delayed platelet activation may explain the impairment in fibrin formation reported in DIC. Interestingly, moderate thrombophilia, characterised by recurrent thrombosis, may favour survival during septic shock. Indeed, patients with aPC resistance (FVR506Q) had a better outcome. On the other hand, genetic (FVIII or FIX deficiencies) or drug-induced (vitamin K-antagonists) haemorrhagic diathesis failed to protect against experimental septic shock and death. Until now, anticoagulant treatment favoured survival in septic shock only when DIC was established. A better assessment of DIC may improve clinical trial design as well as patient survival. Conclusion Low-grade activation of haemostasis assessed by JAAM score less than 5 could favour survival during septic shock. Only a rigorous scoring system may help clinicians to target the 'good treatments for the good patients' .",

            "text": "Results Two hundred and sixty-two septic shock patients were included. The median age was 66 years (56-76), and median SOFA and IGS II scores were 10 (8-12) and 53 (39-77), respectively. The mortality calculated after exclusion of patients that underwent early life support therapy limitation was 28.7 % at day 30 (n = 58) and 33.1 % at day 90 (n = 62). Comparative analysis concerned 195 patients who survived to vasopressors weaning. Among them, 22 % (n = 43) received an early antihypertensive therapy within the 24 h following vasopressors weaning. Patients who received an early antihypertensive treatment after vasopressors weaning did not differ significantly in terms of age, severity scores, past history of high blood pressure or antihypertensive medication, chronic renal insufficiency, endocrinopathy, source of infection, volume resuscitation, weight gain during ICU stay, biological findings, or of norepinephrine treatment duration and maximum dose. In univariate analysis, patients with early antihypertensive therapy after vasopressors weaning presented more frequently gram-negative infection (33.6 %, n = 14 vs 23.2 %, n = 35; p < 0.001) and received more frequently dobutamine (13.9 %, n = 6 vs 5.8 %, n = 9; p = 0.006), hydrocortisone opotherapy (55.8 %, n = 24 vs 45.9 %, n = 70; p = 0.02) and renal replacement therapy (25.6 %, n = 11 vs 15.3 %, n = 23; p = 0.06). In multivariate analysis, predictive factors for developing early high blood pressure were past history of ischemic heart disorder (p = 0.001) and support by mechanical ventilation (p = 0.01). Necessity of starting an early antihypertensive treatment after vasopressors weaning was associated with a better survival at day 30: 94.5 % (n = 35/37) vs 82.5 % (n = 113/137), p < 0.001. In multivariate analysis, early high blood pressure development was predictive of survival at day 30 (OR 0.03, p = 0.03) whereas underlying rhythmic heart disorder seemed predictive of increased mortality (OR 24, p = 0.03). Discussion Our results suggest that the development of an arterial high blood pressure within 24 h following norepinephrine weaning is a frequent phenomenon affecting nearly a quarter of patients who survived the phase of initial resuscitation. The studied population was comparable to that of the recent studies about septic shock. General characteristics did not appear to be related with the arising of this event. Initial management (doses and modalities of norepinephrine and fluid resuscitation) did not seem to be involved either. The role of an underlying rhythmic or ischemic heart disorders could influence different load adaptation. Association with a favorable survival outcome at day 30 is limited but could reflect more advanced correction of tissue perfusion abnormalities at norepinephrine weaning time in patients requiring an early antihypertensive therapy. Conclusion Development of an arterial high blood pressure within 24 h following vasopressors weaning in septic shock is a frequent event. It could be a protective marker regarding mortality at day 30 for patients who survived to vasopressors weaning. Physiopathological substratum of this phenomenon remains uncertain and needs further studies. Introduction In large-scale trials, endotracheal intubation (EI) associated with mechanical ventilation is performed in 40-85 % of patients with septic shock possibly indicating an important variation in practice across physicians. No study has been dedicated until now to define the place of this procedure in shock patients, and recent guidelines does not put forward any recommendation. The objective of the study was to determine the characteristics associated with endotracheal intubation in septic shock patients. Patients and methods This is a post hoc analysis of the database of the SEPSISPAM study, including patients with septic shock. Results Among the 776 SEPSISPAM patients, 633 (82 %) were intubated within 12 h of study inclusion (early intubation), 113 (15 %) were never intubated, and 30 (4 %) had delayed intubation. ICUs with at least 10 patients included were classified according to frequency of early intubation: early intubation <80 % of patients (lowest frequency: 7 ICUs, 254 patients), 80-90 % (middle frequency: 5 ICUs, 170 patients), >90 % (highest frequency: 6 ICUs, 297 patients). Type of ICU, pulmonary infection, lactate >2 mmol/l, lower PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and absence of immunosuppression were independently associated with early intubation. Patients never intubated had a lower initial severity, less frequent pulmonary source of infection, were more likely to have immunosuppression, lower ICU and hospital length of stay and a low mortality rate. In comparison with patients intubated early, patients with delayed intubation had fewer days alive without organ support by day 28. Early EI varied from 56 to 100 % across ICUs. ICUs with the highest frequency of early intubation had a higher mortality rate in comparison with ICUs with middle frequency of early intubation. A nonsignificant increase in mortality was observed in ICU with lowest frequency of early intubation. No statistical difference was observed between the 3 types of ICU for university status, medical/surgical admission, number of beds per ICU and senior physician presence (Fig. 51) . Conclusion We observed a wide variation of early EI practice across centers independent from acute severity parameters and presence of immunosuppression. Our result suggests that practices regarding endotracheal intubation in septic shock may impact outcome, which opens the way for future studies.",

            "text": "Introduction Fluid overload in septic intensive care unit patients is common, and recent studies have demonstrated that it is strongly associated with a poor outcome. In fact, we think that fluid overload is mainly the reflection of the intensity of capillary leak. Capillary leak is a determining factor of shock in sepsis, leading to hypovolemia and microcirculation alteration. Thus, hypovolemia and edema are the two faces of one pathophysiologic change in wall of microvessels, i.e., capillary permeability. Unfortunately, no treatment is capable of decreasing vascular permeability in sepsis at present. Fluid replacement appears to be a poor symptomatic treatment, compensating only the leak flow and fueling formation of edema in the more elastic body tissues. Here, we propose an original therapeutic approach aiming to limit capillary leak in septic shock by means of total body contention. The principle of this method is to antagonize the distension of soft tissues of the trunk and limbs, which allows capillary fluid leak to continue. Subcutaneous tissue being by definition extensible (such as the cutaneous envelope), the volume they can \"accept\" can grow without a dramatic increase in pressure in the interstitial space. In this way, the pressure gradient stays favorable for the leak from vascular to interstitial compartments, despite the presence of edema. We hypothesize that capillary leak in septic shock can be quantitatively contained by limiting soft tissue extension at the onset of disease, using contention bandages on a large proportion of the body surface. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency, tolerance and feasibility of a new mechanistic treatment based on this hypothesis. Patients and methods This is a phase II multicenter single-arm trial in critically ill, non-surgical septic patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The study protocol was approved by an ethics committee (CPP). The therapeutic intervention is the application of contention bandages on more than 80 % of the body surface, initiated at the onset of septic shock. Contention is maintained until fluid balance is negative on two consecutive days. We chose inelastic, short-stretch bandages to apply limited interface pressure on an already poorly perfused skin. Primary outcome is neutral or negative net fluid balance on day 7 (defined by a fluid balance \u2264+500 cc). Secondary outcomes are cumulative fluid balance, daily SOFA scores, death, duration of mechanical ventilation, occurrence of skin ulcers under bandages, reproducibility of interface pressure, monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure and monitoring of respiratory parameters correlated with chest wall compliance such as plateau pressure and dynamic compliance. The design is a two-staged Simon's plan, a methodology inspired by phase II cancer drug trials. Briefly, our primary outcome will be expressed as a response rate ( % of patients achieving a negative fluid balance at day 7) compared to existing data issued from a previous septic shock cohort recruited in our center. A sample size of 45 patients with available data at day 7 was calculated to demonstrate an increase in success rate of 20 %, from 50 % (success rate of septic shock patients from our cohort) to 70 %.",

Median Simplified Acute Severity Score (SAPS II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) are 65 and 12, respectively. Eleven patients among the 16 (69 %) with available data at day 7 have a neutral or negative fluid balance. Cumulative fluid balance at day 4 is +5.9 L. Adverse events are limited for the time being to minor skin ulcers (stage I) in 4 patients (18 %), which did not require contention retrieval. Monitoring of abdominal pressure revealed a slight increase with contention (+2.5 mmHg), but no case of persistent abdominal hypertension is reported. Monitoring of airway pressure showed no significant increase in plateau pressure and dynamic compliance difficulties with mechanical ventilation, and in our clinical experience there were no respiratory issues attributable to contention. Conclusion The preliminary results of the COCOONs trial are encouraging, showing an increase in the percentage of patients with a neutral or negative fluid balance at day 7 compared to a local cohort, despite higher severity scores in our patients. The cumulative fluid balance at day 4 is almost half of what was reported in a reference study (Boyd et al, 2011) . The tolerance is excellent. If those results are confirmed, a randomized controlled study will be conducted. Introduction Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is proposed for patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ECMO allows maintaining oxygenation under protective ventilation until patient's recovery, but complications are not rare and can lead to fatal outcome. Despite few studies, the decision to initiate ECMO is controversial and an European consensus conference recommends referral centres associated with a circulatory support mobile unit available 24/7 and ready to intervene in all healthcare centres in the region concerned. 1 The aim of this study is to describe and compare outcomes of patient accepted for ECMO to those refused. Materials and methods This is a retrospective study between 2012 and 2015 at the Universitary Hospital of Bordeaux. Indication of ECMO (veinoveinous) was decided using CESAR study criteria. 2 Recused patients stayed at the calling hospital and were categorized in \"\"contraindication\" group (CI) and \"to optimize\" group (AO).",

Discussion Mortality was high in both groups ECMO and non-ECMO, confirming severity of ARDS. Our study identifies a group of patients (AO) proposed to ECMO but, in our opinion, not enough severe to receive it immediately. These patients, with optimization of ventilator settings or implementation of adjuvant therapy, rapidly increase their oxygenation within 24 h and have a low mortality. Interestingly in non-ECMO patients, the PRESERVE score was higher in the CI group. Conclusion This suggests that the decision to initiate ECMO is difficult. A referral centre with a high number of calls and a follow-up of recused patients might help to improve this decision and probably avoid ECMO with its associated complications in some cases.",

The definition of PGD is based on the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and the presence of lung infiltrates on chest X-ray. Lung ultrasonography (LU) and extravascular lung water indexed to predicted body weight (EVLWi) are reliable methods for quantifying lung edema. We assessed whether LU and EVLWi were associated with grade 3 PGD. Patients and methods Design and patients All patients scheduled to receive single or bilateral lung transplantation were screened for inclusion between July 2013 and September 2014. Data collection PGD was graded according to the ISHLT criteria. Chest X-rays were interpreted independently by two physicians blinded to the clinical variables, with adjudication of disagreements. The classification k for agreement on grade 3 PGD was 0.93. Grading ISHLT was performed at 4 time points: within the 6 h after ICU admission and over the following 3 days at 10 am. The worst grading of PGD was used to classify patients. The use of rescue therapies for severe hypoxemia was considered when the following criteria were fulfilled: prone positioning (PP) if PaO 2 /FiO 2 was lower than 150 mmHg, continuous neuromuscular blocking agents infusion (NMBA) if PaO 2 /FiO 2 was lower than 120 mmHg, iNO if PaO 2 /FiO 2 was lower than 100 mmHg despite PP and NMBA infusion and veno-venous ECMO according to the French recommendations. Transpulmonary thermodilution and lung ultrasound During the transplantation, two thermodilution measurements were realized during chest-closed periods, one after induction of anesthesia and the second after the end of the surgical procedure. Thermodilution and LU scores were then performed during the three-day period following lung transplantation at the PGD assessment time points. Lung ultrasound examination was conducted using two specific methods: the echo comet score (ECS) and the 12-region technique (LUS). Due to barriers to US resulting from pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, chest tubes or thoracic dressings, we weighted every score obtained by the number of interspaces (for the ECS) or areas (for the LUS) available. Results Between August 2013 and September 2014, 36 patients were included prospectively. All except one underwent bilateral sequential single-lung transplantation. Thirteen patients (36 %) presented PGD grade 3 during the first 3 days following ICU admission. In the grade 3 PGD group, crystalloids infusion was larger during the transplantation procedure than the one without grade 3 PGD. Overall ICU mortality was only 3 % (one death in the grade 3 PGD group). In the grade 3 PGD group, ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were longer and the probability of rescue therapies need was higher.",

Consensual definition of severe leptospirosis is somehow lacking. Reunion Island is one of the few regions with a high endemicity rate where every kind of organ support is available, including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The aim of this study is to determine the mortality rate of leptospirosis in an intensive care unit (ICU) where all kinds of organ supports are available and to asses the organ failures. This would help to define what severe leptospirosis is, in order to decide what patients must to be admitted in ICU. Patients and methods This is a retrospective study from January 2004 to January 2015. All patients admitted with leptospirosis in two critical care units (Reunion Island, France) were included. We collected demographic, clinical and biological data and performed bivariate analysis to examine risk factors associated with mortality. Results One hundred and thirty-four patients were included with biological diagnostic confirmed in 100 % of the cases. Mortality rate in ICU was 6 %. Mean Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS)-2 was 40 \u00b1 19, and mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 10 \u00b1 4. Mean age was 41 \u00b1 15 years. Acute renal failure was identified in 95 % of cases, thrombopenia in 93 % of the cases and hyperbilirubinemia in 90 % of the cases. Pulmonary involvement was frequent, with 40 % alveolar hemorrhage. Twenty-one percent of the patients presented moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), according to the Berlin definition. All patients have been treated by antibiotics. Fifty-six percent of the patients underwent CRRT, 31 % underwent invasive mechanical ventilation and 4 % underwent ECMO. Mean time for CRRT setup was 1 [1] [2] day. Mean time for tracheal intubation was 12 [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] h. Risk factors associated with mortality were SAPS-2, SOFA score, neurological and/or respiratory failure on admission, alveolar haemorrhage, time between onset of symptoms and antibiotherapy, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, need for vasoactive support, kaliemia, pH, lactate, base excess, bilirubinemia and blood products transfusion. Main cause for mortality was refractory ARDS (62 % of cases). All deceased patients had required oxygen support or were already under invasive mechanical ventilation upon admission. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the largest case series of patients admitted for leptospirosis in ICU. This study pinpoints two important findings in this young population, such as the association of a very low mortality rate despite high severity scores and a strong association between respiratory failure and death. Prompt organ support, including CRRT and mechanical ventilation, is most probably the main explanation for such low mortality rate. All patients requiring oxygen support, even if as little as 1 L/min, should promptly be admitted in ICU. CRRT should in no way be delayed in patients presenting with kaliemia >4 mmol/L and oligo-anuria. Hyperbilirubinemia is for the first time to be identified as a risk factor for mortality, but it has already been described as a risk factor for mortality in ARDS. Cause or effect, it may participate to the particular pattern of pulmonary failure in leptospirosis.",

Five sessions of 10 min were evaluated: a baseline period with spontaneous breathing (SB), followed by a randomised sequence of four conditions: 5 L/min with conventional nasal canulas, and 20, 40 and 60 L/min with high-flow nasal cannulas. During the whole protocol, FiO 2 was set at 0.21. The primary outcome was the work of breathing (WOB), computed from esophageal pressure and tidal volume, which was estimated by respiratory inductive plethysmography. We also measured and calculated the esophageal pressure-time product (PTPeso), minute ventilation, capillary blood gases at the end of each tested condition, airway resistance and compliance. Results Recruitment is still under progress. We report here the data of a preliminary analysis performed in 8 subjects. vs. 9.5 \u00b1 3.0 vs. 7.6 \u00b1 2.4 breaths/min, respectively; p < 0.0001). This resulted in similar minute volumes between baseline, 5 and 20 L/ min (5.42 \u00b1 1.02 vs. 5.01 \u00b1 1.59 vs. 5.33 \u00b1 2.09 L/min, respectively; p = 0.41), whereas a significant decrease was found with 40 and 60 L/ min (4.04 \u00b1 1.36 and 4.18 \u00b1 1.22 L/min respectively; p = 0.009 vs. baseline). pH, PaCO 2 and SpO 2 were not significantly modified during the study periods. Respiratory compliance was not significantly different between the study periods either (p = 0.74), but mean airway inspiratory resistances did increase with increasing flows (14.6 \u00b1 4.4 vs. 15.6 \u00b1 4.5 vs. 18.9 \u00b1 6.2 vs. 22.5 \u00b1 7.1 vs. 25.7 \u00b1 9.6 cmH2O/L/s, respectively, for SB, 5, 20, 40 and 60 L/min; p = 0.01). Discussion To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the work of breathing during NHF in healthy adult subjects.

It is well accepted that \"bed-in-chair\" sitting, first chair sitting exercise, passive verticalization and walking are crucial steps to better rehabilitation in the ICU and after patients have left the ICU. We aimed at assessing the real-life conditions performance of early rehabilitation practices in ICUs and to study why there are sometimes limitations to a large use of such training for patients. Materials and methods A prospective telephone inquiry was performed from February to March 2015 in 35 ICU (25 from university hospitals), representing 1046 beds; it recorded data on ICUs and on the real-life practice of rehabilitation in the setting of 5 clinical cases (1 coma patient undergoing mechanical ventilation weaning yet he was on low tapering NE infusion, 1 ARDS, 1 COPD under noninvasive ventilation, 1 acute/chronic liver failure patient infused tapering doses of norepinephrine, 1 postoperative patient) For each case, staff were questioned on the practice of transferring from flat bed to chair; bed in armchair positioning; transferring to edge of bed; standing position; and marching.

Conclusion Despite low sedation, many critically ill patients are readily installed in a bed in armchair position because this position does not include danger and allows easy visual control. Postoperative patients with complicated surgical devices are not often proposed for early mobilization from bed: Nurses and physiotherapists bring up the problem of understaffing.

Introduction Motor imagery can be used in conjunction with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to study brain plasticity during motor recovery for non-highly selected stroke patients. The presumed advantage of using motor imagery over overt movements is that they both share a number of behavioral (Jeannerod 1995) and Conclusion At main sea level and 18,000 feet, the tested OCC were able to ensure a FiO 2 which meets the manufacturer's standards. However, we observed a decrease oxygen flow rate during the climbing, but was not statistically significant for an O 2 flow rate of 2 l/min. In our study, with an oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min, OCC are able to administer the correct oxygen concentration in high altitude.",

Treatment of hypoxemic pneumonia is based on oxygen therapy. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a technique whereby heated and humidified oxygen can be delivered to the nose at high flow rates. It generates a low level of positive pressure in the upper airways and decreases the work of breathing. This technique might be useful to hypoxemic pneumonia treatment and could reduce the need of invasive or noninvasive ventilation in pediatric patients.",

After exclusion of 3 patients with dark skin, we compared skin microcirculatory parameters in septic shock patients according to the absence (n = 8) or the presence of mottling (n = 12). Endothelial dysfunction was much more pronounced in mottling skin in comparison with non-mottling skin: basal value 7 (6-8) versus 5 (4-6) (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.01), peak value 17 (8-52) versus 7 (5-15) (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.05), area under the curve 7981 (4243-19,612) versus 3302 (2643-6531) (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.03). Noteworthy, endothelial function assessed on the forearm area was not different between mottling and non-mottling group.

General characteristic, clinical and bacteriological data [isolated microorganism and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)], organ function, creatinine clearance, vancomycin dosing regimens and measured plasmatic level were described. Using the population pharmacokinetic model of vancomycin published by Le et al. we derived the individual pharmacokinetics parameters of each patient (taking into account age, daily individual dose, body weight, creatinin level and vancomycin concentration). Using these parameters, we simulated the plasma time course of vancomycin in every child. We could then describe the concentration after the loading dose and calculate the area under the curve (AUC24) from the first dose. Results We analysed 29 patients aged from 1 month to 17 years and weighted from 3 to 53 kg (median 2.7 years and 12 kg). Fifteen patients (52 %) had one or more organ failure and 4 patients (14 %) received vasopressor or inotropic agents. Median creatinine clearance was 176 ml/min (range 75-343), and no patient required dialysis during the time course of study.Fourteen patients (48 %) received vancomycin for catheter-related infection mostly caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus [WU1] (n = 11), and empirically for 13 patients (45 %), MIC value (mg/L) was available for 3 documented infections (1; 1.5 and 1.5). Median vancomycin loading dose was 14.8 mg/kg (range 12-16) over 1 h followed by a continuous infusion of 44 mg/kg/day (range 35-61). Median delay for first plasmatic level after loading dose was 20 h (range 10-51) with a level of 14.5 mg/L (range 9.8-46.9). Eleven patients (38 %) reached a level >15 mg/L. Sixteen patients (55 %) have had one or more dosing adjustment. Median of the 11 increases of vancomycin daily dose was +25 % (IQR +11 to +57), resulting in a median plasmatic drug level enhancement from 12.1 to 15.5 mg/L. Five patients (46 %) kept a vancomycin level <15 mg/L. During the first 24 h of treatment, assuming that MIC was equal to 1 mg/L, AUC24/MIC was estimated to 349 (range [WU2] 201, 1001) and only 7 patients (24 %) reached an AUC24/MIC > 400. Median simulated concentrations of vancomycin at the end of the loading dose was 20.4 mg/L (17.1-23.7), showing that the loading dose was appropriate to reach the target of 15-25 mg/L [WU3]. Clinical and bacteriological failure occurred for one of the 16 patients who had a confirmed infection. One patient exhibited a renal function deterioration 24 h after the start of the cure.",

One of the main complications of this device is the central-line-associated bloodstream infection. These hospital-acquired infections are responsible for an important morbidity and mortality. We tried to estimate the outcome at 2 months at the infectious level, of central venous catheter placement in our department, comparing two periods separated by an update of the guidelines with the paramedical and medical teams. Patients and methods This is a prospective study realized in the whole pediatric department of the Strasbourg University Hospital, comparing two periods: from September 1 to October 31, 2014 (period 1), and from March 1 to April 30, 2015 (period 2). All the CVC placement in the department during those periods was collected. We have recorded all the central-line-associated bloodstream infection (positive blood culture and clinical and/or biological signs of infection). Between those two periods (from November 2014 to February 2015), we have worked with the hygiene team to update, standardize and broadcast protocols of CVC placement and maintenance in the department. Results Four hundred and one CVC were included: 198 during the period 1 and 203 during the period 2.

Results Business service of pediatric resuscitation: A major change in 2008 when the number of beds has doubled to 08 beds and activity recent years has shown a marked increase in hospitalizations increased from 230 in 2008 to 520 in 2013. The number of children on average breakdown in our service pediatric intensive care is on the increase (40 % in 2014) against (20 % in 2005) with a occupancy rate has increased from 71 % in 2011 to 94 % in 2014. The service always welcomes children from 1 month to 15 years for mainly respiratory distress, acute hemodynamic or neurological. The population welcomed comes from hospital medical pediatric services (infectious, hematology, gastroenterology, nephrology and pulmonology) and postoperative. The calls are on average 60 per month. The average residence time is 7 days with prolonged periods, and this is up to 60 days due to the absence of a post-resuscitation service. New techniques/units: -Noninvasive ventilation introduced in 2008. -Opening of two new units in 2013: A post-consultation resuscitation unit and a unit for sedation outside the block since 2012 (puncture marrow biopsy, bronchial endoscopy, CT and MRI) Conclusion The decline in 10 years (2005 and 2015) and the service activity is increasing, requiring an increase in hospital capacity. There are one million newborns per year and thus there is the need to create new pediatric intensive care unities.Competing interests None.",

These can be used in the intermediate care environment at the hospital. The capability for these home-care ventilators to deliver adequate FIO 2 is an important endpoint for patient's safety. Therefore, our goal was to measure FIO 2 delivered on the bench by such ventilators when non-vented (double-limb) circuit was used. Materials and methods The following home-care turbine-powered ventilators, Astral 150, Elis\u00e9e 150, Trilogy 200 and Monnal T50, equipped with non-vented double-limb circuit or equivalent, were set in volume-controlled mode (tidal volume 500 ml, breathing frequency 15 cycles/min, inspiratory time 0.8 s, constant flow inflation shape, positive end expiratory pressure 5 cmH2O) and connected to ASL 5000 lung model set in a condition mimicking COPD patient (compliance 75 ml/cmH2O, inspiratory and expiratory airways resistance 15 and 25 cmH 2 O/L/s, respectively). Oxygen was supplemented by plugging the low-pressure oxygen port at the rear of ventilator to the wall oxygen supply via a flowmeter. Three oxygen flow rates were delivered: 0, 3 and 15 L/min. FIO 2 was measured with Citrex H4 \u2122 (imtmedical, Switzerland) and continuously monitored on the screen of the device. Once FIO 2 reached a plateau, oxygen administration was maintained for an additional 1 min and FIO 2 was measured over the last 10 breaths of the recording at the steady state defined as a change in FIO 2 of less than 10 % from the previous sampling window. The sampling rate was 200 Hz. Citrex H4 \u2122 device was calibrated before each experiment. The values of FIO 2 were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. As we anticipated very low variability across the measurement at the steady state, we decided not to perform formal statistical comparisons between the values. Results The values of FIO 2 are shown in the table below. The baseline values of FIO 2 were similar across the ventilators. The FIO 2 was greater with Astral and Elis\u00e9 150 at 15 L/min. Mean values of FIO 2 between ventilators at different oxygen sup-FIO 2 generated by home-care turbine-driven ventilators fed by low-pressure oxygen port was different across ventilators. At the highest oxygen supply rate, the values of FIO 2 are close to 100 % with some ventilators.",

Materials and methods To investigate this point, we submitted a quiz to all the doctors of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital (Paris). A first part consisted in questions about 6 images extracted from 6 clinical cases. For every image, they had to choose appropriate words characterizing it among a list of 18 words. Then, having only the image as information on each patient, they had to answer 2 questions: \"What is the prognosis of this patient?\" and \"Personally would you propose a WWLST?\" The second part of the study was composed with general questions about the weight of imaging in WWLST decisions.",

Results During the study period, 299 cases of suicide are compiled. In 42 cases (14 %), suicide is committed by self-poisoning, representing a little more than 5 cases per year. The sex ratio is 0,7. The mean age of victims is 32.9 \u00b1 7,6 years with extremes ranging from 18 to 63 years. In 25 cases (60 %) the victim is single, in 15 cases (35 %) she is married and she is divorced in only 2 cases (5 %). She is unemployed in 18 cases (43 %) and she is a daily-worker in 16 cases (38 %). In half of cases the victim doesn't have any known psychiatric illness history. The antecedent of suicide attempts is found in 8 cases (19 %). In only 14 cases (33 %) death occurred at home. Most of victims were hospitalized in intensive care unit (28 cases, 67 %). The average time interval between hospitalization and death is 32.45 hours with extremes ranging from 8 to 96 hours. The forensic autopsy is often performed more than one day after the intoxication date. The post-mortem toxicological samples systematically made during the autopsy were positive in only 5 cases (12 %). Toxic samples are often not made during the hospitalization. The nature of the toxic substance is determined based only on history and clinical information. In our study the nature of the toxic substance is a pesticide in 16 cases (38 %) and a medication in 14 cases (34 %). It is still undetermined in 6 cases (14 %). Conclusion Toxicological samples performed after a prolonged interval of time from the intoxication moment are often negative. Thus it is fundamental to realize them systematically at the time of admission into intensive care unit in case of intoxication suspicion. The determination of toxics allows not only to orientate the therapeutic management but also to strengthen preventive strategies against suicide. Competing interests None.",

Pheochromocytoma was highly suspected on abdominal CT scan showing adrenal gland tumor in 7 cases (the two others did not have CT scan during ICU stay). Three patients died from refractory cardiogenic shock despite ECMO implantation. For the 6 others, myocardial function improved and ECMO was removed 3-7 days after initiation. Alpha and beta blockers were progressively introduced after ECMO removal. Five survivors had adrenalectomy 6 weeks after ICU discharge and had satisfactory outcome. In one patient, pheochromocytoma was diagnosed 1 year after the index event and surgical adrenalectomy was performed without complication. Conclusion Pheochromocytoma is a rare but reversible cause of cardiogenic shock that might be rescued by VA-ECMO. Radiographic imaging with echography and CT scan of the adrenal gland should be obtained in all patients with unexplained cardiogenic shock. Lastly, adrenalectomy might be safely performed in the weeks following the initial catastrophic presentation, after complete recovery of LV systolic function.IntroductionThere is a lack of data concerning the characteristics, the outcome and temporal trends in mortality of cardiogenic shock (CS) patients admitted in critical care unit (CCU). Accordingly, we provide an extended 15 years long perspective into changing trends in key features of patients, use of life-supporting therapies and in-CCU death rates. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective study using prospectively collected data from the 1997-2012 database of Parisian area critical care units-the CubRea (Intensive Care Database User Group). We assessed temporal trends in the use of life-supporting therapies and patient outcomes (Crude and SAPS II-Standardized Mortality, discharge location). Results Among 316,905 patients admitted in CCUs, 19, 416 (6.1 %) exhibited CS, with an increasing incidence between 1997 and 2012 from 4.1 to 7.7 %, P < 0.001. Baseline characteristics of patients according to the study period are reported inTable 24. Over time, the age of CS patients decreased 66.4 \u00b1 16.1-63.7 \u00b1 16.6, P < 0.001 and mean SAPS II increased from 58.7 \u00b1 25.3-64.5 \u00b1 23.3, P < 0.001. Use of lifesupporting therapies increased with increase in renal replacement therapy by 12.4 percentage points (95 % CI 10.8-14.0) and of invasive ventilation by 1.4 percentage points (95 % CI \u22120.4 to 3.3). However, crude in-CCU mortality declined from 50 to 45 %, P < 0.001. SAPS II-Standardized in-CCU mortality rates also declined from 56.5 to 44.2 %, P < 0.001. Among survivors, the numbers of patients discharged at home was low and decreased from 4 to 2 %, P < 0.001. Conclusion In France, the profile of CS patients admitting in CCUs changed over a 15-year study period. From 1997 to 2012, CS patients are younger but with a higher severity and need for respiratory and renal support. Yet, both crude and SAPS II-Standardized Mortality decreased, suggesting an improvement in the management and prognosis.P95Benefits of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in elderly patients with postcardiotomy refractory cardiogenic shockNadia Aissat 1 , R. Bernard 1 , Guillaume Lebreton 2 , Dimitri Margetis 1 , Julien Amour 3 , Pascal Leprince 4 , Adrien Bougl\u00e9 1 Introduction Because of the sanitary and social progress, proportion of elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery constantly increases. Nevertheless, in case of postcardiotomy refractory cardiogenic shock, the need for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is questionable because of the lack of survey data in this population. The aim of this study was to investigate the 28-day mortality after cardiac surgery in patient \u226580 years old with or without ECLS. Materials and methods In a monocentric retrospective study, we included all patients \u226580 years old undergoing on pump cardiac surgery between January 2013 and December 2014. Primary endpoint was the 28-day mortality. Data are expressed in median (25th-75th quartile) or percentage. Fisher's test for qualitative variable or Wilcoxon's test for quantitative analysis was used. Conclusion In elderly patients undergoing on pump cardiac surgery, refractory cardiogenic shock is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, in this particular severe cohort, ECLS seems to offer a valuable alternative and could be beneficial in some selected patients.P96Heart transplantation versus ventricular assist device: which therapy for patients with refractory cardiogenic shock?

The role of early rehabilitation in the management of these patients has shown interest. The creation of unit, with both expertise of intensivists and physics Doctor, would improve the healthcare network. But physical and rehabilitation medicine requires specialized human resources and equipment. This retrospective epidemiological pilot study was to determine the needs of Amiens University Hospital in post-intensive care rehabilitation department (PICRD). Patients and methods We determined the number of patients eligible to PICRD, during 2013. The \u00abProgramme M\u00e9dicalis\u00e9 des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information\u00bb allowed to count all patients admitted to medical-surgical ICUs in Amiens University Hospital. Patients who had brain injury, spinal cord injury, or severe peripheral neurological damage regardless of origin were included in the study among the ICU patients. Even if they did not suffer from those pathologies, patients with duration of hospitalization (DH) over 7 days in the ICU were also included. The need for PICRD has been evaluated by computing the number of eligible patients in PICRD. They were eligible to PICRD: patients with persistent neurological impairment in their day 10 of hospitalization, without hemodynamic disability in absence of catecholamine, with a tracheotomy when a ventilator weaning was impossible. It was applied to the group \"eligible\" a new release date, which corresponded to day 2 after the realization of tracheotomy and/or stopping of catecholamine, and/or stopping continuous invasive treatments. This allowed calculating a new DH and therefore a new average length of stay. Over 70 and under 18 years old and those with undergoing neoplasia were excluded from the study. Results A total of 2690 hospitalizations in ICU were counted at the Amiens University Hospital in 2013. Seven hundred and seventeen patients were included in the study; after application of the exclusion criteria, a total of 388 were analyzed. This group of patients consisted of 72 % men, and the median age was 54 years old (IQR = 20.25). The median SAPS II was 42 (IQR = 28) with a median length of stay of 12 days (IQR = 14) and a mortality rate of 19.6 %. The median SAPS II was 38 (IQR = 23.25). The main diseases were also neurological for 46 % with: stroke, STBI and SCI. Other causes were: shock for 14 %, acute respiratory distress and ARDS for a total of 28 %, severe sepsis for 11 %. Seventy-seven of them came out alive from the ICU, 20 % in intensive care in \"Berck\", 10 % in physical and rehabilitation medicine unit, 50 % in medicine or surgery services. After application of the new date of stay, a significant difference in hospital stay of 40 days (p < 0.0001) was demonstrated. Conclusion There is a need of adults PICRD at Amiens University Hospital. It would allow an early medical and rehabilitative treatment, improving the fluidity of the post-intensive care discharge, and lead to a reduction in socioeconomic costs of care of these patients who need no more ICU care.P108 Factors of degradation on independence and quality of life at 3 and 6 months after stay in intensive care unit Benjamin Kowalski 1 , Anne Guaguere 2 , Claire Boulle-Geronimi 3 1 Reanimation, Centre Hospitalier de Douai, Douai, France; 2 R\u00e9animation polyvalente, Hospital Center De Douai, Douai, France; 3 R\u00e9animation polyvalente, H\u00f4pital de Douai, Douai, France Correspondence: Benjamin Kowalski -kowalskibenj@orange.fr Annals of Intensive Care 2016, 6(Suppl 1):P108Introduction Although survival of patient remains the priority in intensive care unit (ICU), quality of life and level of dependence when returning home have become important issues.

Patients who presented immediately deteriorating of mental status such as low or moderate memory disorders and psychiatric disorders were excluded. Patients or their relatives were interviewed during their stay. Then, patients were clinically reevaluated at third month (M3) and interviewed by phone at sixth month (M6) after admission date. The independence degree had been measured using IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily living) test score and their quality of life using WHOQOL-BREF test score (World Health Organization Quality of Life). Data from stay in intensive care, onset of delirium, autonomy before hospitalization, physical capacities at home, presence of posttraumatic stress disorder assessed by the Post traumatic Scale Score 10 (PTSS10) and anxio-depressive symptoms evaluated by Hospital Anxiety Depression Score (HADS). Results In total, thirty-five patients were included at the beginning. Four patients died at M3. Three patients cannot be evaluated for the level of dependence at M3. Seven patients left the follow-up at M6. All patients showed decreased quality of life at M3. At 3 months, 28 patients were evaluated for the independence.",

Characteristics of elderly patients, burn injuries and prognostic factors were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPPS 20.Results During the period of study, 1417 patients were admitted with 144 of elderly patients (10 % of total admissions). The mean age was 74 \u00b1 8 years old. There were 63 males and 81 females. The average TBSA was 25 \u00b1 22 % with an UBS of 56 \u00b1 74. The major mechanism of injury for the patients was scalding or flame burns (97 %). Elderly burn patients suffer from premorbid conditions: diabetes (n = 38), hypertension (n = 30) and cardiovascular diseases (n = 16). In our series, burns affected limbs (75 %) and the head/ neck (57 %). Inhalation injuries were noted in 17 % of cases, and mechanical ventilation was required in fifty-three patients (36 %) for a duration of 5 days (1-30 day). Our patients developed hypovolemic shock at admission in 22 % of cases. Clinical complications were sepsis (46 %), acute renal failure (40 %) and thromboembolic complications (11 %). The mortality rate was 43 % and occurred at 12 days after burn injury. In our study, factors associated with death in elderly burned patients were: secondary transfer, inhalation injury, ARDS, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure and septic shock. Conclusion Burns in elderly patients are frequent (10 %) and serious.

Patients and methods This analysis is part of a multicenter, prospective, observational study (six centers) on the outcome of patients aged 85 or older (very old group) after an hospitalization in ICU. The control group consists of patients, from the same centers, aged 70-84 (mild-old group) randomly selected. The autonomy-related variables collected were: ALD score six items, living conditions (at home, alone in couple or with family, or in retirement homes), comorbidities (cardiac failure NYHA 3 or 4, respiratory failure Gold 4, chronic renal disease, dialysis), the pathway before resuscitation and ICU stay. Results are given as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or percentage. Results The very old group included 34 patients (age 86 years \u00b1 1.6, IGSII 50.7 \u00b1 27); the medium-old group included 57 patients (age 77.6 years \u00b1 4.7, IGS II 54.2 \u00b1 24.1). The admission mode in ICU was the same (Emergencies Department: medium-old = 32 %, very old = 22 %, home by SMUR: medium-old = 2.8 %, very old = 6.5 %, already hospitalized: medium-old = 39 %, very old = 34 %, p = 0.34). There was no difference about their living conditions nor about crippling heavy histories. The ALD autonomy score did not exhibit differences, whether item by item or on total score (medium-old = 5.35 \u00b1 1.5, very old = 5.11 \u00b1 1.81, p = 0.49). There was no difference for the Knaus score noted on the admission. The surgical pathologies were more frequent for older patients (medium-old 8.7 %; very old 13.5 %, p 0.001) as well as admissions for cardiac pathologies, particularly for cardiogenic pulmonary edema (medium-old = 8 %, very old = 58 %, p = 0.01). The duration of invasive ventilation was shorter for older patients: medium-old: 4.82 \u00b1 7.55; very old: 1.16 \u00b1 1.62, p = 0.005. There was no difference on the need for noninvasive ventilation, renal replacement therapy or surgery. The length of stay in ICU was also shorter for Age \u226565 years and a hospital stay \u226548 h.Results During the period of our study, 852 patients were admitted to our service.

The exact impact of resistance of Pa strains on outcome is still on debate; some studies report association between Pa resistance and morbidity/mortality, other not. We therefore performed a study to analyze the risk factors, characteristics and outcomes of Pa-VAP according to the characteristic of the strains, i.e., susceptible or resistant. Patients and methods This was a retrospective study on data prospectively collected(1). Patients having developed bacteriologically confirmed Pa-VAP (diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate or mini-bronchoalveolar lavage) were prospectively followed until ICU discharge or death. Pa strains were considered multidrug resistant (MDR) if resistant to \u22651 agent in \u22653 categories of antibiotics; extensively drug resistant (XDR) if resistant to \u22651 or more agent in all but \u22642 categories of antibiotics and pan-drug resistant (PDR) if resistant to all antibiotics tested(2). Patients infected with susceptible (S) strains were compared to patients infected with MDR and XDR strains. In a second analysis, patients infected with a MDR or XDR strains (grouped together and therefore named R) were compared to patients infected with S strains. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD or median (IQR). Results One hundred and sixty-nine patients with at least one episode of Pa-VAP were included: 111 were males, and 58 females; they were 58 \u00b1 19 year old, with a SAPS II score on admission of 51 \u00b1 21 and duration of MV before VAP episode of 11[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] days. Of 169, 143 (85 %) had received antibiotics in the preceding 15 days. One hundred and fifteen patients (68 %) were infected with S strain, 36 patients with MDR strain (21 %) and 18 patients (11 %) with XDR strain. No patient was infected with PDR strain. Patients infected with XDR and MDR strains had trend toward higher previous use of fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, third-generation cephalosporins and piperacillin/ tazobactam than patients infected with S strains (33, 28 and 16 % for previous fluoroquinolones use, respectively; 22, 8 and 6 % for previous ceftazidime use respectively; 44, 39 and 26 % for previous third-generation cephalosporins use, respectively; 39, 40 and 25 % for previous piperacillin/tazobactam use, respectively. P = NS for all). No other differences were observed between patients infected with S, MDR or XDR strains regarding initial characteristics of patients, VAP characteristics or outcomes (infection recurrence, ICU length of stay and mortality). Similar results were observed when comparing patients infected with S strains and those infected with R (MDR plus XDR grouped together): No difference at ICU admission or the day VAP was diagnosed except that patients infected with R strains received more frequently fluoroquinolone (30 vs. 16 %, respectively p = 0.03) and trend toward more piperacillin/tazobactam (39 vs. 25 %, respectively, p = 0.07) and thirdgeneration cephalosporins (41 vs. 26 %, respectively, p = 0.054) than patients infected with S strains, but exhibited similar VAP recurrence (30 % and 39 %, respectively, p = NS), ICU length of stay (29 [20-50] and 38 [21-53] days, respectively, p = NS) and mortality rate (33 % and 33 %, respectively). Conclusion In this large cohort of Pa-VAP, resistance profile was not associated with infection recurrence, ICU length of stay or death. Except previous use of fluoroquinolones, we were not able to find any risk factor associated with resistance profile of Pa.Introduction Related to the absence of effective diagnostic tools for invasive candidiasis, empirical systemic antifungal therapies are recommended and largely prescribed to the intensive care unit patients with risk factors. However, secondary documented invasive candidiasis is not observed for all the patients who receive an empirical systemic antifungal therapy. The objective of this study is to define the risk factors able to predict the probability for having a secondary documented invasive candidiasis after empirical systemic antifungal therapy by accounting for center and patient variables. Patients and methods The patients with an empirical systemic antifungal therapy were prospectively included from a multicenter prospective observational study. Only patients without primary documented invasive candidiasis were included and were divided into two groups: patients without documented invasive candidiasis and patients with a secondary documented invasive candidiasis. A multivariate hierarchical model was performed to identify factors independently associated with a secondary documented invasive candidiasis. Two sub-group analyses were performed by considering the type of intensive care unit admission (intra-abdominal surgery vs. other). Five hundred and forty-four patients were included in the analysis, from whom 112 (21 %) had a secondary documented IC (candidemia 19 (17 %), intra-abdominal IC 64 (57 %) and deep-seated IC 29 (26 %)). The proportion of secondary documented invasive candidiasis was higher for patients admitted for an intra-abdominal surgery (28 %) compared to the patients admitted for another reason (other surgery or medicine 14 %). The multivariate analysis confirmed that the patients admitted in intensive care unit for an intra-abdominal surgery had more than three times as likely to experience a secondary documented invasive candidiasis than the patients who were admitted for a medicine reason (OR 3.02 [1.69; 5.40]: p < 0.01). The other factors significantly associated with a secondary documented invasive candidiasis were the presence of an infectious disease in the intensive care unit (OR 2.78 [1.07; 7.18], p = 0.03) and septic shock at the treatment initiation (0.60 [0.368; 1.00]; p = 0.05).",

Septic shock still carries high mortality for these patients. The place of aminoglycosides (AMG) in this setting is still uncertain. Patients and methods In a post hoc analysis of the Trial-OH study, we studied 444 patients with HMs admitted to 17 ICUs for septic shock as defined by the need for vasopressors and clinically or microbiologically documented infection, or neutropenia and fever. All patients were treated using broad-spectrum beta-lactams. AMG were prescribed according to clinician's decision. The analysis was based on propensity matching (1:1 matching algorithm) and following variables such as neutropenia, acute kidney injury, myeloma, dialysis and ICU which might affect the administration of AMG in addition to age, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), secondary acute leukemia and remission status of the HMs. The primary endpoint was hospital mortality.Results A total of 313 patients (70.5 %) received AMG, whereas 131 did not. Hospital mortality was, respectively, 174 (55.6 %) and 73 (56.1 %); [OR] = 1.04 [0.68;1.54] P = 0.91. Age, SOFA, secondary acute leukemia and remission status were significant variables associated with mortality. Among the 131 patients who did not receive AMG, 123 could be matched to AMG-treated patients, resulting in a total of 246 paired observations in the propensity analysis. The proportion of hospital death was not significantly different between the two groups 56.1 % (no AMG) vs 55.3 %, P = 0.89 [OR] = 1.04 [95 % CI, 0.61-1.76]. No center effect was reported. ICU length of stay was also not significantly different between AMG-treated patients and other patients. Conclusion In HM patients with septic shock, up to 70 % receive AMG with no center effect. These data, in line with the literature in immunocompromised patients without septic shock, do not support the use of AMG in this setting. Randomized clinical trials are warranted.Introduction The use of nasogastric tube (NG) is one means of administering antifungal therapy to critically ill patients unable to receive medication via the oral route. The aim of the study was to determine pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of voriconazole in critically ill patients receiving continuous enteral feeding. Patients and methods A prospective multicentric, crossover study was conducted. Stable critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation and receiving continuous enteral feeding with suspected or proven fungal invasive infection (IFI) treated with voriconazole were included. Voriconazole loading dose (6 mg/kg) every 12 h for 2 doses intravenously was followed by maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 h during 3 days. From day 4, administration of 5 mg/kg every 12 h was performed through the NT. NG dose was 1 mg/kg greater than the recommended dose in order to avoid food reduction bioavailability. Blood samples were collected after the fifth intravenous (IV) infusion and after the fifth NG administration. Demographic, biologic data and concomitant drugs were collected. AUC/dose NG was compared to AUC/dose IV using a paired T test. Results Eight patients (5 males, 3 females) were evaluable. Median (range) age and bodyweight were 67.5 (49-86) years and 76.5 (57.3-117) kg. Only one patient did not receive esomeprazole. None had hepatic disease.

Recently, many studies focused on the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) so as to ameliorate patients' prognosis. PCAS is composed of four entities: persistent precipitating pathology, post-CA circulatory failure systemic, ischaemia-perfusion and post-anoxic brain injury.(1)  We look forward to analyse our daily management of resuscitated patients admitted in our medical intensive care unit. Patients and methods All patients admitted in our unit between January 2011 and June 2013 with the diagnosis of cardiac arrest were included retrospectively. We collected data about cardiac arrest itself but also those concerning PCAS. Exclusion criteria were: suspected or known acute intracranial haemorrhage or stroke, a body temperature on admission of less than 30 \u00b0C, unwitnessed cardiac arrest with initial rhythm asystole, known disease making 180 days survival unlikely, known pre-cardiac arrest Cerebral Performance Category score of 3 or 4 (2), systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg in spite of fluid loading, vasopressor and/or inotropic medication. Results Eighty patients (pts) were included with average age of 65 years (\u00b114) (57 males and 23 females). Mean SAPS II was 72, and mean SOFA score was 11. Aetiology of cardiac arrest (CA) was cardiac in 35 pts (43.8 %), non-cardiac in 32 pts (40 %) and unknown in 13 pts (16 %). Coronarography has been realized for 31 pts (39 %), 21 pts of whom had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Fiftyseven pts (71 %) required catecholamine infusion during the first 48 h. Therapeutic hypothermia (32-34 \u00b0C) is prescribed for 46 pts (58 %). Twenty-four (52 %) had an initial shockable rhythm. ICU mortality was 55 % (44 pts). Among survivors, Cerebral Performance Scale was good, moderate and severe for 33 (41.25 %), 1 (1.25 %) and 2 (2.5 %) patients, respectively. Discussion PCAS is frequent after CA. Its management requires a rigorous control of many variables. Our retrospective study results were not far from the literature data. Only 39 % of our patients underwent coronarography. Indications and timing of coronarography are still not clear except for transmural myocardial infarction. Only half of our patients had therapeutic hypothermia. This point needs clearly to be improved. Conclusion Functional and vital prognosis of CA could probably be improved by an aggressive management of PCAS. Close control of patients' parameters is necessary to achieve such a goal. Application of guidelines must be emphasized in this setting.IntroductionIn-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is still associated with poor outcomes. Early prediction of unfavourable outcomes is difficult but crucial to improve resource allocation. There is actually no predictive score for IHCA outcome. Our objective was to determine whether the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) score based on clinical and easily accessible variables could correctly predict outcome in patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) after an IHCA. Patients and methods This was a retrospective observational multicentric cohort study including all patients admitted in 7 French medical or mixed ICUs after an IHCA between January 2009 and December 2014. Cardiac arrest (CA) occurrence in operating room or ICU was excluded. Outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Categories score (CPC 1-2 for good outcome; CPC 3-4-5 for poor outcome) at hospital discharge. Results Of the 349 patients assessed for eligibility, 297 patients were finally included. Before CA, 267 patients (90 %) were hospitalized for a non-surgical disease, 18 (6 %) for programmed surgery and 12 (4 %) for emergency surgery. IHCA occurred in a ward in 193 patients (65 %) and in the emergency room in 103 patients (35 %). IHCA was from cardiac origin in 75 patients (25 %). Median no flow duration was 0.5 min (interquartile range 0.5-1.0), and low flow duration was 10 min (interquartile range 5-20). An initial shockable rhythm was found in 62 patients (21 %), and hospital survival with favourable neurological outcome occurs in 26 % of cases. OHCA score was significantly lower in patients with a favourable outcome compared to unfavourable outcome (14 [interquartile range 1-25] versus 29 [interquartile range 17-40], respectively; p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, OHCA score was independently associated with unfavourable outcome (odds ratio per OHCA score point: 0.97, 95 % confidence interval [0.95-0.99], p = 0.002) with a sensibility of 61 % and a specificity of 85 % (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.77). For an OHCA score >36, predictive mortality was 97 % (95 % confidence interval 96-97)(Fig. 41). Conclusion In this first retrospective multicentric study, OHCA score is independently associated with IHCA outcome at hospital discharge. Early prediction of IHCA outcome by OHCA score needs further studies to confirm this hypothesis.Competing interestsNone.

Conclusion Among patients admitted alive after CA, nearly one-third of them awoke more than 48 h after discontinuation of sedation.

In particular, incidence and characteristics of sudden unexplained death (SUD) are debated. We aimed at describing etiologies in a large cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, in order to characterize victims without identified diagnosis. Patients and methods We analyzed data from our prospective registry of OHCA patients admitted between January 2000 and December 2014. Initial diagnostic strategy included coronary angiography, brain and chest CT scan. This was completed by an extensive diagnostic strategy, encompassing biological and toxicological tests, repeated electrocardiograms and echocardiography, MRI, Holter monitoring and endocavitary explorations. Two independent investigators reviewed each final diagnosis. Baseline characteristics were compared between subgroups of patients with Chi square test and Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. One-year mortality was compared between subgroups using univariate Kaplan-Meier curves. Results Over the study period, 1857 patients were admitted in our unit after a resuscitated OHCA. The event was related to a non-cardiac and a cardiac cause in 526 (30.7 %) and 1057 (61.8 %) patients, respectively. The main cause of cardiac-related OHCA was ischemic heart disease (78.4 %), while non-structural cardiomyopathies accounted for only 2.2 %. No diagnosis was evidenced in 127 (7.4 %) patients. In these SUD patients, baseline characteristics and 1-year survival of patients under 35 years were similar to those with identified nonstructural cardiomyopathy. Conclusion We observed that ischemic heart disease was by far the most common cause of cardiac arrest, while non-structural cardiomyopathies accounted for a very low part of diagnosis. Young patient victims of a sudden unexplained death shared similar baseline characteristics and outcome with patients with non-structural cardiomyopathies. Focusing on this subgroup of patients for further investigations and follow-up may help in managing themselves and their relatives.",

Differences and results across gender remain unknown. We assessed the relationship between gender and coronary reperfusion after OHCA and the relationship between PCI and outcome according to gender. Materials and methods All patients admitted in our center after OHCA were prospectively included in an electronic registry database, from 2000 to 2013. Characteristics were collected according to the Utstein style. We assessed the association between gender and coronary reperfusion (using multivariate logistic regression and propensity score analysis) and between PCI and outcome (according to gender). Results One thousand eight hundred and seventeen patients were included (520 women, 29 %). Women were older (62.8 vs 59.1 years, P < 0.0001), with less cardiomyopathy. They had less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (84 % vs 88 %, P < 0.05) and less shockable rhythm (42 % vs 61 %, P < 0.001). After multivariate logistic regression, male sex was associated with the performance of coronary angiogram (OR 1.73, 95 % CI 1.28-2.34, P < 0.001). Results after propensity score matching were consistent (P = 0.02). Among 1157 patients who underwent coronary angiogram, rate of PCI did not differ between men and women (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 0.90-1.88, P = 0.17). Results after matching (211 men, 211 women) were consistent (P = 0.13). PCI was associated with favorable outcome by multivariate logistic regression (OR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.07-1.96, P = 0.02) with no interaction between gender and PCI (P for interaction = 0.40). Association between PCI and outcome was consistent across genders. Conclusion After OHCA, women are less likely to undergo coronary angiogram. Rates of PCI after coronary angiogram do not differ across gender, and the association between PCI and favorable outcome is similar across gender.",

            "text": "See text for descriptionIntroduction Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) represents in 2015 a persistent public health problem, with always a bad prognosis and poor survival. Outcomes are improved by healthcare provider practices as recommended by the 2010 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. In France, the National registry R\u00e9AC was set up in 2010 because of the lack of national and international outof-hospital cardiac arrest registry. Our study followed upon observation of the lack of data concerning the OHCA in Martinique. The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic factors of the OHCA in Martinique. Patients and methods A prospective, observational, and monocentric study was performed in Martinique over a 29-month period (from December 2012 to April 2015), including all out-of hospital cardiac arrests requiring the intervention of our emergency pre-hospital medical service (SAMU 972). We described the circumstances, demographic data, clinical and management of each link in the \u00ab chain of survival \u00bb and the different delays of care. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality on hospital admission. Data from SAMU 972 were compared to other French emergency medical centers. Results Three hundred eighty-five patients with cardiac arrest were included. Fifty-nine percent were men with a median age of 63 years. Sixty-eight percentage of OHCA occurred at home and were witnessed in 74 % of cases, as compared to other French national centers. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated by bystanders in 43 %. The absence of CPR and early defibrillation were associated with asystole (89 % of the cases), when advanced cardiac life support was initiated by firefighters and/or by emergency medical service. When the emergency medical team arrived in the site, more than 80 % of the patients were found in asystole and only 6 % in VF/VT. Delay of departure of the emergency medical service vehicle and arrival at the scene were much more longer in comparison with other centers. The absence of CPR and delay for firefighters to reach the patients were associated with mortality on hospital admission (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). The rate of return of spontaneous circulation was 18 %, with a 13 % survival rate on hospital admission and 3.4 % rate on day 30. The overall survival rate was lower than the other French centers (R\u00e9AC). Prognostic factors significantly associated with the survival rate were (p < 0.05): young age, immediate resuscitation by training bystanders, presence of emergency medical service personnel or firefighters at the time of OHCA, used of automated external defibrillator before the EMS providers arrived at the scene, delay and type of early rhythm, use of epinephrine and early therapeutic hypothermia in ICU. Conclusion Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Martinique are similar to those from metropolis France with horrifying outcome. However, in Martinique, survival rate appears to be lower. Several proposals could be suggested to improve outcome, including (1) increasing population training to basic cardiac life support, (2) enhancing public access to early defibrillation, (3) reducing delays of out-of-hospital medical services interventions, (4) standardizing advanced cardiac life support, and (5) strengthening ways to identify easily house's number. However, the definitive benefit of such interventions should be further investigated.",

All patients hospitalized between September 2012 and December 2013 were included. They received 1 IU/mL human insulin over 48 h infused via one of the two studied assembly lines. The glycaemic objective was between 140 and 180 mg/dL. The standard infusion line consisted in insulin administration through a six-stopcock manifold connected to the distal line of a multilumen central venous catheter by 150 cm tubing. The optimized infusion line administered insulin infusion through a multilumen device consisting of eight accesses connected to nine separate lumens united in a 150cm tube. Capillary glycaemia was measured by a glucometer every 3 h and by an interstitial glucose sensor every 5 min. Moderate hypoglycaemia was defined as a capillary glucose level between 54 and 70 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia by a level below 54 mg/ dL. Time spent in hypoglycaemia for 1000 h of insulin therapy was calculated from glucose sensor data.

Discussion This study shows that the dead-volume measured from the point where drug and carrier streams meet to the patient's blood affects hypoglycaemia occurrence in major surgery patients. Given the severity of undiagnosed hypoglycaemia, close monitoring of blood glucose and the use of low volume infusion sets need to be considered for patients most at risk of glycaemic dysregulation.

Outcome of elderly patients was most often reported for octogenarians. The mean age in studies was roughly 84 years old. The ICU and hospital mortality were 12 and 25 %, respectively, for scheduled surgery(1). For the same endpoints, it was 38-64 and 45-55 % for medical and unscheduled surgery(2). The primary aim of this study was to precise outcome of youngest patients (80-89 years old) vs oldest (>90 years old). The secondary aim was to evaluate outcome according to supporting care in wards units compared to geriatric units after ICU discharge for the nonagenarians. Patients and methods A multicenter (14 ICUs) observational study(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013) was performed in 14 ICUs belonging to the Outcomerea study group. We extracted from the prospective database Rhea patient's characteristics, intensity of treatment, decisions of limitations of treatment (withholding, withdrawing and anticipated withholding), nurse workload (NEMS: Nine Equivalents of nursing Manpower Score), patient status at ICU and hospital discharge. Matching criteria were severity of illness (SAPS without age), center and year in the study. Results The database included 2416 patients aged more than 80 years old hospitalized in 14 centers during the study period. Among them, 176 (7.2 %) were more than 90 years old and represented the cases patients. We matched 176 patients aged 90 years old with patients between 80 and 89 years old hospitalized in the same center and the same severity of illness at admission(Table 57). 10/14 (71 %) of centers had a geriatric unit. Factors associated with transfer in a geriatric unit for nonagenarians vs other wards were The main limitation of the study was the impossibility to research longterm outcome due to higher rate of missing data. Conclusion In a cohort of mainly selected medical patients, ICU and mortality rates were not different between nonagenarians and octogenarians in spite of a lower intensity of treatment. The discharge to a geriatric unit did not change the outcome.Competing interests None.Introduction As the number of patients surviving critical illness is increasing, since these last years, many intensive care units (ICU) developed an ICU aftercare in order to improve patient well-being and recovery. Although there is no gold standard for ICU follow-up, some medical teams showed that a single consultation is beneficial to patient. So the aim of our monocentric retrospective study was to establish that doing a systematic follow-up consultation can help to maintain quality of care for an ICU. Patients and methods Were included all adult patients, discharged alive from ICU after at least 72 h, coming in a follow-up consultation (FC), 3 months after their ICU stay, between February 2012 to June 2014, in general hospital of Roubaix, France. Were excluded unstable psychiatric or socially isolated patients. Were collected baseline demographics and clinical characteristics. Were evaluated during this consultation in order to define qualitative aspects of care: ICU care results (e.g., length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or sedation, muscle wasting and weakness, iatrogenic effects, SF 36, Barthel index); ICU healthcare conditions (e.g., questionnaire of sources of discomfort in ICU, using IPREA 2). We also performed during this consultation a multidisciplinary coordinating action to promote patient well-being and recovery (e.g., patient clinical assessment, referrals to specialists or family physician if necessary and living wills). Results A total of 160 patients were included, mostly males (54 %), with a median age of 64 years, a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score II at 45. Comorbidities were mainly chronic cardiac failure (64 %), chronic respiratory failure (38 %) and chronic renal failure (17 %).",

In this retrospective study, we describe the experience over 5 years in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit. Our secondary goal was to specifically study the population with respiratory failure. Patients and methods This was a retrospective monocentric descriptive study of all pediatric admissions for sickle cell disease from 2009 to 2013 in our 16 bed pediatric intensive care unit. We collected demographic data, description of admission (reason, C-reactive protein and hemoglobin level), intensive care stay (organ failures, need for artificial support, blood transfusion or exchange, complications, mortality, length of stay, Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 and Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction scores from 2010 on). Organ failure definitions used were that of the 2005 International Conference on Pediatric Sepsis and of the 2015 Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Sepsis Investigator network. Results (All patients not included yet): Primary goal: There were 74 patients accounting for 88 admissions in our pediatric intensive care unit; 60.8 % were male; mean age was 9.6 \u00b1 5.1 years; genotype was SS (93.2 %), SC (4.1 %), S\u03b2 (2.7 %); reason for admission was respiratory in 64.7 % (acute chest syndrome 57.9 %), shock 1.1 %, osteomyelitis 2.2 %, cerebral stroke 11.4 %, acute anemia with hemolysis 2.2 %, surgery 6.8 %, pain management 11.3 %. Mean hemoglobin level at admission was 8.96 \u00b1 1.59. Blood transfusion was administered in 35 % before admission. Organs failure during stay were: respiratory 71.5 % (52 % on mechanical ventilation), hemodynamic 2.2 % (septic shock with inotropes), neurological 11.4 %, hematological 9 %, renal 2.2 %, hepatic 5.7 % and multi-organ failure 4.5 %. Blood was administered in 72.7 % (transfusion 29.5 %, exchange in 43.2 %). Median length of stay was 3 days (25-75 %: 2-4). Median Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 was 0.85 (25-75 %: 0.2-3)",

The efficacy, evaluated KT/V value is 0.88 [0.7-1] instead of 1.2-1.4 according to consensus, but it remains a secondary endpoint in these severely ill patients. Although there are no clinical complications and no indirect citrate overdose sign when using citrate on liver failure patients, there is no evaluation of the total amount of citrate infused to these patients with our SLED protocol. Conclusion This study suggests that using RCA with SLED is safe for patients with acute liver failure or cirrhosis in ICU, who need RRT.",

We previously reported that endothelial-derived microparticles (MPs) are relevant biomarkers of sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In this validation cohort, we assessed MPs as surrogates of cell activation to improve early DIC diagnosis and patient stratification. Patients and methods This is a prospective observational study in septic shock patients in four French medical intensive care units. Two hundred and eighty-five patients with septic shock were consecutively enrolled. DIC was diagnosed according to JAAM 2006 score. Endothelial (CD105-MPs and CD31-MPs) and leucocyte-derived (CD11a-MPs) circulating procoagulant MPs were isolated and quantified by prothrombinase assay on admission (D1), D3 and D7. Clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT #02391792. Results Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were analysed. Sixty-one had DIC on admission (DIC-D1), and 32 developed DIC during the first 24 h after admission (DIC-D2). These later patients were seriously ill with mortality as high as DIC-D1 patients. Multiple logistic regression model confirmed that endothelial cell-derived MPs were associated with DIC: CD105+-MPs (OR 2.13) and CD31+-MPs (OR 0.65) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, CD11a+-MPs to leucocyte ratio evidenced leucocyte activation (OR 1.59, p < 0.05). Prediction of DIC was also analysed after exclusion of DIC-D1 patients.A new multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated the association of CD105 + -MPs (>0.60 nM eq. Phtd-Ser, OR 1.67, p < 0.01), platelets count (\u2264127 G/L, OR 0.99, p < 0.01) and prothrombin time (\u226458 %, OR 0.98, p < 0.05) with DIC. A combining score on admission is predictive of the absence of DIC. The predictive equation was: with [CD105+-MPs] in nM eq. PhtdSer, [Plt] in G/L and [PT] in percentage ( %).

Results Of the 1286 VA-ECMO patients treated in our ICU during the study period, 38 had ECMO for refractory electrical storm after a median time of 24 (8-168) hours. Median age, SAPS II and SOFA scores at admission were 58 (49-62) years, 80 (55-87) and 13 (11-15), respectively. Electrical storm was secondary to myocardial infarction in 26 (68 %) patients. Cannulation was performed during and after cardiac arrest in 5 (13 %) and 17 (45 %) patients, respectively. Overall ICU survival was 47 % (one patient got a heart transplant and one a left ventricular assist device). Survivors spent 5 (4-10) days on ECMO, 14 (9-25) days in ICU and 52 (34-59) days in hospital. Patients discharged alive from the ICU had lower body mass index, lower SOFA score before ECMO and at day 1 and received less inotropes in the 24 h following cannulation (p = 0.02). No difference was identified between alive and deceased patients regarding pre-ECMO anti-arrhythmic treatments and number of electrical shocks. Conclusion Refractory electrical storm is a very severe condition that might be rescued by VA-ECMO support. The 47 % ICU survival rate we observed in this series parallels that of other cardiogenic shock populations rescued by VA-ECMO. Earlier ECMO support in the course of the disease might allow a rapid decrease in inotrope doses and less organ failures, which were both associated with more favorable outcomes.S107Incidence and determinants of severe bleeding among patients with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) Lucie Hierle 1 , Fran\u00e7ois Belon 1 , Guillaume Besch 2 , Sebastien Pili-Floury 2 , Lo\u00efc Barrot 1 , B\u00e9reng\u00e8re Vivet 1 , Guylaine Labro 3 , Jean-Christophe Navellou 1 , Cyrille Patry 1 , Nicolas Belin 1 , Ga\u00ebl Piton 1 , Gilles Capellier 1 Introduction Bleeding and need for blood product transfusion are common among patients requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Transfusion is associated with a poor outcome in critically ill patients. Risk factors of bleeding among patients under ECMO are unknown. The aims of this study were to describe bleeding and to determinate risk factors of bleeding under ECMO. Patients and methods From 2013 to 2014, we retrospectively analyzed all the patients admitted to two ICU in a university hospital that required the use of ECMO. Bleeding was defined with ELSO criteria (ELSO anticoagulation guidelines). Patients were studied according to the presence or absence of severe bleeding while they were under ECMO. Results One hundred thirteen patients were included. One hundred two patients received venoarterial (VA)ECMO  and 11 venovenous (VV) ECMO. ECMO runs for a median of 5 days. One hundred six bleeding were identified in 83 patients. Severe bleedings occured in 56 (55 %) patients with VA ECMO. Among them, 33 patients (59 %) had bleeding located on ECMO cannula. Other bleeding complications were intracranial bleeding in 4 patients, gastrointestinal bleeding, ear-nose bleeding and hemoptysis. Totally, 849 red blood cells, 534 fresh frozen plasma and 209 platelets units were transfused. Predictive factors of severe bleeding were female sex (OR 2.8[1.4-10]), platelets <50G/L (OR 3.3 [1.3-8.7]) and antiagregant treatment (OR 3 [1.1-7.8]). Conclusion Severe bleedings are highly more frequent during VA ECMO than VV ECMO: It occurs in more than an half of the patients with VA ECMO. Clinical management of these patients is difficult, and improving the management of severe bleeding under ECMO, in particular by defining the acceptable level of platelet count and hemostasis tests, is required.",

The oxyconcentrators (OCC) can be a solution to overcome this problem because they are an inexhaustible source of oxygen so far as their power supply can be ensured. Very few studies have examined the OCC in HAA. The aim of our study was to evaluate the FiO 2 and O 2 flow rate issued by three OCC in high altitudes. Materials and methods Three OCC (Simply go \u00ae , Devilbiss \u00ae , Ever-Flow \u00ae ) were analyzed in continuous mode (O 2 flow rate: 2 l/min) in an VO 2 L min \u22121 = (VI * FIO 2 ) \u2212 (VE * FeO 2 )hypobaric chamber (HC) (Aerospace Medicine Centre, Queen Astrid Military Hospital, Brussels).

FiO 2 was measured in continuous by an analog iWorx station/digital IWx/214 coupled to an analyzer of CO 2 /O 2 iWorx GA200. O 2 flow rate was analyzed by a thermal mass flow meter Vogtlyn \u2122 Red Y. A oxygen cylinder was used as a reference gas to recalibrate O 2 analyzer at each level of altitude. Statistical test: ANOVA. Results For the three OCC: Average FiO 2 was 93 % (\u00b11 %) at main sea level and 91 % (\u00b12 %) by 18,000 feet (p > 0.05).

Emergency services are the busiest and the most stressful units of hospitals. Aim: To assess the prevalence of burnout among Tunisian public hospital doctors and nurses and to determine its causes and perceived repercussions. Methods: in a first step, we assessed the work conditions, the perceived burnout and its possible consequences in 100 healthcare providers from two departments of emergency of two hospitals from the North of Tunisia. In a second step, we used the Maslach Burn Inventory to assess the burnout symptoms in ours ample. Results More than half (56 %) of our sample had a burnout. Fortyseven percentage of the affected professionals had a high level of emotional distress, 36.6 % had a high level of depersonalization and 33 % had a low level of professional fulfillment. Burnout had a high level in nurse which affects three dimensions relative to physicians. A high level of burnout had found in healthcare provider, which had sick leave with emotional distress (32 %) (p = 0.02), depersonalization (21 %) and a low level of professional fulfillment (11 %). Discussion and conclusion Our results corroborate partially with those of the literature and illustrate some parameters that can be the Competing interests None.",

Per-bronchoscopic bronchial aspiration (PBA) is less aggressive. We wanted to determine whether the documentation obtained by PBA is equivalent to that of BAL. Patients and methods This is a prospective, observational study. All patients hospitalized in the ICU for community-or hospital-acquired pneumonia, who underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with realization of the two types of respiratory samples, were enrolled. A PBA in the bronchial segment corresponding to the pulmonary infiltrate was performed, the operative channel of the endoscope was washed with 20 ml of 0.9 % saline, and a BAL was realized with five aliquots of 20 ml of 0.9 % saline. The first was discarded as recommended. One was sent to the bacteriology laboratory together with the PBA. The samples were diluted with 0.9 %; homogenized and quantitative cultures were realized. Cultures were considered significant if they attained at least 105 CFU/ml for PBA and at least 104 CFU/ml for BAL. Results During a 15-month period, 104 cases were analyzed. Ten patients were included two times. Mean age was 66 \u00b1 15 years, 70 % of patients were men. Fifty-eight percentage of the cases were community-acquired. In 45 cases (43 %), both samples provided identical significant (above threshold) microbiological documentation. In 3 cases (3 %), both samples provided identical nonsignificant (below threshold) microbiological documentation. In 30 cases (29 %), both samples could not document the infection. Thus, microbiological data were fully concordant in 78 cases (75 %). In 13 cases (12.5 %), the microorganisms found were identical but significant (above threshold) in one of the 2 samples only (BAL: 6, PBA: 7). In the 13 remaining cases (12.5 %), a microbiological documentation was obtained in only one sample (BAL: 5, PBA: 8), above threshold in 6 cases (BAL: 3, PBA: 3), below threshold in 7 cases (BAL: 2, PBA: 5). In total, 96 bacteria were retrieved: Enterobacteria (25 including 11 strains of Escherichia coli), Streptococcus pneumonia (20), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19), Staphylococcus aureus (16), Haemophilus influenzae (6) , various microorganisms (10) . The microbial documentation was monomicrobial in 51 cases (69 %). Conclusion Microbial documentation of pneumonia in ICU by PBA is very similar to that by BAL, suggesting that PBA could replace BAL in routine.",

This study investigated the prevalence of de-escalation and the factors associated with in hematology patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients and methods This study is a retrospective evaluation of a prospective observational cohort of hematology patients admitted to the ICU. Patients without antibiotics prior to ICU admission and in whom antibiotics were initiated in the first 48 h were included in this ancillary study. De-escalation of antimicrobial therapy was defined either by the cessation of a \u03b2-lactam or a glycopeptide or by the switch from a \u03b2-lactam to another one with a narrower spectrum (carbapenems > piperacillin/tazobactam > ceftazidime or cefepime > piperacillin or ticarcillin > cefotaxime or ceftriaxone > other penicillins) before the day 5. Characteristics and outcomes of patients with (group D+) and without de-escalation (group D\u2212) were compared. Results Among the 1011 patients from the prospective cohort, 124 patients were included in the present study, 82 men and 42 women with a median age of 60 (IQR 47-70) years. The underlying malignancy was acute leukemia in 46 (37 %) patients, lymphoma in 37 (30 %), myeloma in 14 (11 %), chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 12 (10 %) and miscellaneous hematologic disorders in 15 (12 %) . It was newly diagnosed in 59 (50 %) patients and in complete remission in 22 (19 %). Twentyeight (24 %) patients were neutropenic at ICU admission. Twenty-four (19 %) had received bone marrow transplantation, including allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 11 (9 %). The median Charlson comorbidity index was 4 (IQR 3-6), and 18 (15 %) patients had poor performance status (WHO score [3] [4] . The cardiovascular component of this score was present in 53 (43 %) patients, the pulmonary component in 33 (27 %), the liver component in 15 (12 %) , the neurologic component in 11 (9 %) , the renal component in 10 (8 %) , the HIV infection component in 7 (6 %) and the diabetes component in 3 (2 %) patients. The main reasons for ICU admission were acute respiratory failure in 85 (69 %) patients, shock in 46 (37 %), acute kidney injury in 34 (27 %) and coma in 26 (21 %). Overall, 64 (52 %) patients had multiple organ failure. The median ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 12 and 32 days, respectively. In the whole cohort, 28 (23 %) patients died in the ICU and 43 (35 %) in hospital. Empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted in a \u03b2-lactam in 122 (98 %) patients: 66 (53 %) received piperacillin/tazobactam, 30 (24 %) cefotaxime or ceftriaxone, 20 (16 %) a carbapenem, 13 (11 %) amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 6 (5 %) ceftazidime and 3 (2 %) piperacillin. Twenty-one (17 %) received a glycopeptide, combined to a \u03b2-lactam in 19 (90 %) of them. Thirty-five (27 %) patients received macrolides, 29 (23 %) an aminoglycoside and 28 (23 %) a fluoroquinolone. The antimicrobial therapy was de-escalated in 46 (37 %) patients (group D+). Extensive comparison of patients with and without de-escalation showed no difference in patients' characteristics, comorbidities or in the underlying malignancy status. The main reasons for ICU admission were also similar in both groups. No difference was observed as regard to ICU admission severity according to SOFA score (6 [IQR: [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] No difference across group in terms of mortality was noted after adjustment for confounders. Discussion The rate of de-escalation was high in this cohort of critically ill hematological patients. De-escalation was not associated with a specific characteristic or the outcome of these high-risk patients. However, the lack of power and the design of the present study preclude any firm conclusion. Conclusion Further studies specifically designed to explore this topic are warranted to investigate the feasibility and safety of de-escalation of the antimicrobial therapy in critically ill hematological patients. Introduction Linezolid was an antibiotic with time-dependent activity. It was assumed that adequate serum linezolid concentration will be achieved most of the time when using the recommended dose of 600 mg every 12 h. Burns induce complex physiological changes as modification of distribution volume, increased clearance of drugs and decrease in protein binding. So, the pharmacokinetic of linezolid may then be modified. This requires dose adjustment particularly in burns. The aim of our study was to assess the pharmacokinetic of linezolid in burn patients at a dose of 600 mg three times per day. Thresholds for therapeutic efficacy of linezolid were: plasma C min > 2 mg/l and/ or AUC/MIC ratios of 80 (or AUC24 > 200 mg/h/l) or %TMIC of > 85 (percentage of dosing interval during which linezolid concentration remains above the MIC of targeted bacteria) [1] . Patients and methods This study was conducted in burn center in Tunis. Patients with documented and/or suspected MDR Grampositive bacterium-related infections and whose burned area greater than 20 % (TBSA \u2265 20 %) were included. They were excluded pregnant women and patients <16 years old. Enrolled patients received linezolid at a dose of 600 mg in 1 h infusion three times per day. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken 5 min after the end of the first infusion, 5 min before the second and the third dose and 5 min before the dose of the day after. To assess linezolid serum level, 4 mL of blood was drawn from an arterial line, centrifuged and then stored at -80 \u00b0C. For all patients, linezolid minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the AUC 0-24 h (daily area under curve) and linezolid plasma concentrations (trough (C min ) and peak (C max ) levels) were calculated. Results During the period of study, 10 burned patients were included. The mean age was 39 \u00b1 22 years old with a burned area of 30 \u00b1 11 %. No case of renal failure (creatinine 73 \u00b1 38 \u00b5mol/l) or of thrombocytopenia was noted in our patients (276 \u00b1 176/\u03bcL). For all patients, linezolid administration at the dose of 600 mg three times a day allows to reach: an adequate daily linezolid exposure with a mean AUC 0-24 h/MIC (mg/h/l)* of 126 (recommended: 80-120), a C min of 4.84 \u00b1 2.33 mg/L and a %TMIC of 100. In our study, no case of potential overexposure was noted with this dosage of linezolid. Conclusion Our study suggests that linezolid at the daily dosage of 600 mg every 8 h in burned patients allows to reach optimal PK/PD targets for linezolid clinical efficacy: AUC/MIC of 126 and a %TMIC of 100, and may reduce the emergence of linezolid resistance. Introduction Retrospective observational data suggested potential harmful effects of hyperoxia in patients resuscitated from an outof-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Experimental studies have shown that this deleterious effect of O 2 could be due to the worsening of ischemia-reperfusion injuries and to an oxidative burst following resuscitation. Here we analyzed the relationship between arterial oxygen tension and the pro-and antioxidant balance in a cohort of OHCA patients.",

We defined the exposure using the PaO 2 value on the first arterial blood gas (ABG) at admittance. Hyperoxia was defined as PaO 2 of 300 mm Hg or greater, hypoxia as PaO 2 of less than 60 mm Hg and normoxia as a PaO 2 not classified as hyperoxia or hypoxia. The primary outcome measure was the relation between PaO 2 and main blood markers of oxidative stress measured at admittance in ICU: thiols, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), protein carbonyls, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GRx) and glutathione peroxidase activities (GPx). Results Among 134 patients studied, 13 had hypoxia (10 %), 102 had normoxia (76 %) and 19 had hyperoxia (14 %). The overall intra-hospital mortality was 59.7 % (n = 80). We found no differences between groups, with a 76.9 % (n = 10) mortality rate in the hypoxia group, 56.9 % (n = 58) in the normoxia group and 63.2 % (n = 12) in the hyperoxia group. Median time from cardiac arrest to ABG analysis was similar between the hypoxia, the normoxia and the hyperoxia groups (respectively 278 min, interquartile range (IQR): 153-684; 180 min, IQR: 131-320 and 170 min, IQR: 103-626). There was no statistically significant correlation between any of the biological parameters and PaO 2 values in the whole population, and we found no difference regarding blood markers of oxidative stress across the 3 groups (Table 53) . Conclusion In our study, PaO 2 at hospital admission was not associated with differences in the ratio between oxidant and antioxidant parameters in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest.

Introduction The association of fibrinogen 3 g and tranexamic acid 2 g was introduced into the management protocol for our maternity postpartum hemorrhage from 2012. Before that date, the use of one or both of these products was anecdotal. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the association (fibrinogen/exacyl) in the curative treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. Introduction Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) has been mainly attributed to elevated levels of ammonemia associated with inflammatory response due to modification of intestinal microbiota and increased bacterial translocation. Brain edema is frequently encountered in acute liver failure and has been shown, at a lower extent, in cirrhosis. Astrocytes display cytotoxic edema due to the presence of glutamine, an osmotic agent produced by the transformation of ammonia by glutamine synthetase in the cytoplasm. This condition is not associated with increased brain volume since blood-brain barrier permeability is not modified. At the opposite, vasogenic edema is associated with an increased brain volume and a decreased specific gravity (SG) secondary to an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. Brain volume, weight and SG, that can be measured by CT scan, can be used to estimate brain water contain and determine the type of edema. The physiopathological implication of hyperammonemia in the apparition of vasogenic brain edema is nevertheless still debated in hyperammoniemic encephalopathy. Objective: To determine the influence of ammonemia levels and their modification in the variation of brain water contain and the apparition of vasogenic edema.",

Using a mouse model of ischemic stroke in hyperglycemic conditions, we tested the hypothesis that HDLs may limit hemorrhagic transformation and mortality when administered intra-arterially at the reperfusion phase. Materials and methods After a 3-h middle cerebral artery occlusion using a 7-0 silicon-coated monofilament, C57BL6 mice were randomly treated intra-arterially with human plasma purified HDLs versus saline immediately after reperfusion. Four groups were used with ten animals per group: Hyperglycemic mice with HDL treatment (HG-HDL), normoglycemic mice with HDL treatment (NG-HDL), hyperglycemic mice with saline treatment (HG-S) and normoglycemic mice with saline treatment (NG-S). We used d-glucose intraperitoneal injection (2.2 g/kg) to induce acute hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels were followed up six times during experimental period. The effects of HDLs were assessed blindly 24 h later by evaluating the neurological deficit and mortality and by measuring both infarct volume and hemorrhagic transformation.

Introduction Recent studies showed that the remote ischemic preconditioning may provide protection of renal function after cardiac surgery and contrast-medium-induced renal failure. The mechanism is linked to the production of vasodilatory substances leading to improve organ perfusion. The aim of our study was to determine whether a noninvasive remote preconditioning could induce a vasodilation in intraparenchymal renal circulation measured by the renal resistive index. Patients and methods Remote preconditioning procedure was applied in six volunteers as follows: cycles of 4-min inflation of a blood pressure cuff to a pressure 50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure to one upper arm, followed by 4-min reperfusion with the deflated cuff. RRI was determined using renal Doppler-echography method performed on the interlobar arteries using a 2.5-MHz transducer at 1.8 MHz for Doppler analysis. The RRI was calculated as follows: (peak systolic velocity \u2212 end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity. Three measurements were performed on right kidney and averaged to obtain the mean RI values. Mean values were compared at baseline (T0), during each period with the deflated cuff (T1, T2, T3) and at the end of the protocol (T4) using paired Wilcoxon test.",

We compared three periods: Results During the last 15 years, 196 ILD patients were admitted to our ICU. Mean age was 64.3 \u00b1 12.6 years, and mean SAPS II was 39.5 \u00b1 19.3 points. Overall mortality was 47.9 %. Etiologies of ILD were as follows: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 51, 26 %), connective tissue disease (n = 42, 21.4 %), miscellaneous (n = 61, 31.2 %) and unclassified (n = 42, 21.4 %). Regarding ventilatory support, 105 (53.7 %) patients required mechanical ventilation (MV), among which 78 (74 %) died. MV was started in 42/67 patients (62.6 %) after failure of noninvasive ventilation, with a subsequent mortality rate of 76.2 %. The remaining 17 patients were discharged alive. Of the 9 patients who initially received high-flow nasal oxygen, 6 further required MV, of whom 4 died. Twelve patients were considered for urgent lung transplantation and transferred to referral centers for ECMO in the meantime (data on outcome pending). Among nonventilatory supports, catecholamines and renal replacement therapy were provided to 80 (41 %) and 17 (8.7 %) patients, respectively, and were associated with mortality rates above 90 %. Regarding changes over time, the number of ILD patients admitted to the ICU kept increasing but no significant modification in their management was observed. Finally, mortality remained constant throughout the three periods. Yet, observed mortality was much superior to mortality as predicted by the SAPS II score. Conclusion ICU mortality of ILD patients is high and remains stable despite global improvements in ventilatory support. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of ILD patients may survive. Our data suggest that ILD per se should not be considered as a ground for ICU admission denial. Further analyses are warranted to identify specific prognostic factors, and subgroups of ILD patients likely to benefit most from ICU care. Introduction The outcome of patients admitted in intensive care unit for acute manifestation of small vessel vasculitis has been poorly reported. The main goal was to determine the mortality rate and prognostic factors of patients admitted in intensive care unit for acute manifestation of small vessel vasculitis. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective, multicenter study of patients admitted from January 2001 to December 2014 in 20 intensive care units in France specifically with acute manifestation of small vessels vasculitis. Primary end-point was assessment of mortality rate 90 days after admission. Results Eighty-two patients were included in 20 centers, 93 % of whom with a recent diagnosis (< 6 months) of small vessel vasculitis. Main reasons for admission were respiratory failure (33 %) and pneumo-renal syndrome (32 %). Mechanical ventilation was required in 51 %, catecholamines in 31 % and renal replacement therapy in 71 %. Overall mortality at 90 days was 19 %. Mortality was related to infection in 69 % of cases. No difference was found at admission between survivors and non-survivors at 90 days in terms of reason for admission, comorbidities, type of vasculitis diagnosis and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score. Risk factors associated with 90-day mortality were higher SOFA score on the day of cyclophosphamide administration and delayed administration of cyclophosphamide. Conclusion Even in cases of multiple organ failure, patients admitted in intensive care unit for the management of acute small vessel vasculitis benefit from full intensive care support and early aggressive treatment with immunosuppressors.",

Univariate analysis showed that the risk of WLL complicated by a prolonged hospitalization in ICU is multiplied by 54.6 for severe respiratory illness (p < 10 \u22124 ), by 6.9 if oxygeno-dependence (p = 0.03) and 27.1 in cases of malnutrition (p < 10 \u22124 ). The amount of saline instilled reduced the risk of hospitalization in the ICU up to 2 % per ml/kg (p = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, the risk of complicated WLL prolonged hospitalization in intensive care units is multiplied by 59.7 for severe respiratory illness (p < 10 \u22124 ) by 15 if oxygeno-dependence (p = 0.02) and 7.3 in cases of malnutrition (p = 0.01). The experience of the endoscopist and anesthesiologist did not emerge as complicated WLL risk factors. Conclusion Our study shows that the conditions attached to the WLL procedure are not predictive of prolonged ICU hospitalization. And that the clinical presentation of the patient (malnutrition and respiratory failure) seems to have an impact on complicated WLL. This result could allow us to better identify patients likely to be hospitalized in ICU and to emphasize the importance of nutritional rehabilitation of these patients. Introduction Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the main complication leading adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) to the intensive care unit (ICU). Fat embolism etiology is supposed to account for up to 40 % of ACS. In parallel with traumatic fat embolism syndrome, a medullary fat hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 could take place in ACS, increasing free fatty acids (FFA) responsible for acute lung injury. Arachidonic acid may be one of the main FFA released, because its enzymatic conversion leads to pro-inflammatory mediators. The objective of this study was to determine whether the synthesis of arachidonic acid via secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) was increased in SCD patients admitted to the ICU and leads to plasma FFA changes, as compared to steady state. Patients and methods All SCD patients with ACS admitted to the ICU of a French University Teaching Hospital in Paris between April and June 2015 were included. Samples were collected serially at D2, D3 and at hospital discharge. FFA were determined by enzymatic (total concentration) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (quantitative profile). Plasma activity of sPLA2 was measured by enzymatic method. Parameters changes between times are analyzed using nonparametric Wilcoxon test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Twelve patients (homozygous hemoglobin SS, n = 11; compound heterozygous SC disease, n = 1) were admitted to the ICU for the management of ACS. Five patients had a highly severe course during ICU stay. Twelve samples were collected at D2, 10 at D3 and 3 at hospital discharge. Increased sPLA2 activity (202 \u00b5mol/min/mL Introduction ICU patients prognosis is evaluated at admission by severity scores (APACHEII, SAPSII) that are time-consuming. 50 kHz phase angle (PhA) is measured easily and quickly by bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Lowered PhA is associated with worse prognosis of chronic diseases. The main aim was to determine whether PhA measured at ICU admission predicts 28-day survival. Patients and methods Patients were recruited in 10 centers from 9 countries. The inclusion criteria were: age >18 years, absence of implantable cardioverter defibrillator or pacemaker, expected ICU length of stay >48 h. PhA was measured at admission (day (d) 1) by the Nutriguard (Data-Input, Germany) BIA analyzer. APACHEII and SAPSII were calculated at d1. The following variables were collected: 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, infections, and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviations or median \u00b1 interquartiles accordingly. Relations between PhA and 28-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier actuarial curves and Spearman test. Sensitivity, specificity and PhA cutoffs associated with 28-day mortality were analyzed by ROC curves and the Youden method. Variables associated with 28-day mortality were determined by multivariate logistic regression. Conclusion At ICU admission PhA is an indicator of 28-day mortality, even if SAPSII is the best predictor. A combined multivariate model associating PhA and SAPSII improves 28-day mortality predictability.",

Recent attention has been brought to the challenges raised by inadequate feeding choice of the adequate route, time of onset, and nutrients. Patients with Hematologic malignancies are increasingly admitted to the intensive care and present specific hallmarks of their diseases, such as neutropenia, side effects from chemotherapy, specific gastrointestinal issues, and malnutrition preceding intensive care admission. We investigated the effects of the implementation of a computerized nutritional tool (the CHOCOBOX) on hematologic patients admitted to the intensive care. Patients and methods Our study was a before-after study comparing two prospectively collected cohorts of hematologic cancer patients chronologically admitted to a single intensive care, before and after the implementation of an optimized nutritional protocol (the CHOC-OBOX). This protocol included a computerized prescription tool; simulation of the best combination of products to reach target; team training before the implementation of the CHOCOBOX; dietician counseling; and daily comprehensive computation of all caloric and protein intakes and of daily and total caloric and protein balances. Our main objective was to show a 50 % increase in the compliance of caloric and protein delivery, using a Poisson regression model. Compliances were defined as the numbers of days, respectively, within caloric ((25 kcal/kg/d \u00b1 15 %) and protein (1.5G/KG/D \u00b1 15 %) targets, adjusted on the length of ICU. Secondary objectives were to show a difference in morbidity (days of ventilation, CRRT, antibiotics, positive blood cultures, noradrenalin) and hospital mortality, in four subgroups of patients: neutropenic, bone marrow allografted, malnourished, and severe (SAPS II > 56), tested by a survival curve with a Gray test. Discussion Our study is the first to address nutritional issues in the intensive care in hematologic patients. A nutritional protocol was able to raise caloric and protein delivery to fairer levels and decreased global caloric and protein negative balance. Early-onset enteral feeding has shown benefit in the ICU but was difficult for our patients who had specific enteral problems (esophagitis, mucitis, severe thrombopenia, intolerance, diarrhea, or neutropenic-related colitis). The standard of first choice exclusive enteral feeding may not be adequate for all these patients, but trophic feeding was possible. Survival was better with the CHOCOBOX in patients with failures (saps II > 56) and with neutropenia, perhaps because of higher quantities of protein, or because of a \"package\" of integrated nutritional management, more than because of greater calories. Raised levels of compliance remained mediocre, urging us to find more effective ways to feed this specific population. Conclusion The implementation of a computerized prescription and follow-up nutritional tool is effective in increasing the number of compliant days for protein and calorie delivery in the ICU setting. Such a protocol may lower mortality in some subgroups of patients.",

Introduction Stress-induced hyperglycemia is common in critically ill patients due to insulin resistance and increased hepatic output of glucose, and the relationship between stress hyperglycemia and poor outcome for patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) was demonstrated. Although several randomized controlled studies, based on the use of whether paper protocols or computerized protocols (1), have failed to replicate any mortality benefit, the interest for computerized decision-support system (CDSS) remains because meanwhile new therapeutic goals for blood glucose (BG) control in the ICU have emerged. Furthermore, harmful effects of severe hypoglycemia and multiple hypoglycemic episodes during tight glucose control in critically ill patients have been recently demonstrated (2) . The question arises whether a CDSS allowing the setting of a higher BG target and based on an enhanced algorithm for the calculation of the insulin rate to be applied after each BG measure may reduce the incidence of severe and moderate hypoglycemia. The objective of our study pilot is to assess the impact of the use in routine care of an improved CDSS on the incidence of hypoglycemia, whether severe or moderate, in comparison with a first-generation CDSS.",

This CDSS is a second-generation software (CDSS-2) derived from that used during the CGAO-REA trial (NCT01002482), a nonblinded parallel-group randomized controlled trial involving adult patients admitted to ICUs and comparing tight glucose control (TGC) with a first-generation CDSS (CDSS-1, BG range between 4.4 and 6.1 mmol/l) and conventional glucose control (CGC) protocols (BG < 10 mmol/l). The BG target has been set by default to 5-7.5 mmol/l in the CDSS-2.The embedded algorithm used for the calculation of the next insulin rate (to be applied after each BG measure) was of the type proportional integral with variable coefficients to take into account variations of insulinosensitivity throughout the ICU stay. The CDSS-2 was used on the admission whenever the patient required intravenous insulinotherapy and was our standard care protocol to be used (on medical prescription) by our nursing staff who had already gained experience during the CGAO-REA study. We extracted the clinical data and that concerning BG control for all the patients treated with CDSS-2.A Chi square test was used to compare the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and moderate hypoglycemia observed during the TGC arm of the CGAO-REA trial and the pilot study with CDSS-2.Results The CGAO-REA study, carried out between October 2009 and June 2011, involved 2684 randomized patients, 1351 assigned to computerized (CDSS-1) and 1333 to conventional blood glucose control, recruited in 34 ICUs (19 in academic tertiary care hospitals and 15 in community hospitals). Thirty-six patients were discarded from the analysis: 35 because they withdrew consent and one included twice.In the end, 1336 and 1312 patients were included in the TGC (with CDSS-1) and CGC arms, respectively. Among the 1336 patients treated with CDSS-1, 19 were discarded because important data concerning BG measurement were lacking. Thus, 1317 patients were analyzed for comparison. Discussion Further studies are needed to improve glycemic control in the ICU and reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia. The respective roles of the increase in the BG target, the refinement of the algorithm or the use of the software in routine care could not assessed by our historical comparison. Anyway our study paves the way toward the development of the most efficient CDSS for managing BG control in the ICU.

The major aim of the present study was to report data from the Paris Poison Control Centre (PPCC) aiming at defining toxicodynetic parameters dealing with pure oxazepam and nordiazepam. Patients and methods We used data collected at the PPCC from 1999 to 2015. Indeed, the method of collection of data was the same along this period of time. Cases of pure oxazepam and nordiazepam were selected on the basis of self-report by the patient or relatives with a particular attention paid to eliminate the concomitant alcohol ingestion. The classical toxicodynetics parameters were looked for using the individual medical record available at the PPCC. These parameters included (1) the supposed ingested dose which was expressed as a therapeutic index (TI) as defined by a percentage of the maximum recommended daily dose, (2) the time of ingestion (T0), the delay in onset (hours), (3) the rate of worsening (hours or on-off process), (4) the maximal observed effect (Emax), (5) the time of onset of the maximal effect (Tmax), (6) the shape of the duration of maximal effect as a peak or a plateau, (7) the rate of recovery, (8) the duration of hospitalization in uncomplicated poisonings.Results During the study period the number of exposures to oxazepam and nordiazepam as a mono-or combined intoxications reported to the PPCC centre was 840 and 157, respectively. The number of mono-intoxications with oxazepam and nordazepam included in the toxicodynetic study was 257 and 74 cases, respectively. The T0 was known in all cases (100 %). The Emax in both oxazepam and nordiazepam was sleepiness or obtundation occurring in 108 and 36 cases of oxazepam and nordiazepam, respectively. Noteworthy, coma was never used to qualify alteration in consciousness of the poisoned patients. The median delay in onset was 1 h in both poisonings. Interestingly in both poisonings, there was no reported delay in onset of the Emax which was reported on a \"on-off\" mode. The median TI resulting in the Emax effect was 3.3-and 19.6-fold, the maximum recommended daily dose in oxazepam and nordiazepam poisonings, respectively. Follow-up of the poisoned patients was performed in only 19 and 13 % of the oxazepam and nordiazepam poisonings, respectively, precluding any definitive conclusion about the duration of symptoms. Discussion Toxicodynetics is a new discipline in clinical toxicology focusing on relevant clinical toxic effects induced by a substance. Toxicodynetics may be described for all toxic substances using clinical and biological data routinely collected. Toxicodynetics does not require any toxicological analysis and may be performed in both mono-and poly-intoxication. In spite of major limitations of the study which was a monocentric, retrospective study, some information is provided regarding the early toxicodynetic phases of oxazepam and nordiazepam involving exposures to large doses of each toxicant. Both poisonings were quite similar in terms of delay in onset of about 1 h, an \"on-off\" mode of occurrence of the Emax. In spite of large supposed ingested doses, limited effects on consciousness were reported, never using the term of coma. Oxazepam is the terminal common metabolite of a number of benzodiazepines, including nordiazepam. Oxazepam is both metabolized into inactive metabolites and eliminated unchanged in the urine. During the course of nordiazepam, a part of nordiazepam is metabolized into oxazepam which actually always results in a mixed nordiazepam and oxazepam poisonings. In spite of the supposed ingestion of large doses, the Emax in nordiazepam poisoning was not greater than that induced by oxazepam.Conclusion Toxicodynetics provides information allowing going further to understand which substances may dramatically alter consciousness. These findings support the hypothesis of the role of a drug-drug intoxication. The toxicodynetic approach unveils limitation of data collected routinely in PCC, not allowing to describe the late phase of poisoning. Toxicodynetics provides quantitative information on the quality of report of data in acute poisonings.",

This review provided a limited list of signs to be collected in a small subset of frankly symptomatic patients. The signs and symptoms were classified according to the corresponding organ(s) involved by chemical injury. All signs should be clinically collected using current physical examination. We hypothesized that (1) such a chemical disaster cannot injure a single patient, (2) the collection of data can be repeated due to either an immediate onset or a progressive onset of signs and symptoms on an hourly or longer basis at the request of the attending physician. We advised to examine at least three symptomatic casualties and no more than 10. There are presently three versions of the sheet: French, English, and Arabic. Owing to the political context and analytical difficulties, we never attempted at precisely determining the agent having caused signs and symptoms. In each setting, the analysis of the quoted items on the sheet allowed to suggest the class of the toxicant within a few hours after exposure. In the case of exposure to chlorine and to the vesicant agent, two collections of signs over a period of a few hours were needed to draw definitive conclusion. The lowest number of casualties in an exposure was three after exposure to vesicant agents. The definitive diagnosis was in accord with the initial presumption regarding the class of toxicant. Early identification allowed to advise adapted protection of caregivers at the site as well as define the need for antidote supply and the nature of the antidote. Conversely, in one setting (Mali 2015) a toxic origin was ruled out as not fitting any known toxicant while an infectious disease was identified as the likely cause of the outbreak. Discussion In case of suspected chemical incident or supposed terrorist attacks, a one-page sheet of the list of signs and symptoms dedicated to identity relevant signs and symptoms allowed to define a toxidrome specific of a class of toxicant, helped in protecting rescuers and caregivers at the site and refined the needs for supportive and antidotal treatment. Repeated collection of signs may be required in agents acting progressively. A close collaboration with a skilled toxicologist is needed when facing incident involving hazardous materials. At the scene only chemical incident was identified. However, repetition of bombing in the same area resulted in a more accurate and rapid response of pre-hospital and hospital at the scene. Conclusion A one-page sheet easily filled out at the scene in the context of chemical incident allows defining the toxidrome and consequently protection of rescuers, needs for supportive and antidotal supply.

However, in the past, the development of methods based on immunoenzymology provided information on the class rather the substance by itself with questionable ability to quantify exposure. Consequently, routinely used TA was progressively discarded. TA was recommended in only a few number of toxicants and in conditions where SID does not explain major signs and symptoms. However, over the past decade, modern TA using various modes of mass spectrometry was developed; meanwhile, analysts claimed they was able to address all toxicological concerns of attending physicians. From a theoretical viewpoint, this assumption was sounded. However, the translational to practice has not been assessed to our knowledge. The aim of this retrospective study performed in a medical polyvalent intensive care unit (MPICU) was to test the hypothesis more especially as the MPICU has unlimited access to facilities provided by three University Toxicology Laboratory (Tox Lab). Patients and methods Patients Included patients were adult patients admitted for suspicion of poisoning ranging from moderate to severe in our MPICU from the January 1, 2014, until April 2015. This period of time corresponded to the period of time at which the MPICU has unlimited access to the three Tox Lab. Toxicology analyses: According to our current practice, blood and urine specimens were collected at the time of admission and sent to the different Tox Lab owing to the facilities provided by each, including the local hospital for a limited of toxiciants, the Tox Lab on duty in our institution allowing screening and dosing, and the Tox Lab of the Forensic Department of our institution. The latter two have facilities of modern apparatus including mass spectrometry in various modes as well as separative process (gas and liquid). The Tox Lab was blinded regarding the aim of the study. Expression of results: In each patient results from the different laboratory were gathered, one positive detection/quantification of a SID was considered SID+, TA+; lack of SID with positive TA: SID\u2212, TA+, a SID+ with negative TA was considered SID+, TA\u2212. Unfortunately, there was no SID6, TA\u2212 as there was no need to ask for the presence of a drug to Tox Lab knowing it is was absent in a study done in current practice. Assessment of severity of exposure Severity of exposure is assessed only for drugs and alcohol using the maximum daily dose recommended for drugs (a therapeutic index >1 denotes an intoxication) and a blood alcohol level (BAL) of 0.4 g/l (a BAL > 0.4 g/l was considered toxic).Results Over the study period, there were 224 occurrences concerning 90 SID (a number of multiple occurrences of the same drug) in 70 patients (a number of patients reported multiple drug ingestions). A SID+, TA+ was recorded in only 33 % of the 224 occurrences; however, the TI was >1 in 45 % of the dosed drugs. In addition, in the group of SSI\u2212, TA+, the TA added 15 % of patients with SID\u2212. However, in 79 % of the SID\u2212, TA+, the TI was less than 1. This finding suggests the detection was that of drugs prescribed or used by the patient therapeutically or recreatively in this class of patients SID6, TA+. Discussion In the sixties, toxicological analysis was considered the gold standard to definitively assume the role of a substance in a poisoning. Surprisingly, while the methods used in analytical toxicology resulted in a manifold increase in sensitivity and specificity allowing to screen hundreds of substances in 10 microliter of whole blood, the added value of analytical toxicology is fairly low as shown by evidencing the SID in only 33 % of the occurrences. We can question about the accuracy of the SID. However, until the toxicological analysis does not currently assume the substance is not present, the analytical result is subject to caution. The question is open to know whether high-resolution mass spectrometer can actually increase the added value of TA. Furthermore, closer collaboration regarding the actual needs of the clinician may help analysts in defining the lists of toxicant of interest, providing regular update of this list of toxicant. Conclusion Gathering facilities provided by three University Tox Lab using modern technology resulted in a low added value of toxicological analysis in acute poisonings daily presenting in ICU. Improving the gap might be helped by high-resolution mass spectrometry. However, a closer collaboration between toxicologists and analysts should result in filling the gap.",

They occur mainly in Spring season. Plant poisoning still be rare and unrecognized by health caregivers working in emergency and intensive care departments. The aim of our work was to report an extremely rare accidental collective plant poisoning by \"hyoscyanus Niger\" which happened in Zaghouan in Tunisia in a traditional celebration. Patients and methods It was a descriptive transversal and retrospective study reporting a family collective (twenty-one members (21)) poisoning. This accidental poisoning occurred in the region of Zaghouan in the spring 2015 (May). All members of the family consumed in a traditional village marriage \"couscous\" prepared with an alkaloid plant identified as \"jusquiame. \" This plant was confounded with Swiss chard. Results On May 2015, a family composed of twenty-one members (ten men and eleven women) was admitted to the teaching emergency and intensive care department of the regional hospital of Zaghouan (Tunisia). All of them attended emergency department with a non-medical transfer. All members of the family presented nausea, vomiting, dizziness and hallucinations. Ten patients presented generalized seizures. All patients presented a great agitation. They reported the ingestion 12 h before a traditional couscous prepared specially for a traditional marriage. They reported that it was prepared by \"Swiss chard\" specific to the region. The average of blood pressure was 160/100 mmHg.

All risk factors identified were markers of the characteristics of malignancy and of patient's severity. Conclusion In our study, the occurrence of nosocomial infections was largely due to the characteristics of malignancy and patient's severity and did not further influence the outcome of hematology and oncology patients admitted in ICU. Our findings in a large population of critically ill cancer patients can help to identify subgroups with a particularly increased risk.

PEEP (Fig. 52b ) was significantly higher with HFOT than with COT (5 \u00b1 4.95 vs 1.44 \u00b1 3.13 cmH 2 O, respectively, p = 0.029), while EMG activity (Fig. 53b) (Fig. 53a) .Conclusion We observed a decreased inspiratory muscle's electromyographic activity that reflects an improvement of the ventilation with HFT. This can be interesting for patient with respiratory failure, particularly for patients in weaning phase. Clinical scores and questionnaires have been used to assess motor imagery abilities. The most frequent is the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire (KVIQ), which can be somewhat subjective. In contrast, subject performance can additionally be objectively evaluated using fMRI.",

The keywords used were \"motor imagery, \" \"fMRI, \" and \"stroke. \" Results Functional imaging techniques have helped highlight the activation of a large network during motor imagery tasks, including fronto-parietal, subcortical, and cerebellar regions, as well as cortical areas involved in motor control. The activation of the primary motor cortex, however, has been controversial for many years (Lotze and Halsband 2006). Indeed, in a recent neuroimaging meta-analysis, H\u00e9tu et al. (2013) did not find the primary motor cortex to be consistently activated among subjects. Finally, it is important to note that these activations depend on several parameters: the part of the body imagined, the mode (kinesthetic or visual), and the difficulty of the imagined motor task. Discussion One of the limitations in assessing brain plasticity in stroke patients with motor imagery is their \"chaotic\" motor imagery performance, revealed by a disruption of accuracy of imagined movements and temporal coupling between executed and imagined movements (Sharma, 2006) . Moreover, certain stroke locations distinctly modify patient performance in motor imagery, such as parietal lobe damage or right-sided lesions. Malouin et al. (2012) found a lower correlation between executed and imagined movements in right-sided lesions. They hypothesized that imagining movements was more demanding in right-sided strokes due to damage to the fronto-parietal network, known to be involved in the visuospatial domain. Patients with lesions involving the parietal cortex were also selectively impaired at predicting the time required to perform an explicit motor imagery task. This is consistent with previous findings of a decorrelation between executed and imagined movements in patients with lesions restricted to the parietal lobe (Sirigu et al., 1996) . The parietal lobe is indeed a complex structure responsible for several aspects involved in explicit motor imagery, such as correspondence between observed and executed movements, representation of internal models, maintaining the postural representation of the upper limb, and movement intention and motor preparation.Conclusion These findings suggest that fMRI is helpful in assessing patient motor imagery ability and could be used to determine which patients would benefit from motor imagery training.",

            "text": "None. Introduction The use of diagnostic ultrasound by physiotherapists is not a new concept; it is frequently performed in musculoskeletal physiotherapy. Physiotherapists currently lack accurate, reliable, sensitive and valid measurements for the assessment of the indications and effectiveness of chest physiotherapy. Thoracic ultrasound may be a promising tool for the physiotherapist and could be routinely performed at patients' bedsides to provide real-time and accurate information on the status of pleura, lungs and diaphragm. Materials and methods This is a narrative review. This review refers to lung and diaphragm ultrasound semiology and how thoracic ultrasound should be used in the physiotherapist's clinical decision-making process.Results Lung ultrasound provides real-time and accurate information about the pleura, lung and diaphragm statuses of the patient: This allows the assessment of lung aeration, including interstitial syndrome to lung consolidation. Each ultrasound pattern is related to a level of aeration as follows: normal with A lines indicate a wellaerated lung; B lines indicate alveolar-interstitial syndrome and increased extravascular lung water; and lung consolidation indicates total loss of aeration.A physiotherapist must to accurately evaluate a patient in order to select the most suitable intervention. Thus, to reliably assess the lung status, lung ultrasound examinations should be comprehensive (i.e., both lungs and all of the chest areas should be investigated). In cases of ICU bedridden patients, B lines are found primarily in the most dependent parts of the lungs and are frequently associated with basal lung consolidations; thus, body positioning and mobilization might be a suitable strategy to improve lung aeration. In case of confluent B lines, alveoli are partially filled by fluid. Techniques aimed at improving ventilation and preventing lung consolidation should be considered and include positive expiratory pressure, body positioning and mobilization. At the patient's bedside, LUS performs much better than chest X-rays at diagnosing lung consolidation. LUS characteristics thus allow physiotherapists to quickly distinguish between atelectasis and pneumonia and to implement a suitable therapeutic strategy. For example, the dynamic air bronchogram rules out atelectasis. In cases of lobar or hemilobar lung consolidation with fluid bronchograms in mechanically ventilated patients, the treatment should imply techniques that increase the expiratory flow rate (e.g., huffing, exsuflator) with adjustments to the ventilator settings. With lung ultrasound, the physiotherapist monitors the consolidation and evaluates the effectiveness of treatments. If the physiotherapist identifies a pleural effusion, it seems reasonable to address the patient and wait for medical or surgical treatment to be completed. Then, the physiotherapist may help to implement supportive respiratory management if a chest drain is not required. Discussion In addition to clinical examinations, lung ultrasound may guide the choice of chest physiotherapy strategies (e.g., alveolar syndrome, lung consolidation) or help to determine whether the patient requires medical intervention and no chest physiotherapy (e.g., pneumothorax, severe pleural effusion). An appropriate level of training is necessary to implement lung ultrasound in clinical practice. Thoracic ultrasound may be used in clinical research for chest physiotherapy because it is accurate, reliable and reproducible. Conclusion Diagnostic ultrasound performs significantly better than chest X-rays or auscultation at diagnosing lung deficiencies that are relevant for the physiotherapist. Physiotherapists should use lung ultrasound semiology to guide, monitor and evaluate their chest physiotherapy treatments. This potential new tool for physiotherapists still requires significant development before being used commonly. Introduction During nebulization associated with noninvasive ventilation using single-limb circuit bilevel ventilator, it has been shown that a part of drug nebulized during expiratory phase is held in the circuit and delivered during the next inspiratory phase. This \"reservoir effect\" could potentially improve drug delivery. Also, the use of an inspiratory synchronized nebulization has been shown to be effective in ventilated patient. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare aerosol delivery of amikacin using two different vibrating-mesh nebulization modes coupled to a single-limb circuit bilevel ventilator: (1) an experimental expiratory (Expi-Neb) and (2) inspiratory (Inspi-Neb) synchronized nebulization modes.",

The nebulizer was charged with amikacin solution (250 mg/3 mL) and positioned before and after the exhalation port (starting from the lung model). An experimental control system was used to perform an expiratory (aerosol generated during only the whole expiratory phase) and inspiratory (aerosol generated during only the whole inspiratory phase) synchronized nebulization modes. Inhaled doses were assessed by residual gravimetric method. Results Irrespective of the nebulizer position, Inspi-Neb produced higher inhaled dose than Expi-Neb (position before exhalation port: 75.8 \u00b1 0.9 vs 55.9 \u00b1 0.8 % of nominal dose; position after exhalation port: 34.0 \u00b1 0.4 vs 15.6 \u00b1 0.1 % of the nominal dose; p < 0.05 for both). At position after exhalation port, adding 289-mL corrugated piece of tubing between exhalation port and nebulizer was associated with an increase in aerosol delivery of Expi-Neb (+5.7 \u00b1 0.2 % of the nominal dose; p < 0.05). Conclusion During simulated noninvasive ventilation with a singlelimb circuit bilevel ventilator, aerosol delivery with a vibrating-mesh nebulizer was dependent on nebulization mode and position. Expiratory synchronized nebulization mode was less efficient than the inspiratory synchronized mode.Competing interests None.",

Different minute ventilation (MV: 5 to 20 l/min) were investigated. An oxygen flow rate of 2 l/ min O 2 was ensured using either a O 2 C (B2: Air Liquide \u2122 ) or an POC (Sequal Saros \u00ae ). Two mode of O 2 delivery systems were tested: Continuous O 2 (O 2 C and POC) and bolus O 2 : 74 ml at each breath (with POC). The FiO 2 and MV measurements were made using a iWorx \u00ae acquisition system (GA207 gas analyzer and analog/digital IX/228 s) and LabScribe II \u00ae software. Statistical test used: ANOVA followed by a post hoc test (Tukey).Results After a period of 5 min necessary for the denitrogenation of the Wenoll system dead volume (O 2 flow rate: 2 l/min), the FiO 2 reached a value of 100 % with O 2 C and 92 % with POC at continuous flow (p < 0.05). With POC, there was no significant difference between continuous and bolus mode (pulsed volume of 74 ml at each respiration). Conclusion We hypothesized that the oxygen extraction ratio (E) of air in the lung (E = FiO 2 \u2212 FEO 2 ) was stable and equal to 5 %. In this case, if VI is equal to VE, VO 2 is:VI volume of air inspired per minute (l min\u22121)/VE volume of air expired per minute (l min\u22121), FiO2: Fraction inspired of O2/FeO2: fraction expired of O2. Consequently, for MV from 5 to 20 l/min, with the use of an POC coupled to Wenoll system, we can administer for a long period FiO 2 near 92 % with a very low O 2 flow rate (2 l/min) to ensure the patient VO 2 .Note that the duration of effectiveness of the decarboxylation by soda lime cartridge of Wenoll system is estimated (by the manufactory) to be 5 h for a patient ventilating at rest.",
