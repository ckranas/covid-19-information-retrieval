            "text": "Barriers to evidence-informed health policymaking are well-established [1] . Although many barriers are technical in nature (e.g., poor communication of research findings) [2] , a major impediment stems from the political nature of policymaking [3] [4] . Public opinion is a key aspect of politics; and one that is relevant to efforts to promote evidenceinformed policymaking because public opinion influences policymakers' behaviors [5] [6] . Thus, if policymakers learn that the public wants their decisions to be supported by evidence, this information could spur policymakers to make more evidence-informed health policy decisions and demonstrate evidence use to their constituents. However, no prior research has examined public opinion about evidenceinformed policymaking. This study sought to characterize public opinion about the influence that evidence should, and does, have on health policy development in U.S. Congress relative to other factors and examine differences in opinion by political party affiliation.",

Billing data were then tied to self-reported perceptions of outcomes of service from the Child-Family Mental Health Consumer Survey. These outcome data were compared between youth who did and did not receive a valid EBP session during the observation period Results Among this sample of 1,580 youth, 19.7% (n=312) received at least one valid EBP psychotherapy session. Youth from rural (21.4%) versus urban (16.2%) providers were more likely to have received an EBP session (\u03c72=6.02, p=0.014). There were significant differences by race/ethnicity (\u03c72=14.71, p=0.04). Non-Hispanic Whites (20.2%) and American Indians (33.3%) were more likely, while African Americans (12.3%) and Hispanics (15.7%) were less likely to have received a valid EBP session. There was a trend for an interaction between race/ ethnicity and receipt of an EBP session on self-reported positive services outcomes, with receipt of an EBP session potentially being associated with more positive services outcomes among youth who were non-White versus White.",

Implementation roadmaps provide a playbook outlining critical steps practitioners should follow in scaling up CCIs to new settings that overcome implementation barriers, measure implementation success, and garnering leadership support for longer-term CCI sustainability [2] . We present an Implementation Roadmap [3] that guides community-based CCI implementation based on the experiences of stakeholders successfully implementing a broad spectrum of CCIs through the Michigan Mental Health Integration Partnership (MIP) [4] . The goal of MIP is to support the scale up and spread of CCIs that enhance access to care for Medicaid-eligible consumers with behavioral healthcare needs, while also providing an in-situ implementation laboratory for informing sustained uptake of CCIs across a variety of community-based settings.",

Facilitation was associated with improvements in TDM subscales for role clarity and team primacy. Percentage of CCM-concordant processes achieved varied (44-89%).

Mental health hospitalization rate demonstrated a robust drop during facilitation; this finding withstood four internal validity tests [3] . Conclusions Working solely at the clinician level with minimal study-funded support, CCM implementation yielded provider and Veteran benefits. Although impact on self-reported overall population health status was negligible, health status improved for complex individuals, and hospitalization rate declined.

Executives, clinic leaders, and therapists complete surveys assessing leadership and implementation climate at baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16 , and 20 months. At baseline, all therapists at the participating clinics were trained in trauma screening and a sub sample in the treatment models for PTSD (TF-CBT, EMDR, CT-PTSD), and units were randomly assigned to one of three cohorts. In addition, the strategy uses the 360 degrees assessments to inform subsequent work on tailored leadership and climate development plans to enhance implementation. Therapy sessions are audio or video recorded and scored for fidelity. Patients complete surveys assessing symptom development during the therapy process.",

Mandell, Heather Nuske, Emily Becker-Haimes Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Correspondence: Emily Becker-Haimes (embecker@upenn.edu) Implementation Science 2020, 15(Suppl 2):A26 Background Evidence-based practices for children with autism generally follow the principles of applied behavior analysis, which require frequent, systematic data collection. In Philadelphia, as in many systems, children with autism often are accompanied by a one-to-one aide, who is responsible for collecting these data as part of implementing a treatment plan. Direct observations and interviews with these aides and their supervisors confirm that aides rarely collect data in a rigorous manner. These aides often work in isolation and rarely receive consistent supervision, which may lead to the perception that data collection is not expected of them, nor do people in their position collect data in this manner. We use participatory methods combined with innovative methods borrowed from industry that incorporate the principles of behavioral economics to design implementation strategies to increase aides' data collection.",

The gravity of the opioid epidemic requires innovative and promising solutions that can be rapidly scaled [1] . Hybrid type 1 designs can speed the translation of such interventions by accomplishing the dual tasks of (a) establishing effectiveness of interventions as they are being rolled out under real-world conditions and (b) identifying determinants of implementation that can assist with planning of future scaling activities [2] [3] . The current study aims to accomplish just such a task through the replication and testing of Project Planned Outreach, Intervention, Naloxone, and Treatment (POINT), an EDbased peer support intervention aimed at connecting people with opioid use disorder to medication assisted treatment (i.e., methadone-, buprenorphine-, or naltrexone-facilitated treatment). This study is funded by a unique federal mechanism that aims to improve rapid translation of research to practice through academic-state partnerships.

Although critical for decision makers with constrained budgets and limited resources, such resource use and cost information are not typically reported. This is at least partly due to a lack of clearly defined and standardized costing methods for use in implementation science.

Measurement based care (MBC), the use of progress/ outcome monitoring measures to guide treatment [1] , is one such EBP mandated for use. It is crucial to understand the process by which mandates are received by organizations, as contextual factors may influence mandate implementation success.

[3] Conclusions Organizations implementing policy mandates for EBPs should consider how site-specific contextual drivers may interact with implementation efforts, affect mandate outcomes, and need to be addressed through targeted implementation strategies. The fields of implementation science and knowledge translation have evolved somewhat independently from the field of policy implementation research, despite calls for better integration [1] . As a result, implementation theory and empirical work do not often reflect the implementation experience from a policy lens nor benefit from the scholarship in all three fields. This means policy makers, researchers and practitioners may find it challenging to draw from theory that adequately reflects their implementation efforts.",

Impact of adaptations: useful in considering adaptations' impact on intervention outcomes (intervention effectiveness) and implementation outcomes (acceptability, cost, etc.). to help anticipate and mitigate negative consequences of adaptations (e.g., plan for implementation of an adaptation that might improve intervention effectiveness but decrease acceptability). Adaptation Typology: classifies adaptation attributes (e.g., type, nature of adaptation), providing consistency in reporting Conclusions Our guidance takes a consolidated framework developed for research and translates it to be helpful to practitioners. Our guidance helps practitioners \"back-up\" and re-think adaptations suspected to have negative impacts and helps practitioners think through \"ripple effects\" and tradeoffs of adaptations to plan accordingly (e.g., put in place an implementation strategy to monitor/boost fidelity if an adaptation is suspect to have positive impacts on acceptability, but negative impacts on fidelity).",

One causal theory that may explain the infrequent use of TNs is the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; [3] ). The TPB states that intentions, which are informed by attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, are the strongest predictor of actual behavior. The TPB also acknowledges that certain contextual factors need to be present in order for intentions to translate into actual behavior. Implementation science frameworks, such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; [4] ), provide insight into the types of contextual factors that may affect clinician behavior (e.g., organizational variables). This study aimed to identify barriers to TN use by integrating a causal theory of behavior change (TPB) and a widely used contextual framework (CFIR).",

Our prior work with school-based services for youth with autism demonstrated that studying practitioners' intentions to use specific EBP components rather than their intentions to use broader intervention protocols, may point to levers by which to tailor implementation strategies as a function of the specific EBPs themselves (e.g., their salience, complexity) [1] . We extend this work by examining variability in community clinicians' intentions to use different components of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT has long been a target of implementation efforts [2] [3] yet remains underutilized in community settings [4] [5] . CBT comprises multiple, distinct components that vary in their complexity, ranging from relatively simple (e.g., homework review) to more complex interventions (e.g., cognitive restructuring). Examining how intentions vary across specific CBT components may yield insights into how to tailor implementation strategies to increase CBT use in community settings.",

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for these disorders, but only a fraction of adolescents in need have access to high quality treatment. Access could be substantially increased if school professionals (SPs) were trained to deliver CBT. However, typical professional development and clinical training opportunities are often unsuccessful because they lack post-training support necessary for producing sustained behavioral change.

This expansion highlights the interplay of two common paradigms of program replicationdesigning program components using community-based participatory research methods and implementing programs with a high degree of fidelity. These two goals are often seen as contradictory, but successful programs are known to appraise both. Our first objective is thus to describe MOMS replication through community partners, identifying which components have been malleable based on community feedback and which were static. Our second objective is to provide the framework to measure program fidelity to the original model.",

Experiences of the early career investigators at MOMS while replicating program in three new cities provide reflections on lessons learned when entering new communities ethically and effectively, learning how to work towards program fidelity while valuing responsiveness to community need. Background Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve anxiety and depression in autistic adults [1] , who frequently struggle with these cooccurring psychiatric conditions [2] . Most autistic adults do not receive CBT, however, because of a lack of clinicians who are willing and able to treat them. We applied the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) [3] , a leading model of behavior change, to examine malleable factors that may influence community clinicians' use of CBT for autistic adults with anxiety or depression. These factors can be targeted with tailored implementation strategies to improve implementation of evidence-based practice [4] .",

Often unrecognized or undertreated among older populations, those living in poverty experience disparities in access to LLD care. PEARLS is a home-based collaborative care model (CCM) for LLD developed with social service community-based organizations (CBOs) to reach underserved older adults. Since demonstrating effectiveness via RCT in 2004, [1] we have partnered with CBOs to apply implementation science (IS) tools and strategies to improve PEARLS delivery. One of our current projects is to evaluate whether and how PEARLS may help address the recent \"epidemic\" of social isolation [2] in five US sites.",

For 8 strategies, there were no BCTs clearly indicated in the strategy definition or title (e.g., strategy: make training dynamic).

Background Barriers and facilitators assessments (BFAs) are regarded as a key step in implementation, yet our understanding of how to conduct BFAs effectively has stalled. There is an abundance of literature on barriers and facilitators (BFs) to adopting a multitude of interventions and programs, but these studies do not offer any additional insight on how BFAs can be made more meaningful and rigorous.

First, they are typically conducted before or after implementation, and do not explore the relationship between anticipated versus actual/experienced BFs. Second, they rely primarily upon self-report, although individuals tend to have a poor understanding of their own behavior. Third, they fail to examine dependencies between BFs (e.g., removing one barrier may uncover unintended consequences or \"masked\" barriers). BFAs would be enhanced by: 1) continuous assessment throughout implementation process; 2) considering their proximity to, and impact on, implementation; 3) integrating prioritization processes; 4) increased use of observation, qualitative, and mixed methods; and 5) integrating systems science methods that facilitate exploration of interdependencies.",

To demonstrate its usefulness in implementation research, we will use CNA to identify the strategies that cancer programs have used to develop comprehensive approaches to survivorship care plan implementation. The Commission on Cancer (CoC) requires cancer care providers to develop and deliver survivorship care plans (SCPs) to survivors and their primary care providers (PCPs). Cancer programs' approaches to implementing SCPs in practice substantially vary, ranging from cursory (i.e., developing SCPs to meet requirements without delivering them to survivors or PCPs) to comprehensive (i.e., promoting adherence to screening and health behavior guidelines and recommended utilization of follow-up care).",

Background Nationwide, 576,000 students were served for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during the 2014-15 school year, an increase of 51% from 2007-08 [1] . Given the significant increase in demand for educational services for students with ASD, there is urgent demand to improve implementation and sustainment of evidence-based practices (EBP) in school settings. However, the organizational and leadership structure for school-based services for ASD is complex and involves a team of providers to account for the complexity of care needed [2] [3] . Organizational culture and leadership have been found to impact EBP use in a variety of settings, but less is known about their impact in schools. As a first step toward tailoring implementation intervention for this context, the current proposal explores implementation leadership and implementation climate in relationship with provider factors.",

The field of implementation science has advanced in recent years, but unfortunately this has coincided with a growing divide between the science and practice of implementation. One strategy to bridge this gap is training implementation practitioners to apply implementation science to their initiatives in a thoughtful and proactive way. Effective implementation capacity building should be based on core competencies -the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors needed to apply implementation science. There is a growing body of literature on core competencies for implementation scientists, but same progress has not been made for core competencies for implementation practitioners. Building applied implementation science capacity at the practitioner level can foster better implementation and overall improved population-level impacts; therefore, understanding the core competencies for applying implementation science at the front line is paramount.

Conclusions This presentation will briefly highlight the methods and then focus on how to prioritize and select relevant core competencies for projects and individuals. The competencies can be used as a guide to prioritize capacity building efforts. The increased influence of implementation science has prompted an important question: if an organisation does not have personnel who are fluent in implementation science how do they apply it? Often an implementation expert, intermediary organisation or consultant is engaged. But who are they and what knowledge, skills and abilities must they have? There is limited literature on the core competencies of implementation practitioners including a lack of common terminology and title. However, there is emerging literature on the role, knowledge, skills and abilities that contribute to effective consultation for implementation [1] [2] . This presentation draws on this literature, our experience developing the implementation support capabilities of a purveyor/intermediary organisation (Triple P International) [3] learnings from Triple P International Implementation Consultants (TPI-ICs), who for over five years have supported organisations in the application of implementation science and with implementing organisations and practitioners.

It aims to promote discussion on future areas of practice development as well as exploring ways that additional research could help advance our understanding and further develop the field. Despite rigorous efforts to disseminate evidence-based treatments (EBTs) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in community settings and major medical systems such as the Veterans Health Administration, penetration rates for these treatments have been suboptimal [1] [2] . Understanding of provider-related and client-related barriers and challenges to EBT implementation is crucial to improving EBT reach with community mental health settings. This is a naturalistic study of perceived implementation barriers and challenges for EBTs for PTSD in a sample of community providers who were trained in cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure for PTSD by the STRONG STAR Training Initiative (SSTI), a comprehensive competency-based training program designed to disseminate EBTs.",

One focus of these efforts concerns training the mental health workforce, of which masters-level social workers represent a large proportion. However, the curricula of master's in social work (MSW) programs do not often emphasize evidence-based approaches. One possible solution is Managing and Adapting Practice (MAP; Practice-Wise, LLC), a system that allows clinicians to (1) identify clinically indicated evidence-based programs by searching a growing evidence-base of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and (2) build individualized evidence-informed treatment plans by focusing on common practice elements. MAP may also address the concerns about manual-based programs (e.g., inflexibility). Although some MSW programs have integrated MAP, the benefits of MAP training within MSW education have not yet been evaluated. This project evaluated multiple mechanisms of training [1] in a semester-long MSW-focused MAP course relative to curriculum-as-usual control at a large public university.",

Next, we engaged an Expert Panel in a rigorous 3-stage modified Delphi process to develop consensus on core IF activities for high complexity and low complexity clinical innovations in three implementation phases (pre-implementation, implementation, sustainment). Background All over the word medical interventions in child-birth are increasing [1] . Since 2014, in Germany, there exists a national nursing expert standard to promote physiological child-birth, which demands antenatal consultation conducted by midwives who are employed by a hospital. National expert standards define an evidence-based and practitioners consented quality level using Donabedian's model of structure, process and outcome criteria [2] . During the pilot implementation period (6 month in 2015) in 13 German hospitals, the antenatal consultation was not evaluated. Thus, to what extent antenatal consultation was implemented and how implementation success looks like remained unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate implementation fidelity (adherence, participant responsiveness) [3] and sustainability (benefits, institutionalization, development) [4] of antenatal consultation in two hospitals.",

Eighteen teachers and 18 community health volunteers (CHVs; N = 36) participated in qualitative interviews after delivering two groups of TF-CBT.

Previous research has demonstrated that the alignment or misalignment between leadership and providers on organizational constructs (e.g., implementation leadership) impacts successful implementation [1] . In particular, positive misalignment, which occurs when leaders rate the implementation context significantly lower than the staff, may facilitate the successful implementation of evidence-based practices, and negative misalignment may hinder these processes. This paper examines alignment between school administrators and their staff on implementation leadership (i.e., specific leadership behaviors that support or inhibit effective implementation) and implementation climate (i.e., shared norms and expectations among staff related to implementation).",

Following early low recruitment numbers, the study team mobilized seven clinicians and research assistants with mental health service experience, as well as members of a statewide CBT coaching network to reach out to schools. Leveraging these existing community partnerships served to significantly increase recruitment success, with average number of schools recruited increasing from 6/month prior to coach involvement to 39/month after. Further, discussion with SPs about their concerns regarding participation also proved helpful, as most were related to implementation of CBT in their work, rather than study participation. Discussing the experiences of past program participants, as well as program flexibility, helped assuage these concerns. Notably, SPs were generally not persuaded by discussion of study incentives ($330 over 18 months), but rather by empirical evidence related to student mental health improvement.",

To the extent that experts think that less obviously impaired students would benefit from 1:1 instruction, those working with teachers should address practical, attitudinal and structural barriers to providing 1:1 instruction to a larger proportion of students. This study highlights the importance of considering client characteristics in the development and study of implementation strategies, across EBPs and contexts. The Veterans Health Administration recommends that patients with PTSD receive either of the two evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE). However, in one survey, clinicians who completed the national PE training program reported that they only treated one or two patients at a time with PE [1] . In another survey, 69% of the clinicians who were trained in CPT provided CPT \"rarely\" or \"less than half the time\" [2] .

However, a review of billing data shows that few parent training sessions have been billed under the Medicaid Autism Benefit, despite providers having the ability to bill for the service at a high reimbursement rate.

No single approach can meet the multi-dimensional needs of impoverished, high-risk families. With this in mind, the Building Healthy Children (BHC) intervention program was designed as a collaborative community initiative to prevent child maltreatment and support healthy development in newborns of young mothers [1] [2] . This inter-agency collaborative was comprised of medical, university and community partners, with a strong focus exporting evidence-based models and translating research to practice. BHC was designed as a home visitation program that employed a tiered model of service delivery based on families' individual needs, in order to effectively and efficiently deliver outreach and evidence-based treatment models. These treatment models addressed parenting (Parents as Teachers), attachment (Child-Parent Psychotherapy), and maternal depression (Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression), and each has received substantial evidentiary support [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

The COACH observational rating system assesses fidelity to the FCU4-Health. In a prior trial, COACH ratings have been associated with higher concurrent ratings of parent engagement, and in turn, longitudinal improvements in parenting and child behaviors [2] . Further, coordinators with more training had better MI skills, and this was positively linked with parent engagement [3] suggesting that MI skills are a core component of change.

Most notably, caregivers of teens with psychopathology symptoms and a therapy history were less likely to value principles of EBP. Caregivers of teens with substance use and legal problems also tended to prefer other terms over EBP. Background Children with behavior difficulties reared by child welfare (CW)-involved families often fail to receive needed mental health (MH) treatment due to limited service capacity and chronic engagement difficulties [1] . Task-shifting strategies (World Health Organization, 2008) can increase MH treatment access by relocating treatment to alternative service platforms (e.g., CW service settings) and utilizing a non-specialized workforce (e.g., CW caseworkers) to deliver MH interventions while supervised by trained clinicians. In this study, an evidence-based, multiple family group intervention (The 4Rs and 2Ss Program for Strengthening Families [4R2S]; [2] [3] [4] ) to reduce child disruptive behavioral difficulties was modified so that it could be delivered by CW caseworkers without advanced MH training. This study examines the degree to which CW staff perceived delivering 4R2S in CW placement prevention services as feasible and acceptable, as well as those factors reported to facilitate or hinder feasibility and acceptability.",

Most teachers felt they were able to be more effective teachers due to participating in the intervention (72%), while only 44% of CHVs reported improvement in their role due to participation. As salaried professionals, teachers did not receive compensation for participation; however, as volunteers, the CHVs received a stipend, which was endorsed by 61% as a reward/incentive. Further, CHVs-often considered the health system's extension into the community-perceived additional rewards and incentives in relation to their communities that teachers did not. Nearly half of CHVs (44%) reported receiving rewards and incentives from outside their job (e.g., gifts/acknowledgment from community members), whereas only 2 teachers (11%) reported rewards/incentives from outside their profession. CHVs reported benefit to their personal life slightly more frequently than teachers (56% v 44%). Conclusions Encouraging participation and sustaining task-sharing interventions requires understanding how rewards and incentives are perceived. For professionals, like teachers, emphasizing rewards and incentives related to their profession may encourage participation and enable sustainment. For non-salaried volunteers, highlighting rewards and incentives from their communities might be more beneficial. In both systems, counselors reported similar levels of personal benefit, like using skills to manage their own grief, suggesting participation goes beyond profession and stipend to add value to counselors' personal lives.

Conclusions This is among the first studies to explore implementation of VA's ATS and through the lens of the NASSS framework. The NASSS framework highlighted how the system can be better embedded into current practices, which patients might benefit most from its functionality, and which aspects of ATS messages are potentially most relevant to self-management. Mobile phone SMS texting is rapidly becoming an accepted means of asynchronous communication between healthcare systems and patients. Our findings reveal that VA's ATS has potential to expand the reach of VA care; however, providers require additional support to adopt, implement, and sustain ATS use.",

Modified nominal group exercise involving implementation scientists and primary care clinicians, with synthesis of the exercise results Participants: 5 implementation scientists and 26 clinicians from primary care clinics in the WWAMI region Practice and Research Network. Every implementation scientist and clinician chose their top 5 implementation strategies from a list of the 73 evidence-based, published strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study [3] for the 13 barriers. For each barrier, we examined the degree of agreement among \u226530% of clinicians, \u226530% of scientists, or \u226530% of both on chosen strategies. Results \u2265 30% of clinicians and/or scientists chose 39/73 top implementation strategies they felt were the most important to address barriers to CVD risk calculation. Implementation scientists chose 34 of these 39 top strategies; clinicians chose 21. Scientists and clinicians agreed on the choice of 14 of the top implementation strategies. On average, a total of 7 top implementation strategies were chosen by either scientists or clinicians for each barrier; however, scientists and clinicians agreed on only 1 of these top strategies. Conclusions Implementation scientists and clinicians generally choose different implementation strategies to overcome barriers to implementing a CVD risk calculator in practice. Collaboration between these stakeholders could guide the choice of a broader range of strategies to overcome barriers to evidence-based practice. Background Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the main cause of death in American women and CV risk factors are often less controlled in women compared to men. To address CV risk among women Veterans, we developed a CV toolkit comprised of a patient screener, an electronic health record template, and a health education group tailored for women to target CV goal-setting. We describe how iterative cycles of adaptation during implementation allows us to improve fit with local context, address barriers, and increase engagement with CV toolkit components.",

Background Up-to-date human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the US has increased since the vaccine's introduction over a decade ago to 49% of adolescents ages 13-17 in 2017 [1] . However, vaccination coverage remains far below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% for adolescents ages 13-15 [1] . As a strategy to improve uptake, the President's Cancer Panel [2] and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee [3] have recommended expanding HPV vaccine provision in pharmacies. Pharmacies are promising alternative settings for HPV vaccination because of their population reach, convenience, and existing infrastructure for vaccine delivery. As a result, pilot projects conducted in five states aimed to demonstrate the utility of pharmacy-located HPV vaccination services for adolescents. To date, no study we are aware of has documented the experiences of implementing HPV vaccination programs in real-world pharmacy settings. We sought to document challenges and opportunities of implementing pharmacylocated HPV vaccination services in five US states.",

Conclusions TTTF has proven successful in integrating tobacco cessation interventions into regular clinical practice to address tobacco use within behavioral health clinics. Mixing methods involved program adopters and recipients as collaborators who directly impacted implementation by shaping the intervention to their individual context and needs. Collaboration of such key stakeholders was vital to increasing program fit, ownership, adoption and sustainability; closing the gap between research and practice. These findings contribute to the development of flexible strategies and tailored interventions responsive to real-world conditions in diverse settings which better address implementation barriers thus enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of a tobacco-free workplace program.",

ED stakeholders included registered nurses (RNs), nursing assistants (NAs), social workers (SWs). To understand ED perspectives, research staff conducted semi-structured interviews (SSIs) with interview guides developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) [7] Guides included constructs from four CFIR domains (i.e., intervention characteristics, inner setting, characteristics of individuals, process). SSIs were transcribed and analyzed using framework-guided rapid analysis [8] [9] . To understand the patient perspective, research staff tested screening questions with 75 older patients to identify how many are at-risk, and gauge receptivity to screening and referrals within the ED. Research staff worked with a CBO to understand their perspective on data sharing, referral pathways and \"closing-the-loop.\" Results Nine SSIs (n=3 RNs, n=2 NAs, n=4 SWs) were analyzed. Common themes related to constructs from CFIR domains were identified, including building the screener into the EHR, comparing to existing screening processes, and educating ED staff. A critical finding was that NAs, not RNs, should screen patients. From the sample of patients screened, approximately 35% were positive for malnutrition, 18% for food insecurity and 8% for both. Patients were receptive to being screened in the ED and indicated they would be willing to receive help connecting to CBOs. The CBO informed the development of referral workflows, particularly bidirectional communication and datapoints to facilitate data sharing.",

Barriers included lack of systematic alcohol screening procedures; variability in clinicians' knowledge, comfort, and interest in providing evidencebased treatments (e.g., medications for alcohol use disorder); perceived inadequate linkage with specialty addiction treatment and/or behavioral health; and challenges related to staffing time/availability. Facilitators included system-and clinic-level leadership support, histories of successful quality improvement efforts, staff who are wellprepared to serve as clinical champions, consensus regarding the importance of addressing alcohol use, enthusiasm for several planned practice facilitation elements, and cohesive teams.

Complicating this challenge is that robust application of implementation science requires supporting behavior change at each of individual, organizational, and system levels. \"Technical assistance,\" \"facilitation,\" and \"implementation support\" are terms often used to describe the concept of \"implementation practice.\" Regardless of these labels, what drives the effective application of implementation science within real world environments? Materials and Methods Drawing from a review of relevant literature and our experience facilitating the real-world application of implementation science, members of The Impact Center at FPG organized ten theoretically-and empirically-informed core practice components to strengthen implementation support processes. These ten proposed core practice components underwent initial feasibility testing within two projects involving implementation support for communities scaling an evidence-based system of parenting interventions. For more than two years, implementation specialists have tracked their utilization of the practice components across interactions with community sites. Implementation specialists working to build the capacity of intermediary partners also tracked their use of practice components. All community and intermediary sites received monthly surveys to report process and short-term outcomes. Intended long-term outcomes of implementation support (capacity to support implementation best practices at community and intermediary levels) were assessed every six months.",

Supported sites reported favorable process outcomes, such as acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness. Short-term outcomes, such as working alliance, have been useful markers for early successes or challenges. Long-term capacity outcomes have demonstrated improvement over time. Notwithstanding these strengths, Center implementation specialists voiced a need for greater clarity about operational activities related to the practice components. This recently led members of Center to re-operationalize the components to better support consistent application. Next steps include the development of a complete practice profile, stronger training and fidelity assessment materials, and formative evaluation methods to test statistical associations between the components and intended short-and long-term outcomes.",

This has limited reach of training and opportunities for multi-institutional development of broad D&I capacity. In addition, investigators must effectively engage with other partners, from clinical trials centers to community partners and policymakers. Such engagement skills need to be embedded in the core D&I training. This includes assisting earlier stage translational scientists' participation in next stage activities, with designing for dissemination at the forefront.",

Significant investments are being made to decrease the gap between this evidence and its application at scale. Our objectives were to systematically review implementation research targeting depression interventions in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) and critically assess coverage and scientific gaps.Materials and MethodsPubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE were searched for evaluations of depression interventions in LMICs reporting at least one implementation outcome. Study-and intervention-level characteristics were abstracted. Results A total of 7,034 studies were screened, 589 were assessed for eligibility, and 59 studies published between 2003 and 2017 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (n=24; 40.7%), followed by South Asia (n=17; 28.8%), and Latin America and the Caribbean (n=12; 20.3%). The majority of studies (n=41; 69.5%) reported outcomes for a depression intervention that was implemented at the pilot/ research phase. The majority of studies (n=35; 59.3%) focused on depressive interventions delivered at the facility level, with 22 (37.3%) delivered in the community. Thirty studies (50.9%) utilized non-specialized healthcare workers as the implementing agent. Primary depression intervention modalities were individual psychotherapy (n=20; 33.9%) and multicomponent interventions (n=20; 33.9%). Only 19 studies (32.2%) tested an implementation strategy, with the most common implementation strategy being revising professional roles (n=8; 42.1%). The most common implementation outcomes reported were acceptability (n=39; 66.1%), followed by feasibility (n=22; 37.3%), and fidelity (n=16; 27.1%). No study reported penetration, and only 3 (5.1%) reported adoption or sustainability. Conclusions Implementation research for depressive interventions in LMICs has focused largely on early-stage implementation outcomes. Most studies have the primary aim of testing evidence-based interventions under pilot researcher-controlled implementation. Future implementation research could prioritize the development and testing of implementation strategies to promote delivery of evidence-based depression interventions in routine care. This would include increased consideration of contextual factors, as well as later-stage implementation outcomes such as cost, penetration, and sustainability. Certain regions, such as Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia could be prioritized for investments given the paucity of research.",
