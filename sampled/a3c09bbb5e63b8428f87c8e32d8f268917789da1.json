In December 2010, Alberta Health Services (AHS) implemented a province-wide hospital overcapacity protocol (OCP) structured upon the Viccellio model. in patient-hours (pt-hrs). Throughput is reported as time from ED arrival to physician assessment and percent left without being seen (LWBS). Continuous variables were compared with the Student's t-test. Results: The volume of ED patients across all sites increased by 6.3% from the pre phase to the post phase (579071 vs. 615787; p < 0.001) while admission rates remained constant (12.9% vs. 13.1%; p = NS). ED LOS for admitted patients decreased from 17.2 hours to 11.6 hours (p < 0.001); the load of admitted patients at 10 am declined from 11.3 pt-hrs to 6.1 (p < 0.001). Average time from ED arrival to physician assessment decreased in the post phase (113.2 vs. 99.3 minutes; p < 0.001) as did % LWBS (4.0% vs 3.8%; p < 0.001). All OCP effects remained constant over time; however, there were regional disparities in its impact. Conclusion: Policy-driven changes in ED and hospital operations were associated with significant improvements in both throughput and output metrics, despite increased input. Which components of the OCP program had the greatest impact are uncertain, as are explanations for the differential regional impact.",

            "text": "Background: Burns are characterized by an eschar that delays diagnosis and increases the risk of infection and scarring. As a result, surgical excision of the eschar is a cornerstone of care requiring specialized personnel and facilities. Objectives: A novel debriding agent that could be used by emergency physicians (EPs) was developed to overcome the weaknesses of surgical and conventional enzymatic debridement. We hypothesized that the novel agent would reduce the need for surgical excision and skin grafting compared with standard care (SC). Methods: The safety and efficacy of a novel Debriding Gel Dressing (DGD) was determined in six studies; five were RCTs. Treatments (DGD, control vehicle, or SC) were randomly allocated to deep partial and full thickness burns covering less than 30% TBSA by a computer-generated randomization scheme. Primary endpoints were percentage eschar debridement, rate of surgical burn excision and total area excised. Efficacy analyses were intention to treat. Results: 518 patients were enrolled. Percentage eschar debridement was greater than 90% in all studies for DGD, which was comparable to SC, and significantly greater than control vehicle, which was negligible. In the third study, the total area surgically excised was significantly less in DGD-treated patients compared with patients treated with the control vehicle (22.9% vs. 73.2%, P < 0.001) or SC (50.5%, P = 0.006). In the sixth, phase III RCT the rate of surgical excision was significantly lower in DGD-treated patients than in control patients treated with SC (40/163 [24.5%] vs. 119/170 [70.0%], P < 0.001). The total area surgically excised was also significantly less in DGD-treated patients compared with patients treated with SC (13.1% vs. 56.7%, P < 0.001). Local and systemic adverse events were similar for DGD and SC. Conclusion: DGD is a safe and effective method of burn debridement that offers an alternative, minimally invasive burn care modality to standard surgical excision that could be used by EPs.",

Methods: A prospective pre-post experimental study was conducted using administrative data from 15 community and tertiary centers across the province. The study phases consisted of the 8 months from February to September 2010 compared against the same months in 2011. Operational data for all centres were collected through the EDIS tracking systems used in the province. The OCP included 3 main triggers: ED bed occupancy >110%, at least 35% of ED stretchers blocked by patients awaiting inpatient bed or disposition decision, and no stretcher available for high acuity patients. When all criteria were met, selected boarded patients were moved to an inpatient unit (non-traditional care space if no bed available). The primary outcome was ED length of stay (LOS) for admitted patients.

Objectives: To define diagnostic SBI and non-bacterial (non-SBI) biosignatures using RNA microarrays in febrile infants presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Methods: We prospectively collected blood for RNA microarray analysis in addition to routine screening tests including white blood cell (WBC) counts, urinalyses, cultures of blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, and viral studies in febrile infants 60 days of age in 22 EDs . We defined SBI as bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or bacterial meningitis.

Infants with SBIs had higher mean temperatures, and higher WBC, neutrophil, and band counts. We analyzed RNA biosignatures on 141 febrile infants: 35 SBIs (2 meningitis, 5 bacteremia, 28 UTI), 106 non-SBIs (49 influenza, 29 enterovirus, 28 undefined viral infections), and 11 healthy controls. Class comparisons identified 1,288 differentially expressed genes between SBIs and non-SBIs. Modular analysis revealed overexpression of interferon related genes in non-SBIs and inflammation related genes in SBIs. 232 genes were differently expressed (p < 0.01) in each of the three non-SBI groups vs SBI group. Unsupervised cluster analysis of these 232 genes correctly clustered 91% (128/141) of non-SBIs and SBIs. K-NN algorithm identified 33 discriminatory genes in training set (30 non-SBIs vs 17 SBIs) which classified an independent test (76 non-SBIs vs 18 SBIs) with 87% accuracy. Four misclassified SBIs had over-expression of interferon-related genes, suggesting viral-bacterial co-infections, which was confirmed in one patient.

All patients had an initial lactate measured with repeat at two hours. Normalization of lactate was defined a lactate decline to <2.0 mmol/L in a patient with an intial lactate \u20212.0. Absolute lactate clearance (initial -delayed value), and relative ((absolute clearance)/(initial value)*100) were calculated if the initial lactate was \u20212.0. The outcome was in-hospital survival. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed and areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Difference in proportions of survival between the two groups at different lactate cutoffs were analyzed using 95% CI and Fisher exact tests. Results: Of 272 included patients, the median initial lactate was 3.1 mmol/L (IQR 1.7, 5.8), and the median absolute and relative lactate clearance were 1 mmol/L (IQR 0.3, 2.5) and 37% (IQR 14, 57 ).

The mean times from injury to repair for infected and noninfected wounds were 2.4 vs. 3.0 hrs (p = 0.39) with 78% of lacerations treated within 3 hours and 4% (85) treated 12 hours after injury. There were no differences in the infection rates for lacerations closed before (2.9%, 95%CI 2.2-3.7) or after (2.1%, 95%CI 0.4-6.0) 6 hours and before (3.0%, 95% CI 2.3%-3.8%) or after (1.2%, 95% CI 0.03%-6.4%) 12 hours. The patients treated 12 hours after injury tended to be older (41 vs. 34 yrs p = 0.02) and fewer were treated with primary closure (85% vs. 96% P < 0.0001). Comparing wounds 12 or more hours after injury with more recent wounds, there was no effect of location on decision to close. Wounds closed after 12 hours did not differ from wounds closed before 12 hours with respect to use of prophylactic antibiotics, type of repair, length of laceration, or cosmetic outcome. Conclusion: Closing older lacerations, even those greater than 12 hours after injury, does not appear to be associated with any increased risk of infection or adverse outcomes. Excellent irrigation and decontamination over the last 30 years may have led to this change in outcome. Background: Deep burns may result in significant scarring leading to aesthetic disfigurement and functional disability. TGF-b is a growth factor that plays a significant role in wound healing and scar formation. Objectives: The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that a novel TGF-b antagonist would reduce scar contracture compared with its vehicle in a porcine partial thickness burn model. Methods: Ninety-six mid-dermal contact burns were created on the backs and flanks of four anesthetized young swine using a 150 gm aluminum bar preheated to 80\u00b0Celsius for 20 seconds. The burns were randomized to treatment with topical TGF-b antagonist at one of three concentrations (0, 187, and 375 lL) in replicates of 8 in each pig. Dressing changes and reapplication of the topical therapy were performed every 2 days for 2 weeks then twice weekly for an additional 2 weeks. Burns were photographed and full thickness biopsies were obtained at 5, 7, 9, 14, and 28 days to determine reepithelialization and scar formation grossly and microscopically. A sample of 32 burns in each group had 80% power to detect a 10% difference in percentage scar contracture.",

Background: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common and lethal complication of diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends treating adult patients with a bolus dose of regular insulin followed by a continuous insulin infusion. The ADA also suggests a glucose correction rate of 75-100 mg/dl/hr to minimize complications. Objectives: Compare the effect of bolus dose insulin therapy with insulin infusion to insulin infusion alone on serum glucose, bicarbonate, and pH in the initial treatment of DKA. Methods: Consecutive DKA patients were screened in the ED between March '06 and June '10. Inclusion criteria were: age >18 years, glucose >350 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 15 or ketonemia or ketonuria. Exclusion criteria were: congestive heart failure, current hemodialysis, pregnancy, or inability to consent. No patient was enrolled more than once. Patients were randomized to receive either regular insulin 0.1 units/kg or the same volume of normal saline. Patients, medical and research staff were blinded. Baseline glucose, electrolytes, and venous blood gases were collected on arrival. Bolus insulin or placebo was then administered and all enrolled patients received regular insulin at rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hr, as well as fluid and potassium repletion per the research protocol. Glucose, electrolytes, and venous blood gases were drawn hourly for 4 hours. Data between two groups were compared using unpaired t-test. Results: 99 patients were enrolled, with 30 being excluded. 35 patients received bolus insulin; 34 received placebo. No significant differences were noted in initial glucose, pH, bicarbonate, age, or weight between the two groups. After the first hour, glucose levels in the insulin group decreased by 151 mg/dL compared to 94 mg/dL in the placebo group (p = 0.0391, 95% CI 2.7 to 102.0). Changes in mean glucose levels, pH, bicarbonate level, and AG were not statistically different between the two groups for the remainder of the 4 hour study period. There was no difference in the incidence of hypoglycemia in the two groups. Conclusion: Administering a bolus dose of regular insulin decreased mean glucose levels more than placebo, although only for the first hour. There was no difference in the change in pH, serum bicarbonate or anion gap at any interval. This suggests that bolus dose insulin may not add significant benefit in the emergency management of DKA.",

Consecutive patients meeting PRE-SHOCK criteria were enrolled over a 1-year period. Patients with overt shock in the ED, pregnancy, or acute trauma were excluded. Outcome: Primary patientcentered outcome of increased organ failure (sequential organ failure assessment [SOFA] score increase >1 point, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressor utilization) within 72 hours of admission or in-hospital mortality. Results: We identified 248 PRE-SHOCK patients from 2649 screened. The primary outcome was met in 54% of the cohort and 44% were transferred to the ICU from a medical floor. Patients meeting the outcome of increased organ failure had a greater Shock Index (1.02 vs 0.93, p = 0.042) and heart rate (115 vs 105, p < 0.001) with no difference in initial lactate, age, MAP, or exposure to hypotension (sBP <100 mmHg). There was no difference in the Predisposition, Infection, Response, and Organ dysfunction (PIRO) score between groups (6.4 vs 5.7, p = 0.052). Outcome patients had similar initial levels of organ dysfunction but had higher SOFA scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours, a higher ICU transfer rate (60 vs 24%, p < 0.001), and increased ICU and hospital lengths of stay. Conclusion: The PRE-SHOCK sepsis population has a high incidence of clinical deterioration, progressive organ failure, and ICU transfer. Physiologic data in the ED were unable to differentiate the PRE-SHOCK sepsis patients who developed increased organ failure. This study supports the need for an objective organ failure assessment in the emergency department to supplement clinical decision-making. Background: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has long been recognized to initiate the host inflammatory response to infection with gram negative bacteria (GNB). Large clinical trials of potentially very expensive therapies continue to have the objective of reducing circulating LPS. Previous studies have found varying prevalence of LPS in blood of patients with severe sepsis. Compared with sepsis trials conducted 20 years ago, the frequency of GNB in culture specimens from emergency department (ED) patients enrolled in clinical trials of severe sepsis has decreased. Objectives: Test the hypothesis that prior to antibiotic administration, circulating LPS can be detected in the plasma of fewer than 10% of ED patients with severe sepsis. Methods: Secondary analysis of a prospective EDbased RCT of early quantitative resuscitation for severe sepsis. Blood specimens were drawn at the time severe sepsis was recognized, defined as two or more systemic inflammatory criteria and a serum lactate >4 mM or SPB<90 mmHg after fluid challenge. Blood was drawn in EDTA prior to antibiotic administration or within the first several hours, immediately centrifuged, and plasma frozen at )80\u00b0C. Plasma LPS was quantified using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay (LAL) by a technician blinded to all clinical data.",

Also, by applying MEDS score to risk stratify patients into various groups of illness severity, we found no specific groups where EGDT is more efficacious at reducing the Predicted Probability of death (Table 1) . Without controlling for MEDS score, there is a trend in reduction of absolute mortality by 9.7% when EGDT is used (control = 30.2%, study = 20.5%, p = 0.086). EGDT leads to a 40.3% reduction in the median LOS in ICU (control = 124 hours, study = 74 hours, p = 0.03), without increasing LOS in ED (control = 6 hours, study = 7 hours, p = 0.50). Conclusion: EGDT is beneficial in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, regardless of their MEDS score. Background: In patients experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prompt diagnosis is critical in achieving the best health outcome. While ECG analysis is usually sufficient to diagnose ACS in cases of ST elevation, ACS without ST elevation is reliably diagnosed through serial testing of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Pointof-care testing (POCT) for cTnI by venipuncture has been proven a more rapid means to diagnosis than central laboratory testing. Implementing fingerstick testing for cTnI in place of standard venipuncture methods would allow for faster and easier procurement of patients' cTnI levels, as well as increase the likelihood of starting a rapid test for cTnI in the prehospital setting, which could allow for even earlier diagnosis of ACS.",

Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain history, lab, and ECG data. Subjects included those with self-reported or lab-confirmed cocaine use and chest pain. They were matched to controls based on age, sex, and race. Our main outcome was diagnosis of ACS at index visit. We determined median MPO and CRP values, calculated maximal AUC for ROC curves, and found cut-points to maximize sensitivity and specificity. Data are presented with 95% CI. Results: Overall, 95 patients in the cocaine positivegroup and 86 patients in the nonusers group had MPO and CRP levels measured. Patients had a median age of 47 (IQR, (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) , 90% black or African American, and 62% male (p > 0.05 between groups). Fifteen patients were diagnosed with ACS: 8 patients in the cocaine group and 7 in the nonusers group. Comparing cocaine users to nonusers, there was no difference in MPO (median 162 [IQR, ] v 136 ng/mL; p = 0.78) or CRP (3 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] v 5 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] mg/L; p = 0.08). The AUC for MPO was 0.65 (95% CI 0.39-0.90) v 0.54 (95% CI 0.19-0.73). The optimal cut-point to maximize sensitivity and specificity was 242 ng/mL which gave a sensitivity of 0.42 and specificity of 0.75. Using this cutpoint, 57% v 29% of ACS in cocaine users vs the nonusers would be identified. The AUC for CRP was 0.63 (95% CI 0.39-0.88) in cocaine users vs 0.73 (95% CI 0.52-0.95) in nonusers. The optimal cut point was 11.9 mg/L with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.79. Using this cutpoint, 43% v 88% of ACS in cocaine users and nonusers would have been identified. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of MPO and CRP is not different in cocaine users than nonusers and does not appear to have sufficient discriminatory ability in either cohort. Results: 18 hrs of moderate PE caused a significant decrease in RV heart function in rats treated with the solvent for BAY 41-8543: peak systolic pressure (PSP) decreased from 39 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg, control to 16 \u00b1 1.5, PE, +dP/dt decreased from 1192 \u00b1 93 mmHg/sec to 463 \u00b1 77, -dP/dt decreased from )576 \u00b1 60 mmHg/sec to )251 \u00b1 9.

Conclusion: Experimental PE produced significant RV dysfunction, which was ameliorated by treatment of the animals with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, BAY 41-8543. 1 Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; 2 Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ Background: Patients who present to the ED with symptoms of potential acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can be safely discharged home after a negative coronary computerized tomographic angiography (CTA). However, the duration of time for which a negative coronary CTA can be used to inform decision making when patients have recurrent symptoms is unknown. Objectives: We examined patients who received more than one coronary CTA for evaluation of ACS to determine whether they had disease progression, as defined by crossing the threshold from noncritical (<50% maximal stenosis) to potentially critical disease. Methods: We performed a structured comprehensive record search of all coronary CTAs performed from 2005 to 2010 at a tertiary care health system. Low-tointermediate risk ED patients who received two or more coronary CTAs, at least one from an ED evaluation for potential ACS, were identified. Patients who were revascularized between scans were excluded. We collected demographic data, clinical course, time between scans, and number of ED visits between scans. Record review was structured and done by trained abstractors. Our main outcome was progression of coronary stenosis between scans, specifically crossing the threshold from noncritical to potentially critical disease. Results: Overall, 32 patients met study criteria (median age 45, interquartile range [IQR] (37.5-48); 56% female; 88% black). The median time between studies was 27.3 months (IQR, . 22 patients did not have stenosis in any vessel on either coronary CTA, two studies showed increasing stenosis of <20%, and the rest showed ''improvement,'' most due to better imaging quality. No patient initially below the 50% threshold subsequently exceeded it (0%; 95% CI, 0-11.0%).",

Conclusion: We did not find clinically significant disease progression within a 2 year time frame in patients who had a negative coronary CTA, despite a high number of repeat visits. This suggests that prior negative coronary CTA may be able to be used to inform decision making within this time period. 42.7-48.6) compared to non TRO CT patients. There was no significant difference in image quality between TRO CT images and those of dedicated CT scans in any studies performing this comparison. Similarly, there was no significant difference between TRO CT and other diagnostic modalities in regards to length of stay or admission rate. When compared to conventional coronary angiography as the gold standard for evaluation of CAD, TRO CT had the following pooled diagnostic accuracy estimates: sensitivity 0.94 Conclusion: TRO chest CT is comparable to dedicated PE, coronary, or AD CT in regard to image quality, length of stay, and admission rate and is highly accurate for detecting CAD. The utility of TRO CT depends on the relative pre-test probabilities of the conditions being assessed and its role is yet to be clearly defined. TRO CT, however, involves increased radiation exposure and contrast volume and for this reason clinicians should be selective in its use. Background: Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) has high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and prognostic value for coronary artery disease (CAD) and ACS. However, how a CCTA informs subsequent use of prescription medication is unclear.",

Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of several combined prospective cohort studies that enrolled ED patients who received an evaluation for ACS in an urban ED from 1999 to 2009. Cocaine users and STEMI patients were excluded. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, pain description, history, lab, and ECG data for all studies. Hospital course was followed daily. Thirty-day follow up was done by telephone. Our main outcome was 30-day MACE using objective criteria. The secondary outcome was potential change in ED disposition due to application of the rule. Descriptive statistics and 95% CIs were used. Results: Of 9289 visits for potential ACS, patients had a mean age of 52.4 \u00b1 14.7 yrs; 68% were black and 59% female.

However, even without application of this rule, the 70% of young patients at low risk are already being discharged home based upon clinical judgment. Background: A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) incorporates evidence-based medicine into clinical practice, but this technology is underutilized in the ED. A CDSS can be integrated directly into an electronic medical record (EMR) to improve physician efficiency and ease of use. The Christopher study investigators validated a clinical decision rule for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). The rule stratifies patients using Wells' criteria to undergo either D-dimer testing or a CT angiogram (CT). The effect of this decision rule, integrated as a CDSS into the EMR, on ordering CTs has not been studied. Objectives: To assess the effect of a mandatory CDSS on the ordering of D-dimers and CTs for patients with suspected PE. Methods: We assessed the number of CTs ordered for patients with suspected PE before and after integrating a mandatory CDSS in an urban community ED. Physicians were educated regarding CDSS use prior to implementation. The CDSS advised physicians as to whether a negative D-dimer alone excluded PE or if a CT was required based on Wells' criteria. The EMR required physicians to complete the CDSS prior to ordering the CT. However, physicians maintained the ability to order a CT regardless of the CDSS recommendation. Patients \u202118 years of age presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, or palpitations were included in the data analysis. We compared the proportion of D-dimers and CTs ordered during the 8-month periods immediately before and after implementing the CDSS. All 27 physicians who worked in the ED during both time periods were included in the analysis. Patients with an allergy to intravenous contrast agents, renal insufficiency, or pregnancy were excluded. Results were analyzed using a chi-square test.",

All adult ED patients who were diagnosed with PE during a 24-month period from 11/1/09 through 10/31/11 were identified. The Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score, a previously validated clinical decision rule to risk stratify patients with PE, was calculated. Patients with high PESI (>85) were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included patients who were at high risk of complications from initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation and those patients with other clear indications for admission to the hospital. The remaining cohort of patients with low risk PE (PESI \u00a3 85) was included in the final analysis. Outcomes were measured at 14 and 90 days after PE diagnosis and included death, major bleeding, and objectively confirmed recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Results: During the study period, 298 total patients were diagnosed with PE. There were 172 (58%) patients categorized as ''low risk'' (PESI \u00a3 85), with 42 removed because of various pre-defined exclusion criteria. Of the remaining 130 (44%) patients suitable for outpatient treatment, 5 patients (3.8%; 95% CI, 0.5% -7.2%) had one or more negative outcomes by 90 days. This included 2 (1.5%; 95% CI, 0% -3.7%) major bleeding events, 2 (1.5%; 95% CI, 0% -3.7%) recurrent VTE, and 2 (1.5%; 95% CI, 0% -3.7%) deaths. None of the deaths were attributable to PE or anticoagulation. One patient suffered both a recurrent VTE and died within 90 days. Both patients who died within 90 days were transitioned to hospice care because of worsening metastatic burden. At 14 days, there was 1 bleeding event (0.8%; 95% CI, 0% -2.3%), no recurrent VTE, and no deaths.",

In addition, the average hospital length of stay for these patients was 2.8 days, which may represent a potential cost savings if these patients had been managed as outpatients. Our experience supports previous studies that suggest the safety of outpatient treatment of patients diagnosed with PE in the ED. Given the potential savings related to a decreased need for hospitalization, these results have health policy implications and support the feasibility of creating protocols to facilitate this clinical practice change. Background: Chest x-rays (CXRs) are commonly obtained on ED chest pain patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Abnormalities on CXR and specific interventions were predetermined, with a positive CXR defined as one with abnormality requiring ED intervention, and a negative CXR defined as either normal or abnormal but not requiring ED intervention. The final radiologist report was used as a reference standard for CXR interpretation.

Methods: Prospective enrollment at four academic US hospitals. Inclusion criteria required patients to have at least one symptom or sign and one risk factor for PE, and have 64-channel CTPA completed. Pretest probability data were collected in real time and the D-dimer was measured in a central laboratory. Criterion standard for PE or pneumonia consisted of CPTA interpretation by two independent radiologists combined with necessary treatment plan. Subsegmental PE was defined as total vascular obstruction <5%. Patients were followed for outcome at 30 days. Proportions were compared with 95% CIs. Results: Of 678 patients enrolled, 126 (19%) were PE+ and 93 (14%) had pneumonia. With RGS\u00a36 and standard threshold (<500 ng/mL), D-dimer was negative in 110/678 (16%, 95% CI: 13-19%), and 4/110 were PE+ (posterior probability 3.8%, 95% CI: 1-9.3%). With RGS\u00a36 and a threshold <1000 ng/mL, D-dimer was negative in 208/678 (31%, 27-44%) and 11/208 (5.3%, 2.8-9.3%) were PE+, but 10/11 missed PEs were subsegmental, and none had concomitant DVT. The posterior probability for pneumonia among patients with RGS&#8804;6 and D-dimer<500 was 9/110 (8.2%, 4-15%) which compares favorably to the posterior probability of 12/208 (5.4%, 3-10%) observed with RGS& #8804;6 and D-dimer<1000 ng/mL. Of the 200 (35%) patients who also had plain film CXR, radiologists found an infiltrate in only 58. Use of Wells\u00a34 produced similar results as the RGS&#8804;6 for exclusion rate and posterior probability of both PE and pneumonia. Conclusion: Doubling the threshold for a positive D-dimer with a PE unlikely pretest probability can significantly reduce CTPA scanning with a slightly increased risk of missed isolated subsegmental PE, and no increase in rate of missed pneumonia.",

Methods: Design -Prospective observational review of all patients for whom transfer to a hospital was requested or for whom a clinic ambulance was requested to an off-site location to assist with patient care. Setting -Weekday, daytime only clinic in Titanyen, Haiti. Participants/Subjects -Consecutive series of all patients for whom transfer to another health care facility or for whom an ambulance was requested during the time period of 11/22/2010 -12/14/2010 and 3/28/2011 -5/13/2011 . Results: Between 11/22/2010 -12/14/2010 and 3/28/2011 -5/13/2011 patients were identified who needed to be transferred to a higher level of care. Sixteen patients (43.2%) presented with medical complaints, 12 (32.4%) were trauma patients, 6 (16.2%) were surgical, and 3 (8.1%) were in the obstetric category. Within these categories, 6 patients were pediatric and 4 non-trauma patients required blood transfusion. Conclusion: While trauma services are often focused on in rural developing world medicine, the need for obstetric care and blood transfusion constituted six (16.2%) cases in our sample. These patients raise important public health, planning, and policy questions relating to access to prenatal care and the need to better understand transfusion medicine utilization among rural Haitian patients with non-trauma related transfusion needs. The data set is limited by sample size and single location of collection. Another limitation of understanding the needs is that many patients may not present to the clinic for their health care needs in certain situations if they have knowledge that the resources to provide definitive care are unavailable.",

Methods: The ER Committee of the JAAM, the most prestigious professional organization in Japanese emergency medicine, conducted the survey by sending questionnaires to 499 accredited emergency medicine training institutions. Results: Valid responses obtained from 299 facilities were analyzed. US model EM was provided in 211 facilities (71% of 299 facilities), either in full time (24 hours a day, seven days a week; 123 facilities) or in part time (less than 24 hours a day; 88 facilities). Among these 211 US model facilities, 44% have a number of beds between 251-500. The annual number of ED visits was less than 20,000 in 64%, and 37% have ambulance transfers between 2,001-4,000 per year. The number of emergency physicians was less than 5 in 60% of the facilities. Postgraduate general clinical training was offered at US model ED in 199 facilities, and ninety hospitals adopted US model EM after 2004, when a 2-year period of postgraduate general clinical training became mandatory for all medical graduates. Sixty-four facilities provided a residency program to be a US model emergency physician, and another 9 institutions were planning to establish it.

Occupational injuries are preventable but they can occasionally cause morbidity and mortality resulting in work day loss and financial problems. Hand injuries are one-third of all traumatic injuries and are the most injured parts after occupational accidents. Objectives: We aim to evaluate patients with occupational upper extremity injuries for demographic characteristics, injury types, and work day loss. Methods: Trauma patients over 15 years old admitted to our emergency department with an occupational upper extremity injury were prospectively evaluated from 15.04.2010 to 30.04.2011. Patients with one or more of digit, hand, forearm, elbow, humerus, and shoulder injuries were included. Exclusion criteria were multitrauma, patient refusal to participate, and insufficient data. Patients were followed up from the hospital information system and by phone for work day loss and final diagnosis. Results: During the study period there were 570 patients with an occupational upper extremity injury. Total of 521 (91.4%) patients were included. Patients were 92.1% male, 36.5% between the age 25 to 34, and mean age was calculated 32.9 \u00b1 9.6 years. 43.8% of the patients were from the metal and machinery sector, and primary education was the highest education level for the 74.7% of the patients. Most injured parts were fingers with the highest rate for index finger and thumb. Crush injury was the most common injury type. 96.3% (n = 502) of the patients were discharged after treatment in the emergency department.",

Survey respondents stated their amount of exposure to previously published core curriculum components: EM System Development, Humanitarian Assistance, Disaster Response, and Public Health. A pooled analysis comparing overall responses of fellows to those of program directors was performed using two-sampled t-test. Results: Response rates were 88% (n = 30) for program directors and 53% (n = 17) for current and recent fellows. Programs varied significantly in terms of their emphasis on and exposure to six proposed core curriculum areas: EM System Development, EM Education Development, Humanitarian Aid, Public Health, EMS, and Disaster Management. Only 43% of programs reported having exposure to all four core areas. As many as 67% of fellows reported knowing their curriculum only somewhat or not at all prior to starting the program. Conclusion: Many fellows enter IEM and GH fellowships without a clear sense of what they will get from their training. As each fellowship program has different areas of curriculum emphasis, we propose not to enforce any single core curriculum. Rather, we suggest the development of a mechanism to allow each fellowship program to present its curriculum in a more transparent manner. This will allow prospective applicants to have a better understanding of the various programs' curricula and areas of emphasis. Background: Advance warning of probable intensive care unit (ICU) admissions could allow the bed placement process to start earlier, decreasing ED length of stay and relieving overcrowding conditions. However, physicians and nurses poorly predict a patient's ultimate disposition from the emergency department at triage. A computerized algorithm can use commonly collected data at triage to accurately identify those who likely will need ICU admission.",

Triage data includes age, sex, acuity (emergency severity index), blood pressure, heart rate, pain scale, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and a nurse's free text assessment. A Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm was used to cluster words in triage nurses' free text assessments into 500 topics.

Only Emergency Severity Index Level 3 patients were evaluated. The DD team was scheduled weekdays from 14:00 until 23:00. Several ED beds were allocated to this team. The team was comprised of one attending physician and either one nurse and a tech or two nurses. Comparisons were made between LOS for discharged patients originally triaged to the main ED side who were seen by the DD team versus the main side teams. Time from triage physician to team physician, team physician to discharge decision time, and patient age were compared by unpaired t-test. Differences were studied for number of patients receiving x-rays, CT scan, labs, and medications. Results: DD team mean LOS in hours for discharged patients was shorter at 3.4 (95% CI: 3.3-3.6, n = 1451) compared to 6.4 (95% CI: 6.3-6.5, n = 4601) on the main side, p < 0.01. The mean time from triage physician to DD team physician was 1.4 hours (95% CI: 1.4-1.5, n = 1447) versus to 2.7 hours (95% CI: 2.7-2.8, n = 4568) to main side physician, p < 0.01. The DD team physician mean time to discharge decision was 1.0 hour (95% CI: 1.0-1.1, n = 1432) compared to 2.5 hours (95% CI: 2.4-2.6, n = 4590) for main side physician, p < 0.01. The DD team patients' mean age was 42.6 years (95% CI: 41.9-43.6, n = 1454) compared to main side patients' mean age of 49.1 years (95% CI: 48.5-49.6, n = 4621.) The DD team patients (n = 1454) received fewer x-rays (40% vs. 59%), CT scans (13% vs. 23%), labs (64% vs. 85%), and medications (63% vs. 68%) than main side patients (n = 4621), p < 0.01 for all compared. Conclusion: The DD team complements the advanced triage process to further reduce LOS for patients who do not require extended ED treatment or observation. The DD team was able to work more efficiently because its patients tended to be younger and had fewer lab and imaging tests ordered by the triage physician compared to patients who were later seen on the ED main side.",

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from an academic medical center with an adult ED with 55,000 annual patient visits. All patients admitted into the hospital through the ED 6/30/2008-2/28/2011 were included. Development of HAPU was determined using the standardized, national protocol for CMS reporting of HAPU. ED boarding time was defined as the time between an order for inpatient admission and transport of the patient out of the ED to an in-patient unit. We used a multivariate logistic regression model with development of a HAPU as the outcome variable, ED boarding time as the exposure variable, and the following variables as covariates: age, sex, initial Braden score, and admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) from the ED. The Braden score is a scale used to determine a patient's risk for developing a HAPU based on known risk factors. A Braden score is calculated for each hospitalized patient at the time of admission. We included Braden score as a covariate in our model to determine if ED boarding time was a predictor of HAPU independent of Braden Score. Results: Of 46,704 patients admitted to the hospital through the ED during the study period, 243 developed a HAPU during their hospitalization. Clinical characteristics are presented in the table. Per hour of ED boarding time, the adjusted OR of developing a HAPU was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.04, p = 0.007). A median of 40 patients per day were admitted through the ED, accumulating 144 hours of ED boarding time per day, with each hour of boarding time increasing the risk of developing a HAPU by 2%. Conclusion: In this single-center, retrospective study, longer ED boarding time was associated with increased risk of developing a HAPU.",

Methods: A survey was administered to a convenience sample of ED and ward nurses. It was performed in a 631-bed academic medical center (30,000 admissions/yr) with a 68-bed ED (60,000 visits/yr). Nurses were identified as ED or ward and whether they had previously worked in the ED. The nurses were asked if there were any circumstances where admitted patients should be boarded in the ED or inpatient hallways. They were also asked their preferred location if they were admitted as a patient. Six clinical scenarios were then presented and their opinions on boarding queried. Results: Ninety nurses completed the survey; 35 (39%) were current ED nurses (cED), 40 (44%) had previously worked in the ED (pED). For the entire group 46 (52%) believed admitted patients should board in the ED. Overall, 52 (58%) were opposed to inpatient boarding, with 20% of cED versus 83% of current ward (cW) nurses (P < 0.0001) and 28% of pED versus 85% of nurses never having worked in the ED (nED) opposed (P < 0.001). If admitted as patients themselves, overall 43 (54%) preferred inpatient boarding, with 82% of cED versus 33% of cW nurses (P < 0.0001) and 74% of pED versus 34% nED nurses (P = 0.0007) preferring inpatient boarding. For the six clinical scenarios, significant differences in opinion regarding inpatient boarding existed in all but two cases: a patient with stable COPD but requiring oxygen and an intubated, unstable sepsis patient. Conclusion: Ward nurses and those who have never worked in the ED are more opposed to inpatient boarding than ED nurses and nurses who have worked previously in the ED. Nurses admitted as patients seemed to prefer not being boarded where they work. ED and ward nurses seemed to agree that unstable or potentially unstable patients should remain in the ED. 8 weeks. Staff satisfaction was evaluated through pre/ post-shift and study surveys; administrative data (physician initial assessment (PIA), length of stay (LOS), patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) and against medical advice [LAMA] ) were collected from an electronic, real-time ED information system. Data are presented as proportions and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR); bivariable analyses were performed. Results: ED physicians and nurses expected the intervention to reduce the LOS of discharged patients only. PIA decreased during the intervention period (68 vs 74 minutes; p < 0.001). No statistically/clinically significant differences were observed in the LOS; however, there was a significant reduction in the LWBS (4.7% to 3.5% p = 0.003) and LAMA (0.7% to 0.4% p = 0.028) rates. While there was a reduction of approximately 5 patients seen per physician in the affected ED area, the total number of patients seen on that unit increased by approximately 10 patients/day. Overall, compared to days when there was no extra shift, 61% of emergency physicians stated their workload decreased and 73% felt their stress level at work decreased. Conclusion: While this study didn't demonstrate a reduction in the overall LOS, it did reduce PIA times and the proportion of LWBS/LAMA patients. While physicians saw fewer patients during the intervention study period, the overall patient volume increased and satisfaction among ED physicians was rated higher.",

Across all hospitals, there was great variation in individual physician admission rates (15.4%-50.0%). The 72H-RA rates were quite low, but demonstrated a similar magnitude of individual variation (0.3%-1.2%). Physicians with the highest admission rate quintile had lower odds of 72H-RA (OR 0.8 95% CI 0.7-0.9) compared to the lowest admission rate quintile, after adjusting for other factors. No intermediate admission rate quintiles (2nd, 3rd, or 4th) were significantly different from the lowest admission rate quintile with regard to 72H-RA. Conclusion: There is more than three-fold variation in individual physician admission rates indicating great variation among physicians in hospital admission rates and 72H-RA. The highest admitters have the lowest 72H-RA; however, evaluating the causes and consequences of such significant variation needs further exploration, particularly in the context of health reform efforts aimed at reducing costs.

Outcome measures included admission to hospital and ED length of stay (LOS); 72-hr return to ED (RR) was used as a balancing measure. Scorecards were constructed using box plots to show physicians their practice patterns relative to peers (the figure shows an example of the scorecard for gatroenteritis for one physician, showing resources use rates for IV fluids and labs). Blinded scorecards were distributed quarterly for five quarters using rolling-year averages. A pre/post-intervention analysis was performed with Sep 1, 2010 as the intervention date. Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for analysis. Results: We analyzed 45,872 patient visits across two hospitals (24,834 pre-and 21,038 post-intervention), comprising 17.6% of the total ED volume during the study period.

The results from each ED were statistically significant for both average wait time and average wait time error (p < 0.0001). There was a positive correlation between the average wait time and average wait time error, with R-values of 0.84, 0.83, 0.58, and 0.48 for the main ED, FED #1, FED #2, and the small community hospital ED, respectively. Each correlation was statistically significant; however, no correlation was found between the number of beds available (budgeted-actual census) and average wait times. Conclusion: Publically posted ED wait times are accurate for facilities with less than 2000 ED visits per month. They are not accurate for EDs with greater than 4000 visits per month.",

The number of ''near-misses'' or mismatched specimens captured by each clerk was then blinded to all patient identifiers and was collated by monthly intervals. Due to poor performance in 2009, an incentive program was introduced in early 2010 by which the clerk who captured the most mismatched specimens would be awarded a $50 gift card on a quarterly basis.

Reitsema University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM Background: ED interruptions occur frequently. Recently a hands-free communication device (Vocera) was added to a cell phone and a pager in our ED. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this addition improved interruption times. Our hypothesis was that the device would significantly decrease length of time of interruptions. Methods: This study was a prospective cohort study of attending ED physician calls and interruptions in a Level I trauma center with EM residency. Interruptions included phone calls, EKG interpretations, pages to resuscitation, and other miscellaneous interruptions (including nursing issues, laboratory, EMS, and radiology). We studied a convenience sampling intended to include mostly evening shifts, the busiest ED times. Length of time the interruption lasted was recorded. Data were collected for a comparison group pre-Vocera. Three investigators collected data including seven different addendings' interruptions. Data were collected on a form, then entered into an Excel file. Data collectors' agreement was determined during two additional four hour shifts to calculate a kappa statistic. SPSS was used for data entry and statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for univariate data. Chi-square and Mann Whitney U nonparametric test were used for comparisons. Results: Of the total 511 interruptions, 33% were phone calls, 24% were EKGs to be read, 18% were pages to resuscitation, and 25% miscellaneous. There were no significant differences in types of interruptions pre-vs. post-Vocera. Pre-Vocera we collected 40 hours of data with 65 interruptions with a mean 1.6 per hour. Post-Vocera, 180 hours of data were collected with 446 interruptions with a mean 2.5 per hour. There was a significant difference in length of time of interruptions with an average of 9 minutes pre-Vocera vs. 4 minutes post-Vocera (p = 0.012, diff 4.9, 95% CI 1.8-8.1). Vocera calls were significantly shorter than non-Vocera calls (1 vs 6 minutes, p < 0.001). Comparing data collectors for type of interruption during the same 4-hour shift resulted in a kappa (agreement) of 0.73. Conclusion: The addition of a hands-free communication device may improve interruptions by shortening call length.",

However, little is known about how much interaction a patient has with clinicians after being placed in a room, or what proportion of the in-room visit is also spent ''waiting,'' rather than directly interacting with care providers. Objectives: The objective was to assess the proportion of time, relative to the time in a patient care area, that a patient spends actively interacting with providers during an ED visit. Methods: A secondary analysis of 29 audiotaped encounters of patients with one of four diagnoses (ankle sprain, back pain, head injury, laceration) was performed. The setting was an urban, academic ED. ED visits of adult patients were recorded from the time of room placement to discharge. Audiotapes were edited to remove all downtime and non-patient-provider conversations. LOS and door-to-doctor times were abstracted from the medical record. The proportion of time the patient spent in direct conversation with providers (''talk-time'') was calculated as the ratio of the edited audio recording time to the time spent in a patient care area (talk-time = [edited audio time/(LOS -door-to-doctor)]). Multiple linear regression controlling for time spent in patient care area, age, and sex was performed.",

There were no significant differences based on diagnosis. Regression analysis showed that those spending a longer time in a patient care area had a lower percentage of talk time (b = )0.11, p = 0.002). Conclusion: Although limited by sample size, these results indicate that approximately 80% of a patients' time in a care area is spent not interacting with providers. While some of the time spent waiting is out of the providers' control (e.g. awaiting imaging studies), this significant ''downtime'' represents an opportunity for both process improvement efforts to decrease downtime as well as the development of innovative patient education efforts to make the best use of the remaining downtime.",

The differences between observed times and timestamps were computed and found to be normally distributed. Post-implementation, mean physician seen times along with arrival to bed, bed to physician, and physician to disposition intervals occurred before observation. Physician seen timestamps were frequently incorrect and did not improve postimplementation. Significant discrepancies (ten minutes or greater) from observed values were identified in timestamps involving disposition decision and exit from the ED. Calculating service time intervals resulted in every service interval (except arrival to bed) having at least 15% of the times with significant discrepancies. It is notable that missing values were more frequent post-EHR implementation. Conclusion: EHR implementation results in reduced variability of timestamps but reduced accuracy and an increase in missing timestamps. Using electronic timestamps for operational efficiency assessment should recognize the magnitude of error, and the compounding of error, when computing service times. Background: Procedural sedation and analgesia is used in the ED in order to efficiently and humanely perform necessary painful procedures. The opposing physiological effects of ketamine and propofol suggest the potential for synergy, and this has led to interest in their combined use, commonly termed ''ketofol'', to facilitate ED procedural sedation. Objectives: To determine if a 1:1 mixture of ketamine and propofol (ketofol) for ED procedural sedation results in a 13% or more absolute reduction in adverse respiratory events compared to propofol alone. Methods: Participants were randomized to receive either ketofol or propofol in a double-blind fashion according to a weight-based dosing protocol. Inclusion criteria were age 14 years or greater, and ASA Class 1-3 status. The primary outcome was the number and proportion of patients experiencing an adverse respiratory event according to pre-defined criteria (the ''Quebec Criteria'').

Thirty-eight (27%) patients receiving ketofol and 36 (25%) receiving propofol developed hypoxia, of whom three (2%) ketofol patients and 1 (1%) propofol patient received bag-valve-mask ventilation. Sixty-five (46%) patients receiving ketofol and 93 (65%) receiving propofol required repeat medication dosing or lightened to a Ramsay Sedation Score of 4 or less during their procedure (difference 19%; 95% CI 8% to 31%; p = 0.001). Procedural agitation occurred in 5 patients (3.5%) receiving ketofol compared to 15 (11%) receiving propofol (difference 7.5%, 95% CI 1% to 14%). Recovery agitation requiring treatment occurred in six patients (4%, 95% CI 2.0% to 8.9%) receiving ketofol. Other secondary outcomes were similar between the groups. Patients and staff were highly satisfied with both agents. Conclusion: Ketofol for ED procedural sedation does not result in a reduced incidence of adverse respiratory events compared to propofol alone. Induction time, efficacy, and sedation time were similar; however, sedation depth appeared to be more consistent with ketofol. with propofol and its safety is well established. However, in 2010 CMS enacted guidelines defining propofol as deep sedation and requiring administration by a physician. Common EDPS practice had been one physician performing both the sedation and procedure. EDPS has proven safe under this one-physician practice. However, the 2010 guidelines mandated separate physicians perform each. Objectives: The study hypothesis was that one-physician propofol sedation complication rates are similar to two-physician. Methods: Before and after, observational study of patients >17 years of age consenting to EDPS with propofol. EDPS completed with one physician were compared to those completed with two (separate physicians performing the sedation and the procedure). All data were prospectively collected. The study was completed at an urban Level I trauma center. Standard monitoring and procedures for EDPS were followed with physicians blinded to the objectives of this research. The frequency and incremental dosing of medication was left to the discretion of the treating physicians. The study protocol required an ED nurse trained in data collection to be present to record vital signs and assess for any prospectively defined complications.

Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and OAA/S were monitored and recorded every 15 minutes and at the time of occurrence of any CRD. Respiratory rate and ETCO 2 were measured at five second intervals using a Capno-Stream20 monitor. CRD included an increase in supplemental oxygen, the use of bag-valve-mask ventilations, repositioning to improve ventilation, and physical or verbal stimulus to induce respiration, and were performed at the discretion of the treating physicians and nurses.

Results: 100 patients were enrolled in the study (age 35, range 18 to 67, 62% male, median OAAS 4, range 1 to 5).

            "text": "Results: The database recorded 2710 intubations (capture rate 98%) and 1670 met the inclusion criteria. RSI was the initial method chosen in 489 (29%) and non-RSI in 1181 (71%). Use of RSI varied among institutes from 0% to 79%. Success cases of RSI on first and within three attempts are 353 intubations (72%, 95%CI 68%-76%) and 474 intubations (97%, 95%CI 95%-98%), respectively. The success cases of non-RSI on first and within three attempts are 724 intubations (61%, 95%CI 58%-64%) and 1105 intubations (94%, 95%CI 92%-95%). Success rates of RSI on first and within three attempts are higher than non-RSI (OR 1.64, 95%CI 1.30-2.06 and OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.22-3.77, respectively). We recorded 67 complications in RSI (14%) and 165 in non-RSI (14%). There is no significant difference of complication rate between RSI and non-RSI (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.72-1.32). Conclusion: In this multi-center prospective study in Japan, we demonstrated a high degree of variation in use of RSI for ED intubation. Additionally we found that success rate of RSI on first and within three attempts were both higher than non-RSI. This study has the limitation of reporting bias and confounding by indication. (Originally submitted as a ''late-breaker.'') Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, singleblind study conducted in the ED setting from June 2010 until the present time. This study took place at an academic adult ED of a 405-bed (21 in the ED) and a Level I trauma center. Subjects were randomized to receive either ketamine-propofol or propofol according to a standardized protocol. ETCO 2 waveforms were digitally recorded. ETCO 2 changes were evaluated by the sedating physicians at the bedside. Recorded waveforms were reviewed by an independent physician and a trained research assistant (RA). To ensure the reliability of trained RAs, we computed a kappa test for agreement between the analysis of independent physicians and RAs for the first 41 recordings. A post-hoc analysis of the association between any loss, the number of losses, and total duration of loss of ETCO 2 waveform and CRP was performed. On review we recorded the absence or presence of loss of ETCO 2 and the total duration in seconds of all lost ETCO 2 episodes \u202115 seconds. ORs were calculated using SAS statistical software. Results: 91 patients were enrolled; 53 (58.2%) are males and 38 are (41.8%) females. 86.3% participants were ASA class 1 or 2. Waveforms were reviewed by 87 (95.6%) sedating physicians. There were 70 (76.9%) waveforms recordings, 42 (60.0%) were reviewed by an independent physician and 70 (100%) were reviewed by RAs, where there were no discordant pairs (kappa = 1). There were 24 (26.4%) CRP events. Any loss of ETCO 2 was associated with a non-significant OR of 4.06 (95% CI 0.75-21.9) for CRP. However, the duration of ETCO 2 loss was significantly associated with CRP with an OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.08-1.76) for each 30 second interval of lost ETCO 2 . The number of losses was significantly associated with the outcome (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.91). Conclusion: Defining subclinical respiratory depression as present or absent may be less useful than quantitative measurements. This suggests that risk is cumulative over periods of loss of ETCO 2 , and the duration of loss may be a better marker of sedation depth and risk of complications than classification of any loss. Background: ED visits present an opportunity to deliver brief interventions (BIs) to reduce violence and alcohol misuse among urban adolescents at risk for future injury. Previous analyses demonstrated that a brief intervention resulted in reductions in violence and alcohol consequences up to 6 months.",

Prior studies, in nonhealth care settings, have shown associations between violent injury and risk factors including exposure to community violence, peer behavior, and delinquency. Objectives: To assess whether self-reported exposure to violence risk factors can be used to predict future ED visits for injuries. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study in the ED of a Southeastern US Level I trauma center. Patients aged 15-24 presenting for any chief complaint were included unless they were critically ill, incarcerated, or could not read English. Recruitment took place over six months, by a trained research assistant (RA). The RA was present in the ED for 3-5 days per week, with shifts scheduled such that they included weekends and weekdays, over the hours from 8 am-8 pm. Patients were offered a $5 gift card for participation. At the time of initial contact in the ED, patients completed a written questionnaire which included validated measures of the following risk factors: a) aggression, b) perceived likelihood of violence, c) recent violent behavior, d) peer behavior, e) community exposure to violence, and f) positive future outlook. At 12 months following the initial ED visit, the participants' medical records were reviewed to identify any subsequent ED visits for injury-related complaints. Data were analyzed with chi-square and logistic regression analyses. Results: 332 patients were approached, of whom 300 patients consented. Participants' average age was 21.1 years, with 57% female, and 86% African American. Return visits for injuries were significantly associated with hostile/aggressive feelings (RR 3.7, CI 1.42, 9) , self-reported perceived likelihood of violence (RR 5.16, CI 1.93, 13.78) , recent violent behavior (RR 3.16, CI 1.01, 9.88) , and peer group violence (RR 4.4, CI 1.72, 11.25) .

These findings identify a potentially important tool for primary prevention of violent injuries among young adults visiting the ED for both injury and non-injury complaints. Background: Sepsis is a commonly encountered disease in ED, with high mortality. While several clinical prediction rules (CPR) including MEDS, SIRS, and CURB-65 exist to facilitate clinicians in early recognition of risk of mortality for sepsis, most are of suboptimal performance. Objectives: To derive a novel CPR for mortality of sepsis utilizing clinically available and objective predictors in ED. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all adult septic patients who visited the ED at a tertiary hospital during the year 2010 with two sets of blood cultures ordered by physicians. Basic demographics, ED vital signs, symptoms and signs, underlying illnesses, laboratory findings, microbiological results, and discharge status were collected. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to obtain a novel CPR using predictors with <0.1 p-value tested in univariate analyses. The existing CPRs were compared with this novel CPR using AUC. Results: Of 8699 included patients, 7.6% died in hospital, 51% had diabetes, 49% were older than 65 years of age, 21% had malignancy, and 16% had positive blood bacterial culture tests. Predisposing factors including history of malignancy, liver disease, immunosuppressed status, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and older than 65 years of age were found to be associated with mortality (all p < 0.05). Patients who developed mortality tended to have lower body temperature, narrower pulse pressure, higher percentage of red cell distribution width (RDW) and bandemia, higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ammonia, and C-reactive protein level, and longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (all p < 0.05). The most parsimonious CPR incorporating history of malignancy (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.7), prolonged aPTT (3.0, 2.4-3.8), presence of bandemia (1.7, 1.4-2.0 Results: There was poor agreement between the physician's unstructured assessment used in clinical practice and the guidelines put forth by the AHA/ACC/ACEP task force. ED physicians were more likely to assess a patient as low risk (42%), while AHA guidelines were more likely to classify patients as intermediate (50%) or high (40%) risk. However, when comparing the patient's final ACS diagnosis and the relation to the risk assessment value, ED physicians proved better predictors of high-risk patients who in fact had ACS, while the AHA/ACC/ACEP guidelines proved better at correctly identifying low-risk patients who did not have ACS. Conclusion: In the ED, physicians are far more efficient at correctly placing patients with underlying ACS into a high-risk category, while established criteria may be overly conservative when applied to an acute care population. Further research is indicated to look at ED physicians' risk stratification and ensuing patient care to assess for appropriate decision making and ultimate outcomes.",

There is no significant advantage in using the AMUSE over the Wells score in ED patient with suspected DVT. Background: The direct cost of medical care is not accurately reflected in charges or reimbursement. The cost of boarding admitted patients in the ED has been studied in terms of opportunity costs, which are indirect. The actual direct effect on hospital expenses has not been well defined. Objectives: We calculate the difference to the hospital in the cost of caring for an admitted patient in the ED and in a non-critical care in-patient unit. Methods: Time-directed activity-based costing (TDABC) has recently been proposed as a method of determining the actual cost of providing medical services. TDABC was used to calculate the cost per patient bed-hour both in the ED and for an in-patient unit. The costs include nursing, nursing assistants, clerks, attending and resident physicians, supervisory salaries, and equipment maintenance. Boarding hours were determined from placement of admission order to transfer to in-patient unit. A convenience sample of 100 consecutive non-critical care admissions was assessed to find the degree of ED physician involvement with boarded patients. Results: The overhead cost per patient bed-hour in the ED was $60.80. The equivalent cost per bed-hour inpatient was $23.39, a differential of $37.41. There were 27,618 boarding hours for medical-surgical patients in 2010, a differential of $1,033,189.38 for the year. For the short-stay unit (no residents), the cost per patient hour was $11.36 and the boarding hours were 11,804. This resulted in a differential cost of $583,389.76, a total direct cost to the hospital of $1,616,579.14. Review of 100 consecutive admissions showed no orders placed by the ED physician after decision-toadmit. Conclusion: Concentration of resources in the ED means considerably higher cost per unit of care as compared to an in-patient unit. Keeping admitted patients boarding in the ED results in expensive underutilization. This is exclusive of significant opportunity costs of lost revenue from walk-out and diverted patients. This study includes the cost of teaching attendings and residents (ED and in-patient) . In a non-teaching setting, the differential would be less and the cost of boarding would be shared by a fee-for-service ED physician group as well as the hospital.",

Frequent ED users accounted for 1% of patients, but for 6% of visits, averaging 9.74 visits per year, versus 1.55 visits per year for all other patients. 28.5% of frequent users visited two or more EDs during the study period, compared to 10.6% of all other patients. Conclusion: Frequent ED users commonly visited multiple NYCLIX EDs during the study period. The use of a HIE helped identify many additional frequent users, though the benefits were lower for hospitals not located in the relative vicinity of another NYCLIX hospital. Measures that take a community, rather than a single institution, into account may be more reflective of the care that the patient experiences.",

Differences in burn depth were created by using a 2.5 \u00b7 2.5 cm aluminum bar at three exposure times and temperatures: 70 degrees C for 30 seconds, 80 degrees C for 20 seconds, and 80 degrees C for 30 seconds. We have shown in prior validation experiments that these burn temperatures and times create distinct burn depths. LAICGA scanning, using Lifecell SPY Elite, took place at 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 1 week post burn. Imaging was read by a blinded investigator, and perfusion trends were compared with day 28 post-burn contraction outcomes measured using ImageJ software. Biopsies were taken on day 28 to measure scar tissue depth. Results: Deep burns were characterized by a blue center indicating poor perfusion while more superficial burns were characterized by a yellow-red center indicating perfusion that was close to that of the normal uninjured adjacent skin (see figure) . A linear relationship between contraction outcome and burn perfusion could be discerned as early as 1 hour post burn, peaking in strength at 24-48 hours post-burn. Burn intensity could be effectively identified at 24 hours post-burn, although there was no relationship with scar tissue depth. Conclusion: Pilot data indicate that LAICGA using Lifecell SPY has the ability to determine the depth of injury and predict the degree of contraction of deep dermal burns within 1-2 days of injury with greater accuracy than clinical scoring.",

With ED and inpatient sepsis alerts combined, the severe sepsis subgroup mortality was reduced from 17% to 9% (p = 0.013; n = 622). Conclusion: Real-time ED EHR screening for severe sepsis and septic shock patients did not improve mortality. A positive trend in the severe sepsis subgroup was noted, and the combined inpatient plus ED data suggests statistical significance may be reached as more patients enter the registry. Limitations: retrospective study, potential increased data capture post intervention, and no ''gold standard'' to test the sepsis alert sensitivity and specificity. ) . Descriptive statistics were calculated. Principal component analysis was used to determine questions with continuous response formats that could be aggregated. Aggregated outcomes were regressed onto predictor demographic variables using multiple linear regression. Results: 80/100 physicians completed the survey. Physicians had a mean of 9.8 \u00b1 9.0 years experience in the ED. 23.8% were female. Eight physicians (10%) reported never having used the tool, while 70.8% of users estimated having used it more than five times. 75% of users cited the ''P'' alert on the ETB as the most common notification method. Most felt the ''P'' alert did not help them identify patients with pneumonia earlier (mean = 2.5 \u00b1 1.2), but found it moderately useful in reminding them to use the tool (3.5 \u00b1 1.3). Physicians found the tool helpful in making decisions regarding triage, diagnostic studies, and antibiotic selection for outpatients and inpatients (3.7 \u00b1 1.0, 3.6 \u00b1 1.1, 3.6 \u00b1 1.1, and 4.2 \u00b1 0.9, respectively). They did not feel it negatively affected their ability to perform other tasks (1.6 \u00b1 0.9). Using multiple linear regression, neither age, sex, years experience, nor tool use frequency significantly predicted responses to questions about triage and antibiotic selection, technical difficulties, or diagnostic ordering. Conclusion: ED physicians perceived the tool to be helpful in managing patients with pneumonia without negatively affecting workflow. Perceptions appear consistent across demographic variables and experience. Objectives: We seek to examine whether use of the SALT device can provide reliable tracheal intubation during ongoing CPR. The dynamic model tested the device with human powered CPR (manual) and with an automated chest compression device (Physio Control Lucas 2). The hypothesis is that the predictable movement of an automated chest compression device will make tracheal intubation easier than the random movement from manual CPR. Methods: The project was an experimental controlled trial and took place in the ED at a tertiary referral center in Peoria, Illinois. This project was an expansion arm of a similarly structured study using traditional laryngoscopy. Emergency medicine residents, attending physicians, paramedics, and other ACLS-trained staff were eligible for participation. In randomized order, each participant attempted intubation on a mannequin using the SALT device with no CPR ongoing, during CPR with a manual compression, and during CPR with an automatic chest compression.

Our secondary endpoints were to determine inter-and intra-subject variation in aortic velocity measurements. Methods: The authors performed a prospective randomized double-blinded trial using healthy volunteers. We measured the velocity time integral (VTI) and maximal velocity (Vmax) with an estimated 0-20\u00b0pulsed wave Doppler interrogation of the left ventricular outflow in the apical-5 cardiac window. Three physicians reviewed optimal sampling gate position, Doppler angle and verified the presence of an aortic closure spike. Angle correction technology was not used. Subjects with no history of cardiac disease or hypertension fasted for 12 hours and were then randomly assigned to receive a normal saline bolus of 2 ml/kg, 10 ml/kg or 30 ml/kg over 30 minutes.

Patients with a history of diabetes tended to be older, female, and more likely to have chronic kidney disease, lower sepsis severity (MEDS score), and positive blood culture test results (all p < 0.05).

Methods: This IRB-approved retrospective chart review included all patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest during 2010 at an urban, academic teaching hospital. Every patient undergoing therapeutic hypothermia is treated by neurocritical care specialists. Patients were identified by review of neurocritical care consultation logs. Clinical data were dually abstracted by trained clinical study assistants using a standardized data dictionary and case report form. Medications reviewed during hypothermia were midazolam, lorazepam, propofol, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and vecuronium. Results: There were 33 patients in the cohort. Median age was 57 (range 28-86 years), 67% were white, 55% were male, and 49% had a history of coronary artery disease. Seizures were documented by continuous EEG in 11/33 (33%), and 20/33 (61%) died during hospitalization. Most, 30/33 (91%), received fentanyl, 21/33 (64%) received benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy, and 23/33 (70%) received propofol.

Conclusion: Sedation and neuromuscular blockade are common during management of patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Patients in this cohort often received analgesia with fentanyl, and sedation with a benzodiazepine or propofol. Given the frequent use of sedatives and paralytics in survivors of cardiac arrest undergoing hypothermia, future studies should investigate the potential effect of these drugs on prognostication and survival after cardiac arrest.",

Objectives: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent post cardiac arrest TH at eight different institutions across the United States. Our objective was to assess how TH is currently being implemented in emergency departments and assess the feasibility of conducting more extensive TH research using multi-institution retrospective data. Methods: A total of 94 charts with dates from 2008-2011 were sent for review by participating institutions of the Peri-Resuscitation Consortium. Of those reviewed, eight charts were excluded for missing data. Two independent reviewers performed the review and the results were subsequently compared and discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. We assessed patient demographics, initial presenting rhythm, time until TH initiation, duration of TH, cooling methods and temperature reached, survival to hospital discharge, and neurological status on discharge. Results: The majority of cases of TH had initial cardiac rhythms of asystole or pulseless electrical activity (55.2%), followed by ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (34.5%), and in 10.3% the inciting cardiac rhythm was unknown. Time to initiation of TH ranged from 0-783 minutes with a mean time of 99 min (SD 132.5). Length of TH ranged from 25-2171 minutes with a mean time of 1191 minutes (SD 536). Average minimum temperature achieved was 32.5\u00b0C, with a range from 27.6-36.7\u00b0C (SD 1.5\u00b0C). Of the charts reviewed, 29 (33.3%) of the patients survived to hospital discharge and 19 (21.8%) were discharged relatively neurologically intact. Conclusion: Research surrounding cardiac arrest has always been difficult given the time and location span from pre-hospital care to emergency department to intensive care unit. Also, as witnessed cardiac arrest events are relatively rare with poor survival outcomes, very large sample sizes are needed to make any meaningful conclusions about TH. Our varied and inconsistent results show that a multi-center retrospective review is also unlikely to provide useful information. A prospective multi-center trial with a uniform TH protocol is needed if we are ever to make any evidence-based conclusions on the utility of TH for post-cardiac arrest patients.",

A statistically significant positive correlation was found between LA and pulse, respiratory rate (RR), WBC, platelets, and LOS, while a significant negative correlation was seen with temperature and HCO 3 -. When two subjects were dropped as possible outliers with LA >10, it resulted in non-significant temperature correlation, but a significant negative correlation with age and BUN was revealed. Patients in the higher LA group were more likely to be admitted (p = 0.0001) and have longer LOS. Of the discharged patients, there was no difference in mean LA level between those who returned (n = 25, mean LA of 1.88, SD = 0.88) and those who did not (n = 154, mean LA of 1.88, SD = 1.35), p = 0.99.

Background: Mandibular fractures are one of the most frequently seen injuries in the trauma setting. In terms of facial trauma, madibular fractures account for 40-62% of all facial bone fractures. Prior studies have demonstrated that the use of a tongue blade to screen these patients to determine whether a mandibular fracture is present may be as sensitive as x-ray. One study showed the sensitivity and specificity of the test to be 95.7% and 63.5%, respectively. In the last ten years, high-resolution computed tomography (HCT) has replaced panoramic tomography (PT) as the gold standard for imaging of patients with suspected mandibular fractures. This study determines if the tongue blade test (TBT) remains as sensitive a screening tool when compared to the new gold standard of CT. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the TBT as compared to the new gold standard of radiologic imaging, HCT. The question being asked: is the TBT still useful as a screening tool for patients with suspected mandibular fractures when compared to the new gold standard of HCT? Methods: Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: An urban tertiary care Level I trauma center. Subjects: This study took place from 8/1/10 to 8/31/11 in which any person suffering from facial trauma presented. Intervention: A TBT was performed by the resident physician and confirmed by the supervising attending physician. CT facial bones were then obtained for the ultimate diagnosis. Inter-rater reliability (kappa) was calculated, along with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, NPV, likelihood ratio (LR) (+), and likelihood ratio (LR) (-) based on a 2 \u00b7 2 contingency tables generated. Results: Over the study period 85 patients were enrolled. Inter-rater reliability was kappa = 0.93 (SE +0.11). The table demonstrates the outcomes of both the TBT and CT facial bones for mandibular fracture. The following parameters were then calculated based on the contingency table: sensitivity 0.97 (CI 0.81-0.99), specificity 0.72 (CI 0.58-0.83), PPV 0.67 (CI 0.52-0.78), NPV 0.97 (CI 0.87-0.99), accuracy 0.81, LR(+) 3.48 ), LR (-) 0.04 (CI 0.01-0.31). Conclusion: The TBT is still a useful screening tool to rule out mandibular fractures in patients with facial trauma as compared to the current gold standard of HCT. Background: Appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency occurring in children. The diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis is often difficult and computerized tomography (CT) scanning is utilized frequently. CT, although accurate, is expensive, time-consuming, and exposes children to ionizing radiation. Radiologists utilize ultrasound for the diagnosis of appendicitis, but it may be less accurate than CT, and may not incorporate emergency physician (EP) clinical impression regarding degree of risk.",

This is the first study proposing to set normal and abnormal limits. Methods: Subjects were enrolled in this prospective observation study if they had a chief complaint of shoulder pain or injury, and received a shoulder ultrasound as well as a shoulder x-ray. The sonographers were undergraduate students given ten hours of training to perform the shoulder ultrasound. They were blinded to the x-ray interpretation, which was used as the gold standard. We used a posterior-lateral approach, capturing an image with the glenoid rim, the humeral head, as well as the infraspinatus muscle. Two parallel lines were applied to the most posterior aspect of the humeral head and the most posterior aspect of the glenoid rim. A line perpendicular to these lines was applied, and the distance measured. In anterior dislocations, a negative measurement was used to denote the fact that the glenoid rim is now posterior to the most posterior aspect of the humeral head. Descriptive analysis was applied to estimate the mean and 25th to 75th interquartile range of normal and anteriorly dislocated shoulders.",

            "text": "Results: Eighty subjects were enrolled in this study. There were six shoulder dislocations, however only four were anterior dislocations. The average distance between the posterior glenoid rim and the posterior humeral head in normal shoulders was 8.7 mm, with a 25th to 75th inter-quartile range of 6.7 mm to 11.9 mm. The distance in our four cases of anterior dislocation was )11 mm, with a 25th to 75th interquartile range of )10 mm to )12 mm. Conclusion: The distance between the posterior humeral head to posterior glenoid rim may be 7 mm to 12 mm in patients presenting to the ED with shoulder pain but no dislocation. In contrast, this distance in anterior dislocations was greater than )10 mm. Shoulder ultrasound may be a useful adjunct to x-ray for diagnosing anterior shoulder dislocations. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, the presence of RV strain on FOCUS significantly increases the likelihood of an adverse short term event from pulmonary embolism and its combination with hypotension performs similarly to other prognostic rules. Background: Burns are expensive and debilitating injuries, compromising both the structural integrity and vascular supply to skin. They exhibit a substantial potential to deteriorate if left untreated. Jackson defined three ''zones'' to a burn. While the innermost coagulation zone and the outermost zone of hyperemia display generally predictable healing outcomes, the zone of stasis has been shown to be salvageable via clinical intervention. It has therefore been the focus of most acute therapies for burn injuries. While Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) -the current gold standard for burn analysis -has been 96% effective at predicting the need for second degree burn excision, its clinical translation is problematic, and there is little information regarding its ability to analyze the salvage of the stasis zone in acute injury. Laser Assisted Indocyanine Green Dye Angiography (LAICGA) also shows potential to predict such outcomes with greater clinical utility. Objectives: To test the ability of LDI and LAICGA to predict interspace (zone of stasis) survival in a horizontal burn comb model. Methods: A prospective animal experiment was performed using four pigs. Each pig had a set of six dorsal burns created using a brass ''comb'' -creating four rectangular 10 \u00b7 20 mm full thickness burns separated by 5 \u00b7 20 mm interspaces. LAICGA and LDI scanning took place at 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week post burn using Novadaq SPY and Moor LDI respectively. Imaging was read by a blinded investigator, and perfusion trends were compared with interspace viability and contraction. Burn outcomes were read clinically, evaluated via histopathology, and interspace contraction was measured using Image J software. Results: LAICGA data showed significant predictive potential for interspace survival. It was 83.3% predictive at 24 hours post burn, 75% predictive 48 hours post burn, and 100% predictive 7 days post burn using a standardized perfusion threshold. LDI imaging failed to predict outcome or contraction trends with any degree of reliability. The pattern of perfusion also appears to be correlated with the presence of significant interspace contraction at 28 days, with an 80% adherence to a power trendline. ventions, 11 Isolation, 4 Testing, 4 Treatment, and 1 ''Other'' category intervention were identified. One intervention involving school closures was associated with a 28% decrease in pediatric ED visits for respiratory illness. Conclusion: Most interventions were not tested in isolation, so the effect of individual interventions was difficult to differentiate. Interventions associated with statistically significant decreases in ED crowding were school closures, as well as interventions in all categories studied. Further study and standardization of intervention input, process, and outcome measures may assist in identifying the most effective methods of mitigating ED crowding and improving surge capacity during an influenza or other respiratory disease outbreak.",

We hypothesized that women who were experiencing severe IPV and/or were in contemplation or action stages would be more likely to endorse safety behaviors. Methods: We conducted the intervention for female IPV victims at three urban EDs using a computer kiosk to deliver targeted education about IPV and violence prevention as well as referrals to local resources. All adult English-speaking non-critically ill women triaged to the ED waiting room were eligible to participate. The validated Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol was used for IPV screening. Any who disclosed IPV further responded to validated questionnaires for alcohol and drug abuse, depression, and IPV severity. The women were assigned a baseline stage of change (precontemplation, contemplation, action, or maintenance) based on the URICA scale for readiness to change behavior surrounding IPV. Participants were contacted at 1 week and 3 months to assess a variety of pre-determined actions such as moving out, to prevent IPV during that period. Statistical analysis (chi-square testing) was performed to compare participant characteristics to the stage of change and whether or not they took protective action.",

The objective is to determine comparative injury prevention effectiveness of the newer CEW. Methods: Four humans had metal CEW probe pairs placed. Each volunteer had two probe pairs placed (one pair each on the right and left of the abdomen/inguinal region). Superior probes were at the costal margin, 5 inches lateral of midline. Inferior probes were vertically inferior at predetermined distances of 6, 9, 12, and 16 inches apart. Each volunteer was given the goal of slashing a target 10 feet away with a rubber knife during CEW exposure. As a means of motivation, they believed the exposure would continue until they reached the goal (in reality, the exposure was terminated once no further progress was made). Each volunteer received one exposure from a X26 and a X2 CEW. The exposure order was randomized with a 2-minute rest between them. Exposures were recorded on a hi-speed, hi-resolution video. Videos were reviewed and scored by six physician, kinesiology, and law officer experts using standardized criteria for effectiveness including degree of upper and lower extremity, and total body incapacitation, and degree of goal achievement. Reviews were descriptively compared independently for probe spread distances and between devices.",

            "text": "Objectives: The purpose of this analysis was to a) describe bicycle-related injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments between 1997 and 2009 and b) investigate the association between gas prices and both the incidence and severity of adult bicycle injuries. We hypothesized that as gas prices increase, adults are more likely to shift away from driving for utilitarian travel toward more economical non-motorized modes of transportation, resulting in increased risk exposure for bicycle injuries. Methods: Bicycle injury data for adults (16-65 years) were obtained from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database for emergency department visits between 1997-2009. The relationship between national seasonally adjusted monthly rates of bicycle injuries, obtained by a seasonal decomposition of time series, and average national gasoline prices, reported by the Energy Information Administration, was examined using a linear regression analysis. Results: Monthly rates of bicycle injuries requiring emergency care among adults increase significantly as gas prices rise (p < 0.0001, see figure) . An additional 1,149 adult injuries (95% CI 963-1,336) can be predicted to occur each month in the U.S. (>13,700 injuries annually) for each $1 rise in average gasoline price. Injury severity also increases during periods of high gas prices, with a higher percentage of injuries requiring admission. Conclusion: Increases in adult bicycle use in response to higher gas prices are accompanied by higher rates of significant bicycle-related injuries. Supporting the use of non-motorized transportation will be imperative to address public health concerns such as obesity and climate change; however, resources must also be dedicated to improve bicycle-related injury care and prevention. Background: This is a secondary analysis of data collected for a randomized trial of oral steroids in emergency department (ED) musculoskeletal back pain patients. We hypothesized that higher pain scores in the ED would be associated with more days out of work. Objectives: To determine the degree to which days out of work for ED back pain patients are correlated with ED pain scores. Methods: Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Suburban ED with 80,000 annual visits. Participants: Patients aged 18-55 years with moderately severe musculoskeletal back pain from a bending or twisting injury \u00a3 2 days before presentation. Exclusion criteria included nonmusculoskeletal etiology, direct trauma, motor deficits, and employer-initiated visits. Observations: We captured initial and discharge ED visual analog pain scores (VAS) on a 0-10 scale. Patients were contacted approximately 5 days after discharge and queried about the days out of work. We plotted days out of work versus initial VAS, discharge VAS, and change in VAS and calculated correlation coefficients. Using the Bonferroni correction because of multiple comparisons, alpha was set at 0.02. Results: We analyzed 67 patients for whom complete data were available. The mean age was 40 \u00b1 9 years and 30% were female. The average initial and discharge ED pain scales were 8.0 \u00b1 1.5 and 5.7 \u00b1 2.2, respectively. On follow-up, 88% of patients were back to work and 36% did not lose any days of work. For the plots of the days out of work versus the initial and discharge VAS and the change in the VAS, the correlation coefficients (R 2 ) were 0.03 (p = 0.17), 0.08 (p = 0.04), and 0.001 (p = 0.87), respectively. Conclusion: For ED patients with musculoskeletal back pain, we found no statistically significant correlation between days out of work and ED pain scores. Background: Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEWs) are common law enforcement tools used to subdue and repel violent subjects and, therefore, prevent further injury or violence from occurring in certain situations. The TASER X2 is a new generation of CEW that has the capability of firing two cartridges in a ''semi-automatic'' mode, and has a different electrical waveform and different output characteristics than older generation technology. There have been no data presented on the human physiologic effects of this new generation CEW. Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the human physiologic effects of this new CEW. Methods: This was a prospective, observational study of human subjects. An instructor shot subjects in the abdomen and upper thigh with one cartridge, and subjects received a 10-second exposure from the device. Measured variables included: vital signs, continuous spirometry, pre-and post-exposure ECG, intra-exposure echocardiography, venous pH, lactate, potassium, CK, and troponin. Results: Ten subjects completed the study (median age 31.5, median BMI 29.4, 80% male). There were no important changes in vital signs or in potassium. The median increase in lactate during the exposure was 1.2, range 0.6 to 2.8. The median change in pH was )0.031, range )0.011 to 0.067. No subject had a clinically relevant ECG change, evidence of cardiac capture, or positive troponin up to 24 hours after exposure. The median change in creatine kinase (CK) at 24 hours was 313, range )40 to 3418. There was no evidence of impairment of breathing by spirometry. Baseline median minute ventilation was 14.2, which increased to 21.6 during the exposure (p = 0.05), and remained elevated at 21.6 post-exposure (p = 0.01). Conclusion: We detected a small increase in lactate and decrease in pH during the exposure, and an increase in CK 24 hours after the exposure. The physiologic effects of the X2 device appear similar to previous reports for ECD devices.",

            "text": "Use Background: Public bicycle sharing (bikeshare) programs are becoming increasingly common in the US and around the world. These programs make bicycles easily accessible for hourly rental to the public. There are currently 15 active bikeshare programs in cities in the US, and more than 30 programs are being developed in cities including New York and Chicago. Despite the importance of helmet use, bikeshare programs do not provide the opportunity to purchase or rent helmets. While the programs encourage helmet use, no helmets are provided at the rental kiosks. Objectives: We sought to describe the prevalence of helmet use among adult users of bikeshare programs and users of personal bicycles in two cities with recently introduced bicycle sharing programs (Boston, MA and Washington, DC). Methods: We performed a prospective observational study of bicyclists in Boston, MA and Washington, DC. Trained observers collected data during various times of the day and days of the week. Observers recorded the sex of the bicycle operator, type of bicycle, and helmet use. All bicycles that passed a single stationary location in any direction for a period of between 30 and 90 minutes were recorded. Data are presented as frequencies of helmet use by sex, type of bicycle (bikeshare or personal), time of the week (weekday or weekend), and city. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio for helmet use controlling for type of bicycle, sex, day of week, and city. Results: There were 43 observation periods in two cities at 36 locations. 3,073 bicyclists were observed. There were 562 (18.2%) bicylists riding bikeshare bicycles. Overall helmet use was 45.5%, although helmet use varied significantly with sex, day of use, and type of bicycle (see figure) . Bikeshare users were helmeted at a lower rate compared to users of personal bicycles (19.2% vs 51.4%). Logistic regression, controlling for type of bicycle, sex, day of week, and city demonstrate that bikeshare users had higher odds of riding unhelmeted (OR 4.34, 95% CI 3.47-5.50). Women had lower odds of riding unhelmeted (OR 0.62, 0.52-0.73), while weekend riders were more likely to ride unhelmeted (OR 1.32, 1.12-1.55). Conclusion: Use of bicycle helmets by users of public bikeshare programs is low. As these programs become more popular and prevalent, efforts to increase helmet use among users should increase. Background: Abusive head trauma (AHT) represents one of the most severe forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among abused infants with 30% mortality. Young adult males account for 75% of the perpetrators. Most AHT prevention programs are hospital-based and reach a predominantly female audience. There are no published reports of school-based AHT prevention programs to date. Objectives: 1. To determine whether a high schoolbased AHT educational program will improve students' knowledge of AHT and parenting skills. 2. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a school-based AHT prevention program. Methods: This program was based on an inexpensive commercially available program developed by the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome. The program was modified to include a 60-minute interactive presentation that teaches teenagers about AHT, parenting skills, and caring for inconsolable crying infants. The program was administered in three high schools in Flint, Michigan during spring 2011. Student's knowledge was evaluated with a 17-item written test administered pre-intervention, post-intervention, and two months after program completion. Program feasibility and acceptability were evaluated through interviews and surveys with Flint area school social workers, parent educators, teachers, and administrators. Results: In all, 342 high school students (40% male) participated. Of these, 317 (92.7%) completed the pretest and post-test with 171 (50%) completing the twomonth follow-up test. The mean pre-intervention, postintervention, and two-month follow-up scores were 53%, 87%, and 90% respectively. From pre-test to posttest, mean score improved 34%, p < 0.001. This improvement was even more profound in young males, whose mean post-test score improved by 38%, p < 0.001. Of the 69 participating social workers, parent educators, teachers, and administrators, 97% ranked the program as feasible and acceptable. Conclusion: Students participating in our program showed an improvement in knowledge of AHT and parenting skills which was retained after two months. Teachers, social workers, parent educators, and school administrators supported the program. This local pilot program has the potential to be implemented on a larger scale in Michigan with the ultimate goal of reducing AHT amongst infants.",

            "text": "Will Background: Fear of litigation has been shown to affect physician practice patterns, and subsequently influence patient care. The likelihood of medical malpractice litigation has previously been linked with patient and provider characteristics. One common concern is that a patient may exaggerate symptoms in order to obtain monetary payouts; however, this has never been studied. Objectives: We hypothesize that patients are willing to exaggerate injuries for cash settlements and that there are predictive patient characteristics including age, sex, income, education level, and previous litigation. Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study spanned June 1 to December 1, 2011 in a Philadelphian urban tertiary care center. Any patient medically stable enough to fill out a survey during study investigator availability was included. Two closed-ended paper surveys were administered over the research period. Standard descriptive statistics were utilized to report incidence of: patients who desired to file a lawsuit, patients previously having filed lawsuits, and patients willing to exaggerate the truth in a lawsuit for a cash settlement. Chi-square analysis was performed to determine the relationship between patient characteristics and willingness to exaggerate injuries for a cash settlement. Results: Of 126 surveys, 11 were excluded due to incomplete data, leaving 115 for analysis. The mean age was 39 with a standard deviation of 16, and 40% were male. The incidence of patients who had the desire to sue at the time of treatment was 9%. The incidence of patients who had filed a lawsuit in the past was 35%. Of those patients, 26% had filed multiple lawsuits. Fifteen percent [95% CI 9-23%] of all patients were willing to exaggerate injuries for cash settlement. Sex and income were found to be statistically significant predictors of willingness to exaggerate symptoms: 22% of females vs. 4% of males were willing to exaggerate (p = 0.01), and 20% of people with income less than $100,000/yr vs. 0% of those with income over $100,000/ yr were willing to exaggerate (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Patients at a Philadelphian urban tertiary center admit to willingness to exaggerate symptoms for a cash settlement. Willingness to exaggerate symptoms is associated with female sex and lower income. Background: Current data suggest that as many as 50% of patients presenting to the ED with syncope leave the hospital without a defined etiology. Prior studies have suggested a prevalence of psychiatric disease as high as 26% in patients with syncope of unknown etiology. Objectives: To determine whether psychiatric disease and substance abuse are associated with an increased incidence of syncope of unknown etiology. Methods: Prospective, observational, cohort study of consecutive ED patients \u202118 presenting with syncope was conducted between 6/03 and7/06. Patients were queried in the ED and charts reviewed about a history of psychiatric disease, use of psychiatric medication, substance abuse, and duration. Data were analyzed using SAS with chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: We enrolled 519 patients who presented to the ED after syncope, 159 of whom did not have an identifiable etiology for their syncopal event. 36.5% of those without an identifiable etiology were male. 166 (32%) patients had a history of or current psychiatric disease (42% male), and 55 patients (11%) had a history of or current substance abuse (60% male). Among males with psychiatric disease, 39% had an unknown etiology of their syncopal event, compared to 22% of males without psychiatric disease (p = 0.009). Similarly, among all males with a history of substance abuse, 45% had an unknown etiology, as compared to 24% of males without a history of substance abuse (p = 0.01). A similar trend was not identified in elderly females with psychiatric disease (p = 0.96) or substance abuse (p = 0.19). However, syncope of unknown etiology was more common among both men and women under age 65 with a history of substance abuse (47%) compared to those without a history of substance abuse (27%; p = 0.01). Conclusion: Our results suggest that psychiatric disease and substance abuse are associated with increased incidence of syncope of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the ED or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from psychiatric screening and possibly detoxification referral. This is particularly true in men.

Eligibility criteria include: age>18, AHA low/intermediate risk, nondynamic ECGs, and normal initial Troponin I. Patients >75 and with a history of CAD or co-existing active medical problem were excluded. Based on prior studies and our estimated CPU census and demographic distribution, we estimated a sample size of 2,242 patients in order to detect a difference in stress utilization of 7% (2-tailed, a = 0.05, b = 0.8). We calculated a TIMI risk prediction score and a Diamond & Forrester (D&F) CAD likelihood score on each patient. T-tests were used for univariate comparisons of demographics, cardiac comorbidities, and risk scores. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for receiving testing based on race, controlling for insurance and either TIMI or D&F score. Results: Over 18 months, 2,451 patients were enrolled. Mean age was 53 \u00b1 12, and 54% (95% CI 52-56) were female. Sixty percent (95% CI 58-62) were Caucasian, 12% (95% CI 10-13) African American, and 24% (95% CI 23-26) Hispanic. Mean TIMI and D&F scores were 0.5 (95% CI 0.5-0.6) and 38% (95% CI 37-39). The overall stress testing rate was 52% (95% CI 50-54). After controlling for insurance status and TIMI or D&F scores, African American patients had significantly decreased odds of stress testing (OR TIMI 0.67 (95% CI 0.52-0.88), OR D&F 0.68 (95% CI 0.51-0.89)). Hispanics had significantly decreased odds of stress testing in the model controlling for D&F (OR D&F 0.78 (95% CI 0.63-0.98)). Conclusion: This study confirms that disparities in the workup of African American patients in the CPU are similar to those found in the general ED and the outpatient setting. Further investigation into the specific provider or patient level factors contributing to this bias is necessary.",

Conclusion: We found the 3-minute walk test to be easy to administer in the ED and that maximum heart rate and inability to start the test were highly associated with adverse events in patients with exacerbations of HF and COPD, respectively. We suggest that the 3-minute walk test be routinely incorporated into the assessment of HF and COPD patients in order to estimate risk of poor outcomes.",

These trials were selected for this review because they presented minimal factors known to be associated Background: Increasing rates of patient exposure to computerized tomography (CT) raise questions about appropriateness of utilization, as well as patient awareness of radiation exposure. Despite rapid increases in CT utilization and published risks, there is no national standard to employ informed consent prior to radiation exposure from diagnostic CT. Use of written informed consent for CT (ICCT) in our ED has increased patient understanding of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to CT imaging. Our team has developed an adjunct video educational module (VEM) to further educate ED patients about the CT procedure. Objectives: To assess patient knowledge and preferences regarding diagnostic radiation before and after viewing VEM. Methods: The VEM was based on ICCT currently utilized at our tertiary care ED (census 37,000 patients/ year). ICCT is written at an 8th grade reading level. This fall, VEM/ICCT materials were presented to a convenience sample of patients in the ED waiting room 9 AM-7 PM, Monday-Sunday. Patients who were <18 years of age, critically ill, or with language barrier were excluded. To quantify the educational value of the VEM, a six-question pretest was administered to assess baseline understanding of CT imaging. The patients then watched the VEM via iPad (Macintosh) and reviewed the consent form. An eight-question post-test was then completed by each subject. No PHI were collected. Pre-and post-test results were analyzed using McNemar's test for individual questions and a paired t-test for the summed score (SAS version 9.2). Results: 100 patients consented and completed the survey. The average pre-test score for subjects was poor, 66% correct. Review of VEM/ICCT materials increased patient understanding of medical radiation as evidenced by improved post-test score to 79%. Mean improvement between tests was 13% (p < 0.0001). 78% of subjects responded that they found the materials helpful, and that they would like to receive ICCT. Conclusion: The addition of a video educational module improved patient knowledge regarding CT imaging and medical radiation as quantified by pre-and posttesting. Patients in our study sample reported that they prefer to receive ICCT. By educating patients about the risks associated with CT imaging, we increase informed, shared decision making -an essential component of patient-centered care.",

After adjusting for age, race, and sex, neither triage (p = 0.75) nor approach (p = 0.65) pain scores predicted consent. Conclusion: Research enrollment is feasible even in ED patients reporting high levels of pain. Patients with modest improvements in pain levels may be more likely to consent. Future research should investigate which factors influence patients' decisions to participate in ED research. Conclusion: In this multicenter study of children hospitalized with bronchiolitis neither specific viruses nor their viral load predicted the need for CPAP or intubation, but young age, low birth weight, presence of apnea, severe retractions, and oxygen saturation <85% did. We also identified that children requiring CPAP or intubation were more likely to have mothers who smoked during pregnancy and a rapid respiratory worsening.

Results: Among 2,825 children evaluated for abuse, 618 met criteria as ''physically abused'' and these had 477 contacts. For each screening modality, screening was completed as recommended by the protocol in approximately 75% of cases. Of 134 contacts who met criteria for skeletal survey, new injuries were identified in 16 (12.0%). None of these fractures had associated findings on physical examination. Physical examination identified new injuries in 6.2% of eligible contacts. Neuroimaging failed to identify new injuries among 25 eligible contacts less than 6 months old. Twins were at significantly increased risk of fracture relative to other nontwin contacts (OR 20.1). Conclusion: These results support routine skeletal survey for contacts of physically abused children <24 months old, regardless of physical examination findings. Even for children where no injuries are identified, these results demonstrate that abuse is common among children who share a home with an abused child, and support including contacts in interventions (foster care, safety planning, social support) designed to protect physically abused children. Methods: This was a retrospective study evaluating all children presenting to eight paediatric, universityaffiliated EDs during one year in 2010-2011. In each setting, information regarding triage and disposition were prospectively registered by clerks in the ED database. Anonymized data were retrieved from the ED computerized database of each participating centre. In the absence of a gold standard for triage, hospitalisation, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), length of stay in the ED, and proportion of patients who left without being seen by a physician (LWBS) were used as surrogate markers of severity. The primary outcome measure was the association between triage level (from 1 to 5) and hospitalisation. The association between triage level and dichotomous outcomes was evaluated by a chi-square test, while a Student's t-test was used to evaluate the association between triage level and length of stay. It was estimated that the evaluation of all children visiting these EDs for a one year period would provide a minimum of 1,000 patients in each triage level and at least 10 events for outcomes having a proportion of 1% or more.",

Methods: We completed a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of the ED discharge process for children aged 2-24 months.

Limited understanding was defined as a score of 3-5 from 1 (excellent) to 5 (poor). Risk of medication error was defined as a plan to use over-the-counter cough/cold medication and/or an incorrect dose of acetaminophen (measured by direct observation at discharge or reported dose at follow-up call). Parents identified as at risk received further instructions from their provider. The primary outcome was persistent risk of medication error assessed at phone interview 5-10 days post-discharge. A major barrier to administering analgesics to children is the perceived discomfort of intravenous access. The delivery of intranasal analgesia may be a novel solution to this problem.

The addition of the MAD was not associated with a statistically significant increase in analgesic administration.

Conclusion: While the addition of the Mucosal Atomizer Device as an alternative delivery method for fentanyl shows a trend towards increased analgesic administration in a prehospital pediatric population, age and mechanism of injury are more predictive in who receives analgesia.

Background: Pediatric medications administered in the prehospital setting are given infrequently and dosage may be prone to error. Calculation of dose based on known weight or with use of length-based tapes occurs even less frequently and may present a challenge in terms of proper dosing. Objectives: To characterize dosing errors based on weight-based calculations in pediatric patients in two similar emergency medical service (EMS) systems. Methods: We studied the five most commonly administered medications given to pediatric patients weighing 36 kg or less. Drugs studied were morphine, midazolam, epinephrine 1:10,000, epinephrine 1:1000, and diphenhydramine. Cases from the electronic record were studied for a total of 19 months, from January 2010 to July 2011. Each drug was administered via intravenous, intramuscular, or intranasal routes. Drugs that were permitted to be titrated were excluded. An error was defined as greater than 25% above or below the recommended mg/kg dosage. Results: Out of 248,596 total patients, 13,321 were pediatric patients. 7885 had documented weights of <36 kg and 241 patients were given these medications. We excluded 72 patients for weight above the 97%ile or below the 3%ile, or if the weight documentation was missing. Of the 169 patients and 187 doses, errors were noted in 53 (28%; 95% CI 22%, 35%). Midazolam was the most common drug in errors (29 of 53 doses or 55%; 95% CI 40%, 68%), followed by diphenhydramine (11/53 or 21%; 95% CI 11%, 34%), epinephrine (7/53 or 13%; 95% CI 5%, 25%), and morphine sulfate (6/53 or 11%; 95% CI, 4%, 23%). Underdosing was noted in 34 of 53 (64%; 95% CI 50%, 77%) of errors, while excessive dosing was noted in 19 of 53 (36%; 95% CI 23%, 50%). Conclusion: Weight-based dosing errors in pediatric patients are common. While the clinical consequences of drug dosing errors in these patients are unknown, a considerable amount of inaccuracy occurs. Strategies beyond provision of reference materials are needed to prevent pediatric medication errors and reduce the potential for adverse outcomes.",

After 2.5 minutes of CPR to circulate the vasopressor, compressions were interrupted for 10 seconds to analyze the ECG rhythm. This was immediately followed by 20 seconds of CPR to restore CPP before the first RS was delivered. If the RS failed, CPR resumed and additional vasopressors (SDE, and vasopressin 0.57 mg/kg) were given and the sequence repeated. The CPP was defined as aortic diastolic pressure minus right atrial diastolic pressure. The CPP values were extracted at three time points: immediately after the 2.5 minutes of CPR, following the 10-second pause, and immediately before defibrillation for the first two RS attempts in each animal. Eighty-three sets of measurements were logged from 42 animals.",

In fact, an understanding of patient self-triage abilities is needed to inform health policies targeting how and where patients access acute care services within the health care system. Objectives: To determine the accuracy of a patient's self-assessment of urgency compared against triage nurses. Methods: Setting: ED patients are assigned a score by trained nurses according to the Canadian Emergency Department Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). We present a cross-sectional survey of a random patient sample from 12 urban/regional EDs conducted during the winters of 2007 and 2009. This previously validated questionnaire, based on the British Healthcare Commission Survey, was distributed according to a modified Dillman protocol. Exclusion criteria consisted of: age 0-15 years, left prior to being seen/treated, died during ED visit, no contact information, presented with a privacy-sensitive case. Alberta Health Services provided linked non-survey administrative data. Results: 21,639 surveys distributed with a response rate of 46%. Patients rated health problems as life-threatening (6%), possibly life-threatening (22%), urgent (30%), somewhat urgent (37%), or not urgent (5%). Triage nurses assigned the same patients CTAS scores of I (<1%), II (20%), III (45%), IV (29%) or V (5%). Patients self-rated their condition as 3 or 4 points less urgent than the assigned CTAS score (<1% of the time), 2 points less urgent (5%), 1 point less urgent (25%), exactly as urgent (38%), 1 point more urgent (24%), 2 points more urgent (7%), or 3 or 4 points more urgent (1%, respectively). Among CTAS I or II patients, 54% described their problem as life-threatening/possibly life-threatening, 26% as urgent (risk of permanent damage), 18% as urgent (needed to be seen that day), and 2% as not urgent (wanted to be but did not need to be seen that day). Conclusion: The majority of ED patients are generally able to accurately assess the acuity of their problem. Encouraging patients with low-urgency conditions to self-triage to lower-acuity sources of care may relieve stress on EDs. However, physicians and patients must be aware that a small minority of patients are unable to self-triage safely. When the tourniquet was released, blood spurted from the injured artery as hydrostatic pressure decayed. Pressure and flow were recorded in three animals (see table) .",

Methods: Over 6 months a workgroup of physicians and nurses with experience in team training and simulation developed an educational program for clinical staff of a tertiary PED. Goals included: create a didactic curriculum to teach the principles of CRM, incorporate principles of CRM into simulation-enhanced team training in-situ and center-based exercises, and utilize assessment instruments to evaluate for teamwork, completion of critical actions, and presence of latent safety threats during in-situ SIM resuscitations. Results: During Phase I, 130 clinicians, divided into teams, participated in 90-minute pre-training assessments of PALS-based in-situ simulations. In Phase II, staff participated in a 6-hour curriculum reviewing key CRM concepts, including team training exercises utilizing simulation and expert debriefing. In Phase III, staff participated in post-training 90 minute teamwork and clinical skills assessments in the PED. In all phases, critical action checklists (CAC) were tabulated by simulation educators. In-situ simulations were recorded for later review using the assessment tools. After each simulation, educators facilitated discussion of perceptions of teamwork and identification of systems issues and latent hazards. Overall, 54 in-situ simulations were conducted capturing 97% of the physicians and 84% of the nurses. CAC data were collected by an observer and compared to video recordings. Over 20 significant systems issues, latent hazards, and knowledge deficits were identified. All components of the program were rated highly by 90% of the staff. Conclusion: A workgroup of PEM, simulation, and team training experts developed a multidisciplinary team training program that used in-situ and centerbased simulation and a refined CRM curriculum. Unique features of this program include its multidisciplinary focus, the development of a variety of assessment tools, and use of in-situ simulation for evaluation of systems issues and latent hazards. This program was tested in a PED and findings will be used to refine care and develop a sustainment program while addressing issues identified.

HRV data were collected using a continuous heart rate variability monitoring system. Participant HRV was monitored at baseline, during the unassisted first attempt at endotracheal intubation, during supervised practice, and then during a simulated respiratory failure clinical scenario. Standard deviation of beat to beat variability (SDNN), very low frequency (VLF), total power (TP), and low frequency (LF) was analyzed to determine the effect of practice and level of training on the level of stress. A Cohen's d test was used to determine differences between study groups. Results: SDNN data showed that second-year residents were less stressed during all stages than were fourthyear medical students (avg d = 1.12). VLF data showed third-year residents exhibited less sympathetic activity than did first-year residents (avg d = )0.68). The opportunity to practice resulted in less stress for all participants. TP data showed that residents had a greater degree of control over their autonomic nervous system (ANS) than did medical students (avg d = 0.85). LF data showed that subjects were more engaged in the task at hand as the level of training increased indicating autonomic balance (avg d = 0.80). Conclusion: Our HRV data show that stress associated with the performance of a complex procedural task is reduced by increased training. HRV may provide a quantitative measure of physiologic stress during the learning process and thus serve as a marker of when a subject is adequately trained to perform a particular task. Objectives: We seek to examine whether intubation during CPR can be done as efficiently as intubation without ongoing CPR. The hypothesis is that the predictable movement of an automated chest compression device will make intubation easier than the random movement from manual CPR. Methods: The project was an experimental controlled trial and took place in the emergency department at a tertiary referral center in Peoria, Illinois. Emergency medicine residents, attendings, paramedics, and other ACLS trained staff were eligible for participation. In randomized order, each participant attempted intubation on a mannequin with no CPR ongoing, during CPR with a human compressor, and during CPR with an automatic chest compression device (Physio Control Lucas 2). Participants could use whichever style laryngoscope they felt most comfortable with and they were timed during the three attempts. Success was determined after each attempt.",

The mean times for intubation with manual CPR and no CPR were not statistically different (17.1 sec, 18.1 sec; p = 0.606). Conclusion: The success rate of tracheal intubation with ongoing chest compression was the same as the success rate of intubation without CPR. Although intubation with automatic chest compression was faster than during other scenarios, all methods were close to the 10 second timeframe recommended by ACLS. Based on these findings, it may not always be necessary to hold CPR to place a definitive airway; however, further studies will be needed. Background: After acute myocardial infarction, vascular remodeling in the peri-infarct area is essential to provide adequate perfusion, prevent additional myocyte loss, and aid in the repair process.

Furthermore, 20% of dissections are without chest pain and 6% are painless. For all these reasons, diagnosing dissection can be difficult for the ED physician. We wished to quantify the magnitude of this problem in a large ED database. Objectives: Our goal was to determine the number of patients diagnosed by ED physicians with aortic dissections compared to total ED patients and to the total number of patients with a chest pain diagnosis.

Methods: The study was performed in an inner-city academic ED between 1/1/07 and 12/31/10. Every patient for whom ED activation of our STEMI system occurred was included. All times data from a pre-existing quality assurance database were collected prospectively. Patient language was determined retrospectively by chart review.

Hospitalization for syncope, although common, is rarely of benefit. No populationbased study has examined disparities in regional admission practices for syncope care in the ED. Moreover, there are no population-based studies reporting prognostic factors for 7-and 30-day readmission of syncope. Objectives: 1) To identify factors associated with admission as well as prognostic factors for 7-and 30-day readmission to these hospitals; 2) To evaluate variability in syncope admission practices across different sizes and types of hospitals.",

PARTICIPANTS/SUBJECTS -patients >17 years of age with syncope (ICD10: R55) as a primary or secondary diagnosis from 2007 to June 2011. Readmission was defined as return visits to the ED or admission <7 days or 7-30 days after the index visit (including against medical advice and left without being seen during the index visit). OUTCOMES -factors associated with hospital admission at index presentation, and readmission following ED discharge, adjusted using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Overall, 44521 syncope visits occurred over 4 years. Increased age, increased length of stay (LoS), performance of CXR, transport by ground ambulance, and treatment at a low-volume hospital (non-teaching or non-large urban) were independently associated with index hospitalization. These same factors, as well as hospital admission itself, were associated with 7-day readmission. Additionally, increased age, increased LoS, performance of a head CT, treatment at a low-volume hospital, hospital admission, and female sex were independently associated with 7-30 day readmission. Arrival by ground ambulance was associated with a decreased likelihood of both 7-and 7-30 day readmission. Conclusion: Our data identify variations in practice as well as factors associated with hospitalization and readmission for syncope. The disparity in admission and readmission rates between centers may highlight a gap in quality of care or reflect inappropriate use of resources. Further research to compare patient out-comes and quality of patient care among urban and non-urban centers is needed.

            "text": "Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of a convenience sample of AHF patients presenting with dyspnea to the ED of an academic tertiary referral center with a mixed urban/ suburban catchment area. Patients were enrolled weekdays, June through December 2006. Patients assessed their DS using a 10-cm visual analog scale at three times: the start of ED treatment (baseline) as well as at 1 and 4 hours after starting ED treatment. The difference between baseline and 1 hour was the 1-hour DS change. The difference between baseline and 4 hours was the 4-hour DS change. Two clinical outcome measures were obtained: 1) the number of days hospitalized or dead within 30 days of the index visit (30-day outcome), and 2) the number of days hospitalized or dead within 90 days of the index visit (90-day outcome). Results: Data on 86 patients were analyzed. The median 30-day outcome variable was 6 days with an interquartile range (IQR) of 3 to 16. The median 90-day outcome variable was 10 days (IQR 4 to 27.5). The median 1-hour DS change was 2.6 cm (IQR 0.3 to 6.7). The median 4-hour DS change was 4.9 cm (IQR 2.2 to 8.2). The 30-day and 90-day mortality rates were 9% and 13% respectively. The spearman rank correlations and 95% confidence intervals are presented in the table below. Conclusion: While the point estimates for the correlations were below 0.5, the 95% CI for two of the correlations extended above 0.5. These pilot data support change in DS as a valid outcome measure for AHF when measured over 4 hours. A larger prospective study is needed to obtain a more accurate point estimate of the correlations. Background: The majority of volume-quality research has focused on surgical outcomes in the inpatient setting; very few studies have examined the effect of emergency department (ED) case volume on patient outcomes. Objectives: To determine whether ED case volume of acute heart failure (AHF) is associated with short-term patient outcomes. Methods: We analyzed the 2008 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) and Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), the largest, all-payer, ED and inpatient databases in the US. ED visits for AHF were identified with a principal diagnosis of ICD-9-CM code 428.xx. EDs were categorized into quartiles by ED case volume of AHF. The outcome measures were early inpatient mortality (within the first 2 days of admission), overall inpatient mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: There were an estimated 946,000 visits for AHF from approximately 4,700 EDs in 2008; 80% were hospitalized. Of these, the overall inpatient mortality rate was 3.2%, and the median hospital LOS was 4 days. Early inpatient mortality was lower in the highest-volume EDs, compared with the lowest-volume EDs (0.8% vs. 2.1%; P < 0.001). Similar patterns were observed for overall inpatient mortality (3.0% vs. 4.1%; P < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis adjusting for 37 patient and hospital characteristics, early inpatient mortality remained lower in patients admitted through the highest-volume EDs (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.96), as compared with the lowest-volume EDs. There was a trend towards lower overall inpatient mortality in the highest-volume EDs; however, this was not statistically significant (adjusted OR, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.75-1.14). By contrast, using the NIS data including various sources of admissions, a higher case volume of inpatient AHF patients predicted lower overall inpatient mortality (adjusted OR, 0.51; 95%CI, 0.40-0.65). The hospital LOS in patients admitted through the highest-volume EDs was slightly longer (adjusted difference, 0.7 day; 95%CI, 0.2-1.2), compared with the lowest-volume EDs. Conclusion: ED patients who are hospitalized for AHF have an approximately 30% reduced early inpatient mortality if they were admitted from an ED that handles a large volume of AHF cases. The ''practice-makesperfect'' concept may hold in emergency management of AHF.",

These improvements were noted to be statistically significant in each case: courtesy p < 0.001, time listening p < 0.001, concern for comfort p < 0.001, informativeness p < 0.001, overall perception of care p < 0.001, and likelihood to recommend p < 0.001. Conclusion: Data from this community ED suggest that transition from a non-residency trained, ABEM certified staff to a fully trained and certified model has important implications for patient's perceptions of the care they receive. We observed significant improvement in rating scores provided by patients across all physicianoriented and general ED measures. Background: Transfer of care from the ED to the inpatient floor is a critical transition when miscommunication places patients at risk. The optimal form and content of handoff between providers has not been defined. In July 2011, ED-to-floor signout for all admissions to the medicine and cardiology floors was changed at our urban, academic, tertiary care hospital. Previously, signout was via an unstructured telephone conversation between ED resident and admitting housestaff. The new signout utilizes a web-based ED patient tracking system and includes: 1) a templated description of ED course is completed by the ED resident; 2) when a bed is assigned, an automated page is sent to the admitting housestaff; 3) ED clinical information, including imaging, labs, medications, and nursing interventions (figure) is reviewed by admitting housestaff; 4) if housestaff has specific questions about ED care, a telephone conversation between the ED resident and housestaff occurs; 5) if there are no specific questions, it is indicated electronically and the patient is transferred to the floor. Objectives: To describe the effects on patient safety (floor-to-ICU transfer in 24 hours) and ED throughput (ED length of stay (LOS) and time from bed assignment to ED departure) resulting from a change to an electronic, discussion-optional handoff system. Conclusion: Transition to a system in which signout of admitted patients is accomplished by accepting housestaff review of ED clinical information supplemented by verbal discussion when needed resulted in no significant change in rate of floor-to-ICU transfer or ED LOS and reduced time from bed assignment to ED departure. Background: Emergency physicians may be biased against patients presenting with nonspecific complaints or those requiring more extensive work-ups. This may result in patients being seen less quickly than those with more straightforward presentations, despite equal triage scores or potential for more dangerous conditions. Objectives: The goal of our study was to ascertain which patients, if any, were seen more quickly in the ED based on chief complaint. Methods: A retrospective report was generated from the EMR for all moderate acuity (ESI 3) adult patients who visited the ED from January 2005 through December 2010 at a large urban teaching hospital. The most common complaints were: abdominal pain, alcohol intoxication, back pain, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, dizziness, fall, fever, flank pain, headache, infection, pain (nonspecific), psychiatric evaluation, ''sent by MD,'' vaginal bleeding, vomiting, and weakness. Non-parametric independent sample tests assessed median time to be seen (TTBS) by a physician for each complaint. Differences in the TTBS between genders and based on age were also calculated. Chi-square testing compared percentages of patients in the ED per hour to assess for differences in the distribution of arrival times. Results: We obtained data from 116,194 patients. Patients with a chief complaint of weakness and dizziness waited the longest with a median time of 35 minutes and patients with flank pain waited the shortest with 24 minutes (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 1 ). Overall, males waited 30 minutes and females waited 32 minutes (p < 0.0001). Stratifying by gender and age, younger females between the ages of 18-50 waited significantly longer times when presenting with a chief complaint of abdominal pain (p < 0.0001), chest pain (p < 0.05), or flank pain (p < 0.0001) as compared to males in the same age group ( Figure 2 ). There was no difference in the distribution of arrival times for these complaints. Conclusion: While the absolute time differences are not large, there is a significant bias toward seeing young male patients more quickly than women or older males despite the lower likelihood of dangerous conditions. Triage systems should perhaps take age and gender better into account. Patients might benefit from efforts to educate EM physicians on the delays and potential quality issues associated with this bias in an attempt to move toward more egalitarian patient selection. Background: Detailed analysis of emergency department (ED) event data identified the time from completion of emergency physician evaluation (Doc Done) to the time patients leave the ED as a significant contributor to ED length of stay (LOS) and boarding at our institution. Process flow mapping identified the time from Doc Done to the time inpatient beds were ordered (BO) as an interval amendable to specific process improvements.",

Methods: A prospective, observational design was used to evaluate the study questions. Data regarding the time to BO and LOS outcomes were collected before and after implementation of the ED holding orders program. The intervention targeted stable AIM patients being admitted to hospitalist, internal medicine, and family medicine services. ED holding orders were placed following the admission discussion with the accepting service and special attention was paid to proper bed type, completion of the emergent work-up and the expected immediate course of the patient's hospital stay. Holding orders were of limited duration and expired 4 hours after arrival to the inpatient unit. Results: During the 6-month study period, 7321 patients were eligible for the ED holding orders intervention; 6664 (91.0%) were cared for using the standard adult medicine order set and 657 (9.0%) received the intervention. The median time from Doc Done to BO was significantly shorter for patients in the ED holding orders group, 41 min (IQR 19, 88) vs. 95 min (IQR 53, 154) for the standard adult medicine group, p < 0.001. Similarly, the median ED LOS was significantly shorter for those in the ED holding orders group, 413 min (IQR 331, 540) vs. 456 min (IQR 346, 581) for the standard adult medicine group, p < 0.001. No lapses in patient care were reported in the intervention group. Conclusion: In this cohort of ED patients being admitted to an AIM service, placing ED holding orders rather than waiting for a traditional inpatient team evaluation and set of admission orders significantly reduced the time from the completion of the ED workup to placement of a BO. As a result, ED LOS was also significantly shortened. While overall utilization of the intervention was low, it improved with each month.",

Charting with voice recognition dictation has the potential to decrease interruptions in the ED allowing for more efficient workflow and improved patient care. Background: Using robot assistants in health care is an emerging strategy to improve efficiency and quality of care while optimizing the use of human work hours. Robot prototypes capable of performing vital signs and assisting with ED triage are under development. However, ED users' attitudes toward robot assistants are not well studied. Understanding of these attitudes is essential to design user-friendly robots and to prepare EDs for the implementation of robot assistants. Objectives: To evaluate the attitudes of ED patients and their accompanying family and friends toward the potential use of robot assistants in the ED. Methods: We surveyed a convenience sample of adult ED patients and their accompanying adult family members and friends at a single, university-affiliated ED, 9/ 26/11-10/27/11. The survey consisted of eight items from the Negative Attitudes Towards Robots Scale (Normura et al.) modified to address robot use in the ED. Response options included a 5-point Likert scale. A summary score was calculated by summing the responses for all 8 items, with a potential range of 8 (completely negative attitude) to 40 (completely positive attitude). Research assistants gave the written surveys to subjects during their ED visit. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Bivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the summary score and the following variables: participant type (patient or visitor), sex, race, time of day, and day of week. Results: Of 121 potential subjects approached, 113 (93%) completed the survey. Participants were 37% patients, 63% family members or friends, 62% women, 79% white, and had a median age of 45.5 years (IQR 18-84). Cronbach's alpha was 0.94. The mean summary score was 22.2 (SD = 0.87), indicating subjects were between ''occasionally'' and ''sometimes'' comfortable with the idea of ED robot assistants (see table) . Men were more positive toward robot use than women (summary score: 24.6 vs 20.8; p = 0.033). No differences in the summary score were detected based on participant type, race, time of day, or day of week. Conclusion: ED users reported significant apprehension about the potential use of robot assistants in the ED. Future research is needed to explore how robot designs and strategies to implement ED robots can help alleviate this apprehension. Background: Emergency department cardioversion (EDC) of recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) patients is an increasingly common management approach to this arrhythmia. Patients who qualify for EDC generally have few co-morbidities and are often discharged directly from the ED. This results in a shift towards a sicker population of patients admitted to the hospital with this diagnosis. Objectives: To determine whether hospital charges and length of stay (LOS) profiles are affected by emergency department discharge of AF patients. Methods: Patients receiving treatment at an urban teaching community hospital with a primary diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or flutter were identified through the hospital's billing data base. Information collected on each patient included date of service, patient status, length of stay, and total charges. Patient status was categorized as inpatient (admitted to the hospital), observation (transferred from the ED to an inpatient bed but placed in an observation status), or ED (discharged directly from the ED). The hospital billing system automatically defaults to a length of stay of 0 for observation patients. ED patients were assigned a length of stay of 0. Total hospital charges and mean LOS were determined for two different models: a standard model (SM) in which patients discharged from the ED were excluded from hospital statistics, and an inclusive model (IM) in which discharged ED patients were included in the hospital statistics. Statistical analysis was through ANOVA.",

Exclusion of these patients from hospital statistics skews performance profiles effectively punishing institutions for progressive care. Background: Recent health care reform has placed an emphasis on the electronic health record (EHR). With the advent of the EHR it is common to see ED providers spending more time in front of computers documenting and away from patients. Finding strategies to decrease provider interaction with computers and increase time with patients may lead to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction. Computerized charting adjuncts, such as voice recognition software, have been marketed as ways to improve provider efficiency and patient contact.

Methods: We performed an electronic chart review at our inner city, academic emergency department with an annual census of 110,000 patients. We identified all patients over the age of 18 who received a non-invasive triage temperature and a subsequent rectal temperature while in the ED from January 2002 through February 2011.

The mean difference in temperatures between the initial temperature and the rectal temperature was 1.3\u00b0F, with 25.9% having higher rectal temperatures \u20212\u00b0F, and 5.0% having higher rectal temperatures \u20214\u00b0F. The mean temperature difference among the 10,313 patients who an initial noninvasive temperature and a rectal temperature within one hour was 1.4\u00b0F. The mean difference among patients that received oral, axillary, and temporal temperatures was 1.2\u00b0F, 1.8\u00b0F, and 1.2\u00b0F respectively. Approximately one in five patients (18.1%) were initially afebrile and found to be febrile by rectal temperature, with an average temperature difference of 2.5\u00b0F. These patients had a higher rate of admission, and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Conclusion: There are significant differences between rectal temperatures and non-invasive triage temperatures in this emergency department cohort. In almost one in five patients, fever was missed by triage temperature.

            "text": "Methods: Data were extracted from a computerized ED tracking system in an urban tertiary care PED. Comparisons were made between metrics for 2010 (23,681 patients) and the 3 months following process change (6,195 patients). During 2010, patients were triaged by one or two nurses, registered, and then sent either to a 14-bed PED or a physically separate 5-bed fast-track unit, where they were seen by a physician. Following process change, patients were brought directly to a bed in the 14-bed PED, triaged and registered, then seen by a physician. The fast-track unit was only utilized to accommodate patient surges. Results: Anticipating improved efficiencies, attending physician coverage was decreased by 9%. After instituting process changes, improvements were noted immediately. Although daily patient volume increased by 3%, median time to be seen by a physician decreased by 20%. Additionally, median LOS for discharged patients decreased by 15%, and median time until the decisionto-admit decreased by 10%. Press-Ganey satisfaction scores during this time increased by greater than 5 mean score points, which was reported to be a statistically significant increase. Conclusion: Direct bedding, bedside registration, and patient pooling were simple to implement process changes. These changes resulted in more efficient PED throughput, as evidenced by decreased times to be seen by a physician, LOS for discharged patients, and time until decision-to-admit. Additionally, patient satisfaction scores improved, despite decreased attending physician coverage and a 30% decrease in room utilization. ) . During period 1, the OU was managed by the internal medicine department and staffed by primary care physicians and physician assistants. During periods 2 and 3, the OU was managed and staffed by EM physicians. Data collected included OU patient volume, length of stay (LOS) for discharged and admitted patients, admission rates, and 30-day readmission rates for discharged patients. Cost data collected included direct, indirect, and total cost per patient encounter. Data were compared using chi-square and ANOVA analysis followed by multiple pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni method of p-value adjustment. Results: See table. The OU patient volume and percent of ED volume was greater in period 3 compared to periods 1 and 2. Length of stay, admission rates, 30-day readmission rates, and costs were greater in period 1 compared to periods 2 and 3. Conclusion: EM physicians provide more cost-effective care for patients in this large OU compared to non-EM physicians, resulting in shorter LOS for admitted and discharged patients, greater rates of patients discharged, and less 30-day readmission rates for discharged patients. This is not affected by an increase in OU volume and shows a trend towards improvement. Background: Emergency department (ED) crowding continues to be a problem, and new intake models may represent part of the solution. However, little data exist on the sustainability and long-term effects of physician triage and screening on standard ED performance metrics, as most studies are short-term. Objectives: We examined the hypothesis that a physician screening program (START) sustainably improves standard ED performance metrics including patient length of stay (LOS) and patients who left without completing assessment (LWCA). We also investigated the number of patients treated and dispositioned by START without using a monitored bed and the median patient door-to-room time. Methods: Design and Setting: This study is a retrospective before-and-after analysis of START in a Level I tertiary care urban academic medical center with approximately 90,000 annual patient visits. All adult patients from December 2006 until November 2010 are included, though only a subset was seen in START. START began at our institution in December 2007. Observations: Our outcome measures were length of stay for ED patients, LWCA rates, patients treated and dispositioned by START without using a monitored bed, and door-to-room time. Statistics: Simple descriptive statistics were used. P-values for LOS were calculated with Wilcoxon test and p-value for LWCA was calculated with chi-square. Results: Table 2 shows median length of stay for ED patients was reduced by 56 minutes/patient (p-value <0.0001) when comparing the most recent year to the year before START. Patients who LWCA were reduced from 4.8% to 2.9% (p-value <0.0001) during the same time period. We also found that in the first half-year of START, 18% of patients screened in the ED were treated and dispositioned without using a monitored bed and by the end of year 3, this number had grown to 29%. Median door-to-room time decreased from 18.4 minutes to 9.9 minutes over the same period of time. Conclusion: A START system can provide sustained improvements in ED performance metrics, including a significant reduction in ED LOS, LWCA rate, and doorto-room time. Additionally, START can decrease the need for monitored ED beds and thus increase ED capacity. . Labs were obtained in 98%, CT in 37%, US in 30%, and consultation in 23%. 18% of the cohort was admitted to the hospital. The most commonly utilized source of translation was a layman (35%). A professional translator was used in 9% and translation service (language line, MARTY) in 30%. The examiner was fluent in the patient's language in 11%. Both the patient and examiner were able to maintain basic communication in 11%. There were 47 patients in the professional/ fluent translation group and 44 patients in the lay translation group. There was no difference in ED LOS between groups 288 vs 304 min; p = 0.6. There was no difference in the frequency of lab tests, computerized tomography, ultrasound, consultations, or hospital admission. Frequencies did not differ by sex or age. Conclusion: Translation method was not associated with a difference in overall ED LOS, ancillary test use, or specialist consultation in Spanish-speaking patients presenting to the ED for abdominal pain.",

Of these, providers identified 54.7% (325 patients) who presented with a warfarin-related complication as their primary reason for the ED visit. 56.9% (338) Each 100 hours of daily boarding is associated with a drop of 1.3 raw score points in both PG metrics. These seemingly small drops in raw scores translate into major changes in rankings on Press Ganey national percentile scales (a difference of as much as 10 percentile points). Our institution commonly has hundreds of hours of daily boarding. It is possible that patient-level measurements of boarding impact would show stronger correlation with individual satisfaction scores, as opposed to the daily aggregate measures we describe here. Our research suggests that reducing the burden of boarding on EDs will improve patient satisfaction. Background: Prolonged emergency department (ED) boarding is a key contributor to ED crowding. The effect of output interventions (moving boarders out of the ED into an intermediate area prior to admission or adding additional capacity to an observation unit) has not been well studied. Objectives: We studied the effect of a combined observation-transition (OT) unit, consisting of observation beds and an interim holding area for boarding ED patients, on the length of stay (LOS) for admitted patients, as well as secondary outcomes such as LOS for discharged patients, and left without being seen rates. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review (12 months pre-, 12 months post-design) of an OT unit at an urban teaching ED with 59,000 annual visits (study ED). We compared outcomes to a nearby communitybased ED with 38,000 annual visits in the same health system (control ED) where no capacity interventions were performed. The OT had 17 beds, full monitoring capacity, and was staffed 24 hours per day. The number of beds allocated to transition and observation patients fluctuated throughout the course of the intervention, based on patient demands. All analyses were conducted at the level of the ED-day. Wilcoxon rank-sum and analysis of covariance tests were used for comparisons; continuous variables were summarized with medians. Results: In unadjusted analyses, median daily LOS of admitted patients at the study ED was 31 minutes lower in the 12 months after the OT opened, 6.98 to 6.47 hours (p < 0.0001). Control site daily LOS for admitted patients increased 26 minutes from 4.52 to 4.95 hours (p < 0.0001). Results were similar after adjusting for other covariates (day of week, ED volume, and triage level). LOS of discharged patients at study ED decreased by 14 minutes, from 4.1 hours to 3.8 hours (p < 0.001), while the control ED saw no significant changes in discharged patient LOS (2.6 hours to 2.7 hours, p = 0.06). Left without being seen rates did not decrease at either site. Conclusion: Opening an OT unit was associated with a 30-minute reduction in average daily ED LOS for admitted patients and discharged patients in the study ED. Given the large expense of opening an OT, future studies should compare capacity-dependent (e.g., OT) vs. capacity-independent (e.g, organizational) interventions to reduce ED crowding.",

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a potentially severe complication of lower genital tract infections, which involves inflammation of the female upper genital tract secondary to ascending STIs. PID has been associated with severe sequelae including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. We describe the prevalence and microbial patterns of PID in a cohort of adolescent females presenting to an urban emergency department with abdominal or genitourinary complaints. Objectives: To describe the prevalence and microbial patterns of PID in a cohort of adolescent patients presenting to an ED with lower abdominal or genitourinary complaints. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective study of females ages 14-19 years presenting to a pediatric ED with lower abdominal or genitourinary complaints. Diagnosis of PID was per 2006 CDC guidelines. Patients underwent Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhea (GC) testing via urine APTIMA Combo 2 Assay and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) testing using the vaginal OSOM Trichomonas rapid test. Descriptive statistics were performed using STATA 11.0. Results: The prevalence of PID in this cohort of 328 patients was 19.5% (95% CI 15.2%, 23.8%), 37.5% (95% CI 25.3%, 49.7%) of whom had positive sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing: 25% (95% CI 14.1%, 35.9%) with CT, 7.8% (95% CI 1.1, 14.6%) with GC, and 12.5% (95% CI 4.2%, 20.8%) with TV. 84.4% (95% CI 75.2, 93.5%) of patients diagnosed with PID received antibiotics consistent with CDC recommendations. Patients with lower abdominal pain as their chief complaint were more likely to have PID than patients with genitourinary complaints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.7, 6.4). Conclusion: A substantial number of adolescent females presenting to the emergency department with lower abdominal pain were diagnosed with PID, with microbial patterns similar to those previously reported in largely adult, outpatient samples. Furthermore, appropriate treatment for PID was observed in the majority of patients diagnosed with PID.",

Conclusion: Use of maternal ultrasound in rural and resource-limited settings draws women to an initial antenatal care visit, increases referral, and improves job satisfaction among health care workers. Methods: A retrospective database analysis was conducted using the electronic medical record from a single, large academic hospital. ED patients who received a billing diagnosis of ''nausea and vomiting of pregnancy'' or ''hyperemesis gravidarum'' between 1/1/10 and 12/31/10 were selected. A manual chart review was conducted with demographic and treatment variables collected. Statistical significance was determined using multiple regression analysis for a primary outcome of return visit to the emergency department for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Results: 113 patients were identified. The mean age was 27.1 years (SD\u00b15.25), mean gravidity 2.90 (SD\u00b11.94), and mean gestational age 8.78 weeks (SD\u00b13.21). The average length of ED evaluation was 730 min (SD\u00b1513). Of the 113 patients, 38 (33.6%) had a return ED visit for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, 17 (15%) were admitted to the hospital, and 49 (43%) were admitted to the ED observation protocol. Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of medical co-morbidity (p = 0.039), patient gravditity (p = 0.016), gestational age (p = 0.038), and admission to the hospital (p = 0.004) had small but significant effects on the primary outcome (return visits to the emergency department). No other variables were found to be predictive of return visits to the ED including admission to the ED observation unit or factors classically thought to be associated with severe forms of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy including ketonuria, electrolyte abnormalities, or vital sign abnormalities. Conclusion: Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy has a high rate of return ED visits that can be predicted by young patient age, low patient gravidity, early gestational age, and the presence of other comorbidities. These patients may benefit from obstetric consultation and/or optimization of symptom management after discharge in order to prevent recurrent utilization of the ED.",

The mean distance flown was shorter for NFL (850 miles, SD 576 vs. NHL 1060, SD 579) miles and all were in a pressurized cabin. The mean number of games missed for NFL and NHL players who traveled by air immediately after concussion was increased by 29% and 24% (respectively) than for those who did not travel by air NFL: 3.8 (SD 2.2) vs. 2.6 games (SD 1.8) and NHL: 16.2 games (SD 22.0) vs.12.4 (SD 18.6); p < 0.03. Conclusion: This is an initial report of an increased rate of recovery in terms of more games missed, for professional athletes flying commercial airlines post-mTBI compared to those that do not subject their recently injured brains to pressurized airflight. The obvious changes of decreased oxygen tension with altitude equivalent of 7,500 feet, decreased humidity with increased dehydration, and duress of travel accompanying pressurized airline cabins all likely increase the concussion penumbra in acute mTBI. Early air travel post concussion should be further evaluated and likely postponed 48-72 hr. until initial symptoms subside.

The study related survey variables included patient demographics, community characteristics, mode of transport to the hospital, and hospital characteristics. Results: 566 patients met inclusion criteria, representing 2,153,234 patient records nationally. Of these, 50.4% arrived by ambulance. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients residing in the west and south had lower odds of arriving by ambulance for stroke when compared to northeast (Southern Region, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.76, Western Region, OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25-0.84, Midwest Region, OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.31-1.01).

Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive patients diagnosed with TIA between June 2009 and July 2011 that underwent both CT and MRI as part of routine care within 1 calendar day of presentation to a single, academic ED. CT and MR images were reviewed by a single emergency physician who was blinded to the MR images at the time of CT interpretation.

These residents had higher levels of BO Background: Emergency department (ED) billing includes both facility and professional fees. An algorithm derived from the medical provider's chart generates the latter fee. Many private hospitals encourage appropriate documentation by financially incentivizing providers. Academic hospitals sometimes lag in this initiative, possibly resulting in less than optimal charting. Past attempts to teach proper documentation using our electronic medical record (EMR) were difficult in our urban, academic ED of 80 providers (approximately 25 attending physicians, 36 residents, and 20 physician assistants). Objectives: We created a tutorial to teach documentation of ED charts, modified the EMR to encourage appropriate documentation, and provided feedback from the coding department. This was combined with an incentive structure shared equally amongst all attendings based on increased collections. We hypothesized this instructional intervention would lead to more appropriate billing, improve chart content, decrease medical liability, and increase educational value of charting process. Methods: Documentation recommendations, divided into two-month phases of 2-3 proposals, were administered to all ED providers by e-mails, lectures, and reminders during sign-out rounds. Charts were reviewed by coders who provided individual feedback if specific phase recommendations were not followed. Our endpoints included change in total RVU, RVUs/ patient, E/M level distribution, and subjective quality of chart improvement. We did not examine effects on procedure codes or facility fees. Results: Our base average RVU/patient in our ED from 1/1/11-6/30/11 was 2.615 with monthly variability of approximately 2%. Implementation of phase one increased average RVU/patient within two weeks to 2.73 (4.4% increase from baseline, p < 0.05). The second aggregate phase implemented 8 weeks later increased average RVU/patient to 3.04 (16.4% increase from baseline, p < 0.05).",

Many institutions and departments struggle with providing both basic and transformative mentoring for their faculty. Objectives: We sought to identify and understand the essential practices of successful mentoring programs. Methods: Multidisciplinary institutional stakeholders in the school of medicine including tenured professors, deans, and faculty acknowledged as successful mentors were identified and participated in focused interviews between Mar-Nov 2011. The major area of inquiry involved their experiences with mentoring relationships, practices, and structure within the school, department, or division. Focused interview data were transcribed and grounded theory analysis was performed. Additional data collected by a 2009 institutional mentoring taskforce were examined. Key elements and themes were identified and organized for final review. Results: Results identified the mentoring practices for three categories: 1) General themes for all faculty, 2) Specific practices for faculty groups: Basic Science Researchers, Clinician Researchers, Clinician Educators, and 3) National examples. Additional mentoring strategies that failed were identified. The general themes were quite universal among faculty groups. These included: clarify the best type of mentoring for the mentee, allow the mentee to choose the mentor, establish a panel of mentors with complementary skills, schedule regular meetings, establish a clear mentoring plan with expectations and goals, offer training and resources for both the mentor and mentee at institutional and departmental levels, ensure ongoing mentoring evaluation, create a mechanism to identify and reward mentoring. National practice examples offered critical recommendations to address multi-generational attitudes and faculty diversity in terms of gender, race, and culture. Conclusion: Mentoring strategies can be identified to serve a diverse faculty in academic medicine. Interventions to improve mentoring practices should be targeted at the level of the institution, department, and individual faculty members. It is imperative to adopt results such as these to design effective mentoring programs to enhance the success of emergency medicine faculty seeking robust academic careers. Background: Women comprise half of the talent pool from which the specialty of emergency medicine draws future leaders, researchers, and educators and yet only 5% of full professors in US emergency medicine are female. Both research and interventions are aimed at reducing the gender gap, however, it will take decades for the benefits to be realized which creates a methodological challenge in assessing system's change. Current techniques to measure disparities are insensitive to systems change as they are limited to percentages and trends over time.",

Methods: RRI is a method of analysis that assesses the percent of sub-populations in each stage relative to their representation in the stage directly prior. Thus, there is a better notion of the advancement given the availability to advance. RRI also standardizes data for ease of interpretation. This study was conducted on the total population of academic professors in all departments at Yale School of Medicine during the academic year of 2010-2011. Data were obtained from the Yale University Provost's office. Results: N = 1305. There were a total of 402 full, 429 associate, and 484 assistant professors. Males comprised 78%, 59%, and 54% respectively. RRI for the Department of Emergency Medicine (DEM) is 0.67, 1.93, and 0.78, for Full, Associate, and Assistant Professors, respectively while the percentages were 44%, 60%, and 33% respectively. Conclusion: Relying solely on percentages masks improvements to the system. Women are most represented at the associate professor level in DEM, highlighting the importance of systems change evidence. Specifically, twice as many women are promoted to associate professor rank given the number who exists as assistant professors. Within 5 years, the DEM should have an equal system as the numbers of associate professors have dramatically increased and will be eligible to promote to full professor. Additionally, DEM has a better record of retaining and promoting women than other Yale Departments of Medicine at both associate and full professor ranks.

We grouped each ED visit according to the unique hospital-based ED identifier, thus creating a payer mix for each ED. We define a ''Safety Net ED'' as any ED where the payer mix satisfied any one of the following three conditions: 1) >30% of all ED visits are Medicaid patients; 2) >30% of all ED visits are self-pay patients; or 3) >40% of all ED visits are either Medicaid or self-pay patients. NEDS tags each ED with a hospital-based variable to delineate metropolitan/non-metropolitan locations and academic affiliation. We chose to examine a subpopulation of EDs tagged as either academic metropolitan or non-academic metropolitan, because the teaching status of non-metropolitan hospitals was not provided. We then measured the proportion of EDs that met safety net criteria by academic status and region. Results: We examined 2,821, 2,793, and 2,844 weighted metro EDs in years 2006-2008, respectively. Table 1 presents safety net proportions. The proportions of academic safety net EDs increased across the study period. Widespread regional variability in safety net proportions existed across all years. The proportions of safety net EDs were highest in the South and lowest in the Northeast and Midwest.

Despite broad CDC screening recommendations, many youth do not receive testing when indicated. The pediatric emergency department (PED) is a venue with a high volume of patients potentially in need of STI testing, but assessing risk in the PED is difficult given constraints on time and privacy. We hypothesized that patients visiting a PED would find an Audio-enhanced Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) program to establish STI risk easy to use, and would report a preference for the ACASI over other methods of disclosing this information. Objectives: To assess acceptability, ease of use, and comfort level of an ACASI designed to assess adolescents' risk for STIs in the PED. Methods: We developed a branch-logic questionnaire and ACASI system to determine whether patients aged 15-21 visiting the PED need STI testing, regardless of chief complaint. We obtained consent from participants and guardians. Patients completed the ACASI in private on a laptop. They read a one-page computer introduction describing study details and completed the ACASI. Patients rated use of the ACASI upon completion using five-point Likert scales. Results: 2030 eligible patients visited the PED during the study period. We approached 873 (43%) and enrolled and analyzed data for 460/873 (53%). The median time to read the introduction and complete the ACASI was 8.2 minutes (interquartile range 6.4-11.5 minutes). 90.7% of patients rated the ACASI ''very easy'' or ''easy'' to use, 90.6% rated the wording as ''very easy'' or ''easy'' to understand, 60% rated the ACASI ''very short'' or ''short'', 60.3% rated the audio as ''very helpful'' or ''helpful,'' 82.9% were ''very comfortable'' or ''comfortable'' with the system confidentiality, and 71.2% said they would prefer a computer interface over in-person interviews or written surveys for collection of this type of information. Conclusion: Patients rated the computer interface of the ACASI as easy and comfortable to use. A median of 8.2 minutes was needed to obtain meaningful clinical information.

Methods: We conducted a multivariate logistic analysis on a prospectively collected database of airway management from an air and land critical care transport service that provides scene responses and interfacility transport in the Province of Ontario. Background: Motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are one of the most common types of trauma for which people seek ED care. The vast majority of these patients are discharged home after evaluation. Acute psychological distress after trauma causes great suffering and is a known predictor of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development.

The Denver Emergency Department (ED) Trauma Organ Failure (TOF) Score was recently derived and internally validated to predict multiple organ failure in trauma patients. The relationship between the Denver TOF Score and mortality has not been assessed or compared to other conventional measures of mortality in trauma. Objectives: To compare the prognostic accuracies of the Denver ED TOF Score, ED SOFA Score, and ED base excess and lactate for mortality in a large heterogeneous trauma population. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from the Denver Health Trauma Registry, a prospectively collected database. Consecutive adult trauma patients from 2005 through 2008 were included in the study. Data collected included demographics, injury characteristics, prehospital care characteristics, response to injury characteristics, ED diagnostic evaluation and interventions, and in-hospital mortality. The values of the four clinically relevant measures (Denver ED TOF Score, ED SOFA score, ED base excess, and ED lactate) were determined within four hours of patient arrival, and prognostic accuracies for in-hospital mortality for the four measures were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Multiple imputation was used for missing values. Results: Of the 4,355 patients, the median age was 37 (IQR 26-51) years, median injury severity score was 9 (IQR 4-16), and 81% had blunt mechanisms. Thirty-eight percent (1,670 patients) were admitted to the ICU with a median ICU length of stay of 2.5 (IQR 1-8) days, and 3% (138 patients) died.

We retrospectively compared TT for those receiving prehospital cold fluids and those not receiving cold fluids. TT was defined as 34\u00b0C measured via Foley thermistor. Secondary outcomes included mortality, good neurological outcome defined as Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 1 or 2 at discharge, and effects of pre-ROSC cooling. Results: There were 132 patients who were included in this analysis with 80 patients receiving prehospital cold IV fluids and 52 who did not. Initially, 63% of patients were in VF/VT and 36% asystole/PEA. Patients receiving prehospital cooling did not have a significant improvement in TT (256 minutes vs 271 minutes, p = 0.64). Survival to discharge and good neurologic outcome were not associated with prehospital cooling (54% vs 50%, p = 0.67) and CPC of 1 or 2 in 49% vs 44%, (p = 0.61). Initiating cold fluids prior to ROSC showed both a nonsignificant decrease in survival (48% vs 56%, p = 0.35) and increase in poor neurologic outcomes (42% vs 50%, p = 0.39). 77% of patients received \u00a3 1L of cooled IVF prior to hospital arrival. Patients receiving prehospital cold IVF had a longer time from arrest to hospital arrival (44 vs 34 min, p =< 0.001) in addition to a prolonged ROSC to hospital time (20 vs 12 min, p = 0.005). Conclusion: At our urban hospital, patients achieving ROSC following OOHCA did not demonstrate faster TT or outcome improvement with prehospital cooling compared to cooling initiated immediately upon ED arrival. Further research is needed to assess the utility of prehospital cooling.",

Our hypothesis was that both ED physicians and prehospital providers would have poor ability to detect elements of delirium in an unstructured setting. Methods: Prehospital providers and ED physicians completed identical questionnaires regarding their clinical encounter with a convenience sample of elderly (age >65 years) patients who presented via ambulance to two urban, teaching EDs over a three-month period. Respondents noted the presence or absence of (1) an acute change in mental status, (2) inattention, (3) disorganized thinking, and (4) altered level of consciousness (using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale). These four components comprise the operational definition of delirium. A research assistant trained in the CAM-ICU rated each component for the same patients using a standard procedure. We calculated inter-rater reliability (kappa) between prehospital providers, ED physicians, and research assistants for each component. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the association between age and EMS use while controlling for potential confounders. We hypothesized that this association use would persist after controlling for confounders. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted at an academic medical center's ED. An interview-based survey was administered and included questions regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, mode of ED arrival, health care use, and the perceived illness severity. Age was modeled as an ordinal variable (<60, 60-79, and \u2021 80 years). Bivariate analyses were used to identify potential confounders and effect measure modifiers and a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed.

The median age of the sample was 60 years and 52% were female. There was a statistically significant linear trend in the proportion of subjects who arrived via EMS by age (p < 0.0001). Compared to adults aged less than 60 years, the unadjusted odds ratio associating age and EMS use was 1.41 (95% CI: Background: We previously derived a clinical decision rule (CDR) for chest radiography (CXR) in patients with chest pain and possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) consisting of the absence of three predictors: history of congestive heart failure, history of smoking, and abnormalities on lung auscultation. Objectives: To prospectively validate and refine a CDR for CXR in an independent patient population. Methods: We prospectively enrolled patients over 24 years of age with a primary complaint of chest pain and possible ACS from September 2009 to January 2010 at a tertiary care ED with 73,000 annual patient visits. Physicians completed standardized data collection forms before ordering chest radiographs and were thus blinded to CXR findings at the time of data collection. Two investigators, blinded to the predictor variables, independently classified CXRs as ''normal,'' ''abnormal not requiring intervention,'' and ''abnormal requiring intervention'' (e.g, heart failure, infiltrates) based on review of the radiology report and the medical record. Analyses included descriptive statistics, inter-rater reliability assessment (kappa), and recursive partitioning. Results: Of 1159 visits for possible ACS, mean age (SD) was 60.3 (15.6) and 51% were female. Twenty-four percent had a history of acute myocardial infarction, 10% congestive heart failure, and 11% atrial fibrillation. Seventy-one (6.1%, 95% CI 4.9-7.7) patients had a radiographic abnormality requiring intervention. ing the likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) could reduce the need for stress testing or coronary imaging. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (ACAT2) activity has been shown in monkey and murine models to correlate with atherosclerosis. Objectives: To determine if a novel cardiac biomarker consisting of plasma cholesteryl ester levels (CE) typically derived from the activity of ACAT2 is predictive of CAD in a clinical model. Methods: A single center prospective observational cohort design enrolled a convenience sample of subjects from a tertiary care center with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary CT angiography or invasive angiography. Plasma samples were analyzed for CE composition with mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was any CAD determined at angiography. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the relationship between the sum of the plasma concentrations from cholesteryl palmitoleate (16:1) and cholesteryl oleate (18:1) (defined as ACAT2-CE) and the presence of CAD. The added value of ACAT2-CE to the model was analyzed comparing the C-statistics and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Results: The study cohort was comprised of 113 participants enrolled over 24 months with a mean age 49 (\u00b111.7) years, 59% with CAD at angiography. The median plasma concentration of ACAT2-CE was 938 lM (758, 1099) in patients with CAD and 824 lM (683, 998) in patients without CAD (p = 0.03) (Figure) . When considered with age, sex, and the number of conventional CAD risk factors, ACAT2-CE were associated with a 6.5% increased odds of having CAD per 10 lM increase in concentration. The addition of ACAT2-CE significantly improved the C-statistic (0.89 vs 0.95, p = 0.0035) and IDI (0.15, p < 0.001) compared to the reduced model. In the subgroup of low-risk observation unit patients, the CE model had superior discrimination compared to the Diamond Forrester classification (IDI 0.403, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Plasma levels of ACAT2-CE, considered in a clinical model, have strong potential to predict a patient's likelihood of having CAD. In turn, this could reduce the need for cardiac imaging after the exclusion of MI. Further study of ACAT2-CE as biomarkers in patients with suspected ACS is needed. Background: Outpatient studies have demonstrated a correlation between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) on ultrasound and coronary artery disease (CAD). There are no known published studies that investigate the role of CIMT in the ED using cardiac CT or percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) as a gold standard. Objectives: We hypothesized that CIMT can predict cardiovascular events and serve as a noninvasive tool in the ED. Methods: This was a prospective study of adult patients who presented to the ED and required evaluation for chest pain. The study location was an urban ED with a census of 120,000 annual visits and 24-hour cardiac catheterization. Patients who did not have CT or PCI or had carotid surgery were excluded from the study. Ultrasound CIMT measurements of right and left common carotid arteries were taken with a 10MHz linear transducer (Zonare, Mountain View, CA). Anterior, medial, and posterior views of the near and far wall were obtained (12 CIMT scores total). Images were analyzed by Carotid Analyzer 5 (Mailing Imaging Application LLC, Coralville, Iowa). Patients were classified into two groups based on the results from CT or PCI. A subject was classified as having significant CAD if there was over 70% occlusion or multi-vessel disease. Results: Ninety of 102 patients were included in the study; 55.7% were males. Mean age was 56.6 \u00b1 13 years. There were 34 (37.8%) subjects with significant CAD and 56 (62.2%) with non-significant CAD. The mean of all 12 CIMT measurements was significantly higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (0.60 \u00b1 0.20 vs. 0.35 \u00b1 0.23; p < 0.00001). A logistic regression analysis was carried out with significant CAD as the event of interest and the following explanatory variables in the model: Objectives: To determine the diagnostic yield of routine testing in-hospital or following ED discharge among patients presenting to an ED following syncope. Methods: A prospective, observational, cohort study of consecutive ED patients \u202118 years old presenting with syncope was conducted. The four most commonly utilized tests (echocardiography, telemetry, ambulatory electrocardiography monitoring, and cardiac markers) were studied. Interobserver agreement as to whether tests results determined the etiology of the syncope was measured using kappa (k) values. Results: Of 570 patients with syncope, 150 (26%) had echocardiography with 33 (6%) demonstrating a likely etiology of the syncopal event such as critical valvular disease or significantly depressed left ventricular function (k = 0.78). On hospitalization, 349 (61%) patients were placed on telemetry, 19 (3%) of these had worrisome dysrhythmias (k = 0.66). 317 (55%) patients had troponin levels drawn of whom 19 (3%) had positive results (k = 1); 56 (10%) patients were discharged with monitoring with significant findings in only 2 (0.4%) patients (k = 0.65). Overall, 73 (8%, 95% CI 7-10%) studies were diagnostic. Conclusion: Although routine testing is prevalent in ED patients with syncope, the diagnostic yield is relatively low. Nevertheless, some testing, particularly echocardiography, may yield critical findings in some cases. Current efforts to reduce the cost of medical care by eliminating non-diagnostic medical testing and increasing emphasis on practicing evidence-based medicine argue for more discriminate testing when evaluating syncope. (Originally submitted as a ''late-breaker.'') Unusual fatigue was reported by 70.7% (severe 29.7%) and insomnia by 47.8% (severe 21.0%). These findings have led to risk management recommendations to consider these symptoms as predictive of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) among women visiting the ED. Objectives: To document the prevalence of these symptoms among all women visiting an ED. To analyze the potential effect of using these symptoms in the ED diagnostic process for ACS. Methods: A survey on fatigue and insomnia symptoms was administered to a convenience sample of all adult women visiting an urban academic ED (all arrival modes, acuity levels, all complaints). A sensitivity analysis was performed using published data and expert opinion for inputs. Results: We approached 548 women, with 379 enrollments. See table. The top box shows prevalences of prodromal symptoms among all adult female ED patients. The bottom box shows outputs from sensitivity analysis on the diagnostic effect of initiating an ACS workup for all female ED patients reporting prodromal symptoms. Conclusion: Prodromal symptoms of ACS are highly prevalent among all adult women visiting the ED in this study. This likely limits their utility in ED settings. While screening or admitting women with prodromal symptoms in the ED would probably increase sensitivity, that increase would be accompanied by a dramatic reduction in specificity. Such a reduction in specificity would translate to admitting, observing, or working up somewhere between 29% and 61% of all women visiting the ED, which is prohibitive in terms of personal costs, risks of hospitalization, and financial costs. While these symptoms may or may not have utility in other settings such as primary care, their prevalence, and the implied lack of specificity for ACS suggest they will not be clinically useful in the ED.",

Cox proportional hazard modeling was performed to assess the effect of testing modality (stress testing vs. CCTA) on the LOS in the CDU. As CCTA is not available on weekends, only subjects presenting on weekdays were included. Cox models were stratified on time of patient presentation to the ED, based on four hour blocks beginning at midnight. The primary independent variable was first test modality, either stress imaging (exercise echo, dobutamine echo, stress MRI) or CCTA. Age, sex, and race were included as covariates. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using scaled Schoenfield residuals, and the models were graphically examined for outliers and overly influential covariate patterns. Test selection was a time varying covariate in the 8AM strata, and therefore the interaction with ln (LOS) was included as a correction term. After correction for multiple comparisons, an alpha of 0.01 was held to be significant. Results: Over the study period, 841 subjects (of 1,070 in the registry) presented on non-weekend days. The median LOS was 18.5 hours (IQR 12.4-23.3 hours), 57% were white, and 61% were female. The table shows the number of subjects in each time strata, the number tested, and the number undergoing stress testing vs. CCTA. After adjusting all models for age, race, and sex, the hazard ratio (HR) for LOS is as shown. Only those patients presenting between 8AM and noon noted a significant improvement in LOS with CCTA use (p < 0.0001). Objectives: Determine the validity of a managementfocused EM OSCE as a measure of clinical skills by determining the correlation between OSCE scores and faculty assessment of student performance in the ED. Methods: Medical students in a fourth year EM clerkship were enrolled in the study. On the final day of the clerkship students participated in a five-station EM OSCE. Student performance on the OSCE was evaluated using a task-based evaluation system with 3-4 critical management tasks per case. Task performance was evaluated using a three-point system: performed correctly/timely (2), performed incorrectly/late (1), or not performed (0). Descriptive anchors were used for performance criteria. Communication skills were also graded on a three-point scale. Student performance in the ED was based on traditional faculty assessment using our core-competency evaluation instrument. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for the relationship between OSCE score and ED performance score. Case item analysis included determination of difficulty and discrimination. The ACGME also requires that trainees are evaluated on these 6CCs during their residency. Trainee evaluation in the 6CCs are frequently on a subjective rating scale. One of the recognized problems with a subjective scale is the rating stringency of the rater, commonly known as the Hawk-Dove effect. This has been seen in Standardized Clinical Exam scoring. Recent data have shown that score variance can be related to evaluator performance with a negative correlation. Higher-scoring physicians were more likely to be a stringent or Hawk type rater on the same evaluation. It is unclear if this pattern also occurs in the subjective ratings that are commonly used in assessments of the 6CCs. Objectives: Comparison of attending physician scores on the ACGME 6CCs with attending ratings of residents for a negative correlation or Hawk-Dove effect. Methods: Residents are routinely evaluated on the 6CCs with a 1-9 numerical rating scale as part of their training. The evaluation database was retrospectively reviewed. Residents anonymously scored attending physicians on the 6CCs with a cross-sectional survey that utilized the same rating scale, anchors, and prompts as the resident evaluations. Average scores for and by each attending were calculated and a Pearson Correlation calculated by core competency and overall.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Hawk-Dove effects can be seen in some scoring systems and has the potential to affect trainee evaluation on the ACGME core competencies. However, a negative correlation to support a Hawk-Dove scoring pattern was not found in EM resident evaluations by attending physicians. This study is limited by being a single center study and utilizing grouped data to preserve resident anonymity. Background: All ACGME-accredited residency programs are required to provide competency-based education and evaluation. Graduating residents must demonstrate competency in six key areas. Multiple studies have outlined strategies for evaluating competency, but data regarding residents' self-assessments of these competencies as they progress through training and beyond is scarce. Objectives: Using data from longitudinal surveys by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate if resident self-assessments of performance in required competencies improve over the course of graduate medical training and in the years following. Additionally, resident self-assessment of competency in academic medicine was also analyzed. Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of data gathered from two rounds of the ABEM Longitudinal Study of Emergency Medicine Residents (1996-98 and 2001-03) and three rounds of the ABEM Longitudinal Study of Emergency Physicians (1999, 2004, 2009 ). In both surveys, physicians were asked to rate a list of 18 items in response to the question, ''What is your current level of competence in each of the following aspects of work in EM?'' The rated items were grouped according to the ACGME required competencies of Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, Practice-based Learning and Improvement, Interpersonal and Communication Skills, and System-based Practice. An additional category for academic medicine was also added. Results: Rankings improved in all categories during residency training. Rankings in three of the six categories improved from the weak end of the scale to the strong end of the scale. There is a consistent decline in rankings one year after graduation from residency. The greatest drop is in Medical Knowledge. Mean self-ranking in academic medicine competency is uniformly the lowest ranked category for each year. Conclusion: While self-assessment is of uncertain value as an objective assessment, these increasing rankings suggest that emergency medicine residency programs are successful at improving residents' confidence in the required areas. Residents do not feel as confident about academic medicine as they do about the ACGME required competencies. The uniform decline in rankings the first year after residency is an area worthy of further inquiry.",

This consisted of reviewing board scores and requiring a letter of intent. Students from our home institution were not screened. All end-of-shift evaluation cards and final rotation grades (honors, high pass, pass, fail) from 2004 to 2011 were analyzed. We identified two cohorts: home students (control) and visiting students. We compared pre-intervention (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) and postintervention (2008-2011) scores and grades. End of shift performance scores are recorded using a fivepoint scale that assesses indicators such as fund of knowledge, judgment, and follow-through to disposition. Mean ranks were compared and P-values were calculated using the Armitage test of trend and confirmed using t-tests. Results: We identified 162 visiting students (91 pre, 81 post) and 160 home students (90 pre, 80 post). 12 (13.2%) visiting students achieved honors pre-intervention while 31 (38.3%) achieved honors post-intervention (p = 0.000093). No significant difference was seen in home student grades: 28 (31.1%) received honors pre-2008 and 17 (21.3%) received honors post-2008 Conclusion: We found that implementation of a screening process for visiting medical students improved overall rotation scores and grades as compared to home students who did not receive screening. Screening rotating students may improve the overall quality of applicants and thereby the residency program.

Students in the video group were found to be 2.45 times more likely to have a neutral or favorable feeling of suturing confidence before the workshop (p = 0.067, CI 0.94-6.4) using a proportional odds model. No association was detected between group assignment and level of suturing confidence after the workshop (p = 0.475). There was also no association detected between group assignment and opinion of the suturing workshop (p = 0.681) using a logistic regression odds model. Among those students who indicated a lack of confidence before training, there was no detected association (p = 0.967) between group assignment and having an improved confidence using a logistic regression odds model. Conclusion: Students in the video group and students in the control group achieved similar levels of suturing skill and confidence, and equal belief in the workshop's effectiveness. This study suggests that video instruction could be a reasonable substitute for lectures in procedural education. Background: Accurate interpretation of the ECG in the emergency department is not only clinically important but also critical to assess medical knowledge competency. With limitations to expansion of formal didactics, educational technology offers an innovative approach to improve the quality of medical education.",

One cardiologist and two ED attending physicians independently validated a standardized exam of ten ECGs: four were normal ECGs, three were classic STEMIs, and three were subtle STEMIs. The gold standard for diagnosis was confirmed acute coronary thrombus during cardiac catheterization. After evaluating the 10 ECGs, students completed a pre-intervention test wherein they were asked to identify patients who required emergent cardiac catheterization based on the presence or absence of ST segment elevation on ECG. Students then completed an online interactive multimedia module containing 13 minutes of STEMI training based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on STEMI. Medical students were asked to complete a post-test of the 10 ECGs after watching online multimedia. Objectives: Our objective was to quantify the number of pre-verbal pediatric head CTs performed at our community hospital that could have been avoided by utilizing the PECARN criteria. Methods: We conducted a standardized chart review of all children under the age of 2 who presented to our community hospital and received a head CT between Jan 1st, 2010 and Dec 31st, 2010. Following recommended guidelines for conducting a chart review, we: 1) utilized four blinded chart reviewers, 2) provided specific training, 3) created a standardized data extraction tool, and 4) held periodic meetings to evaluate coding discrepancies. Our primary outcome measure was the number of patients who were PECARN negative and received a head CT at our institution. Our secondary outcome was to reevaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the PECARN criteria to detect ciTBI in our cohort.

No parent was able to classify all symptoms listed as correctly related or not related to concussion. However, identification of correct concussion definitions correlated with identification of correct symptoms (0.25; p < 0.05). Conclusion: While most parents had received some education regarding concussion from a health care provider, important misconceptions remain among parents of young athletes regarding the definition, symptoms, and treatment of concussion. This study highlights the need for health care providers to increase educational efforts among parents of young athletes in regard to concussion. Figure 1 ). 2/2 (100%) of patients with baseline liver dysfunction were 25(OH)D deficient and 5/6 (83%) of deaths were patients who had insufficient levels of 25(OH)D. There was an inverse association between 25(OH)D level and TNF-a (p = 0.03; Figure  2 ) and IL-6 (p = 0.04). Background: Fever is common in the emergency department (ED), and 90% of those diagnosed with severe sepsis present with fever. Despite data suggesting that fever plays an important role in immunity, human data conflict on the effect of antipyretics on clinical outcomes in critically ill adults. Objectives: To determine the effect of ED antipyretic administration on 28-day in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis. Methods: Single-center, retrospective observational cohort study of 171 febrile severe sepsis patients presenting to an urban academic 90,000-visit ED between June 2005 and June 2010. All ED patients meeting the following criteria were included: age \u2021 18, temperature \u2021 38.3\u00b0C, suspected infection, and either systolic blood pressure \u00a3 90 mmHg after a 30 mL/kg fluid bolus or lactate of \u2021 4. Patients were excluded for a history of cirrhosis or acetaminophen allergy. Antipyretics were defined as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or ketorolac. Results: One hundred-thirty five (78.9%) patients were treated with an antipyretic medication (89.4% acetaminophen). Intubated patients were less likely to receive antipyretic therapy (51.9% vs. 84.0%, p < 0.01), but the groups were otherwise well matched. Patients requiring ED intubation (n = 27) had much higher in-hospital mortality (51.9% vs. 7.6%, p < 0.01). Patients given an antipyretic in the ED had lower mortality (11.9% vs. 25.0%, p < 0.05). When multivariable logistic regression was used to account for APACHE-II, intubation status, and fever magnitude, antipyretic therapy was not associated with mortality (adjusted OR 0.97, 0.31-3.06, p = 0.96). Conclusion: Although patients treated with antipyretic therapy had lower 28-day in-hospital mortality, antipyretic therapy was not independently associated with mortality in multivariable regression analysis.

Fasting asymptomatic subjects had a wide inter-subject variation in both baseline IVC-US measurements and fluid-related changes. The wide differences within our 30 ml/kg group may limit conclusions regarding proportionality. There were significant differences in performance on ED measures by ownership (P < 0.0001) and region (P = 0.0002). Scores on ED process measures were highest at for-profit hospitals (27% above average) and hospitals in the south (5% above average), and lowest at public hospitals (16% below average) and hospitals in the northeast (8% below average). Conclusion: There was considerable variation in performance on the ED measures included in the VBP program by hospital ownership and region. ED directors may come under increasing pressure to improve scores in order to reduce potential financial losses under the program.

The most variability was more than 3-fold and found among patients undergoing colectomy in which the worst-performing hospitals saw 24.1% of their patients experienced an ED visit within 30 days while the best-performing hospitals saw 7.4%. Average total payments for the 30-day window from initial discharge across all surgical cohorts varied from $18,912 for patients discharged without subsequent ED visit; $20,061for those experiencing an ED visit(s); $38,762 for those readmitted through the ED; and $33,632 for those readmitted from another source. If all patients who did not require readmission also did not incur an ED visit within the 30-day window, this would represent a potential cost savings of $125 million. Conclusion: Among elderly Medicare recipients there was significant variability between hospitals for 30-day ED visits after six common inpatient procedures. The ED visit may be a marker of poor care coordination in the immediate discharge period. This presents an opportunity to improve post-procedure outpatient care coordination which may save costs related to preventable ED visits and subsequent readmissions. Objectives: We sought to assess the effect of pharmacist medication review on ED patient care, in particular time from physician order to medication administration for the patient (order-to-med time). Methods: We conducted a multi-center, before-after study in two EDs (urban academic teaching hospital and suburban community hospital, combined census of 61,000) after implementation of the electronic prospective pharmacy review system (PRS). The system allowed a pharmacist to review all ED medication orders electronically at the time of physician order and either approve or alter the order. We studied a 5-month time period before implementation of the system (pre-PRS, 7/1/10-11/30/11) and after implementation (post-PRS, 7/ 1/11-11/30/11). We collected data on all ED medication orders including dose, route, class, pharmacist review action, time of physician order, and time of medication administration. Differences in order-to-medication between the pre-and post-PRS study periods were compared using a Results: ED metrics that were significantly associated with LBTCs varied across ED patient-volume categories (Table) . For EDs seeing less than 20K patients annually, the percentage of EMS arrivals admitted to the hospital and ED square footage were both weakly associated with LBTCs (p = 0.09). For EDs seeing at least 20K-39K patients, median ED length of stay (LOS), percent of patients admitted to hospital through the ED, percent of EMS arrivals admitted to hospital, and percent of pediatric patients were all positively associated, while percent of patients admitted to the hospital was negatively associated with LBTCs.

Objectives: Our study sought to compare bacterial growth of samples taken from surfaces after use of a common approved QUAT compound and a virtually non-toxic, commercially available solution containing elemental silver (0.02%), hydrogen peroxide (15%), and peroxyacetic acid (20%) (SHP) in a working ED. We hypothesized that, based on controlled laboratory data available, SHP compound would be more effective on surfaces in an active urban ED. Methods: We cleaned and then sampled three types of surfaces in the ED (suture cart, wooden railing, and the floor) during midday hours one minute after application of tap water, QUAT, and SHP and then again at 24 hours without additional cleaning. Conventional environmental surface surveillance RODAC media plates were used for growth assessment. Images of bacterial growth were quantified at 24 and 48 hours.

Conclusion: SHP outperforms QUAT in sterilizing surfaces after one minute application. SHP may be a superior agent as a non-toxic, non-corrosive, and effective agent for surfaces in the demanding ED setting. Further studies should examine sporidical and virucidal properties in a similar environment. Objectives: Evaluate the effect on patient satisfaction of increasing waiting room times and physician evaluation times. Methods: Emergency department flow metrics were collected on a daily basis as well as average daily patient satisfaction scores.

The total satisfaction with the visit as well as satisfaction with the provider dropped when the evaluation extended over 110 minutes, but was not statistically significant on ANOVA analysis (see table 2 for means). Conclusion: Once a patient's time in the waiting room extends beyond 15 minutes, you have lost a significant opportunity for patient satisfaction; once they have been in the waiting room for over 120 minutes, you are also much more likely to receive a poor score. Physician evaluation time scores are much more consistent but as longer evaluation times occurred beyond total of 110 minutes we started to see a trend downward in the satisfaction score. Results: In all three EDs, pain medication rates (both in ED and Rx) varied significantly by clinical factors including location of pain, discharge diagnosis, pain level, and acuity. We observed little to no variation in pain medication rates by patient factors such as age, sex, race, insurance, or prior ED visits. The table displays key pain management practices by site and provider. After adjusting for patient and clinical characteristics, significant differences in pain medication rates remained by provider and site (see figure) . Conclusion: Within this health system, the approach to pain management by both providers and sites is not standardized.

Background: Procedural competency is a key component of emergency medicine residency training. Residents are required to log procedures to document quantity of procedures and identify potential weaknesses in their training. As emergency medicine evolves, it is likely that the type and number of procedures change over time. Also, exposure to certain rare procedures in residency is not guaranteed. Objectives: We seek to delineate trends in type and volume of core EM procedures over a decade of emergency medicine residents graduating from an accredited four-year training program. Methods: Deidentified procedure logs from 2003-2011 were analyzed to assess trends in type and quantity of procedures. Procedure logs were self-reported by individual residents on a continuous basis during training onto a computer program. Average numbers of procedures per resident in each graduating class were noted. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and includes a simple linear regression to evaluate for significant changes in number of procedures over time and an independent samples two-tailed t-test of procedures performed before and after the required resident duty hours change.",

Certain procedures in our emergency medicine training program have remained stable but uncommon over the course of nearly a decade. To ensure competency in uncommon procedures, innovative ways to expose residents to these potentially life saving skills must be considered. These may include practice on high-fidelity simulators, increased exposure to procedures on patients during residency (possibly on off-service rotations), or practice in cadaver and animal labs. Objectives: To study the effectiveness of a unique educational intervention using didactic and hands-on training in USGPIV. We hypothesized that senior medical students would improve performance and confidence with USGPIV after the simulation training. Methods: Fourth year medical students were enrolled in an experimental, prospective, before and after study conducted at a university medical school simulation center. Baseline skills in participant's USGPIV on simulation vascular phantoms were graded by ultrasound expert faculty using standardized checklists. The primary outcome was time to cannulation, and secondary outcomes were ability to successfully cannulate, number of needle attempts, and needle-tip visualization. Subjects then observed a 15-minute presentation on correct performance of USGPIV followed by a 30-minute hands-on practical session using the vascular simulators with a 1:4 to 1:6 ultrasound instructor to student ratio. An expert blinded to the participant's initial performance graded post-educational intervention USGPIV ability. Pre-and post-intervention surveys were obtained to evaluate USGPIV confidence, previous experience with ultrasound, peripheral IV access, USG-PIV, and satisfaction with the educational format. Objectives: This study examines the grade distribution of resident evaluations when the identity of the evaluator was anonymous as compared to when the identity of the evaluator was known to the resident. We hypothesize that there will be no change in the grades assigned to residents. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all faculty evaluations of residents and grades assigned from July 1, 2008 through November 15, 2011. Prior to July 1, 2010 the identity of the faculty evaluators was anonymous, while after this date, the identity of the faculty evaluators was made known to the residents. Throughout this time period, residents were graded on a five-point scale. Each resident evaluation included grades in the six ACGME core competencies as well as in select other abilities. Specific abilities evaluated varied over the dates analyzed. Evaluations of residents were assigned to two groups, based on whether the evaluator was anonymous or made known to the resident.

However, retention by adult learners is limited when presented material in a lecture format. More effective methods such as small group sessions, simulation, and other active learning modalities are time-and resource-intensive and therefore not practical as a primary method of instruction. Thus, the traditional lecture format remains heavily relied upon. Efficient strategies to improve the effectiveness of lectures are needed. Testing utilized as a learning tool to force immediate recall of lecture material is an example of such a strategy. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of immediate postlecture short answer quizzes on EM residents' retention of lecture content. Methods: In this prospective randomized controlled study, EM residents from a community based 3-year training program were randomized into two groups. Block randomization provided a similar distribution of postgraduate year training levels and performance on both US-MLE and in-training examinations between the two groups. Each group received two identical 50-minute lectures on ECG interpretation and aortic disease. One group of residents completed a five-question short answer quiz immediately following each lecture (n = 13), while the other group received the lectures without subsequent quizzes (n = 16). The quizzes were not scored or reviewed with the residents. Two weeks later, retention was assessed by testing both groups with a 20-question multiple choice test (MCT) derived in equal part from each lecture. Mean and median test results were then compared between groups. Statistical significance was determined using a paired t-test of median test scores from each group. Results: Residents who received immediate post-lecture quizzes demonstrated significantly higher MCT scores (mean = 57%, median 58%, n = 10) compared to those receiving lectures alone (mean = 48%, median = 50%, n = 15); p = 0.023.",

It is an effective learning technique that offers several advantages to both the educator and student. Background: Critical access hospitals (CAH) provide crucial emergency care to rural populations that would otherwise be without ready access to health care. Data show that many CAH do not meet standard adult quality metrics. Adults treated at CAH often have inferior outcomes to comparable patients cared for at other community-based emergency departments (EDs). Similar data do not exist for pediatric patients. Objectives: As part of a pilot project to improve pediatric emergency care at CAH, we sought to determine whether these institutions stock the equipment and medications necessary to treat any ill or injured child who presents to the ED. Methods: Five North Carolina CAH volunteered to participate in an intensive educational program targeting pediatric emergency care. At the initial site visit to each hospital, an investigator, in conjunction with the ED nurse manager, completed a 109-item checklist of commonly required ED equipment and medications based on the 2009 ACEP ''Guidelines for Care of Children in the Emergency Department''. The list was categorized into monitoring and respiratory equipment, vascular access supplies, fracture and trauma management devices, and specialized kits. If available, adult and pediatric sizes were listed. Only hospitals stocking appropriate pediatric sizes of an item were counted as having that item. The pharmaceutical supply list included antibiotics, antidotes, antiemetics, antiepileptics, intubation and respiratory medications, IV fluids, and miscellaneous drugs not otherwise categorized. Results: Overall, the hospitals reported having 91% of the items listed (range 87-96%). The two greatest deficiencies were fracture devices (range 33-66%), with no hospital stocking infant-sized cervical collars, and antidotes, with no hospital stocking Pralidoxime, 1/5 hospitals stocking Fomepizole, and 2/5 hospitals stocking pyridoxine and methylene blue. Only one of the five institutions had access to Prostaglandin E. The hospitals stated cost and rarity of use as the reason for not stocking these medications. Conclusion: The ability of CAH to care for pediatric patients does not appear to be hampered by a lack of equipment. Ready access to infrequently used, but potentially lifesaving, medications is a concern. Tertiary care centers preparing to accept these patients should be aware of these potential limitations as transport decisions are made. Background: While incision and drainage (I&D) alone has been the mainstay of management of uncomplicated abscesses for decades, some advocate for adjunct antibiotic use, arguing that available trials are underpowered and that antibiotics reduce treatment failures and recurrence. Objectives: To investigate the role of antibiotics in addition to I&D in reducing treatment failure as compared to management with I&D alone. Methods: We performed a search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar databases (with a medical librarian) to include trials and observational studies analyzing the effect of antibiotics in human subjects with skin and soft-tissue abscesses. Two investigators independently reviewed all the records. We performed three overlapping meta-analy-ses: 1. Only randomized trials comparing antibiotics to placebo on improvement of the abscess during standard follow-up. 2. Trials and observational studies comparing appropriate antibiotics to placebo, no antibiotics, or inappropriate antibiotics (as gauged by wound culture) on improvement during standard follow-up. 3. Only trials, but broadened outcome to include recurrence or new lesions during a longer follow-up period as treatment failure. We report pooled risk ratios (RR) using a fixed-effects model for our point estimates with Shore-adjusted 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: We screened 1,937 records, of which 12 studies fit inclusion criteria, 9 of which were meta-analyzed (5 trials, 4 observational studies) because they reported results that could be pooled. Of the 9 studies, 5 enrolled subjects from the ED, 2 from a soft-tissue infection clinic, and 2 from a general hospital without definition of enrollment site. Five studies enrolled primarily adults, 3 pediatrics, and 1 without specification of ages. After pooling results for all randomized trials only, the RR = 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97-1.08). Exposure being ''appropriate'' antibiotics (using trials and observational studies) resulted in a pooled RR = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.98-1.03). When we broadened our treatment failure criteria to include recurrence or new lesions at longer lengths of follow-up (trials only), we noted a RR = 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97-1.15). Conclusion: Based on available literature pooled for this analysis, there is no evidence to suggest any benefit from antibiotics in addition to I&D in the treatment of skin and soft tissue abscesses.

Background: While early cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) could be more effective to manage emergency department (ED) patients with acute chest pain and intermediate (>4%) risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than current management strategies, it also could result in increased testing, cost, and radiation exposure. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to determine whether incorporation of CCTA early in the ED evaluation process leads to more efficient management and earlier discharge than usual care in patients with acute chest pain at intermediate risk for ACS. Methods: Randomized comparative effectiveness trial enrolling patients between 40-75 years of age without known CAD, presenting to the ED with chest pain but without ischemic ECG changes or elevated initial troponin and require further risk stratification for decision making, at nine US sites. Patients are being randomized to either CCTA as the first diagnostic test or to usual care, which could include no testing or functional testing such as exercise ECG, stress SPECT, and stress echo following serial biomarkers. Test results were provided to physicians but management in neither arm was driven by a study protocol. Data on time, diagnostic testing, and cost of index hospitalization, and the following 28 days are being collected. The primary endpoint is length of hospital stay (LOS). The trial is powered to allow for detection of a difference in LOS of 10.1 hours between competing strategies with 95% power assuming that 70% of projected LOS values are true. Secondary endpoints are cumulative radiation exposure, and cost of competing strategies. Tertiary endpoints are institutional, caregiver, and patient characteristics associated with primary and secondary outcomes. Rate of missed ACS within 28 days is the safety endpoint. Results: As of November 21st, 2011, 880 of 1000 patients have been enrolled (mean age: 54 \u00b1 8, 46.5% female, ACS rate 7.55%). The anticipated completion of the last patient visit is 02/28/12 and the database will be locked in early March 2012. We will present the results of the primary, secondary, and some tertiary endpoints for the entire cohort.

The odds of a positive test were significantly lower among providers less than 10 years out of residency graduation (OR 0.80, CI 0.68-0.95) after controlling for provider sex, type of residency training, D-dimer use, and total number of scans ordered. Conclusion: We found significant provider variability in diagnostic yield for PE and use of D-dimer in this study population, with 25% of providers having diagnostic yield less than or equal to 3.8%. Providers who were more recently graduated from residency appear to have a lower diagnostic yield, suggesting a more conservative approach in this group. Background: The literature reports that anticoagulation increases the risk of mortality in patients presenting to emergency departments (ED) with head trauma (HT). It has been suggested that such patients should be treated in a protocolized fashion, including CT within 15 minutes, and anticipatory preparation of FFP before CT results are available. There are significant logistical and financial implications associated with implementation of such a protocol. Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine the effect of anticoagulant therapy on the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in elderly patients presenting to our urban community hospital following bunt head injury.",

Median time to antibiotics and median volume of fluid resuscitation differed significantly between recognized and unrecognized septic patients (p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively). Conclusion: Emergency physicians correctly identify and treat infection in most cases, but frequently do not document SIRS and sepsis. Lack of documentation of sepsis in the differential diagnosis is associated with increased time to antibiotic delivery and a smaller total volume of fluid administration, which may explain poor sepsis bundle compliance in the emergency department. Background: Severe sepsis is a common clinical syndrome with substantial human and financial impact. In 1992 the first consensus definition of sepsis was published. Subsequent epidemiologic estimates were collected using administrative data, but ongoing discrepancies in the definition of severe sepsis led to large differences in estimates. Objectives: We seek to describe the variations in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis in the US using four methods of database abstraction. Methods: Using a nationally representative sample, four previously published methods (Angus, Martin, Dombrovskiy, Wang) were used to gather cases of severe sepsis over a 6-year period (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . In addition, the use of new ICD-9 sepsis codes was compared to previous methods. Our main outcome measure was annual national incidence and in-hospital mortality of severe sepsis. Results: The average annual incidence varied by as much as 3.5 fold depending on method used and ranged from 894,013 (300 / 100,000 population) to 3,110,630 (1,031 / 100,000) using the methods of Dombrovskiy and Wang, respectively. Average annual increase in the incidence of severe sepsis was similar (13.0-13.3%) across all methods. Total mortality mirrored the increase in incidence over the 6-year period ( Background: Radiation exposure from medical imaging has been the subject of many major journal articles, as well as the topic of mainstream media. Some estimate that one-third of all CT scans are not medically justified. It is important for practitioners ordering these scans to be knowledgeable of currently discussed risks. Objectives: To compare the knowledge, opinions, and practice patterns of three groups of providers in regards to CTs in the ED.",

In comparison to IM, EM respondents correctly equated one abdominal CT to between 100 and 500 chest x-rays, reported receiving formal training regarding the risks of radiation from CTs, believe that excessive medical imaging is associated with an increased lifetime risk of cancer, and routinely discuss the risks of CT imaging with stable patients more often (see Table 1 ). Particular patient factors influence whether radiation risks are discussed with patients by 60% in each specialty (see Table 2 ). Before ordering an abdominal CT in a stable patient, IM providers routinely review the patient's medical imaging history less often than EM providers surveyed. Overall, 67% of respondents felt that ordering an abdominal CT in a stable ED patient is a clinical decision that should be discussed with the patient, but should not require consent. Conclusion: Compared with IM, EM practitioners report greater awareness of the risks of radiation from CTs and discuss risks with patients more often. They also review patients' imaging history more often and take this, as well as patients' age, into account when ordering CTs. These results indicate a need for improved education for both EM and IM providers in regards to the risks of radiation from CT imaging. Background: In Nebraska, 80% of emergency departments have annual visits less than 10,000, and the predominance are in rural settings. General practitioners working in rural emergency departments have reported low confidence in several emergency medicine skills.

Background: Use of automated external defibrillators (AED) improves survival in out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (OHCA). Since 2005, the American Heart Association has recommended that individuals one year of age or older who sustain OHCA have an AED applied. Little is known about how often this occurs and what factors are associated with AED use in the pediatric population. Objectives: Our objective was to describe AED use in the pediatric population and to assess predictors of AED use when compared to adult patients. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of prospectively collected data from 29 U.S. cities that participate in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). Patients were included if they had a documented resuscitation attempt from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009 and were \u20211 year old. Patients were considered pediatric if they were less than 19 years old. AED use included application by laypersons and first responders. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the associations between age and AED use. Results: There were 19,559 OHCAs included in this analysis, of which 239 (1.2%) occurred in pediatric patients. Overall AED use in the final sample was 5,517, with 1,751 (8.9%) total survivors. AEDs were applied less often in pediatric patients (19.7%, 95% CI: 14.6%-24.7% vs 28.3%, 95% CI: 27.7%-29.0%). Within the pediatric population, only 35.4% of patients with a shockable rhythm had an AED used. In all pediatric patients, regardless of presenting rhythm, AED use demonstrated a statistically significant increase in return of spontaneous circulation (AED used 29.8%, 95% CI: 16.2-43.4 vs AED not used 16.8%, 95% CI: 11.4-22.1, p < 0.05), although there was no significant increase in survival to hospital discharge (AED used 12.8%; AED not used 5.2%; p = 0.057). In the adjusted model, pediatric age was independently associated with failure to use an AED (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.87) as was female sex (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.95). Patients who had a public arrest (OR 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24-1.46) or one that was witnessed by a bystander (OR 1.20. 95%: CI 1.11-1.29) were also predictive of AED use. Conclusion: Pediatric patients who experience OHCA are less likely to have an AED used. Continued education of first responders and the lay public to increase AED use in this population is necessary.",

Ken Will, Michael Nelson, Abishek Vedavalli, Renaud Gueret, John Bailitz Cook County (Stroger), Chicago, IL Background: The American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends therapeutic hypothermia (TH) for out of hospital comatose survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (CSSCA) with an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation (VF). Based on currently limited data, the AHA further recommends that physicians consider TH for CSSCA, from both the out and inpatient settings, with an initial non-VF rhythm. Objectives: Investigate whether a TH protocol improves both survival and neurologic outcomes for CSSCA, for out and inpatients, with any initial rhythm, in comparison to outcomes previously reported in literature prior to TH. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of CSSCA between August 2009 and May 2011 whose care included TH. The study enrolled eligible consecutive CSSCA survivors, from both out and inpatient settings with any initial arrest rhythm. Primary endpoints included survival to hospital discharge and neurologic outcomes, stratified by SCA location, and by initial arrest rhythm. Results: Overall, of 27 eligible patients, 11 (41%, 95% CI 22-66%) survived to discharge, 7 (26%, 95% CI 9-43%) with at least a good neurologic outcome. Twelve were out and 15 were inpatients. Among the 12 outpatients, 6 (50%, 95% CI 22-78%) survived to discharge, 5 (41%, 95% CI 13-69%) with at least a good neurologic outcome. Among the 15 inpatients, 5 (33%, 95% CI 9-57) survived to discharge, 2 (13%, 95% CI 0-30%) with at least a good neurologic outcome. By initial rhythm, 6 patients had an initial rhythm of VF/T and 21 non-VF/T. Among the 6 patients with an initial rhythm of VF/T, 4 (67%, CI 39-100%) survived to discharge, all 4 with at least a good outcome, including 3 out and 1 inpatients. Among the 21 patients with an initial rhythm of non-VF/T, 7 (33%, CI 22-53%) survived to discharge, 3 (14%, CI 0-28%) with at least a good neurologic outcome, including 2 out and 1 inpatients. Conclusion: Our preliminary data initially suggest that local implementation of a TH protocol improves survival and neurologic outcomes for CSSCA, for out and inpatients, with any initial rhythm, in comparison to outcomes previously reported in literature prior to TH. Subsequent research will include comparison to local historical controls, additional data from other regional TH centers, as well as comparison of different cooling methods.",

            "text": "Protocolized Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has been shown to improve the neurologic recovery of cardiac arrest patients who experience return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). It remains unclear as to how earlier cooling and treatment optimization influence outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a protocolized use of early sedation and paralysis on cooling optimization and clinical outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. Methods: A 3-year (2008-2010), pre-post intervention study of patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest treated with TH was performed. Those patients treated with a standardized order set which lacked a uniform sedation and paralytic order were included in the pre-intervention group, and those with a standardized order set which included a uniform sedation and paralytic order were included in the post-intervention group. Patient demographics, initial and discharge Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, resuscitation details, cooling time variables, severity of illness as measured by the APACHE II score, discharge disposition, functional status, and days to death were collected and analyzed using Student's t-tests, Man-Whitney U tests, and the Log-Rank test. Results: 232 patients treated with TH after ROSC were included, with 107 patients in the pre-intervention group and 125 in the post-intervention group. The average time to goal temperature (33\u00b0C) was 227 minutes (pre-intervention) and 168 minutes (post-intervention) (p = 0.001). A 2-hour time target was achieved in 38.6% of the patients (post-intervention) compared to 24.5% in the pre-group (p = 0.029). Twenty-eight day mortality was similar between groups (65.4% and 65.3%) though hospital length of stay (10 days pre-and 8 days post-intervention) and discharge GCS (13 preand 14-post-intervention) differed between cohorts. More post-intervention patients were discharged to home (55.8%) compared to 43.2% in the pre-intervention group. Conclusion: Protocolized use of sedation and paralysis improved time to goal temperature achievement. These improved TH time targets were associated with improved neuroprotection, GCS recovery, and disposition outcome. Standardized sedation and paralysis appears to be a useful adjunct in induced TH. Background: CT is increasingly used to assess children with signs and symptoms of acute appendicitis (AA) though concerns regarding long-term risk of exposure to ionizing radiation have generated interest in methods to identify children at low risk. Objectives: We sought to derive a clinical decision rule (CDR) of a minimum set of commonly used signs and symptoms from prior studies to predict which children with acute abdominal pain have a low likelihood of AA and compared it to physician clinical impression (PCI). Methods: We prospectively analyzed 420 subjects aged 2 to 20 years in 11 U.S. emergency departments with abdominal pain plus signs and symptoms suspicious for AA within the prior 72 hours. Subjects were assessed by study staff unaware of their diagnosis for 17 clinical attributes drawn from published appendicitis scoring systems and physicians responsible for physical examination estimated the probability of AA based on PCI prior to their medical disposition. Based on medical record entry rate, frequently used CDR attributes were evaluated using recursive partitioning and logistic regression to select the best minimum set capable of discriminating subjects with and without AA. Subjects were followed to determine whether imaging was used and use was tabulated by both PCI and the CDR to assess their ability to identify patients who did or did not benefit based on diagnosis. Results: This cohort had a 27.3% prevalence (118/431 subjects) of AA. We derived a CDR based on the absence of two out of three of the following attributes: abdominal tenderness, pain migration, and rigidity/ guarding had a sensitivity of 89.8% (95% CI: 83.1-94.1), specificity of 47.6% (95% CI: 42.1-53.1), NPV of 92.5% (95% CI: 87.4-95.7), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.21 (95% CI: 0.12-0.37). The PCI set at AA <30% pre-test probability had a sensitivity of 94.1% (95% CI: 88.3-97.1), specificity of 49.4% (95% CI: 43.9-54.9), NPV of 95.7% (95% CI: 91.3-97.9), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.06-0.25). The methods each classified 37% of the patients as low risk for AA. Our CDR identified 29.1% (43/148) of low risk subjects who received CT but being AA (-), could have been spared CT, while the PCI identified 20.1% (30/149). Conclusion: Compared to physician clinical impression, our clinical decision rule can identify more children at low risk for appendicitis who could be managed more conservatively with careful observation and avoidance of CT.",

The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated with 95% CI for a low MAS and final diagnosis of appendicitis. Background: Evaluating children for appendicitis is difficult and strategies have been sought to improve the precision of the diagnosis. Computed tomography is now widely used but remains controversial due to the large dose of ionizing radiation and risk of subsequent radiation-induced malignancy.",

Methods: We prospectively enrolled 431 subjects aged 2 to 20 years presenting in 11 U.S. emergency departments with abdominal pain and other signs and symptoms suspicious for acute appendicitis within the prior 72 hours. Subjects were assessed by study staff unaware of their diagnosis for 17 clinical attributes drawn from appendicitis scoring systems and blood samples were analyzed for CBC differential and 5 candidate proteins. Based on discharge diagnosis or post-surgical pathology, the cohort exhibited a 27.3% prevalence (118/431 subjects) of appendicitis. Clinical attributes and biomarker values were evaluated using principal component, recursive partitioning, and logistic regression to select the combination that best discriminated between those subjects with and without disease. Mathematical combination of three inflammation-related markers in a panel comprised of myeloid-related protein 8/14 complex (MRP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC) provided optimal discrimination.",

The observed performance was then verified by testing the panel against a pediatric subset drawn from an independent cohort of all ages enrolled in an earlier study. In this cohort, the panel exhibited a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 87-98%), a specificity of 41% (95% CI, 34-50%), and a negative predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 87-98%). Conclusion: AppyScore is highly predictive of the absence of acute appendicitis in these two cohorts. If these results are confirmed by a prospective evaluation currently underway, the AppyScore panel may be useful to classify pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of, or consistent with, acute appendicitis and thereby sparing many patients ionizing radiation. Background: There are no current studies on the tracking of emergency department (ED) patient dispersal when a major ED closes. This study demonstrates a novel way to track where patients sought emergency care following the closure of Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center (SVCMC) in Manhattan by using de-identified data from a health information exchange, the New York Clinical Information Exchange (NYCLIX). NYCLIX matches patients who have visited multiple sites using their demographic information. On April 30, 2010, SVCMC officially stopped providing emergency and outpatient services. We report the patterns in which patients from SVCMC visited other sites within NYCLIX. Objectives: We hypothesize that patients often seek emergency care based on geography when a hospital closes. Methods: A retrospective pre-and post-closure analysis was performed of SVCMC patients visiting other hospital sites. The pre-closure study dates were January 1, 2010-March 31, 2010. The post closure study dates were May 1, 2010-July 31, 2010. A SVCMC patient was defined as a patient with any SVCMC encounter prior to its closure. Using de-identified aggregate count data, we calculated the average number of visits per week by SVCMC patients at each site (Hospital A-H). We ran a paired t-test to compare the pre-and post-closure averages by site. The following specifications were used to write the database queries: Of patients who had one or more prior visits to SVCMC for each day within the study return the following: a. EID: a unique and meaningless proprietary ID generated within the NYCLIX Master Patient Index (MPI). b. Age: Thru the age of 89. Persons over 90 were listed as ''90 + '' c. Ethnicity/Race d. Type of visit: emergency e. Location of visit: specific NYCLIX site.",

            "text": "Upstream Methods: Data were collected on all ED EMS arrivals from the metro Calgary (population 1.1 million) area to its three urban adult hospitals. The study phases consisted of the 7 months from February to October 2010 (pre-OCP) compared against the same months in 2011 (post-OCP). Data from the EMS operational database and the Regional Emergency Department Information System (REDIS) database were linked. The primary analysis examined the change in EMS offload delay defined as the time from EMS triage arrival until patient transfer to an ED bed. A secondary analysis evaluated variability in EMS offload delay between receiving EDs. Conclusion: Implementation of a regional overcapacity protocol to reduce ED crowding was associated with an important reduction in EMS offload delay, suggesting that policies that target hospital processes have bearing on EMS operations. Variability in offload delay improvements is likely due to site-specific issues, and the gains in efficiency correlate inversely with acuity. Methods: A pre-post intervention study was conducted in the ED of an adult university teaching hospital in Montreal (annual visits = 69 000). The RAZ unit (intervention), created to offload the ACU of the main ED, started operating in January, 2011. Using a split flow management strategy, patients were directed to the RAZ unit based on patient acuity level (CTAS code 3 and certain code 2), likelihood to be discharged within 12 hours, and not requiring an ED bed for continued care. Data were collected weekdays from 9:00 to 21:00 for 4 months (September -December 2008) (pre-RAZ) and for 1.5 months (February -March 2011) (post-RAZ). In the ACU of the main ED, research assistants observed and recorded cubicle access time, and nurse and physician assessment times. Databases were used to extract socio-demographics, ambulance arrival, triage code, chief complaint, triage and registration time, length of stay, and ED occupancy. Background: Telephone follow-up after discharge from the ED is useful for treatment and quality assurance purposes. ED follow-up studies frequently do not achieve high (i.e. \u2021 80%) completion rates.",

We hypothesized that with a rigorous follow-up system we could achieve a high follow-up rate in a socioeconomically diverse study population. Methods: Research assistants (RAs) prospectively enrolled adult ED patients discharged with a medication prescription between November 15, 2010 and September 9, 2011 from one of three EDs affiliated with one health care system: (A) academic Level I trauma center, (B) community teaching affiliate, and (C) community hospital. Patients unable to provide informed consent, non-English speaking, or previously enrolled were excluded. RAs interviewed subjects prior to ED discharge and conducted a telephone follow-up interview 1 week later. Follow-up procedures were standardized (e.g. number of calls per day, times to place calls, obtaining alternative numbers) and each subject's follow-up status was monitored and updated daily through a shared, web-based data system. Subjects who completed follow-up were mailed a $10 gift card. We examined the influence of patient (age, sex, race, insurance, income, marital status, usual major activity, education, literacy level, health status), clinical (acuity, discharge diagnosis, ED length of stay, site), and procedural factors (number and type of phone numbers received from subjects, offering two gift cards for difficult to reach subjects) on the odds of successful followup using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Of the 3,940 enrolled, 45% were white, 59% were covered by Medicaid or uninsured, and 44% reported an annual household income of <$26,000. 86% completed telephone follow-up with 41% completing on the first attempt. The table displays the factors associated with successful follow-up. In addition to patient demographics and lower acuity, obtaining a cell phone or multiple phone numbers as well as offering two gift cards to a small number of subjects increased the odds of successful follow-up. Conclusion: With a rigorous follow-up system and a small monetary incentive, a high telephone follow-up rate is achievable one week after an ED visit. Methods: An interrupted time-series design was used to evaluate the study question. Data regarding adherence with the following pneumonia core measures were collected pre-and post-implementation of the enhanced decision-support tool: blood cultures prior to antibiotic, antibiotic within 6 hours of arrival, appropriate antibiotic selection, and mean time to antibiotic administration. Prescribing clinicians were educated on the use of the decision-support tool at departmental meetings and via direct feedback on their cases. Results: During the 33-month study period, complete data were collected for 1185 patients diagnosed with CAP: 613 in the pre-implementation phase and 572 post-implementation. The mean time to antibiotic administration decreased by approximately one minute from the pre-to post-implementation phase, a change that was not statistically significant (p = 0.824). The proportion of patients receiving blood cultures prior to antibiotics improved significantly (p < 0.001) as did the proportion of patients receiving antibiotics within 6 hours of ED arrival (p = 0.004). A significant improvement in appropriate antibiotic selection was noted with 100% of patients experiencing appropriate selection in the post-phase, p = 0.0112. Use of the available support tool increased throughout the study period, v 2 = 78.13, df = 1, p < 0.0001. All improvements were maintained 15 months following the study intervention. Conclusion: In this academic ED, introduction of an enhanced electronic clinical decision support tool significantly improved adherence to CMS pneumonia core measures. The proportion of patients receiving blood cultures prior to antibiotics, antibiotics within 6 hours, and appropriate antibiotics all improved significantly after the introduction of an enhanced electronic clinical decision support tool. Background: Emergency medicine (EM) residency graduates need to pass both the written qualifying exam and oral certification exam as the final benchmark to achieve board certification. The purpose of this project is to obtain information about the exam preparation habits of recent EM graduates to allow current residents to make informed decisions about their individual preparation for the ABEM written qualifying and oral certification exams.",

Methods: Design: An online survey instrument was used to ask respondents questions about residency preparation and individual preparation habits, as well as the types of board review products used in preparing for the EM boards. Participants: As greater than 95% of all EM graduates are EMRA members, an online survey was sent to all EMRA members who have graduated for the past three years. Observations: Descriptive statistics of types of preparation, types of resources, time, and quantitative and qualitative ratings for the various board preparation products were obtained from respondents. Results: A total of 520 respondents spent an average of 9.1 weeks and 15 hours per week preparing for the written qualifying exam and spent an average of 5 weeks and 7.8 hours per week preparing for the oral certification exam. In preparing for the written qualification exam, 90% used a preparation textbook with 16% using more than one textbook and 47% using a board preparation course. In preparing for the oral qualifying exam, 56% used a preparation textbook while 34% used a preparation course. Sixty-seven percent of respondents reported that their residency programs had a formalized written qualifying exam preparation curriculum of which 48% was centered on the annual in-training exam. Eight-five percent of residency programs had a formalized oral certification exam preparation. Respondents reported spending on average $715 preparing for the qualifying exam and $509 for the certification exam. Conclusion: EM residents spend significant amounts of time and money and make use of a wide range of residency and commercially available resources in preparing for the ABEM qualifying and certification exams. Background: Communication and professionalism skills are essential for EM residents but are not wellmeasured by selection processes. The Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI) uses multiple, short structured contacts to measure these skills. It predicts medical school success better than the interview and application. Its acceptability and utility in EM residency selection is unknown. Objectives: We theorized that the MMI would provide novel information and be acceptable to participants. Methods: 71 interns from three programs in the first month of training completed an eight-station MMI developed to focus on EM topics. Pre-and post-surveys assessed reactions using five-point scales. MMI scores were compared to application data. Results: EM grades correlated with MMI performance (F(1.66) = 4:18, p < 0.05) with honors students having higher MMI summary scores. Higher third year clerkship grades trended to higher MMI performance means, although not significantly. MMI performance did not correlate with a match desirability rating and did not predict other individual components of the application including USMLE Step 1 or USMLE Step 2. Participants preferred a traditional interview (mean difference = 1.36, p < 0.0001). A mixed format was preferred over a pure MMI (mean difference = 1.1, p < 0.0001). Preference for a mixed format was similar to a traditional interview. MMI performance did not significantly correlate with preference for the MMI; however, there was a trend for higher performance to associate with higher preference (r = 0.15, t(65) = 1.19, n.s.) Performance was not associated with preference for a mix of interview methods (r = 0.08, t(65) = 0.63, n.s.). Conclusion: While the MMI alone was viewed less favorably than a traditional interview, participants were receptive to a mixed methods interview. The MMI appears to measure skills important in successful completion of an EM clerkship and thus likely EM residency. Future work will determine whether MMI performance correlates with clinical performance during residency. Background: The annual American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) in-training exam is a tool to assess resident progress and knowledge. When the New York-Presbyterian (NYP) EM Residency Program started in 2003, the exam was not emphasized and resident performance was lower than expected. A course was implemented to improve residency-wide scores despite previous EM literature failing to exhibit improvements with residency-sponsored in-training exam interventions. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of a comprehensive, multi-faceted course on residency-wide in-training exam performance. Methods: The NYP EM Residency Program, associated with Cornell and Columbia medical schools, has a 4year format with 10-12 residents per year. An intensive 14-week in-training exam preparation program was instituted outside of the required weekly residency conferences. The program included lectures, pre-tests, high-yield study sheets, and remediation programs. Lectures were interactive, utilizing an audience response system, and consisted of 13 core lectures (2-2.5 hours) and three review sessions. Residents with previous in-training exam difficulty were counseled on designing their own study programs. The effect on intraining exam scores was measured by comparing each resident's score to the national mean for their postgraduate year (PGY). Scores before and after course implementation were evaluated by repeat measures regression modeling. Overall residency performance was evaluated by comparing residency average to the national average each year and by tracking ABEM national written examination pass rates. Results: Resident performance improved following course implementation. Following the course's introduction, the odds of a resident beating the national mean increased by 3.9 (95% CI 1.9-7.3) and the percentage of residents exceeding the national mean for their PGY year increased by 37% (95% CI 23%-52%). Following course introduction, the overall residency mean score has outperformed the national exam mean annually and the first-time ABEM written exam board pass rate has been 100%. Conclusion: A multi-faceted in-training exam program centered around a 14-week course markedly improved overall residency performance on the in-training exam. Limitations: This was a before and after evaluation as randomizing residents to receive the course was not logistically or ethically feasible. .0 years of practice. Among the nonresidency trained, non-boarded EM physicians, the percentage of individuals with board actions against them was significantly higher (6.9% vs. 1.9%, 95% CI for difference of 5.0% = 3.1 to 7.5%), but the incidence of actions was not significant (1.3 vs. 3.4 events/ 1000 years of practice, 95% CI for difference of 2.1/ 1000 = )3/1000 to +8/1000), but the power to detect a difference was 30%. Conclusion: In this study population, EM-trained physicians had significantly fewer total state medical board disciplinary actions against them than non-EM trained physicians, but when adjusted for years of practice (incidence), the difference was not significantly different at the 95% confidence level. The study was limited by low power to detect a difference in incidence. Objectives: We chose pain documentation as a long term project for quality improvement in our EMS system.

Descriptive statistics with confidence intervals were calculated, and comparisons were made using non-parametric tests. Results: During the 5-year study period, 189,371 unique patients were seen, of whom 0.7% patients were homeless. 335 patients were identified as frequent users. There were patients who presented on the top 100 utilizer lists from multiple years. 67 (20%, 95%CI 16-25) patients were identified as homeless. 148 patients were seen >4 times in at least three of the 5 years and 23 (16%, 11-22) were homeless. 12 patients were seen >20 times in at least three of the 5 years and 5 (41%, 19-68) were homeless. Our facility has a 40% admission rate; however, non homeless Chronic Ultra-High Utilizers had admission rates of 24% and homeless Chronic Ultra-High Utilizers were admitted 14%. Conclusion: Chronic Ultra-High Utilizers of our ED are disproportionately homeless and present with lower severity of illness. These patients may prove to be a cost-effective group to house or otherwise involve with aggressive case management. The debate over homeless housing programs and case management solutions can be sharpened by better defining the groups who would most benefit and who represent the greatest potential saving for the health system. Background: The prevalence of obese patients presenting to our emergency department (ED) is 38%: obese patients present in disproportionate number compared to the general population (US rate = 27%). In spite of this, there is a disconnect in patients' perceptions of weight and health: many patients underestimate their weight and report a key barrier to weight loss is patient-provider communications; such discussions have proven to be highly effective in smoking, drug, and alcohol cessation, an important initial step toward promoting wellness. Information about patient provider communication is essential for designing and implementing emergency department (ED) based interventions to help increase patient awareness about weightrelated medical issues and provide counseling for weight reduction. Objectives: We assessed patients' perceptions about obesity as disease and patient communication with their providers through two questions: Do you believe your present weight is damaging to your health? Has a doctor or other health professional every told you that you are overweight? Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed in an academic tertiary care ED. A randomized sample of patients (every fifth) presenting to the ED (n = 453) was enrolled. Pregnant patients, patients who were medically unstable, cognitively impaired, or who were unable or unwilling to provide informed consent were excluded. Percentages of ''yes'' and ''no'' are reported for each question based on patient BMI, ethnicity, sex, and the number of comorbid conditions. Regression analysis was used to determine differences in responses between subgroups. Results: Among overweight/obese, white/black patients, 42.5% do not feel their weight is damaging to their health and 54.7% reported they have not been told by a doctor they are overweight. Of Individuals who have been told by a doctor they were overweight, 23.2% still believe their present weight is not damaging to their health. Of individuals who have not been told by a doctor they were overweight, 41.5% believe their present weight is damaging to their health. Differences in race and age were not found. P values <0.05 for all results. Conclusion: Our data point toward a disconnect regarding patients' perceptions of health and weight. Timely education about the burden of obesity may lead to a decrease in its overall prevalence. (Originally submitted as a ''late-breaker.'') Objectives: To examine the attitudes and expectations of patients admitted for inpatient care following an emergency department visit. Methods: A descriptive study was done by surveying a voluntary sample of adult patients (n = 210) admitted to the hospital from the emergency department in one urban teaching hospital in the Midwest. A short, ninequestion survey was developed to assess patient attitudes and expectations towards HIV testing, consent, and requirements. Analyses consisted of descriptive statistics, correlations, and chi-square analyses. Results: The majority of patients report that HIV testing should be a routine part of health care screening (82.4%) and that the hospital should routinely test admitted patients for HIV (78.6%). Despite these overall positive attitudes towards HIV testing, the data also suggest that patients have strong attitudes towards consent requirements with 80% acknowledging that HIV testing requires special consent and 72% reporting that separate consent should be required. The data also showed a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who believed that HIV testing is a part of routine health care screening by race (v2 = 6.825, df = 1, p = .009). Conclusion: Patients attitudes and expectations towards routine HIV testing are consistent with the CDC recommendations. Emergency departments are an ideal setting to initiate HIV testing and the findings suggest that patients expect hospital policies outline procedures for obtaining consent and screening all patients who are admitted to the hospital from the ED. Results: The analysis revealed a ''hot spot'', a cluster of 833 counties (24.5%) with high CA rates adjacent to counties with high CA rates, located across the southeastern US (P < 0.001). Within these counties, the average CA rate was 14% higher than the national average. A ''cool spot'', a cluster of 548 counties (16.1%) with low rates, was located across the Midwest (P < 0.001). In this cool spot the average CA rate was 12% lower than the national average. Figures 1 and 2 show US adjusted rates and spatial autocorrelation of CA deaths, respectively. Conclusion: We identify geographic disparities in CA mortality and describe the cardiac arrest belt in the southeastern US. A limitation of this analysis was the use of ICD-10 codes to identify cardiac arrest deaths; however, no other national data exist. An improved understanding of the drivers of this variability is essential to targeted prevention and treatment strategies, especially given the recent emphasis on development of cardiac resuscitation centers and cardiac arrest systems of care. An understanding of the relation between population density, cardiac arrest count, and cardiac arrest rate will be essential to the design of an optimized cardiac arrest system. We defined ED utilization during the past 12 months as non-users (0 visits), infrequent users (1-3 visits), frequent users (4-9 visits), and super-frequent users ( \u202110 visits). We compared demographic data, socioeconomic status, health conditions, and access to care between these ED utilization groups. Results: Overall, super-frequent use was reported by 0.4% of U.S. adults, frequent use by 2%, and infrequent ED use by 19%. Higher ED utilization was associated with increased self-reported fair to poor health (55% for super-frequent, 48% for frequent, 22% for infrequent, 10% for non-ED users). Frequent ED users were also more likely to be impoverished, with 31% of superfrequent, 25% of frequent, 13% of infrequent, and 9% of non-ED users reporting a poverty-income ratio <1. Adults with higher ED utilization were more likely to report the ED as the place they usually go when sick (10% for super-frequent, 6% for frequent, 2% for infrequent, 0.5% for non-ED users). They also reported greater outpatient resource utilization, with 73% of super-frequent, 48% of frequent, 25% of infrequent, and 10% of non-ED users reporting \u202110 outpatient visits/year. Frequent ED users were also more likely than non-ED users to be covered by Medicaid (34% for super-frequent, 26% for frequent, 12% for infrequent, 5% for non-ED users). Conclusion: Frequent ED users were a vulnerable population with lower socioeconomic status, poor overall health, and high outpatient resource utilization. Interventions designed to divert frequent users from the ED should also focus on chronic disease management and access to outpatient services, rather than focusing solely on limiting ED utilization. Objectives: We explored factors associated with specialty provider willingness to provide urgent appointments to children insured by Medicaid/CHIP. Methods: As part of a mixed method study of child access to specialty care by insurance status, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 26 specialists and 14 primary care physicians (PCPs) in Cook County, IL. Interviews were conducted from April to September 2009, until theme saturation was reached. Resultant transcripts and notes were entered into ATLAS.ti and analyzed using an iterative coding process to identify patterns of responses in the data, ensure reliability, examine discrepancies, and achieve consensus through content analysis. Results: Themes that emerged indicate that PCPs face considerable barriers getting publicly insured patients into specialty care and use the ED to facilitate this process. ''If I send them to the emergency room, I'm bypassing a number of problems. I'm fully aware that I'm crowding the emergency room.'' Specialty physicians reported that decisions to refuse or limit the number of patients with Medicaid/CHIP are due to economic strain or direct pressure from their institutions ''In the last budget revision, we were [told], 'You are losing money, so you need to improve your patient mix'''. In specialty practices with limited Medicaid/CHIP appointment slots, factors associated with appointment success included: high acuity or complexity, personal request from or an informal economic relationship with the PCP, geography, and patient hardship. ''If it's a really desperate situation and they can't find anybody else, I will make an exception''. Specialists also acknowledged that ''Patients who can't get an appointment go to the ER and then I am obligated to see them if they're in the system.'' Conclusion: These exploratory findings suggest that a critical linkage exists between hospital EDs and affiliated specialty clinics. As health systems restructure, there is an opportunity for EDs to play a more explicit role in improving care coordination and access to specialty care.",

Patients unable to receive text messages or voicemails were excluded. Health literacy was assessed using a validated health literacy assessment, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Patients were randomized to a discharge instruction modality: 1) usual care, typed and verbal medication and case-specific instructions; 2) usual care plus text messaged instructions sent to the patient's cell phone; or 3) usual care plus voicemailed instructions sent to the patient's cell phone. Antibiotic pick-up was verified with the patient's pharmacy at 72 hours. Patients were called at 30 days to determine antibiotic compliance. Z-tests were used to compare 72-hour antibiotic pickup and patient-reported compliance across instructional modality and NVS score groups. Results: 758 patients were included (55% female, median age 30, range 5 months to 71 years); 98 were excluded. 23% had an NVS score of 0-1, 31% 2-3, and 46% 4-6. The proportion of prescriptions filled at 72 hours varied significantly across NVS score groups; self-reported medication compliance at 30 days revealed no difference across different instructional modalities nor NVS scores (Table 1) .

Whether expanding coverage achieves this is of paramount importance as the United States prepares for the Affordable Care Act. Objectives: We examined ED and outpatient department use after the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage expansion, focusing on adolescents (a major target group for SCHIP) versus young adults (not targeted). We hypothesized that coverage would increase use of outpatient services and emergency department services would decrease. Methods: Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, we analyzed years 1992-1996 as baseline and then compared use patterns in 1999-2009 after SCHIP launch. Primary outcomes were populationadjusted annual visits to ED versus non-emergency outpatient settings. Interrupted time-series were performed on use rates to ED and outpatient departments between adolescents (11-18 years old) and young adults (19-29 years old) in the pre-SCHIP and SCHIP periods.

Conclusion: Since SCHIP, adolescent non-ED outpatient visits increased while ED visits remained unchanged. In comparison to young adults, expanding insurance coverage to adolescents improved access to health care services and suggests a shift to non-ED settings. As an observational study we are unable to control for secular trends during this time period. Also as an ecological study we are unable to examine individual variation.

In the normal airway scenario, there were no differences in the mean time for intubation with GVL or DL (62.9 \u00b1 24.1 vs 61.8 \u00b1 26.2 seconds, p = NS) or the number of interns who performed successful intubation (23 vs 22, p = NS). In the difficult airway scenario, the interns took longer to intubate with GVL than DL (92.3 \u00b1 26.6 vs 59.9 \u00b1 22.7 seconds, p = 0.008), but there were no differences in the number of successful intubations (17 vs 19, p = NS). Interns rated their satisfaction higher for GVL than DL (7.3 \u00b1 1.8 vs 6.5 \u00b1 1.5, p = 0.05) and GVL was chosen as the preferred device for their next intubation by a majority of the interns (19/29, 66%). Conclusion: For novice clinicians, GVL does not improve the time to intubation or intubation success Objectives: To determine the time to intubation, the number of attempts, and the occurrence of hypoxia, in patients intubated with a C-MAC device versus those intubated using a standard laryngoscope. Methods: Randomized controlled trial using exception from informed consent that included patients undergoing endotracheal intubation with a standard laryngoscope at an urban Level I trauma center. Eligible patients were randomized to undergo intubation using the C-MAC or standard laryngoscopy. Standard laryngoscopy was performed using a C-MAC device laryngoscope with the video output obstructed to ensure equivalent laryngoscope blades in the two groups. Data were collected by a trained research assistant at the patient's bedside and video review by the investigators. The number of attempts made, the initial and lowest oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), and the total time until the intubation was successful was recorded. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation <93%. Data were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum and chi-square tests. Results: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled, 20 (70% male, median age 58, range 28 to 86, median SpO 2 97%, range 79 to 100) in the standard laryngoscopy group and 18 (67% male, median age 58, range 19 to 73, median SpO 2 96.5%, range 78 to 100) in the C-MAC group. The median number of attempts for standard laryngoscopy was 1, range 1 to 3, and for C-MAC was 1, range 1 to 2 (p = 0.43). The median time to intubation for the standard laryngoscopy group was 54 seconds (range 7 to 89) and for the C-MAC group was 41 seconds (range 4 to 101)(p = 0.05). Hypoxia was detected in 5/20 (20%) in the standard laryngoscopy group and 1/18 (6%) in the C-MAC group (p = 0.15). The median decrease in oxygen saturation during the attempt was 5.4% (range 0% to 31%) for the standard laryngoscopy group and 2.3% (range 0% to 16%) for the C-MAC group. Conclusion: We did not detect a difference in number of attempts, the occurrence of hypoxia, or the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia between standard laryngoscopy and the C-MAC. The time to successful intubation was shorter for patients intubated with the C-MAC. The C-MAC device appears to be superior to standard laryngoscopy for emergent endotracheal intubation.",

Background: Japanese census data estimate that 35 million, or nearly 29% of the overall population, will be over age 65 by the year 2020. Similar trends are apparent throughout the developed world. Although increased patient age affects airway management, comprehensive information in emergency airway management for the elderly is lacking. Objectives: We sought to characterize emergency department (ED) airway management for the elderly in Japan including success rate, and major adverse events using a large multi-center registry. Methods: Design and Setting: We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study using the Japanese Emergency Airway Network (JEAN) registry of EDs at 11 academic and community hospitals in Japan between 2010 and 2011 inclusive. Data fields included ED characteristics, patient and operator demographics, methods of airway management, number of attempts, success rate, and adverse events. Participants: Patient inclusion criteria were all adult patients who underwent emergent tracheal intubation in the ED. Primary analysis: Patients were divided to into two groups defined as follows: 18 to 64 years old and over 65 years old. We describe primary success rates and major adverse events using simple descriptive statistics. Categorical data are reported as proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The database recorded 2710 patients (capture rate 98%) and 2623 met the inclusion criteria. Of 2623 patients, 1104 patients were 18 to 64 years old (62%) and 1519 were over 65 years old (38%). The older group had a significantly higher success rate at first attempt intubation (1074/1519; 70.7%, 95% CI 68.8-72.6%) compared with the younger group (710/1104; 64.3%, 95% CI 61.9-66.7%). The older group had similar major adverse event rates (112/1519; 7.4%, 95% CI 6.3-8.5%) compared with the younger group (83/1104; 7.5%, 95% CI 6.2-8.8%).

There was a larger change in heart rate during the exposure among subjects who described a standardized painful exposure as moderate than in those who described it as severe. The small observed changes in blood pressure and respiratory rate seen during the exposure did not differ by pain report or persist after 10 minutes. Background: Vital signs are often used to validate intensity of pain. However, few studies have looked at the capacity of vital signs to estimate pain intensity, particularly in patients with a diagnosis that a majority of physicians would agree produce significant pain in the ED. Objectives: To determine the association between pain intensity and vital signs in consecutive ED patients and in a sub-group of patients with diagnosis known to cause significant pain. Methods: We performed a post-hoc analysis of prospectively acquired data in a cohort study done in an urban teaching hospital with computerized triage and nurses records. We included all consecutive ED adult patients ( \u202116 years old), who had any level of pain intensity measured during triage, from March 2008 to November 2010. The primary outcome was the mean heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure for every pain intensity level from 1 to 10 on a verbal numerical scale. Our secondary outcomes where the same but limited to patients with the following diagnosis: fracture, dislocation, and renal colic. We performed descriptive statistics, one-way and two-way ANOVAs when appropriate. Results: During our study period, 42,947 patients \u202116 years old where triaged with a pain intensity of at least 1/10 and 3939 had a diagnosis known to cause significant pain. 56.5% of patients were female, with a mean pain intensity of 6.8/10, mean age of 47.9 years (\u00b119.3), and 22.3% were \u202165 years old. There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) in mean heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure for each level of pain intensity, ex: difference between 1/10 and 10/10 for mean heart rate was 3.9 beats per minutes, for systolic pressure was 4.0 mmHg and for diastolic 4.5 mmHg. Results are similar for painful diagnosis: difference for mean heart rate was 0.3 beats per minutes, for systolic pressure was 6.5 mmHg and diastolic 8.8 mmHg. However, these differences are not clinically significant. Conclusion: Although our study is a post hoc analysis, pain intensity, heart rate, systolic and diastolic pressures during triage are usually reliable data and a prospective study would likely produce the same result. These vital signs cannot be used to estimate or validate pain intensity in the emergency department. 8% had a positive urine drug screen. Logistic multivariate regressions analyses revealed the following factors to be significantly associated with the risk of having an abnormal head CT: association with seizure (P = 0.0072); length of time of loss of consciousness, ranging from none to 0-30 min to >30 min (P = 0.0013); alteration of consciousness (P = 0.00009); post-traumatic amnesia (P = 0.0132); alcohol intake prior to injury (P = 0,0003); and initial ED GCS (P = 0.0255).",

Background: The etiology of neurogenic shock is classically attributed to diminished peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) secondary to loss of sympathetic outflow to the peripheral vasculature. However, the sympathetic nervous system also controls other key elements of the cardiovascular system such as the heart and capacitance vessels and disruptions in their function could complicate the hemodynamic presentation. Objectives: We sought to systematically examine the hemodynamic profiles of a series of trauma patients with neurogenic shock. Methods: Consecutive trauma patients with documented spinal cord injury complicated by clinical shock were enrolled. Hemodynamic data including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR), impedance-derived cardiac output, pre-ejection period (PEP), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), and calculated systemic PVR were collected in the ED. Data were normalized for body surface area and a validated integrated computer model of human physiology (Guyton model) was used to analyze and categorize the hemodynamic profiles based on etiology of the hypotension using a systems analysis. Correlation between markers of sympathetic outflow (HR, PEP, LVET) and shock etiology category was examined. Results: Of 9 patients with traumatic neurogenic shock, the etiology of shock was decrease in PVR in 4 (45%; 95% CI 19 to 73%), loss of vascular capacitance in 3 (33%; 12 to 65%), and mixed peripheral resistance and capacitance responsible in 2 (22%; 6 to 55%). The markers of sympathetic outflow had no correlation to any of the elements in the patients' hemodynamic profiles.",

Results from this study suggest that neurogenic shock can have multiple mechanistic etiologies and represents a spectrum of hemodynamic profiles. This understanding is important for the treatment decisions made in the management of these patients. -year (2008-2010) , pre-post intervention study of trauma patients requiring massive blood transfusion was performed. We divided the population into two cohorts: a pre-protocol group (PRE) which included trauma patients receiving MBT not aided by a protocol, and a post-protocol group (POST) who underwent MBT via the MBTP. Patient demographics, 24hour blood component totals, timing of blood component delivery, trauma Injury Severity Score (ISS), initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, trauma mechanism, and patient mortality data were collected and analyzed using Fisher's exact tests, Student's t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Fifty-two patients were included for study. Median times to delivery of first products were reduced for PRBCs (4 minutes), FFP (16 minutes), and platelets (33 minutes) between the PRE and POST cohorts. Median time to delivery of any subsequent blood product was significantly reduced (10 minutes) in the POST cohort (p = 0.024). The median number of blood products delivered was increased by 5.5 units for PRBCs, 4 units for FFP, 0.5 units for platelets, and 1 unit for cryoprecipitate after implementation of MBTP. The percentage of patients receiving higher blood product ratios (>3:1) was reduced between the PRE and POST cohorts for PRBC to FFP (25% reduction) and PRBC to platelet ratio groups (7 % reduction). Despite improved transfusion timing and ratios, we found no significant difference in mortality (p = 0.129) between PRE and POST cohorts when we adjusted for injury severity. Conclusion: Protocolized delivery of massive blood transfusion might reduce time to product availability and delivery, though it is unclear how this affects patient mortality in all US trauma centers. Background: Burns are common injuries that can result in significant scarring leading to poor function and disfigurement. Unlike mechanical injuries, burns often progress both in depth and size over the first few days after injury, possibly due to inflammation and oxidative stress. A major gap in the field of burns is the lack of an effective therapy that reduces burn injury progression.",

Background: Minor thoracic injury (MTI) is frequent and a significant proportion will still have moderate to severe pain at 90 days. There is a lack of risk factors to orient specific treatment at ED discharge. Objectives: To determine risk factors of having pain ( \u20213/10, on a numerical intensity pain score from 0 to 10) at 90 days in a population of minor thoracic injury patients discharged from the ED. Methods: A prospective multi-center cohort study was conducted in four Canadian EDs, from November 2006 to January 2010. All consecutive patients, 16 years and older, with MTI (with or without rib fracture), a normal chest x-ray, and discharged from the ED were eligible. A standardized clinical and radiological evaluation was done at 1 and 2 weeks. Standardized phone interviews were done at 30 and 90 days. Pain evaluation occurred at five time points (ED visit, 1 and 2 weeks, 30 and 90 days). Using a pain trajectory model (SAS), we planned to identify groups with different pain evolution at 90 days. The final model was based on the importance of difference in pain evolution, confidence intervals, and number of patients in each group. To judge the adequacy of the final model, we examined whether the posteriori probabilities (i.e., a participant's probability of belonging to a certain trajectory group) averaged at least 70% for each trajectory group. Then using logistic multinomial regression and the low risk group of having pain as the control group, we identified significant predictors of patients in the moderate and high risk groups having pain at 90 days.",

The parameters used to evaluate healing over time were pulsatility and resistance indices of the ophthalmic artery. Results: We have established baseline ultrasound measurements of the optic nerve diameter, normal resistance and pulsatility indices of the ophthalmic artery, and morphological assessment of the optic nerve in a rat model.

The main advantages of ultrasound are low cost, non-invasiveness, lack of ionizing radiation, and the potential to perform longitudinal studies.

Once baseline ultrasound and Doppler measurements are defined there is the opportunity to translate the rat model to evaluate patients with head trauma who are at risk for optic nerve swelling and to assess the usefulness of treatment interventions. Background: Alcoholism is a chronic disease that affects an estimated 17.6 million American adults. A common presentation to the emergency department (ED) is a trauma patient with altered sensorium who is presumed to be alcohol intoxicated by the physicians based on their olfactory sense. Often ED physicians may leave patients suspected of alcohol intoxication aside until the effects wear off, potentially missing major trauma as the source of confusion or disorientation. This practice often results in delays in diagnosing acute potentially life-threatening injuries in the patients with presumed alcohol intoxication.",

It is imperative that students gain exposure to as many of the various fields within EM as possible during this time. If the exposure of medical students to ultrasound is left to the discretion of the supervising physicians, we feel that many students would complete an EM clerkship with limited skills and knowledge in ultrasound. The majority of medical students receive no formal training in ultrasound during medical school and we believe that the EM clerkship is an excellent opportunity to fill this educational gap.

As part of the clerkship requirements, the students have a portion of the curriculum dedicated to the FAST exam and ultrasound-guided vascular access. At the end of the month they take a written test, and 1 month later they are given a survey via e-mail regarding their ultrasound experience. EM residents also completed the test to serve as a comparison group. All data analysis was done using SAS 9.2. Scores were integers ranging between 0 and 10. Descriptive statistics are given as count, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for each group. Due to non-Gaussian nature of the data and small group sizes, a Wilcoxon two-sample test was used to compare the distributions of scores between the groups. Results: In the table, the distribution of scores was compared between the residents (controls) and the students (subjects). The mean and median scores of the student group were higher than those of the resident group. The difference in scores between the two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.021). Conclusion: Our data reveal that after completing an EM clerkship with time devoted to learning ultrasound for the FAST exam and vascular access, fourth year medical students are able to perform better than EM residents on a written test. What remains to be determined is if their skills in image acquisition and in performance of ultrasound-guided vascular access procedures also exceed those of EM residents. Results: There were 106 respondents (total response rate 24.71%). Compared to non-EM students, students pursuing EM (8 students, 7.55%) were more drawn to their specialty for work hour control (p < 0.0009) and shorter residency length (p < 0.0338). EM students were less likely than non-EM students to be drawn to their chosen specialty for future academic opportunities (p < 0.0085). EM students formed their mentorships by referral significantly more than non-EM students (p < 0.0399), though there was no statistical difference in quality of existing mentorships amongst students. Of the 93 students not currently and never formerly interested in EM, the most common response (25.8%) for why they did not choose EM was the lack of a strong mentor in the field. Conclusion: The results confirmed previous findings of lifestyle factors drawing students to EM. Future academic opportunities were less likely to draw students to EM than students pursuing other specialties. Lack of mentorship in the field was the most common reason given for why students did not consider EM. Given the lack of direct EM exposure until late in the curriculum of most medical schools, mentorship may be particularly important for EM and future study should focus on this area. Background: Misdiagnosis is a major public health problem. Dizziness leads to 10 million visits annually in the US, including 2.6 million to the emergency department (ED). Despite extensive ED workups, diagnostic accuracy remains poor, with at least 35% of strokes missed in those presenting with dizziness. ED physicians need and want support, particularly in the best method for diagnosis. Strong evidence now indicates the bedside oculomotor exam is the best method of differentiating central from peripheral causes of dizziness. Objectives: After a vertigo day that includes instruction in head impulse testing, emergency medicine residents will feel comfortable discharging a patient with signs of vestibular neuritis and a positive head impulse test without ordering a CT scan. Methods: Post graduate year 1-4 emergency medicine residents participated in a four hour vertigo day. We developed a mixed cognitive and systems intervention with three components: an online game that began and ended the day, a didactic taught by Dr. Newman-Toker, and a series of small group exercises. The small group sessions included the following: a question and answer session with the lecturer; vertigo special tests (cerebellar assessment, Dix Hall-Pike, Epley maneuver); a head impulse hands-on tutorial using a mannequin; and a video lecture on other tests useful in vertigo evaluation (nystagmus, test of skew, vestibulocular reflex, ataxia). Results: Thirty emergency medicine residents were studied. Before and after the intervention the residents were given a survey in which one question asked ''In a patient with acute vestibular syndrome and a history and exam compatible with vestibular neuritis, I would be willing to discharge the patient without neuroimaging based on an abnormal head impulse test result that I elicited''. Resident answers were based on a sevenpoint Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Twenty-five residents completed both surveys. Of the seven residents who changed their responses pre to post,a significant proportion (100%) changed their answer from disagree/neutral to agree after a 4hour vertigo day (McNemar's Test, p value = 0.0082).",

Additionally, a ''willingness and motivation to improve and learn'' was reported as a strength throughout all the years of training but most frequently reported in the first two years of residency. Entering into conscious incompetence, the second trend identified was ''recognition of limitations and openness to constructive feedback'' that was mentioned frequently in the second and third years of residency.

However, little is known regarding which platforms are best suited for competency assessment. Simulators offer several advantages as an assessment modality, but evidence is lacking regarding their use in this domain. Furthermore, perception of an assessment environment has important influence on the quality of learning outcomes, and procedural skill assessment is ideally conducted on a platform accepted by the learner. Objectives: To ascertain if a simulator performs as well as an unembalmed cadaver with regard to residents' perception of their ability to demonstrate procedural competency during ultrasound (US) guided internal jugular vein (IJ) catheterization. Methods: In this cross-sectional study at an urban community hospital during July of 2011, 15 residents in their second or third year of training from a 3-year EM residency program performed US guided catheterizations of the IJ on both an unembalmed cadaver and a simulator manufactured by Blue Phantom. After the procedure, residents completed an anonymous survey ascertaining how adequately each platform permitted their demonstration of proficiency on predefined procedural steps. Answers were provided on a Likert scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent. P values < 0.10 were considered educationally significant. Results: The median overall rating of the simulator (S) to serve as an assessment platform was similar to that of the cadaver (C) with scores of 8.0 and 8.3 respectively, p = 0.89. Median ratings for permitting the demonstration of specific procedural steps were as follows: Conclusion: Senior EM residents positively rate the Blue Phantom simulator as an assessment platform and similarly to that of a cadaver with regard to permitting their demonstration of procedural competency for US guided IJ catheterization, but did prefer the cadaver to a greater degree when identifying and guiding the needle into the IJ. Methods: In Fall 2011, WCMC and WCMC-Q students taking the course completed a 20 question pre-and post-test. WCMC-Q students also completed a postcourse single-station Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) that evaluated their ability to identify and perform eight actions critical for a first responder in an emergency situation (Table 1) . Results: On both campuses, mean post-test scores were significantly higher than mean pre-test scores (p \u00a3 0.001).

This event has gained acceptance nationally in wilderness medical circles as an excellent way to appreciate the challenges of wilderness medicine, however its effectiveness as a teaching tool has not yet been verified. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine if improvement in simulated clinical and didactic performance can be demonstrated by teams participating in a typical MedWAR event. Methods: We developed a complex clinical scenario and written exam to test the basic tenets that are reinforced through the MedWAR curriculum. Teams were administered the test and scored on a standardized scenario immediately before and after the 2011 Midwest MedWAR race. Teams were not given feedback on their pre-race performance. Scenario performance was based on the number of critical actions correctly performed in the appropriate time frame. Data from the scenario and written exams were analyzed using a standard paired difference t-test. Results: A total of 31 teams participated in both the pre-and post-event scenarios. The teams' pre-race scenario performance was 71.0% (sd = 17.0, n = 31) of critical actions met compared to a post-race performance of 89.7 % (sd = 11.4, n = 31). The mean improvement was 18.7% (sd = 18.7, n = 31, 95% CI 12. 1, 25. 3) with a significant paired two-tailed t-test (p \u00a3 0.01). A total of 95 individual subjects took the written pre-and posttests. The written scores averaged pre-race 84.5% (sd = 12.5, n = 95) and post-race 88.7% (sd = 11.5, n = 95). The mean improvement was 4.2% (sd = 11.7, n = 95, CI )7.5, 15.9), with a significant paired twotailed t-test (p \u00a3 0.01). Conclusion: MedWAR participants demonstrated a significant improvement in both written exam scores and the management of a simulated complex wilderness medical scenario. This strongly suggests that MedWAR is an effective teaching platform for both wilderness medicine knowledge and skills.",

Participants ranked 22 statements on a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree-5 = strongly agree). Statements covered four main domains of barriers related to: 1) education/training, 2) communication, 3) ED environment; 4) personal beliefs. Respondents were also asked if they would call PC consult for 15 ED clinical scenarios (based on established triggers). Results: 30/45 (67%) eligible participants completed the survey (23 residents, 7 faculty), average age was 31 years, 52% (15/29) male, and 58% (15/26) Caucasian. Respondents identified two major barriers to ED-PC provision: lack of 24 hour availability of PC team (mean score 4.4) and lack of access to complete medical records (4.2). Listed domain barriers included: communication-related issues (mean 3.3) like access to family or primary providers, ED environment (2.8) for example chaotic setting with time-constraints, education/training (2.7) related to pain/PC, and personal beliefs regarding end-of-life (2.5). All respondents agreed that they would call PC consult for a 'hospice patient in respiratory distress', and a majority (73%) would consult PC for 'massive intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic arrest, and metastatic cancer'. However, traditional in-patient triggers like frequent re-admits for organ failure issues (dementia, congestive heart failure, and obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations) were infrequently (10%) chosen for PC consult. Conclusion: To enhance PC provision in the ED setting, two main ED physician perceived barriers will likely need to be addressed: lack of access to medical records and lack of 24-7 availability of PC team. ED physicians may not use the same criteria to initiate PC consults as compared to the traditionally established inpatient PC consult trigger models.

MSE was recorded in the chart prior to resident evaluation in 10.9% of cases. ED volume rose by 9.0% between periods. Conclusion: AIT did not affect productivity or acuity of patients seen by EM2s. While some volume was directed away from residents by AIT (patients treated-andreleased by AIT only), overall volume increased and made up the difference. This is similar to previously reported rankings that program directors gave to the same criteria. Although medical students agreed with program directors on the importance of most aspects of the NRMP application areas of discordance included higher medical student ranking for extracurricular activities and a lower relative ranking for AOA status than program directors. This can have implications for medical student mentoring and advising in the future. Background: Emergency care of older adults requires specialized knowledge of their unique physiology, atypical presentations, and care transitions. Older adults often require distinctive assessment, treatment and disposition. Emergency medicine (EM) residents should develop expertise and efficiency in geriatric care. Older adults represent over 25% of most emergency department (ED) volumes. Yet many EM residencies lack curricula or assessment tools for competent geriatric care. The Geriatric Emergency Medicine Competencies (GEMC) are high-impact geriatric topics developed to help residencies meet this demand. Objectives: To examine the effect of a brief GEMC educational intervention on EM resident knowledge. Methods: A validated 29-question didactic test was administered at six EM residencies before and after a GEMC focused lecture delivered summer and fall of 2009. Scores were analyzed as individual questions and in defined topic domains using a paired Student's t-test. Results: A total of 301 exams were included. The testing of didactic knowledge before and after the GEMC educational intervention had high internal reliability (87.9%). The intervention significantly improved scores in all domains (Table 1) . Graded increase in geriatric knowledge occurred by PGY year with the greatest improvement seen at the PGY 3 Level (Table 2) . Conclusion: Even a brief GEMC intervention had a significant effect on EM resident knowledge of critical geriatric topics. A formal GEMC curriculum should be considered in training EM residents for the demands of an ageing population. The overall procedure experience of this incoming class was limited. Most R1s had never received formal education in time management, conflict of interest management, or safe patient trade-off. The majority lacked confidence in their acute and chronic pain management skills. These entry level residents lacked foundational skill levels in many knowledge areas and procedures important to the practice of EM.",

Data were extracted using a standardized data collection tool by trained research personnel. Results: 200 patients were enrolled. Mean (SD) age was 66 (16) and 56.5% were male. Of 58 (29.0%) patients treated with hypothermia, 27 (46.6%) presented with an initial rhythm of VF/VT and 31 (53.4%) presented with PEA or asystole. Nine (33.3%) patients with VF/VT were treated with therapeutic hypothermia and discharged from hospital compared to 2 (6.4%) patients with PEA or asystole (D 26.9%; 95% CI: 6.4%, 46.3%).

Overall mortality was 9% (21 deaths) in the high flow oxygen arm compared with 4% (7 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm; mortality in the subgroup with confirmed COPD was 9% (11 deaths) in the high flow arm compared with 2% (2 deaths) in the titrated oxygen arm. Titrated oxygen treatment reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen by 58% for all patients (p = 0.02) and by 78% for the patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.04). Patients with COPD who received titrated oxygen according to the protocol were significantly less likely to have respiratory acidosis or hypercapnia than were patients who received high flow oxygen. Conclusion: Titrated oxygen treatment significantly reduced mortality, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis compared with high flow oxygen in AECOPD.

Background: Toxic particulates and gases found in ambulance exhaust are associated with acute and chronic health risks. The presence of such materials in areas proximate to ED ambulance parking bays, where emergency services' vehicles are often left running, is potentially of significant concern to ED patients and staff. Objectives: Investigators aimed to determine whether the presence of ambulances correlated with ambient particulate matter concentrations and toxic gas levels at the study site ED. Methods: The Ambulance Exhaust Toxicity in Healthcare-related Exposure and Risk [AETHER] program conducted a prospective observational study at an academic urban ED / Level I trauma center. Environmental ambient gas was sampled over a continuous five-week period from September to October 2011. Two sampling locations in the public triage area (public patient dropoff area without ambulances) and three sampling locations in the ambulance triage area were randomized for 24-hour monitoring windows with a temporal resolution of 2 minutes to obtain 7 days of non-contiguous data for each location. Concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic size (PM2.5), oxygen, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), and carbon monoxide (CO) as well as lower explosive limit for methane (LEL) were monitored with professionally calibrated devices.

Vu 1 , George A. Ralls 1 , Christopher L. Hunter 1 , Zack Weagraff 2 , Linda Papa 1 1 Orlando Regional Medical Center, Orlando, FL; 2 Florida State University College of Medicine, Orlando, FL Background: Prehospital teams must minimize time to EKG acquisition and STEMI recognition to reduce overall time from first medical contact to reperfusion. Auto-racing ''pit crews'' model rapid task completion by pre-assigning roles to team members. Objectives: We compared time-to-completion of key tasks during chest pain evaluation in EMS teams with and without pre-assigned roles. We hypothesized that EMS teams using the ''pit crew'' model would improve time to recognition and treatment of STEMI patients. Methods: A randomized, controlled trial of paramedic students was conducted over 2 months at Orlando Medical Institute, a state-approved paramedic training center. We compared a standard EMS chest pain management algorithm (control) with a pre-assigned tasks (''pit crew'') algorithm (intervention) in the evaluation of simulated chest pain patients. Students were randomized into groups of three; intervention and control groups did not interact after randomization. All students reviewed basic prehospital chest pain management and either the standard or pre-assigned tasks algorithm. Groups encountered three simulated patients. Laerdal SimMan\u00d2 software was used track completion of tasks: taking vital signs, IV access, EKG acquisition and interpretation, ASA administration, hospital STEMI notification, and total time on scene. Results: We conducted 54 simulated-patient encounters (30 control / 24 intervention encounters). Mean time-to-completion of each task was compared in the control and intervention groups respectively. Time to obtain vital signs was 4:18 vs. 2:21 min (P = 0.001); time to ASA administration was 3:54 vs 2:00 min (P < 0.001); time to EKG acquisition was 5:39 vs 3:42 min (P < 0.001); time to EKG interpretation was 6:43 vs 4:21 min (P < 0.001); time to IV access was 5:42 vs 4:45 min (P = 0.05); time to STEMI notification was 7:19 vs 4:26 min (P < 0.001); and time to scene completion was 9:02 vs 5:27 min (P < 0.001).",

The difference in pre-shock pause duration was statistically significant with p < 0.001. Conclusion: These data indicate that after a simple educational intervention emphasizing decreasing time off chest prior to defibrillation the pre-shock pause duration decreased. Future research must describe the sustainability of this intervention as well as the effects this process measure may have on outcomes such as survival to hospital discharge.

The obesity trend has demonstrated a tendency towards insufficient pediatric weight estimations from the BT, and thus potential under-dosing of resuscitation medications.",

            "text": "Objectives: This study compared drug dosing based on the BT with dosing from a novel electronic tool (ET) that accounts for provider estimation of body habitus. Methods: Data were obtained from a prospective convenience sample of children ages 1 to 8 years arriving to a pediatric emergency department. A clinician performed an assessment of body habitus (average/underweight, overweight, or obese), blinded to the patient's actual weight and parental weight estimate. Parental estimate of weight and measured length and weight were collected. Epinephrine dosing was calculated from the measured weight, the BT measurement, as well as from a smart-phone tool based on the measured length and clinician's estimate of body habitus, and a modified tool (MT) incorporating the parent estimate of habitus. The Wilcoxson rank-sum test was used to compare median percent differences in dosing. Results: One hundred children (mean age 3 years) were analyzed; 47% were overweight or obese. Clinicians correctly identified children as overweight/obese 23% of time (CI 0.12-0.38). Adding parent estimate of weight improved this to a sensitivity of 74% (CI 0.59-0.86). The median difference between the weight-based epinephrine dose and BT dose was 11%. For the ET the median difference from the weight-based dose was 7% (p = 0.05 compared to the BT), and for the MT was 1.7% (p < 0.01 compared to the BT). When a clinically significant difference was defined as \u00b110% of the actual dose, BT was within that range 40% of the time, ET was within range 56% of the time (p = 0.02), and MT was within range 64% of the time ( Background: In most out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) events, a call to 9-1-1 is the first action by bystanders. Accurate diagnosis of cardiac arrest by the call taker depends on the caller's verbal description. If cardiac arrest is not suspected, then no telephone CPR instructions will be given. Objectives: We measured the effect of a change in the EMS call taker question sequence on the accuracy of diagnosis of cardiac arrest by 9-1-1 call takers. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) dataset for January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2011 from a city, population 750,000, with a longstanding telephone CPR program (APCO). We included OHCA cases of any age who were in arrest prior to the arrival of EMS and for whom resuscitation was attempted. In early 2010, 9-1-1 call takers were taught to follow a revised telephone script that emphasized focused questions, assertive control of the caller, and provision of hands-only CPR instructions. The medical director personally explained the reasons for the changes, emphasizing the importance of assertive control of the caller and the comparative safety of chest compressions in patients not in cardiac arrest. Beginning in 2010, call recordings were reviewed regularly with feedback to the call taker by the 9-1-1 center leadership. The main outcome measure was sensitivity of the 9-1-1 call taker in diagnosing cardiac arrest. Bystander CPR was reported by EMS crews attending the event. We compared 2009 with 2010 and 2011 using the v 2 test and odds ratios (OR).",

Our hypothesis is that capnography is 100% accurate in determining endotracheal tube location, even in low perfusion states. Methods: This cross-sectional study reviewed a detailed prehospital cardiac arrest database that regularly records information using the Utstein style. In addition, the EMS department quality manager routinely logs the presence of an alveolar (four-phase) capnographic waveform in this database. The study population included all cardiac arrest patients from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 managed by a single EMS agency in Orange County, Florida. Patients were included if they had endotracheal intubation performed, had capnographic measurement obtained, failed to regain return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and had an autopsy performed. The main outcome was the correlation of the presence of an alveolar waveform and the location of the ETT at autopsy. Results: During the study period, 921 cardiac arrests were recorded. Of these, 263 had an advanced airway placed (ETT or laryngeal tube airway), and no ROSC. Of the 263 advanced airway cases, 73 were managed with an ETT. Autopsies were performed on 30 of these patients and resulted in our study cohort. The location of the ETT at autopsy was recorded on all 30 of these cases. Capnographic waveforms were recorded in the field in all 30 of these study patients, and 100% of the tubes were located within the trachea at autopsy. The sensitivity of capnography in determining proper endotracheal tube location was 100% in this study. Conclusion: In our study, the presence of a capnographic waveform was 100% reliable in confirming proper placement of endotracheal tubes placed in outof-hospital patients with poor perfusion states. Results: Over 60 variables were presented to the 34 EMS medical directors responding (100% survey population captured). Among the myriad of responses, 14 (42%) initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) at 30 compressions to 2 ventilations consistent with IL-COR/AHA guidelines. Seven (21%) initiate continuous chest compressions from the start of CPR with no pause and interposed ventilations. Nine (26%) begin chest compressions only during the first 2-3 minutes, with either passive oxygenation by oxygen mask (six; 18%) or no oxygen (three; 9%). Airway management following non-invasive oxygenation and ventilation by primary endotracheal intubation occurs in 12 systems (35%), while six (18%) use supraglottic devices. Fourteen (42%) allow paramedics to decide between endotracheal and supraglottic device placement. Thirty systems (88%) utilize continuous waveform capnography. The initial approach to non-EMS witnessed ventricular fibrillation is chest compression prior to first defibrillation in 30 systems (88%). Eighteen systems (52%) escalate defibrillation energy settings, with four systems (12%) utilizing dual sequential defibrillation. Twenty (59%) initiate therapeutic hypothermia in the field. Conclusion: Wide variability in CA care standards exists in America's largest urban EMS systems in mid-2011, with many current practices promoting more continuity in chest compressions than specified in the 2010 ILCOR/AHA guidelines. Endotracheal intubation, a past mainstay of CA airway management, is deemphasized in many systems. Immediate defibrillation of non-EMS witnessed ventricular fibrillation is uncommon.

The average age for this group was 68.47 years. There were 45 female (39.13%) and 70 male (60.86%) participants. The average time to start CPR was 14.60 minutes. Transportation to the ED was 71.3% by EMS and 25.22% by private vehicle. A total of 68 events were witnessed (59.13%). The survival rate to hospital admission was 23.66%. The overall cardiac arrest survival was 9.30% and overall neurologically intact survival was 4.30%. Neurologically intact survival at 6 and 12 months was 2.15%. The rate of bystander CPR in our population was 16.13% with a survival rate of 6.66%. Conclusion: Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the area served by the UPR Hospital is low but comparable to other cities in the US as reported by the CDC Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES). This low survival rate might be due to low bystander CPR rate and prolonged time to start CPR. Background: Hyperventilation has been directly correlated with increased mortality for out-of-hospital CPR. EMS providers may hyperventilate patients at levels above national BLS guidelines. Real-time feedback devices, such as ventilation timers, have been shown to improve CPR ventilation rates towards BLS standards. It remains unclear if the combination of a ventilation timer and pre-simulation instruction would influence overall ventilation rates and potentially reduce undesired hyperventilation.",

Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are life-saving devices in public locations that can significantly improve survival. An estimated 1 million AEDs have been sold in the US; however, little is known about whether locations of AEDs match OH-CAs.

Included were OHCAs of presumed cardiac etiology in individuals 12 years of age or older. Excluded were OH-CAs of presumed traumatic etiology, cases where resuscitation was terminated at the scene, and those dead on arrival. AED locations in Philadelphia were obtained from MyHeartMap, a database of installed and wallmounted AEDs in Pennsylvania. We used GIS mapping software to visualize where OHCAs occurred relative to where AEDs were located and to determine the radius of OHCAs to AEDs. Arrests within a 200, 400, and 600 foot radius of AEDs were identified using the attribute location selection option in ArcGIS. The lengths of radii were estimated based on the average time it would take for a person to walk to and from an AED (200 feet2 minutes; 400 feet4 minutes; 600 feet6 minutes). Results: We mapped 3,483 OHCAs and 2,314 AEDs in Philadelphia County. OHCAs occurred in males (55%; 1916/3483) and the mean age was 65.4 years. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in 19% (662/3483).

The figure (large black circles) illustrates AED/OHCA within 200 feet on the left and 600 feet on the right. Conclusion: AEDs were rarely close to the locations of OHCAs, which may be a contributor to low cardiac arrest survival rates.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 190 post-arrest patients admitted to an academic medical center between January, 2000 and December, 2007 who had arterial blood gases (ABG) drawn after ROSC. Demographic variables were analyzed using ANOVA and chi-square tests as appropriate. Unadjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hypoxia (PaO 2 < 60 mmHg), normoxia (60-300 mmHg), hyperoxia (>300 mmHg), and mortality. Results: On first ABG (190 patients), 37 (19.5%) were hypoxic, 92 (48.4%) normoxic, and 61 (32.1%) hyperoxic. The average age of the cohort was 62.8 years (no difference for hypoxic, normoxic, and hyperoxic patients). Overall mortality was 70.5% (134/190). There were no significant differences between initial heart rate, systolic blood pressure, sex, race, or pre-arrest functional status. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher when the first ABG demonstrated hypoxia (94.6%; 35/ 37) than for normoxia (68.5%; 63/92) or hyperoxia (59%; 36/61). In unadjusted logistic regression analysis of first PaO 2 values, hyperoxia was not associated with increased mortality (OR 0.7; 95% CI 0.3-1.4) but hypoxia was associated with increased mortality (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.4-27.5). Conclusion: Hypoxia but not hyperoxia on first ABG was associated with mortality in a cohort of post-arrest patients. Background: There are over 330,000 deaths due to cardiac arrest per year in the US. The AHA recommends monitoring the quality of CPR primarily through the use of end tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ). The level of ETCO 2 is significantly dependant on minute ventilation and altered by pressor and bicarbonate use. Cerebral oximetry (CereOx) uses near infrared spectroscopy to non-invasively measure oxygen saturation of the frontal lobes of the brain. CereOx has been correlated with cerebral blood flow and jugular vein bulb saturations. Objectives: The objective of this study is to compare the simultaneous measurement of ETCO 2 and CereOx to investigate which monitoring method provides the best measure of CPR quality as defined by return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Methods: A prospective cohort of a convenient sample of patients using out-of-hospital and ED cardiac arrest from two large EDs. Patients were monitored simultaneously by ETCO 2 and CereOx during CPR. Patient demographics and arrest data were collected using the Utstein criteria. All patients were monitored throughout the resuscitation efforts. ROSC was defined as a palpable pulse and a measurable blood pressure for a minimum of thirty minutes. Results: Twenty two patients were enrolled with complete data sets; 27% of the subjects had ROSC. Average down time of ROSC subjects was 12 minutes (SD \u00b1 14.6) and 31 minutes (SD \u00b1 17.8) for subjects without ROSC. The inability to obtain a value of 30 either for ETCO 2 or CereOx was 50% and 75% specific with an 80% and 100% NPV respectively for predicting lack of ROSC. Obtaining a value of 30 either for ETCO 2 or CereOx was 66% and 100% sensitive, respectively in identifying ROSC. Subjects with ROSC had sustained values above 30 for 1.25 mins on CereOx and 4.9 mins on ETCO 2 prior to ROSC. The increase in values over a three minute period prior to ROSC was 13.5 on CereOx and 1.3 on ETCO 2 . Conclusion: The inability to obtain a value of 30 on either the ETCO 2 or CereOx strongly predicted lack of ROSC. CereOx provides a larger magnitude and closer temporal increase prior to ROSC than ETCO 2 . Attaining a value of 30 on CereOx was more predictive of ROSC than ETCO 2.",

When all vital signs were missing, RA rated 69.1% of transfers as poor, whereas when all VS were present 80.8% of transfers were considered good. Conclusion: EMS and ED staff felt transfers of care were professional, teams were attentive, and had similar amounts of interruptions for both medical and trauma cases. Their perception of transfer of care was similar even when key information was missing, although external observers rated a significant amount of transfers poorly. Thus, EMS and ED staffs were not able to evaluate their own performance in a transfer of care and external observers were found to be better evaluators of transfers of care.",

Conclusion: We identified a need for a revised curriculum on management of psychiatric emergencies. Future steps will focus on development of a curriculum and change in knowledge after implementation of this curriculum.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all prehospital intubations from an urban/suburban ambulance service (Professional Ambulance, Inc.) over a five-year period (January 01, 2006 to December 31, 2010). Characteristics of airway management by paramedics with 0-5 years of experience (Group 1) were compared to those with greater than 5 years of experience (Group 2). Airway management was guided by Massachusetts statewide treatment protocols governing direct laryngoscopy and all adjunctive approaches. Attempts are characterized by laryngoscope blade passing the lips. Difficult and failed airways were managed with extraglottic devices (EGD) or needle cricothyroidotomy. We reviewed patient characteristics, intubation methods, rescue techniques, and adverse events. Results: 150 patients required airway management: 120 (80%) were performed by Group 1 and 30 (20%) were performed by Group 2. Group 1 was both faster to intubate (1.39 vs 1.83 attempts, p = 0.0035) and less likely to use a rescue device (19.1% vs 50.0%, p = 0.0009). Both are equally likely to go directly to a rescue device (10% vs 10%, p = 1.0). All patients were successfully oxygenated and ventilated with either an endotracheal tube or EGD. No surgical airways were performed and no patients died as a result of a failed airway. Conclusion: While intubation success rates of paramedics with less than and greater than five years of experience are similar, less experienced paramedics use fewer attempts and are less likely to use a rescue device. Both recognize difficult airways and go directly to rescue devices equally. This highlights difficulties faced maintaining competence. Education requirements must be evaluated and redesigned to allow paramedics to maintain competence and emphasize airway management according to the latest resuscitation guidelines.",

Methods: All transports for pediatric patients from the scene by a large urban general EMS provider that were prioritized as low acuity by initial 9-1-1 dispatch protocols were identified. Protocols were based on the National Academy of Medical Priority Dispatch System, v12. Starting on Jan 1, 2010, 100 consecutive cases of patients transported to three pediatric emergency departments (PED) of a large tertiary care pediatric health care system were reviewed. Demographics, PED visit characteristics, resource utilization, and disposition were recorded. Those patients who received meds other than PO antipyretics, had labs other than a strep test, a radiology study, a procedure, or were not discharged home were categorized into the significant ED resource utilization group. Results: 93% of the patients were African American and either had public insurance or self-pay (86%, 13% respectively). The median age was 11 months (4d-13yr). 54% were female. None of these low-acuity patients were upgraded by EMS operators en route. Upon arrival to the PED, 45% of transported patients were classified into the significant utilization group. Six of the 100 total patients were admitted, including a 2 y/o requiring emergent intubation, an 8 m/o old with a broken CVL, a 6 y/o with sickle cell pain crisis, and a 2 y/o with altered mental status. The remainder of the significant resource utilization group consisted of children needing procedures, anti-emetics, narcotic pain control, labs, and xrays. Conclusion: In this general EMS 9-1-1 system, dispatch protocols for pediatric patients classified as low priority did poorly in predicting subsequent ED utilization with 45% requiring significant resources. Further, EMS operators did not recognize a critical child who needed emergent intervention. Opportunity exists to refine general EMS 9-1-1 protocols for children in order to more accurately define an EMS priority status that better correlates with ultimate needs and resource utilization.",

Methods: Retrospective cohort review as part of the ongoing QA process of all patients who had IN naloxone administration by BLS providers. The study was part of a special projects waiver by Massachusetts OEMS from February 2011 through November 2011 in a busy urban tiered EMS system in the metro-Boston area. Exclusion criteria: cardiac arrest. Demographic information was collected, as well as vital signs, number of naloxone doses by BLS, patient response to BLS naloxone administration (clinical improvement in mental status and/or respiratory status), ALS intercept. Descriptive statistics and confidence intervals are reported using Microsoft Excel and SPSS 17.0. Results: Fifty-six cases of BLS-administered IN naloxone were identified, and 2 were excluded as cardiac arrests. The included cases had a mean age of 38.8 years \u00b113.5 (range 16-82), and 74% (CI 60-85) were male. Of the 54 included cases, 76% (CI 62-87) of patients responded to BLS administration of naloxone. Of the responders, 17% (CI 7-32) required two doses. There were 10 protocol violations representing 19% (CI 9.2-31.4) of the total administrations, however in 100% of these 10 protocol violations the patients had a positive response to the administration of IN naloxone. Seven of the protocol violations were patients who required a second 2 mg dose of naloxone. Eleven cases did not have an ALS intercept; only 1 of these 11 patients did not respond to BLS administration of naloxone. There were no identified adverse events. Conclusion: BLS providers safely and successfuly administered IN naloxone achieving a response rate consistent with studies of ALS providers' administration of IN naloxone. Given the success rate of BLS providers, it may be feasible for BLS to manage responders without the aid of an ALS intercept. Background: An estimated 20% of patients arriving by ambulance to the ED are in moderate to severe pain. However, the management of pain in the prehospital setting has been shown to be inadequate, and untreated pain may have negative consequences for patients.

Cases were included if the private EMS service was the first medical provider on scene, the case was priority 1, and the patient was 13 years and older. A 12-month time period was used for the data evaluation. Four diagnoses were examined: motor vehicle crash injuries, penetrating trauma, difficulty breathing, and chest pain complaints. Ambulance response times were assessed for each of the four different complaints. The patients' initial vital signs were assessed and the number of vital signs out of range was recorded. A sampling of all cases which went to the single major trauma center was selected for evaluation of hospital outcome. Using this hospital sample, number of vital signs out of range were assessed as a surrogate marker indicating severity of hospital outcome. Correlation coefficients were used to evaluate interactions between independent and outcome variables. Results: Of the 2164 cases we reviewed over the 12month period, we found that the EMS service responded significantly faster to trauma complaints at 4.53 minutes (n = 254) than medical complaints at 5.92 minutes (n = 1910) . In the hospital sample of 587 cases, number of vital signs out of range were positively correlated with hospital days (r = 0.11), admits (r = 0.12), ICU admits (r = 0.10), and deaths (r = 0.09), but not response times (r = (-)0.08). In the entire sample, there was no correlation between vital signs out of range and response times for any diagnosis (see figure) .

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 98 consecutive patients receiving prehospital ketamine from paramedics in the suburban/rural EMS system of Montgomery County Hospital District, Texas between August 1, 2010 and October 25, 2011. Ketamine administration indications were: need for rapid control of violent/agitated patients requiring treatment and transport; sedation and analgesia after trauma; facilitation of intubation and mechanical ventilation. Ketamine administration contraindications were: equivalent ends achieved by less invasive means; hypertensive crisis; angina; signs of significantly elevated intracranial pressure; anticipated inability to support or control airway. All patients were included, regardless of indication for ketamine administration. Data were abstracted from electronic patient care records and available continuous physiologic monitoring data, and analyzed for the presence of adverse effects as defined a priori in ''Clinical Practice Guidelines for Emergency Department Ketamine Dissociative Sedation: 2011 Update.'' Results: No patients were identified as experiencing adverse effects as defined by the referenced literature. Ketamine was utilized most often for patients with the following NEMSIS Provider's Primary Impression: 25 (26%) altered level of consciousness, 23 (23%) behavioral/psychiatric, 20 (20%) traumatic injury. Overall, combativeness was associated with 64 (65%) patients. The mean age was 41 years (range 3-94 years) and 50 (51%) were male. The mean ketamine dose was 150 mg (range 25-500 mg) and twenty-four (24%) patients received multiple administrations. Conclusion: In this patient population, our data indicate that prehospital ketamine use by EMS paramedics, across all indications for administration, was safe. Further study of ketamine's utility in EMS is warranted.",

Methods: The Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) Project is an NIH-funded evaluation of the effect of implementing the EMS TBI Guidelines throughout Arizona (NINDS-1R01NS071049-01A1). To accomplish this, a partnership was developed between the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS), the University of Arizona, and more than 100 EMS agencies that serve approximately 85% of the state's population. Results: EBG implementation: Implementation follows all routine regulatory processes for making changes in EMS protocols. In Arizona, the entire project must be carried out under the authority of the ADHS Director. Evaluation: A before-after system design is used (randomization is not acceptable). HIPAA: As an ADHSapproved public health initiative, EPIC is exempt from HIPAA, allowing sharing of Protected Health Information between participating entities. For EPIC, the State Attorney General provided official verification of HI-PAA exemption, thus allowing direct linkage of EMS and hospital data. IRB: Once EPIC was officially deemed a public health initiative, the university IRB process was engaged. As an officially sanctioned public health project, EPIC was determined to not be human subjects research. This allows the project to implement and evaluate the effect of this initiative without requiring individual informed consent. Conclusion: By utilizing an EMS-Public Health-University partnership, the ethical and regulatory challenges related to evaluating implementation of new EBGs can be successfully overcome. The integration of the Department of Health, the Attorney General, and the university IRB can properly protect citizens while permitting efficient implementation and rigorous evaluation of the effect of EBGs. This novel approach may be useful as a model for evaluation of implementing EMS EBGs in other states and large counties. (20.6%-58.1% by age) were transported to non-trauma centers.

Events were excluded if they were unable to be geocoded (n = 41), outside Denver County (n = 8), or occurred in a jail (n = 3), hospital/ physician's office (n = 7), or nursing home (n = 74). For high OHCA incidence: LMI identified 29 census tracts, Gi* identified 45 census tracts, and the SEB method identified 28 census tracts. Twenty-five census tracts were identified by all three methods. For low bystander CPR prevalence: LMI identified 9 census tracts, Gi* identified 16 census tracts, and 101 census tracts were identified as being in the lowest quartile of CPR prevalence. Twenty-four census tracts were identified by two of the three methods. Two census tracts were identified as high-risk having both high OHCA incidence and low CPR prevalence (Figure) . High-risk census tract demographics as compared to Denver County are shown in the Table. Conclusion: The two high-risk census tracts, comprised of minority and low-income populations, appear to be possible sites for targeted community-based CPR interventions. Objectives: We sought to assess the accuracy and correlation of geographic information system (GIS) derived transport time compared to actual EMS transport time in OHCA patients. Methods: Prospective, observational cohort analysis of OHCA patients in Vancouver, B.C., one of the sites of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC). A random sample from all of the OHCA cases from 12/05 through 05/07 was selected for analysis from one site of the ROC Epistry. Using GIS, EMS transport time was derived from reported latitude/longitude coordinates of the OHCA event to the actual receiving hospital. This was calculated via the actual network distance using ArcGIS. This GIS-derived time was then compared to the actual EMS transport time (in minutes) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Scatter plot analysis of actual vs. GIS times were created to evaluate the relationship between actual and calculated time. A linear regression model predicting actual EMS transport time from the derived GIS-time was also developed in order to examine the potential relationship between the two variables. Differences in the relationship were also investigated based on time of the day to reflect varying traffic conditions. Results: 641 cases were randomly selected for analysis. The median actual transport time was significantly longer than the median GIS derived transport time (7.08 minutes vs. 5.50 minutes). Scatter plot analysis did not reveal any significant correlation between actual and GIS-based time. Additionally, there was poor approximation of GIS-based time and actual EMS time (R 2 = 0.20) with no evidence of a significant linear relationship between the two. The poorest correlation of time was observed during the morning hours (07:00-09:00; R 2 = 0.02) while the strongest correlation was during the overnight hours (00:00-07:00; R 2 = 0.26).",

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected cardiac arrest data from a large, urban EMS system. Our population included all OHCAs with a recorded social security number (which we used to determine 30-day survival through the Social Security Death Index) that were transported to a hospital between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2010. We excluded traumatic arrests, pediatric arrests, and hospitals receiving less than 10 OHCAs with social security numbers over the three-year study period. We examined the associa-tion between receiving hospital and 30-day survival. Additional variables examined included: Level I trauma center status, teaching hospital status, OHCA volume, and whether post-arrest therapeutic hypothermia (TH) protocols were in place in 2008. Statistics were performed using chi-square tests and logistic regression. Results: Our study population comprised 550 arrest cases delivered to 18 unique hospitals with an overall 30-day survival of 14.4%. Mean age was 69.0 (SD 16.2) years. Males comprised 54.2% of the cohort; 53.3% of victims were black. Thirty-day survival varied significantly among the hospitals, ranging from 4.8% to 35.0% (chi-square 32.3, p = 0.014). OHCAs delivered to Level I trauma centers were significantly more likely to survive (19.5% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.05), as were those delivered to hospitals known to offer post-arrest TH (19.2% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.018). Hospital teaching status and OHCA volume were not associated with survival. Conclusion: There was significant variability in OHCA survival by hospital. Patients were significantly more likely to survive if transported to a Level I trauma center or hospital with post-arrest TH protocols, suggesting a potential role for regionalization of OHCA care. Limiting our population to OHCAs with recorded social security numbers reduced our power and may have introduced selection bias. Further work will include survival data on the complete set of OHCAs transported to hospitals during the three-year study period. Background: Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. Previous studies suggest that prehospital intubation in patients with TBI may be associated with mortality.

These associations persisted despite survival time, and while adjusting for injury severity. Background: SBDP150 is a breakdown product of the cytoskeletal protein alpha-II-spectrin found in neurons and has been detected in severe TBI. Objectives: This study examined whether early serum levels of SBDP150 could distinguish: 1) mild TBI from three control groups; 2) those with and without traumatic intracranial lesions on CT (+CT vs -CT); and 3) those having a neurosurgical intervention (+NSG vs -NSG) in mild and moderate TBI (MMTBI). Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled adult patients presenting to two Level I trauma centers following MMTBI with blunt head trauma with loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation and a GCS 9-15. Control groups included uninjured controls and trauma controls presenting to the ED with orthopedic injuries or an MVC without TBI. Mild TBI was defined as GCS 15 and moderate TBI as having a GCS <15. Blood samples were obtained in all patients within 4 hours of injury and measured by ELISA for SBDP150 (ng/ml). The main outcomes were: 1) the ability of SBDP150 to distinguish mild TBI from three control groups; 2) to distinguish +CT from -CT and; 3) to distinguish +NSG from -NSG. Data were expressed as means with 95%CI, and performance was tested by ROC curves (AUC and 95%CI). Results: There were 275 patients enrolled: 54 TBI patients (42 GCS 15, 12 GCS 9-14), 23 trauma controls (16 MVC controls and 7 orthopedic controls), and 198 uninjured controls. The mean age of TBI patients was 39 years (range 19-70) with 63% males. Fourteen (14%) had a +CT and 9% had +NSG. Mean serum SBDP150 levels were 0.764 (95%CI 0.561-0.968) in normal controls, 1.035 (0.091-2.291) in orthopedic controls, 1.209 (0.236-2.181 ) in MVC controls, 2.764 (1.700-3.827 ) in mild TBI with GCS 15, and 5.227 (0.837-9.617) in TBI with GCS 9-14 (P < 0.001). The AUC for distinguishing mild TBI from both controls was 0.83 (95%CI 0.68-0.99). Mean SBDP150 levels in patients with -CT versus +CT were 2.170 (1.340-3.000) and 6.797 (2.227-11.368) respectively (P < 0.001) with AUC = 0.78 (95%CI 0.61-0.95). Mean SBDP150 levels in patients with -NSG versus +NSG were 2.492 (1.391-3.593) and 6.867 (3.891-9.843) respectively (P < 0.001) with AUC = 0.88 (95%CI 0.77-0.98).

Further research with a larger sample of MMTBI patients will be required to better understand and validate these findings. Background: Acetaminophen (APAP) poisoning is the most frequent cause of acute hepatic failure in the US. Toxicity requires bioactivation of APAP to toxic metabolites, primarily via CYP2E1. Children are less susceptible to APAP toxicity; one current theory is that children's conjugative pathway (sulfonation) is more active. Liquid APAP preparations contain propylene glycol (PG), a common excipient that inhibits APAP bioactivation and reduces hepatocellular injury in vitro and in rodents. CYP2E1 inhibition may decrease toxicity in children, who tend to ingest liquid APAP preparations, and suggests a potential novel therapy. Objectives: To compare phase I (toxic) and phase II (conjugative) metabolism of liquid versus solid prepara-tions of APAP. We hypothesize that ingestion of a liquid APAP preparation results in decreased production of toxic metabolites relative to a solid preparation, likely due to the presence of PG in the liquid preparations.",

INTERVENTIONS-Subjects were randomized to receive a 15 mg/kg dose of a commercially available solid or liquid APAP preparation. After a washout period of greater than 1 week, subjects received the same dose of APAP in the alternate preparation. APAP, APAP-glucuronide and APAP-sulfate (phase 2 metabolites), APAP-cysteinate and APAP-mercapturate (phase 1 metabolites) were analyzed via LC/MS in plasma over 8 hours. Peak concentrations and measured AUC were compared using paired-sample T-tests. Plasma PG levels were measured. Results: Fifteen subjects completed the protocol. Peak concentrations and AUCs of the CYP2E1 derived toxic metabolites were significantly lower following ingestion of the liquid preparation (Table, Figure) . The glucuronide and sulfate metabolites were not different. PG was present following ingestion of liquid but not solid preparations. Conclusion: Ingestion of liquid relative to solid preparations in therapeutic doses results in decreased plasma levels of toxic APAP metabolites. This may be due to inhibition of CYP2E1 by PG, and may explain the decreased susceptibility in children. A less hepatotoxic formulation of APAP can potentially be developed if co-formulated with a CYP2E1 inhibitor.

Methods: Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval was obtained. This was a randomized, observational pilot study using a porcine model. Ten pigs (17.3 kg to 25.6 kg) were sedated and intubated for 5 hours. Pigs were injected subcutaneously in the left distal foreleg with 10 mg of lyophilized M. fulvius venom resuspended in water, to a depth of 3 mm. Pigs were randomly assigned to either a control group (no compression bandage and splint) or a treatment group (compression bandage and splint) approximately 1 minute after envenomation. Pigs were monitored daily for 21 days for signs of respiratory depression, decreased oxygen saturations, and paresis/paralysis. In case of respiratory depression, pigs were euthanized and time to death recorded. Chi-square was used to compare rates of survival up to 21 days and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve constructed. Results: Average survival time of control animals was 412 \u00b1 90 minutes compared to 12,642 \u00b1 7,132 minutes for treated animals. Significantly more pigs in the treatment group survived to 24 hours than in the control group (p = 0.03). Two of the treatment pigs survived to the endpoint of 21 days, but showed necrosis of the distal lower extremity. Conclusion: Long-term survival after coral snake envenomation is possible in the absence of antivenin with the use of pressure immobilization bandages. The applied pressure of the bandage is critical to allowing survival without secondary consequences (i.e. necrosis) of envenomation. Future studies should be designed to accurately monitor the pressures applied. Background: Patients exposed to organophosphate (OP) compounds demonstrate a central apnea.

C. scutulatus venom from a single snake with known type B (hemorrhagic) activity was obtained from the National Natural Toxins Research Center. Measurement of platelet aggregation by an aggregometer was performed using five standard concentrations of epinephrine (a known platelet aggregator) on platelet-rich plasma over time, and a mean area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Five different sample groups were measured: 1) blood alone; 2) blood + C. scutulatus venom (0.3 mg/mL); 3) blood + crotaline Fab AV (100 mg/mL); 4) blood + venom + AV (100 mg/ mL); 5) blood + venom + AV (4 mg/mL). Standard errors of the mean (SEM) were calculated for each group. Results: Antivenom administration by itself did not significantly affect platelet aggregation compared to baseline (103.8 \u00b1 3.4%, p = 0.47). Administration of venom decreased platelet aggregation (72.0 \u00b1 8.5%, p < 0.05). Concentrated AV administration in the presence of venom normalized platelet aggregation (101.4 \u00b1 6.8%) and in the presence of diluted AV significantly increased aggregation (133.9 \u00b1 9.0%); p < 0.05 for both groups when compared to the venom-only group. To control for the effects of the venom and AV, each was run independently in platelet-rich plasma without epinephrine; neither was found to significantly alter platelet aggregation. Conclusion: Crotaline Fab AV improved platelet aggregation in an in vitro model of platelet dysfunction induced by venom from C. scutulatus. The mechanism of action remains unclear but may involve inhibition of venom binding to platelets or a direct action of the antivenom on platelets.

Conclusion: Our data show that in this rat model ILE pretreatment leads to a significant difference in MAP response to epinephrine, but no difference in HR response. ILE delayed the peak effect and prolonged the duration of effect on MAP but did not alter the peak increase in MAP.

Smith, Benjamin Bregman, Janice Blanchard, Nasser Hashim, Mary Pat McKay George Washington University, Washington, DC Background: The literature suggests there is a high rate of undiagnosed depression in ED patients and that early intervention can reduce overall morbidity and health care costs. There are several well validated screening tools for depression including the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). A tool using a two-question subset, the PHQ-2, has been shown to be an easily administered, reasonably sensitive screening tool for depression in primary care settings. Objectives: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-2 in detecting major depressive disorders (MDD) among adult ED patients presenting to an urban teaching hospital. We hypothesize that the PHQ-2 is a rapid, effective screening tool for depression in a general ED population. Methods: Cross sectional survey of a convenience sample of 1012 adult, non-critically ill, English speaking patients with medical and not psychiatric complaints presenting to the ED between 9am and 11pm weekdays. Patients were screened for MDD with the PHQ-9. We used SPSS v19.0 to analyze the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and kappa of PHQ-2 scores of 2 and 3 (out of possible total score of 6) compared to a validated cut-off score of 10 or higher of 27 points on the PHQ-9. The two questions on the PHQ-2 are: ''Over the last two weeks, how often have you had little interest in doing things? How often have you felt down, depressed or hopeless?'' Responses are scored from 0-3 based on ''never'',''several days'', ''more than half'', ''nearly every day''.",

Table 1 outlines the percent of subjects who were positive and the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values and kappa for each cut-off on the PHQ-2.

Given the simplicity and ease of using a two-item questionnaire and the high rates of undiagnosed depression in the ED, including this brief, self-administered screening tool to ED patients may allow for early awareness of possible MDD and appropriate evaluation and referral. patients. However, much of this self-harm behavior is not discovered clinically and very little is known about the prevalence and predictors of current ED screening practices.

Eight U.S. EDs reviewed charts in real time for 35-40 hours a week between 8/ 2010 and 11/2011. All patients presenting during enrollment shifts were characterized as to whether a selfharm screening had been performed by ED clinicians. A subset of patients with a positive screening was asked about the presence of self-harm ideation, attempts, or both by trained research staff. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of screening and of current self-harm. Data were clustered by site. In each model we examined day and time of presentation, age < 65 years, sex, race, and ethnicity. Results: Of the 92,154 patients presenting during research shift, 24,240 (26%) were screened for self-harm. Screening rates varied among sites and ranged from 4% to 32%, with one outlier at 93%. Of those screened, 2,471 (10%) had current self-harm. Among those with selfharm approached by study personnel (n = 1,037), 916 (88%) had thoughts of self-harm (suicidal or non-suicidal), 806 (78%) had thoughts of suicide, 444 (43%) had self-harm behavior, and 316 (31%) had suicide attempt(s) over the preceding week. Predictors of being screened were: age < 65 years, male sex, weekend presentation, and night shift presentation (Table) . Among those screened, predictors of current self-harm were: age < 65 years, white race, and night shift presentation. Conclusion: Screening for self-harm is uncommon in ED settings, though practices vary dramatically by site. Patients presenting at night and on weekends are more likely to be screened, as are those under age 65 and males. Current self-harm is more common among those presenting on night shift, those under age 65, and whites. Results: There were 1328 out-of-hospital records reviewed, and hospital discharge data were available in 1120 non-cardiac arrest patients. Of the 1120 patients, 1084 (96.8%) patients survived to hospital discharge and 36 (3.2%) died during hospitalization. The mean age of those transported was 54 years (SD20), 612 (55%) were male, 128 (11%) were trauma-related, and 112 (10%) were admitted to the ICU.

Methods: Randomized, controlled trial comparing usual care versus CPAP (Whisperflow\u00d2) in a prehospital setting, for adults experiencing severe respiratory distress, with falling respiratory efforts, due to a presumed ACPE. Patients were randomised to receive either usual care, including conventional medications (nitrates, furosemide, and oxygen) plus bag-valve-mask ventilation, versus conventional medications plus CPAP. The primary outcome was prehospital or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were need for tracheal intubation, length of hospital stay, change in vital signs, and arterial blood gas results. We calculated relative risk with 95% CIs. Results: Fifty patients were enrolled with mean age 79AE8 (SD 11AE9), male 56AE0%, mortality 20AE0%. The risk of death was significantly reduced in the CPAP arm with mortality 34AE6% (9 deaths) in the usual care arm compared to 4AE2% (1 death) in the CPAP arm (RR, 0AE12; 95% CI 0AE02 to 0AE88; p = 0AE04).

The length of hospital stay was significantly less in the patients who received CPAP (mean difference 2AE3 days; 95% CI )0AE01 to 4AE6, p = 0AE05). Conclusion: We found that CPAP significantly reduced mortality, respiratory acidosis, and length of hospital stay for patients in severe respiratory distress caused by ACPE.

Background: Because emergency service utilization continues to climb, validated methods to safely identify and triage low-acuity patients to either alternate care destinations or a complaint-appropriate level of EMS response is of keen interest to EMS systems and potentially payers. Though the literature generally supports the Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) as a tool to predict low-acuity patients by various standards, correlation with initial patient physiologic data and patient age is novel. Objectives: To determine whether the six MPDS priority determinants for Protocol 26 (sick person) can be used to predict initial EMS patient acuity assessment or severity of an aggregate physiologic score. Our longterm goal is to determine whether MPDS priority can be used to predict patient acuity and potentially send only a first responder to do an in-person assessment to confirm this acuity, while reserving ALS transport resources for higher acuity patients. Methods: Calls dispatched through the Wichita-Sedgwick County 9-1-1 center between July 20, 2009 and October 1, 2011 using MPDS Protocol 26 (sick person) were linked to the EMS patient care record for all patients 14 and older. The six MPDS priority determinants were evaluated for correlation with initial EMS acuity code, initial vital signs, Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS), or patient age. The EMS acuity code scores patients from low to severe acuity, based on initial EMS assessment. Results: There were 9370 calls dispatched using Protocol 26 for those 14 years of age and older during the period, representing approximately 13% of all EMS calls. There is a significant difference in the first encounter vital signs among different MPDS priority levels. Based on the logistic regression model, the MPDS priority code alone had a sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 55% for identifying low-acuity patients with EMS Acuity Score as the standard. The area under the curve (AUC) for ROC is 0.62 for MPDS priority codes alone, while addition of age increases this value to 0.69. If we use the RAPS score as the standard to the MPDS priority code, AUC is 0.528. If we include both MPDS and age in the model, the AUC is 0.533. Conclusion: In our system, MPDS priority codes on Protocol 26 (sick person) alone, or with age or RAPS score, are not useful either as predictors of patient acuity on EMS arrival or to reconfigure system response or patient destination protocols.",

Yancey 1 1 Emory University, Atlanta, GA; 2 Grady EMS, Atlanta, GA Background: Low-acuity patients calling 9-1-1 are known to utilize a large proportion of EMS and ED resources. The National Association of EMS Physicians and ACEP jointly support EMS alternate destination programs (ADPs) in which low-acuity patients are allocated alternative resources non-emergently. Analysis of one year's ADP data from our EMS system revealed that only 4.5% of eligible patients were transported to alternate destinations (ambulatory clinics). Reasons for this low success rate need investigation. Objectives: To survey EMTs and discover the most frequent reasons given by them for transportation of eligible patients to EDs instead of to clinics. Methods: This study was conducted within a large, urban, hospital-based EMS system. Upon conducting an ADP for 12 months, a paper-based survey was created and pre-tested. All medics with any ADP-eligible patient contact were included. EMTs were asked about personal, patient, and system related factors contributing to ED transport during the last 3 months of the ADP. Qualitative data were coded, collated, and descriptively reported. Results: Sixty-three respondents (26 EMT-Intermediates and 37 EMT-Paramedics) completed the survey, representing 79% of eligible EMTs. Thirty-one EMTs (49%) responded that they did not attempt to recruit eligible patients into the ADP in the last 3 program months. Of those EMTs, 25 (81%) attributed their motive to multiple, prior, failed recruitment attempts. The 32 EMTs who actively recruited ADP patients were asked reasons given by patients for clinic transport refusals: 19 (60%) cited that patients reported no prior experience of care at the participating clinics, and 23 (72%) reported patients had a strong preference for care in an ED. Regarding system-related factors contributing to non-clinic transport, 24 of the 32 EMTs (75%) reported that clinic-consenting patients were denied clinic visits, mostly because of non-availability of same-day clinic appointments. Conclusion: Respondents indicated that poor EMT enrollment of eligible patients, lack of available clinic time slots, and patient preference for ED care were among the most frequent reasons contributing to the low success rate of the ADP. This information can be used to enhance the success of this, and potentially other ADP programs, through modifications to ADP operations and improved patient education.",

CT findings of hydronephrosis and hyrdroureter (hydro) were used as a proxy for hydro that could be determined by ultrasound prior to CT. Patients were categorized into three groups: ureteral stone, no significant findings, and intervention or follow-up required. Classification and Regression Tree analysis was used to determine which variables could identify ureteral stone in this population of pyelo patients. Results: Out of the 1899 patients, 105 (7.0%) met criteria for pyelo; subjects had a mean age of 39 \u00b1 15.9 and 82% (n = 87) were female. CT revealed 31 (29%, 95% CI = 0.22-0.39) symptomatic stones, and 72 (68%, 95% CI = 0.59-0.76) exams with no significant findings. Two patients needed intervention/ follow-up (1%, 95% CI = 0.0052-0.0667), one for perinephric hemorrhage and the other for pancreatitis. Hydro was predictive for ureteral stone with an OR = 18.4 (95% CI = 6.4-52, p < 0.0001). Eleven (35%) ureteral stone patients were admitted and 9 (8%) of them had procedures. Of these patients, 100% had CT signs of obstruction, 8 (88%) had hydronephrosis, and 1 (11%) had hydroureter. Conclusion: Hydronephrosis was predictive of ureteral stone and in-house procedures. Prospective study is needed to determine whether CT scan is warranted in patients with pyelonephritis but without hydronephrosis or hydroureter.",

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis on a prospectively maintained institutional tumor registry to identify patients diagnosed with CRC from 2008-2010. EMRs were reviewed to identify which patients presented to the ED with acute symptoms of CRC as the initial sign of their illness. The primary outcome variable was treatment plan (curative vs. palliative). Secondary outcome variables included demographics, tumor type and location. Descriptive statistics were conducted for major variables. Chi-squre and Fisher's exact tests were used to detect the association between categorical variables. Two-sample t-test was used to identify the association between continuous and categorical variables. Results: Between Jan 1 2008 and Dec 31 2010, 376 patients were identified at our institution with CRC. 214 (57%) were male and 162 (43%) were female, with mean age 60.6; SD: 13.3. Thirty-three patients (8.8%) initially presented to the ED, of whom 5 (15.5%) received palliation. Of 339 patients who initially presented elsewhere, 69 (20.5%) received palliation. Acute ED presentation with CRC symptoms did not preclude treatment with curative intent (p = 0.47). Patients who presented emergently were more likely to be female (64% vs male 41%; p = 0.01) and older (65 vs. 60; p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant relationship between age, sex, tumor location, or type and treatment approach. Conclusion: Patients with CRC may present to the ED with acute symptoms, which ultimately leads to the diagnosis. Emergent presentation of CRC does not preclude patients from receiving therapy with curative intent.",

Of the fallers, 65.9% of the patients were discharged, 31% were admitted, and 3% were admitted under observation. Of those who fell, 38.2% had an ED visit within the previous year. Approximately 1/3 (33.3%) of these were fall related. Over half (53.4%) of the patients who fell returned to the ED within one year of their index visit.

Conclusion: Both instruments identify the majority of patients as high-risk which will not be helpful in allocating scarce resources. Neither the ISAR nor the TRST can distinguish geriatric ED patients at high or low risk for 1or 3-month adverse outcomes. These prognostic instruments are not more accurate in dementia or lower literacy subsets. Future instruments will need to incorporate different domains related to short-term adverse outcomes. Background: For older adults, both inpatient and outpatient care involves not only the patient and physician, but often a family member or informal caregiver. They can assist in medical decision making and in performing the patient's activities of daily living. To date, multiple outpatient studies have examined the positive roles family members play during the physician visit. However, there is very limited information on the involvement of the caregiver in the ED and their relationship with the health outcomes of the patient.",

Patients and care partners were initially given a questionnaire to understand basic demographic data. At the end of the ED stay, patients were given a satisfaction survey and followed through 30 days to assess time to disposition, whether the patient was admitted or discharged, outpatient follow-up, and ED revisit rates. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine the strength of differences in the elderly patients' sociodemographics, self-rated health, receiving aid with their Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, and number of health problems by accompaniment status. Multivariate regression models were constructed to examine whether the presence or absence of caregivers affected satisfaction, disposition, and follow-up. Results: Overall satisfaction was higher among patients who had caregivers (2.4 points), among patients who felt they were respected by their physician (3.8 points), and had lower lengths of stay (2 hours). Patients with caregivers were also more likely to be discharged home (OR 2.4) and to follow-up with their regular physician (OR 2.1). There was no evidence to suggest caregivers affected the overall rates of revisits back to an ED. Conclusion: For older adults, medical care involves not only the patient and physician, but often a family member or an informal care companion. These results demonstrate the positive influence of caregivers on the patients they accompany, and emergency physicians should define ways to engage these caregivers during their ED stay. This will also allow caregivers to participate when needed and can help to facilitate transitions across care settings. Background: Shared decision making has been shown to improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes for chronic disease management. Given the presence of individual variations in the effectiveness and side effects of commonly used analgesics in older adults, shared decision making might also improve clinical outcomes in this setting. Objectives: We sought to characterize shared decision making regarding the selection of an outpatient analgesic for older ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain and to examine associations with outcomes. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study with consecutive enrollment of patients age 65 or older discharged from the ED following evaluation for moderate or severe musculoskeletal pain. Two essential components of shared decision making, 1) information provided to the patient and 2) patient participation in the decision, were assessed via patient interview at one week using four-level Likert scales. Results: Of 233 eligible patients, 110 were reached by phone and 87 completed the survey. Only 25% (21/87) of patients reported receiving 'a lot' of information about the analgesic, and only 21% (18/87) reported participating 'a lot' in the selection of the analgesic. There were trends towards white patients (p = 0.06) and patients with higher educational attainment (p = 0.07) reporting more participation in the decision. After adjusting for sex, race, education, and initial pain severity, patients who reported receiving 'a lot' of information were more likely to report optimal satisfaction with the analgesic than those receiving less information (78% vs. 47%, p < 0.05). After the same adjustments, patients who reported participating 'a lot' in the decision were also more likely to report optimal satisfaction with the analgesic (82% vs. 47%, p < 0.05) and greater reductions in pain scores (mean reduction in pain 4.6 vs. 2.7, p < 0.05) at one week than those who participated less. Background: Quality of life (QOL) measurements have become increasingly important in outcomes-based research and cost-utility analyses. Dementia is a prevalent, often unrecognized, geriatric syndrome that may limit the accuracy of patient self-report in a subset of patients. The relationship between caregiver and geriatric patient QOL in the emergency department (ED) is not well understood.",

Trained research assistants screened for cognitive dysfunction using the Short Blessed Test and evaluated health impairment using the Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) Test. When available in the ED, caregivers were asked to independently complete the QOL-AD. Consenting subjects were non-critically ill, English-speaking, community-dwelling adults over 65 years of age. Responses were compared using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test to assess the relationships between patient and caregiver scores from the QOL-AD stratified by normal or abnormal cognitive screening results. Significance was defined by p < 0.05. Results: Patient QOL ratings were obtained from 108 patient-caregiver pairs. Patients were 51% female, 52% African-American, with a mean age of 76-years, and 58% had abnormal cognitive screening tests. Compared with caregivers, cognitively normal patients had no significant QOL assessment differences except for questions of energy level and overall mood. On the other hand, cognitively impaired patients differed significantly on questions of energy level and ability to perform household chores with a trend towards significant differences for living setting (p = 0.097) and financial situation (p = 0.057). In each category, the differences reflected a caregiver underestimation of quality compared with the patient's self-rating. Conclusion: Discrepancies between QOL domains and total scores for patients with cognitive dysfunction and their caregivers highlights the importance of identifying cognitive dysfunction in ED-based outcomes research and cost-utility analyses. Further research is needed to quantify the clinical importance of the patient-and caregiver-assessed quality of life. Background: Age is often a predictor for increased morbidity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether old age is a predictor of adverse outcome in syncope. Objectives: To determine whether old age is an independent predictor of adverse outcome in patients presenting to the emergency department following a syncopal episode. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted from June 2003 to July 2006 enrolling consecutive adult ED patients (>18 years) presenting with syncope. Syncope was defined as an episode of transient loss of consciousness. Adverse outcome or critical intervention were defined as gastrointestinal bleeding or other hemorrhage, myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention, dysrhythmia, alteration in antidysrhythmics, pacemaker/defibrillator placement, sepsis, stroke, death, pulmonary embolus, or carotid stenosis. Outcomes were identified by chart review and 30-day follow-up phone calls. Results: Of 575 patients who met inclusion criteria, an adverse event occurred in 24% of patients. Overall, 35% of patients with risk factors had adverse outcomes compared to 1.6% of patients with no risk factors. In particular, 28/127 (22%; 95% CI 16-30%) of patients <65 with risk factors had adverse outcomes, while 85/196 (43%; 95% CI 36-50%) of the elderly with risk factors had adverse outcomes. In contrast, among young people 2/196 (1%; 95% CI 0.04-3.8%) of patients without risk factors had adverse outcomes while 2/56 (3.6%; 95% CI 0.28-13%) of patients \u202165 without risk factors had adverse outcomes. Conclusion: Although the elderly are at greater risk for adverse outcomes in syncope, age \u2021 65 or older alone does not appear to be a predictor of adverse outcome following a syncopal event. Based on these data, it should be safe to discharge home from the ED patients with syncope, but without risk factors, regardless of age. (Originally submitted as a ''late-breaker.'')",

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases as well as bibliographies of relevant articles. We included studies that enrolled ED patients with lacerations repaired by primary closure. Exclusion: 1. intentional delayed primary repair or secondary closure, 2. wounds requiring intra-operative repair, skin graft, drains, or extensive debridement, and 3. grossly contaminated or infected at presentation. We compared the outcome of wound infection in two groups of early versus delayed presentations (based on the cut-offs selected by the original articles). We used ''Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation'' (GRADE) criteria to assess the quality of the included trials. Frequencies are presented as percentages with 95% confidence intervals. Relative risk (RR) of infection is reported when clinically significant. Results: 418 studies were identified. Four trials enrolling 3724 patients in aggregate met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two studies used a 6-hour cut-off and the other two used a 12-hour cut-off for defining delayed wounds. The overall quality of evidence was low. The infection rate in the wounds that presented with delay ranged from 1.4% to 32%. One study with the smallest sample size (Morgan et al), which only enrolled lacerations to the hand and forearm, showed higher rates of infection in patients with delayed wounds (table). The infection rates in delayed wound groups in the remaining three studies were not significantly different from the early wounds. Conclusion: The evidence does not support the existence of a golden period, nor does it support the role of wound age on infection rate in simple lacerations.

Near-term future goals will involve developing more rapid means of sequencing and enrolling a larger cohort to verify assay performance. conference are presented by influenza scenario in Table  1 and Background: Antiviral medications are recommended for patients with influenza who are hospitalized or at high risk for complications. However, timely diagnosis of influenza in the ED remains challenging. Influenza rapid antigen tests have short turn-around times, making them potentially useful in the ED setting, but their sensitivities may be too low to assist with treatment decisions. Objectives: To evaluate the test characteristics of the BinaxNow Influenza A&B rapid antigen test (RAT) in ED patients. Methods: We prospectively enrolled a systematic sample of patients of all ages presenting to two EDs with acute respiratory symptoms or fever during three consecutive influenza seasons (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) . Research personnel collected nasal and throat swabs, which were combined and tested for influenza with RT-PCR using CDC-provided primers and probes. ED clinicians independently decided whether to obtain a RAT during clinical care. RATs were performed in the clinical laboratory using the BinaxNow Influenza A&B test on nasal swabs collected by ED staff. The study cohort included subjects who underwent both a research PCR and clinical RAT. RAT test characteristics were evaluated using PCR as the criterion standard with stratified sub-analyses for age group and influenza subtype (pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), non-pandemic influenza A, influenza B). Results: 561 subjects were enrolled; 131 subjects were PCR positive for influenza (76 pH1N1, 20 non-pandemic influenza A, and 35 influenza B). For all age groups, RAT sensitivities were low and specificities were high ( HIV infection with CD4 < 200; and among nursing home residents, inability to independently perform activities of daily living. Sources for bacterial cultures included blood, sputum (adults only), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal aspirate, and pleural fluid. Only sputum specimens with a Bartlett score \u20211+ were considered adequate for culturing. Results: Among 461 children enrolled, 7 (2%) had S. aureus cultured from \u20211 specimen, including 5 with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 2 with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Specimens positive for S. aureus included 3 pleural fluid, 2 blood, 2 tracheal aspirates, and 1 BAL. Two children with S. aureus had evidence of co-infection: 1 influenza A, and 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among 673 adults enrolled, 17 (3%) grew S. aureus from \u20211 specimen, including 9 with MRSA and 8 with MSSA. Specimens positive for S. aureus included 5 blood, 11 sputum, and 3 BAL. Five adults with S. aureus had evidence of co-infections: 2 coronavirus, 1 respiratory syncytial virus, 1 S. pneumoniae, and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presenting clinical characteristics and outcomes of subjects with staphylococcal CAP are summarized in Tables 1-2. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest S. aureus is an uncommon cause of CAP. Although the small number of staphylococcal cases limits conclusions that can be drawn, in our analysis staphylococcal CAP appears to be associated with co-infections, pleural effusions, and severe disease. Future work will focus on continued enrollment and developing clinical prediction models to aid in diagnosing staphylococcal CAP in the ED. Background: Emergency care has been a neglected public health challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa. The goal of Global Emergency Care Collaborative (GECC) is to develop a sustainable model for emergency care delivery in low-resource settings. GECC is developing a training program for emergency care practitioners (ECPs). Objectives: To analyze the first 500 patient visits at Karoli Lwanga ''Nyakibale'' Hospital ED in rural Uganda to determine the knowledge and skills needed in training ECPs. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional analysis of the first 500 consecutive patient visits in the ED's patient care log was reviewed by an unblinded abstractor. Data on demographics, procedures, laboratory testing, bedside ultrasounds (US) performed, radiographs (XRs) ordered, and diagnoses were collated. All authors discussed uncertainties and formed a consensus. Descriptive statistics were performed.",

            "text": "Assessment of Point-of-care Ultrasound in Tanzania Background: Current Chinese EMS is faced with many challenges due to a lack of systematic planning, national standards in training, and standardized protocols for prehospital patient evaluation and management. Objectives: To estimate the frequency with which prehospital care providers perform critical actions for selected chief complaints in a county-level EMS system in Hunan Province, China. Methods: In collaboration with Xiangya Hospital (XYH), Central South University in Hunan, China, we collected data pertaining to prehospital evaluation of patients on EMS dispatches from a ''1-2-0'' call center over a 2-month period. This call center services an area of just under 5000 km 2 with a total population of 1.36 million. Each EMS team consists of a driver, a nurse, and a physician. This was a cross-sectional study where a single trained observer accompanied EMS teams on transports of patients with a chief complaint of chest pain, dyspnea, trauma, or altered mental status. In this convenience sample, data were collected daily between 8 AM and 6 PM. Critical actions were pre-determined by a panel of emergency medicine faculty from XYH and the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Simple statistical analysis was performed to determine the frequency of critical actions performed by EMS providers. Results: During the study period, 1170 patients were transported, 452 of whom met the inclusion criteria. 218 (48.2%) evaluations were observed directly for critical actions. The table shows the frequency of critical actions performed by chief complaint. None of the patients with chest pain received an ECG even though the equipment was available. Rapid glucose was checked in only 2.1% of patients presenting with altered mental status. A lung exam was performed in 22.7% of patients with dyspnea, and the respiratory rate was measured in 9.1%. Among patients transported for trauma, blood pressure, and heart rate were only measured in 1% and 4.1%, respectively. Conclusion: In this observation study of prehospital patient assessments in a county-level EMS system, critical actions were performed infrequently for the chief complaints of interest. Performance frequencies for critical actions ranged from 0 to 22.7%, depending on the chief complaint. Standardized prehospital patient care protocols should be established in China and further training is needed to optimize patient assessment.",

Methods: We analyzed the 2006-2008 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), the largest, all-payer, US ED and inpatient database. ED visits for COPD with acute respiratory failure were identified with a combination of COPD exacerbation and respiratory failure ICD-9-CM codes.

Ninety-six percent were admitted to the hospital. Of these, NIV use increased slightly from 14% in 2006 to 16% in 2008 (P = 0.049), while IMV use decreased from 28% in 2006 to 19% in 2008 (P < 0.001); the combined use remained stable (4%). Inpatient mortality decreased from 10% in 2006 to 7% in 2008 (P < 0.001). NIV use varied widely between hospitals, ranging from 0% to 100% with median of 11%. In a propensity score analysis, NIV use (compared to IMV) significantly reduced inpatient mortality (risk ratio 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48-0.56), shortened hospital LOS (difference )3 days; 95%CI )4 to )3), and reduced hospital charges 044; 855) . NIV use was associated with a lower rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax compared with IMV use (0.04% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001). An instrumental analysis confirmed the benefits of NIV use, with a 5% reduction in inpatient mortality in the NIV-preferring hospitals. Conclusion: NIV use is increasing in US hospitals for COPD with acute respiratory failure; however, its adoption remains low and varies widely between hospitals. NIV appears to be more effective and safer than IMV in the real-world setting. Background: Dyspnea is a common ED complaint with a broad differential diagnosis and disease-specific treatment. Bronchospasm alters capnographic waveforms, but the effect of other causes of dyspnea on waveform morphology is unclear. Objectives: We evaluated the utility of capnographic waveforms in distinguishing dyspnea caused by reactive airway disease (RAD) from non-RAD in adult ED patients.",

Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. Diagnostic test characteristics and inter-rater reliability are given. Results: Fifty subjects were enrolled. Median age was 52 years (range 21-82), 50% were female, 34% were Caucasian. 29/50 (58%) had a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RAD was diagnosed by the treating physician in 19/50 (38%) and 32/50 (64%) had received treatment for dyspnea prior to waveform acquisition. The interpreters agreed on waveform analysis in 47/50 (94%) cases (kappa = 0.88).

            "text": "Asthma Background: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who present to the emergency department (ED) usually lack adequate ambulatory disease control. While evidence-based care in the ED is now well defined, there is limited inform-ation regarding the pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic needs of these patients at discharge. Objectives: This study evaluated patients' needs with regard to the ambulatory management of their respiratory conditions after ED treatment and discharge. Methods: Over 6 months, 94 adult patients with acute asthma or COPD, presenting to a tertiary care Alberta Hospital ED and discharged after being treated for exacerbations, were enrolled. Using results from standardized in-person questionnaires, charts were reviewed by respiratory researchers to identify care gaps. Results: Overall, 58 asthmatic and 36 COPD patients were enrolled. More patients with asthma required education on spacer devices (52% vs 31%). Few asthma (9%) and no COPD patients had written action plans; asthma patients were more likely to need adherence counseling (53% vs 36%) for preventer medications. More patients with asthma required influenza vaccination (72% vs 39%; p = 0.003); pneumococcal immunization was low (36%) in COPD patients. Only 22% of asthmatics reported ever being referred to an asthma education program and 19% of the COPD patients reported ever being referred to pulmonary rehabilitation. At ED presentation, 28% of the asthmatics required the addition of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and 16% required the addition of ICS/long acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA) combination agents. On the other hand, 36% of COPD patients required the addition of long-acting anticholinergics while most (83%) were receiving preventer medications. Finally, 31% of COPD and 29% of asthma patients who smoked required smoking cessation counseling. Conclusion: Overall, we identified various care gaps for patients presenting to the ED with asthma and COPD. There is an urgent need for high-quality research on interventions to reduce these gaps. Methods: This is an interim, sub-analysis of an interventional, double-blinded study performed in an academic urban-based adult ED. Subjects with acute exacerbation of asthma with FEV1 < 50% predicted within 30 minutes following initiation of ''standard care'' (including a minimum of 5 mg nebulized albuterol, 0.5 mg nebulized ipratropium, and 50 mg corticosteroid) who consented to be in a trial were included. All treatment was administered by emergency physicians unaware of the study objectives. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or an intravenous beta agonist. All subjects had FEV1 and DS obtained at baseline, 1, 2, and 3 hours after treatment. FEV1 was measured using a bedside Nspire spirometer, and DS was calculated using a Modified Borg Dyspnea score. Results: Thirty-eight patients were included for analysis. Spearman's Rho test (Rho) was used to measure correlations between FEV1 and DS at 1, 2, and 3 hours post study entry and subsequent hospitalization. Rho is negative for FEV1 (higher FEV1 correlates to lower rate of hospitalization) and positive for DS (higher DS correlates to higher rate of hospitalization). At each time point, DS were more highly correlated to hospitalization than were FEV1 (see table) . Conclusion: Dyspnea score at 1, 2, and 3 hours were significantly correlated with hospital admission, whereas FEV1 was not. In this set of subjects with moderate to severe asthma exacerbations, a standardized subjective tool was superior to FEV1 for predicting subsequent hospitalization. Methods: This is an interim, subgroup analysis of a prospective, interventional, double-blind study performed in an academic urban ED. Subjects who were consented for this trial presented with acute asthma exacerbations with FEV1 \u00a3 50% predicted within 30 minutes following initiation of ''standard care'' (includes a minimum of 2.5 mg nebulized albuterol, 0.5 mg nebulized ipratropium, and 50 mg of a corticosteroid). ED physicians who were unaware of the study objectives administered all treatments. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo or investigational intravenous beta agonist arms. Blood was obtained at 1 and 1.25 hours after the start of the hour long infusion. Blood was centrifuged and serum stored at )80\u00b0C, and then shipped on dry ice for albuterol and lactate measurements at a central lab. The treatment lactate and D lactate were correlated with 1 hr serum albuterol concentrations and hospital admission using partial Pearson correlations to adjust for DS. Results: 38 subjects were enrolled to date, 20 with complete data. The mean baseline serum lactate level was 18.1 mg/dL (SD \u00b1 8.6). This increased to 32.7 mg/ dL (SD \u00b1 15.0) at 1.25 hrs. The mean 1 hr DS was 3.85 (SD \u00b1 2.0). The correlations between treatment lactate, D lactate, 1 hr serum albuterol concentrations (R, S and total) and admission to hospital are shown (see table) . Both treatment and D lactate were highly conrrelated with total serum albuterol, R albuterol, and S albuterol. There was no correlation between treatment lactate or D lactate and hospital admission. Conclusion: Lactate and D lactate concentrations correlate with albuterol concentrations in patients presenting had asthma. Fifty one percent were <21 years old and 54% were female. We found a decline of 27% (95% CI: 23%-30%, p < 0.0001; R 2 = 0.73, p < 0.0001) in the overall yearly asthma visits to total ED visits from 1996 to 2010. When we analyzed sex and age groups separately, we found no statistically significant changes for females or for males <21 years old (R 2 \u00a3 0.016, p \u2021 0.65). For females and males >21 years old, yearly asthma visits to total ED visits from 1996 to 2010 decreased 39% (95% CI: 33%-43%, p < 0.0001; R 2 = 0.90, p < 0.0001) and 20% (95% CI: 14%-26%, p < 0.0001; R 2 = 0.80, p < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion: We found an overall decrease in yearly asthma visits to total ED visits from 1996 to 2010. We speculate that this decrease is due to greater corticosteroid use despite the increasing prevalence of asthma. It is unclear why this decrease was seen in adults and not in children and why it was greater for adult females than males.

Background: Inadequate randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding can inflate effect sizes in both human and animal studies. These methodological limitations might in part explain some of the discrepancy between promising results in animal models and non-significant results in human trials. Whereas blinding is not always possible, in clinical or animal studies, true randomization with allocation concealment is always possible, and may be as important in minimizing bias.",

Raw initial agreement was calculated and differences were settled by consensus. The first (period 1 = 2000-2004) and second (period 2 = 2005-2009) 5-year periods were compared with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Of 117 EM animal research studies, 109 were appropriate for review because they involved intervention in at least two groups. Blinding of interventions and measurements were not considered possible in 37% and 3%, respectively. Significant differences between period 1 and 2 were absent, although there was a trend towards less blinding of interventions and more blinding of measurements. Raw agreement was 91%. Conclusion: Although randomization is mentioned in the majority of studies, allocation concealment and blinding remain underutilized in EM animal research. We did not compare outcomes between blinded and non-blinded, randomized and non-randomized studies, because of small sample size. This review fails to demonstrate significant improvement over time in these methodological limitations in EM animal research publications. Journals might consider requiring authors to explicitly describe their randomization, allocation, and blinding methods. Background: Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) are increasingly utilized to evaluate quality improvement interventions aimed at health care providers. In trials testing ED interventions, migration of EPs between hospitals is an important concern, as contamination may affect both internal and external validity. Objectives: We hypothesized geographically isolating emergency departments would prevent migratory contamination in a CRT designed to increase ED delivery of tPA in stroke (The INSTINCT Trial).",

            "text": "Methods: INSTINCT was a prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial. Twenty-four Michigan community hospitals were randomly selected in matched pairs for study. Following selection of a single hospital, all hospitals within 15 miles were excluded from the sample pool. Individual emergency physicians staffing each site were identified at baseline (2007) and 18 months later. Contamination was defined at the cluster level, with substantial contamination defined a priori as >10% of EPs affected. Non-adherence, total crossover (contamination + non-adherence), migration distance and characteristics were determined. Results: 307 emergency physicians were identified at all sites. Overall, 7 (2.3%) changed study sites. One moved between control sites, leaving 6 (2.0%) total crossovers. Of these, 2 (0.7%) moved from intervention to control (contamination) and 4 (1.3%) moved from control to intervention (non-adherence). Contamination was observed in 2 of 24 sites, with 17% and 9% contamination of the total site EP workforce at follow-up, respectively. Two of 6 crossovers occurred between hospitals within the same health system. Average migration distance was 42 miles for all EPs in the study and 35 miles for EPs moving from intervention to control sites. Conclusion: The mobile nature of emergency physicians should be considered in the design of quality improvement CRTs. Use of a 15-mile exclusion zone in hospital selection for this CRT was associated with very low levels of substantial cluster contamination (1 of 24) and total crossover. Assignment of hospitals from a single health system to a single study group and/or an exclusion zone of 45 miles would have further reduced crossovers. Increased reporting of contamination in cluster randomized controlled trials is encouraged to clarify thresholds and facilitate CRT design. Objectives: An extension of the LR, the average absolute likelihood ratio (AALR), was developed to assess the average change in the odds of disease that can be expected from a test, or series of tests, and an example of its use to diagnose wide QRS complex tachycardia (WCT) is provided. Methods: Results from two retrospective multicenter case series were used to assess the utility of QRS duration and axis to assess for ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with undifferentiated regular sustained WCT. Serial patients with heart rate (HR) >120 beats per minute and QRS duration >120 milliseconds (msec) were included. The final tachydysrhythmia diagnosis was determined by a number of methods independent of the ECG. The AALR is defined as: AALR = 1/N Total [R (N i *LR i ) (for LR > 1) + R (N k /LR k ) (for LR < 1)], where LR i and LR k are the interval LRs, and N i and N k are the number of patients with test results within the corresponding intervals. ROC curves were constructed, and interval LRs and AALRs were calculated for the QRS duration and axis tests individually, and when applied together. Confidence intervals were bootstrapped with 10,000 replications using the R boot package. Results: 187 patients were included: 95 with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and 92 with VT. Optimal QRS intervals (msec) for distinguishing VT from SVT were: QRS \u00a3 130, 130 < QRS < 160, and QRS \u2021 160. QRS axis results were dichotomized to upward right axis (181-270 degrees) or not ()89 to 180 degrees). Results are listed in the table. Conclusion: Application of the QRS interval and axis tests together for patients with wide QRS complex tachycardia changes the odds of ventricular tachycardia, on average, by a factor of 3.5 (95% CI 2.4 to 6.2), and this is mildly improved over the QRS duration test alone. Both a strength and weakness of the AALR is its dependence on the pretest probability of disease. The AALR may be helpful for clinicians and researchers to evaluate and compare diagnostic testing approaches, particularly when strategies with serial non-independent tests are considered. consultation for adults with metastatic solid tumors at an urban, academic ED located within a tertiary care referral center.

Respondents also suggested that scenarios of very common emergency department presentations bear a great deal of importance. Emergency medicine educators assign priority to simulations involving professionalism and communication. Finally, many respondents noted that they use simulation to teach the presentation and management of rare or less frequent, but important disease processes.

Background: Prescription drug misuse is a growing problem among adolescent and young adult populations. Objectives: To determine factors associated with past year prescription drug misuse defined as using prescription sedatives, stimulants, or opioids to get high, taking them when they were prescribed to someone else or taking more than was prescribed among patients seeking care in an academic ED. Methods: Adolescents and young adults (14-20) presenting for ED care at a large, academic teaching hospital were approached to complete a computerized screening questionnaire regarding demographics, prescription drug misuse, illicit drug use, alcohol use, and violence in the past 12 months. Logistic regression was used to predict past year prescription drug misuse. Results: Over the study time period, there were 2156 participants (86% response rate) of whom 300 (13.9%) endorsed past year prescription drug misuse. Specifically, rates of past year misuse for opioids was 8.7%, sedatives was 5.4%, and stimulants was 8.0%. Significant overlap exists among classes with over 40% misusing more than one class of medications. In the multivariate analysis significant predictors of past year prescription drug misuse included female gender (OR Conclusion: Approximately one in seven adolescents or young adults seeking ED care have misused prescription drugs in the past year. While opioids are the most common drug misused, significant overlap exists among this population. Given the correlation of prescription drug misuse with the use and misuse of other substances (i.e. alcohol, cough medicine, marijuana) more research is needed to further understand these relationships and inform interventions. Additionally, future research should focus on understanding the differences in demographics and risk factors associated with misuse of each separate class of prescription drugs.",

Subjects were surveyed about their demographic and other health and health care characteristics and were screened with the PHQ 9, a nine-item questionnaire that is a validated, reliable predictor of MDD. We conducted bivariate (chi-square) and multivariate analysis controlling for demographic characteristics (race, income, sex, age) using STATA v. 10.0. Our principal dependent variable of interest was a positive depression screen (PHQ 9 score \u202110). Our principal independent variable of interest was the presence of self-reported chronic pain (greater than 3 months). Results: Of 77 patients enrolled, 2 did not meet all inclusion criteria. 50 had two or more assessments for comparison. Their average age was 39 (range 21-59), 70% were male, and 74% were in police custody. 38% used methadone alone; 16% heroin alone; 4% oxycodone alone; and the rest used multiple opioids. The average dose of IM methadone was 10.3 mg (range 5-20 mg); all but 3 patients received 10 mg.

Background: As the US population ages, the coexistence of COPD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is expected to be more frequent. Very few studies have examined the effect of COPD on outcomes in ACS patients, and, to our knowledge, there has been no report on biomarkers that possibly mediate between COPD and long-term ACS patient outcomes. Objectives: To determine the effect of COPD on longterm outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with ACS and to identify prognostic inflammatory biomarkers. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study enrolling ACS patients from a single large tertiary center. Hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with ACS were interviewed and their blood samples were obtained. Seven inflammatory biomarkers were measured, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM), E-selectin, lipoprotein-a (LP-a), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). The diagnoses of ACS and COPD were verified by medical record review. Annual telephone follow-up was conducted to assess health status and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcomes, a composite endpoint including myocardial infarction, revascularization procedure, stroke, and death. Background: Aortic dissection (AD) is an uncommon life-threatening condition requiring prompt diagnosis and management. Thirty-eight percent of cases are missed upon initial evaluation. The cornerstone of accurate diagnosis hinges on maintaining a high index of clinical suspicion for the various patterns of presentation. Quality documentation that reflects consideration for AD in the history, exam, and radiographic interpretation is essential for both securing the diagnosis and for protecting the clinician in missed cases.",

Methods: IRB-approved, structured, retrospective review of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed non-traumatic AD from 2004 to 2010. Inclusion criteria: New AD diagnosis via ED. Exclusion Criteria: AD diagnosed at another facility; chronic, traumatic, or iatrogenic AD. Trained/monitored abstractors used a standardized data tool to review ED and hospital medical records. Descriptive statistics were calculated as appropriate. Inter-rater reliability was measured. Our primary performance measure was the prevalence of a composite of all three key historical elements (1. any back pain, 2. neurologic symptoms including syncope, and 3. sudden onset of pain.) in the attending emergency physician's documentation. Secondary outcomes included documentation of: AD risk factors, pain quality, back pain at multiple locations, presence/absence of pulse symmetry, mediastinal widening on chest radiograph, and migratory nature of the pain.

Background: Communication failures in clinical handoffs have been identified as a major preventable cause of patient harm. In Italy, advanced prehospital care is provided predominantly by physicians who work on ambulances in teams with either nurses or basic rescuers. The hand-offs from prehospital physicians to hospital emergency physicians (EPs) is especially susceptible to error with serious consequences. There are no studies in Italy evaluating the communication at this transition in patient care. Studying this, however, requires a tool that measures the quality of this communication.",

Methods: Several previously validated tools for evaluating communication in hand-offs were identified through a literature search. These were reviewed by a focus group consisting of EPs, nurses, and rescuers, who then adapted and translated the Australian ISBAR (Identification, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation), the tool most relevant to local practice. The Italian ISBAR tool consists of the following elements: patient and provider identification; patient's chief complaint; patient's past medical history, medications, and allergies; prehospital clinical assessment (primary survey, illness severity, vital signs, diagnosis); treatment initiated and anticipated treatment plan. We conducted and video-taped the hand-offs of care from the prehospital physicians to the EPs in 12 pediatric critical care simulations. Four physician raters were trained in the Italian ISBAR tool and used it to independently assess communication in each simulation. To assess agreement we calculated the proportion of agreement among raters for each ISBAR question, Fleiss' kappas for each simulation, as well as mean agreement and mean kappas with standard deviations. Results: There was 100% agreement among the four physicians on 70% of the items. The mean level of agreement was 91% (SD 0.15). The overall mean kappa was 0.67 (SD 0.10). Conclusion: The standardized tool resulted in good agreement by physician raters. This validated tool may be helpful in studying and improving hand-offs in the prehospital to emergency department setting. Objectives: We hypothesized that residents who were provided with VPs prior to HFs would perform more thoroughly and efficiently than residents who had not been exposed to the online simulation. Methods: We randomized a group of 30 residents from an academic, PGY 1-4 emergency medicine program to complete an online VPs case, either prior to (VPs group, n = 14 residents) or after (n = 16) their HFs case. The VPs group had access to the online case (which reviewed asthma management) 3 days prior to the HFs session. All residents individually participated in their regularly scheduled HFs and were blinded to the content of the case -a patient in moderate asthma exacerbation. The authors developed a dichotomous checklist consisting of 33 items recorded as done/not done along with time completed. A two sample proportion test was used to evaluate differences in the individual items completed between groups. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to determine the differences in overall and subcategory performance between the two groups. Median time to completion was analyzed using the log-rank test.",

Overall there was no difference in time to event completion between the two groups. Conclusion: We found that when HFs is primed with educational modalities such as VPs there was an improvement in performance by trainees. However, the improved completeness of the VPs group may have served as a barrier to efficiency, inhibiting our ability to identify a statistical significant efficiency overall. VPs may aid in priming the learners and maximize the efficiency of training using high-fidelity simulations. Training using an animal model helped develop residents' skills and confidence in performing PTV. Retention was found to be good at 2 months post-training.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study at an urban community hospital, 15 residents in their second or third year of training from a 3-year EM residency program performed US-guided catheterizations of the IJ on a simulator manufactured by Blue Phantom.

Residents were given credit for performing a procedural step if at least one rater marked its completion. Agreement between raters was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients for domain and summary scores. The same protocol was then repeated on an unembalmed cadaver using two different board-certified EM physician raters. Criterion validity of the residents' proficiency on the simulator was evaluated by comparing their median overall performance rating on the simulator to that on the cadaver and by comparing the proportion of residents completing each procedural step between modalities with descriptive statistics. Results: EM residents' overall performance rating on the simulator was 7.4 (95% CI: 6.0 to 8.8) and on the cadaver was 6.1 (95% CI: 4.7 to 7.5). The results for each procedural step are summarized in the attached figure. Inter-rater agreement was high for assessments on both the simulator and cadaver with overall kappa scores of 0.89 and 0.96 respectively. Background: The environment in the emergency department (ED) is chaotic. Physicians must learn how to multi-task effectively and manage interruptions. Noise becomes an inherent byproduct of this environment. Previous studies in the surgical and anesthesiology literature examined the effect of noise levels and cognitive interruptions on resident performance during simulated procedures; however, the effect of noise distraction on resident performance during an ED procedure has not yet been studied. Objectives: Our aim was to prospectively determine the effects of various levels of noise distraction on the time to successful intubation of a high-fidelity simulator.",

Noise levels were standardized by a dosimeter (Ex Tech Instruments, Heavy Duty 600). Each resident was randomized to the order in which he or she was exposed to the various noise levels and had a total of 2 minutes to complete each of the intubation attempts, which were performed in succession. Time, in seconds, to successful intubation was measured in each of these scenarios with the start time defined as the time the resident picked up the STORZ C-MAC video laryngoscope blade and the finish time defined as the time the tube passed through the vocal cords as visualized by an observer on the STORZ C-MAC video screen. Analytic methods included analysis of variance, Student's t-test, and Pearson's chi-square. Results: No significant differences were found between time to intubation and noise level nor did the order of noise level exposure affect the time to intubation (see table) . There were no significant differences in success rate between the three noise levels (p = 0.178). A significant difference in time to intubation was found between the residents' second and third intubation attempts with decreased time to intubation for the third attempt (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Noise level did not have an effect on time to intubation or intubation success rate. Time to intubation decreased between the second and third intubations regardless of noise level.",

A convenience sample of ED patients ages 18 to 65 with abdominal pain of <7 days duration requiring IV opioids was enrolled between 4/2009 and 6/2010. All patients received an initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg IV morphine. Patients in the PCA arms could request additional doses of 1 mg or 1.5 mg IV morphine by pressing a button attached to the pump with a 6-minute lock-out period. For this analysis, data from both PCA arms were combined. Software on the pump recorded times when the patient pressed the button (activation) and when he/she received a dose of morphine (successful activation). Results: 137 patients were enrolled in the PCA arms. Median baseline NRS pain score was 9. Mean amount of supplementary morphine self-administered over the 2 hour study period subsequent to the loading dose was 5.7 mg and 6.7 mg for the 1 and 1.5 mg PCA groups respectively. 124 patients activated the pump at least once (91%, 95% CI: 84 to 94%). Figure 1 shows the frequency distribution of the number of times the pump was activated. Of those who activated the pump, the median number of activations per person was 5 (IQR: 3 to 12). There were 1124 activations of the pump. 60% of activations were successful (followed by administration of morphine), while 40% were unsuccessful as they occurred during the 6-minute lock-out periods. 19% of the activations occurred in the first 30 minutes, 29% in the second 30 minutes, 25% in the third 30 minutes, and 27% in the last 30 minutes after the initial loading dose. Conclusion: Almost all patients requested supplementary doses of PCA morphine, half of whom activated the pump five times or more over a course of 2 hours. This frequency of PCA activations suggests that the commonly recommended dose of 0.1 mg/kg morphine may constitute initial oligoanalgesia in most patients.",

Upon admission or discharge, investigators recorded information regarding length of stay, laboratory tests and imaging ordered, and medications given. Results: Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy-six percent of the patients were pre-treated with some form of anti-pyretic by the caregiver prior to ED arrival. There was no significant effect of pre-treatment on whether laboratory tests or medications were ordered in the ED or whether the patient was admitted or discharged.

Conclusion: Among febrile children, those who receive anti-pyretics prior to their ED visit had statistically significant shorter length of stays.

Conclusion: As rates of childhood obesity continue to grow in the U.S., we can expect greater demands on the ED.

Background: Sudden cardiac arrests in schools are infrequent, but emotionally charged events. Little data exist that describes AED use in these events. Objectives: The purpose of our study was to 1) describe characteristics and outcomes of school cardiac arrests (CA), and 2) assess the feasibility of conducting bystander interviews to describe the events surrounding school CA. Methods: We performed a telephone survey of bystanders to CA occurring in K-12 schools in communities participating in the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. The study period was from 8/2005-12/2010 and continued in one community through 2011. Utstein style data and outcomes were collected from the CARES database. A structured telephone interview of a bystander or administrative personnel was conducted for each CA. A descriptive summary was used to assess for the presence of an AED, provision of bystander CPR (BCPR), and information regarding AED deployment, training, and use and perceived barriers to AED use. Descriptive data are reported. Results: During the study period there were 30,603 CA identified at CARES communities, of which 73 were identified as educational institutions. Of these, 46 (0.15%) events were at K-12 schools with 21 (45.7%) being high schools.

Most arrests 28/40 (70%) occurred during the school day (7a-5p). Overall, 14 (30.4%) survived to hospital discharge. Interviews were completed for 29 of 46 (63.0%) K-12 events. Eighteen schools had an AED on site. Most schools (84.2%) with AEDs reported that they had a training program and personnel identified for its use. An AED was applied in 10 of 18 patients, and of these 8 were in VF and 4 survived to hospital discharge. Multiple reasons for AED non-use (n = 8) were identified.",

Current literature supports the use of anti-emetics reporting improved oral re-hydration, cessation of vomiting, and reduced need for IV re-hydration. However, there remains concern that using these agents may mask alternative diagnoses. Objectives: To assess outcomes associated with use of a discharge action plan using ED-dispensed ondansetron at home in the treatment of gastroenteritis. Methods: A prospective, controlled, observational trial of patients presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department (census 22,400) over a 12-month period for acute gastroenteritis. Fifty patients received ondansetron in the ED. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in the Pediatric Emergency Department Discharge Action Plan (PED-DAP) where ondansetron for home use was dispensed by the treating clinician. Twenty-one patients were controls. Control patients did not receive home ondansetron. PED-DAP patients were given instructions to administer the ondansetron for ongoing symptoms any time 6 hours post ED discharge. All patients were followed by phone at 7-14 days to assess for the following: time of emesis resolution, alternative diagnoses, unscheduled visits, and adverse events.",

Five patients reported an unscheduled visit. All five return visits returned to the ED (1/5 returned for emesis, 4/5 for diarrhea). 17/21 controls reported resolution of symptoms within the ED. 2/21 of controls had resolution between time of discharge and 24 hours. 1/21 of the control patients had resolution with between 24 and 48 hours post discharge. 1/21 had an unscheduled appointment with the PMD at 72 hours post-discharge for ongoing fever and nausea. In follow-up there were no alternative diagnoses identified. The effect of the PED-DAP on resolution of emesis between discharge and 24 hours appears to be statistically significant (P value < 0.04). Conclusion: Ondansetron given in schedule with a discharge action plan appears to provide a modest benefit in resolution of symptoms relative to a control population.

Background: Skull radiographs are a useful tool in the evaluation of pediatric head trauma patients. However, there is no consensus on the ideal number of views that should be obtained as part of a standard skull series in the evaluation of pediatric head trauma patients. Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of a two-and four-film x-ray series in the diagnosis of skull fracture in children, when interpreted by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Methods: A prospective, crossover experimental study was performed in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. The skull radiographs of 100 children were reviewed. These were composed of the 50 most recent cases of skull fracture for which a four-film radiography series was available at the primary setting and 50 controls, matched for age. Two modules, containing a random sequence of two-and four-film series of each child, were constructed in order to have all children evaluated twice (once with two films and once with four films). Board-certified or -eligible pediatric emergency physicians evaluated both modules two to four weeks apart. The interpretation of the four-film series by a radiologist, or when available, the findings on CT scan, served as the gold standard. Accuracy of interpretation was evaluated for each patient. The sensitivity and specificity of the two-film versus the four-film skull xray series, in the identification of fracture, were compared. This was a non-inferiority cross-over study evaluating the null hypothesis that a series with two views would have a sensitivity (specificity) that is inferior by no more than 0.055 compared to a series with four views. A total of 50 controls and 50 cases were needed to establish non-inferiority of the two-film series versus the four-film series, with a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%.",

We hypothesized that it would be a feasible and valid method of differentiating educational needs of different levels of learners. Methods: This was an observational study of a free, web-based needs assessment instrument that was tested on 44 third and fourth year medical students (MS3-4) and 29 pediatric and emergency medicine residents (R1-3). The instrument uses YouTube video triggers of children in respiratory distress. A series of cased-based questions then prompts learners to distinguish between upper and lower airway obstruction, classify disease severity, and manage uncomplicated croup and bronchiolitis. Face validity of the instrument was established by piloting and revision among a group of experienced educators and small groups of targeted learners. Final scores were compared across groups using t-tests to determine the ability of the instrument to differentiate between different levels of learners (concurrent validity). Cronbach's alpha was calculated as a measure of internal consistency. Results: Response rates were 19% among medical students and 43% among residents. The instrument was able to differentiate between junior (MS3, MS4, and R1) and senior (R2, R3) learners for both overall mean score (61% vs.78%, P < 0.01) and mean video portion score (74 vs. 84%, p = 0.02). Table 1 compares results of several management questions between junior and senior learners. Cronbach's alpha for the test questions was 0.47. Conclusion: This free online video-based needs assessment instrument is feasible to implement and able to identify knowledge gaps in trainees' recognition and management of pediatric respiratory emergencies. It demonstrates a significant performance difference between the junior and senior learners, preliminary evidence of concurrent validity, and identifies target groups of trainees for educational interventions. Future revisions will aim to improve internal consistency. Results: The survey response rate was 87% (60/69).

Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial performed at an urban pediatric ED. Parents were asked to answer questions about their child's asthma including drug adherence and history of exacerbations, as well as answer demographic questions. Using a convenience sample of children 1-18 years presenting with an asthma exacerbation, attending physicians in the study were asked to complete an assessment of asthma control. Physicians were randomized to receive a completed PACCI (intervention) or not (control group). Using an intent-to-treat approach, clinicians' ability to accurately identify 1) four categories of control used by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) asthma guidelines, 2) intermittent vs. persistent level asthma, and 3) controlled / mildly uncontrolled vs. moderate/severely uncontrolled asthma were compared for both groups using chi-square analysis. Results: Between January and August 2011, 57 patients were enrolled. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for child's sex, age, race and parents' education. Conclusion: The PACCI improves ED clinicians' ability to categorize children's asthma control according to NHLBI guidelines, and the ability to determine when a child's control has been worsening. ED clinicians may use the PACCI to identify those children in greatest need for intervention, to guide prescription of controller medications, and communicate with primary care providers about those children failing to meet the goals of asthma therapy. Figure) . Fewer than half of physicians reported the parent of a 2-year-old being discharged from their ED following an MVC-related visit would receive either child passenger safety information or referrals (Table) . Conclusion: Emergency physician report of child passenger safety resource availability is associated with trauma center designation. Even when resources are available, referrals from the ED are infrequent. Efforts to increase referrals to community child passenger safety resources must extend to the community ED settings where the majority of children receive injury care. Background: Pediatric subspecialists are often difficult to access following ED care especially for patients living far from providers.

Methods: Children ages 3-18 presenting to one academic pediatric ED with suspicion for appendicitis from October 2010 -August 2011 were prospectively enrolled to a pathway using previously validated lowand high-risk scoring systems. The attending physician recorded his or her suspicion of appendicitis and then used one of two scoring systems incorporating history, physical exam, and CBC. Low-risk patients were to be discharged or observed in the ED. High-risk patients were to be admitted to pediatric surgery. Those meeting neither low-nor high-risk criteria were evaluated in the ED by pediatric surgery, with imaging at their discretion. Chart review and telephone follow-up were conducted two weeks after the visit. Charts of a random sample of patients with diagnoses of acute appendicitis or chief complaint of abdominal pain and undergoing a workup for appendicitis in the eight months before and after institution of the pathway were retrospectively reviewed by one or two trained abstractors. Results: Appendicitis was diagnosed in 65 of 178 patients prospectively enrolled to the pathway (37%). Mean age was 9.6 years. Of those with appendicitis, 63 were not low-risk (sensitivity 96.9%, specificity 48.7%). The high-risk criteria had a sensitivity of 73.8% and specificity of 77.0%. A priori attending physician assessment of low risk had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 49.6%. A priori assessment of high risk had a sensitivity of 58.5% and specificity of 90.2%. We reviewed 232 visits prior to the pathway and 290 after. Mean ED length of stay was similar (256 minutes before versus 257 after). CT was used in 12.1% of visits before and 7.3% after (p = 0.07). Use of ultrasound increased (44.8% before versus 55.9% after, p < 0.02). Admission rates were not significantly different (48.3% before versus 42.7% after, p = 0.2). Conclusion: The low-risk criteria had good sensitivity in ruling out appendicitis and can be used to guide physician judgment. Institution of this pathway was not associated with significant changes in length of stay, utilization of CT, or admission rate in an academic pediatric ED.",

Patients who visit the emergency department (ED) are not routinely screened for driver safety behavior; however, large numbers of patients are treated in the ED every day creating an opportunity for screening and intervention on important public health behaviors. Objectives: To evaluate patient acceptance and response to a computer-based traffic safety educational intervention during an ED visit and one month follow-up. Methods: DESIGN. Pre /post educational intervention. SETTING. Large urban academic ED serving over 100,000 patients annually. PARTICIPANTS. Medically stable adult ED patients. INTERVENTION. Patients completed a self-administered, computer-based program that queried patients on alcohol use and risky driving behaviors (texting, talking, and other forms of distracted driving). The computer provided patients with educational information on the dangers of these behaviors and collected data on patient satisfaction with the program. Staff called patients one month post ED visit for a repeat query. Results: 150 patients participated; average age 39 (21-70), 58% Hispanic, 52% male. 96% of patients reported the program was easy to use and were comfortable receiving this education via computer during their ED visit. Self-reported driver safety behaviors pre, post intervention (% change): driving while talking on the phone 45%,16% ()29%, p = 0.001), aggressive driving 44%,15% ()29%, p = 0.001), texting while driving 28%,9% ()19%, p = 0.001), driving while drowsy 18%,4% ()14%, p = 0.002), drinking in excess of NIH safe drinking guidelines15%,%7 ()8%, p = 0.039), drinking and driving 10%,1% ()9%, p = 0.006). Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of selfreported risky driving behaviors in our ED population. At 1 month follow-up, patients reported a significant decrease in these behaviors. Overall patients were very satisfied receiving educational information about these behaviors via computer during their ED visit.

Methods: A retrospective study of patients presenting to an acute alcohol and drug detoxification hospital was performed from July 2010 through January 2011. Patients were excluded if other drug withdrawal was present in addition to alcohol. Initial assessment included age, sex, vital signs, and blood alcohol level (BAL) in addition to hourly CIWA score. Admission is indicated for a CIWA score of 10 or higher. Data were analyzed by selecting all patients not immediately admitted at initial presentation. Logistic regression using Wald's criteria for stepwise inclusion was used to determine the utility of the initially gathered CIWA, BAL, longest sobriety, liver cirrhosis, and vital signs in predicting subsequent admission. Results: There were 123 patients who fit the inclusion criteria, with 9 admitted for treatment at initial intake and another 27 admitted during the following 10 hours. Logistic regression indicated that presenting BAL was a strong predictor (p = 0.01) of admission for treatment after initial presentation, as was presenting CIWA (p = 0.03). Thus, presenting BAL provided a substantial addition above initial CIWA in predicting later admission. No other variables added significantly to the prediction of later admission. To determine the interaction between presenting BAL and CIWA scores, we ran a repeated measures analysis of the first five CIWA scores (from presentation to 4 hours later), using BAL split into low (BAL < 0.10) and high (BAL > 0.10) groups (see figure) . Their interaction was significant, F (1, 93) = 11.86, p < 0.001, g 2 = 0.11. Those presenting with higher initial BAL had suppressed CIWA scores that rose precipitously as the alcohol cleared. Those with low presenting BAL showed a decline in CIWA over time Conclusion: Initial assessment using the common assessment tool CIWA is aided significantly by BAL assessment. Patients with higher presenting BAL are at higher risk for progression to serious alcohol withdrawal symptom. Objectives: To describe patient and visitor characteristics and perspectives on the role of visitors in the ED and determine the effect of visitors on ED and hospital outcome measures. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in an 81,000-visit urban ED, and data were attempted to be collected from all patients over a consecutive 96-hour period from August 25 to 28, 2011. Trained data collectors were assigned to the ED continuously for the study period. Patients assigned to a rapid care section of the ED (24%) were excluded. A visitor was defined as a person other than a health care provider (HCP) or hospital staff present in a patient's room at any time. Patient perspectives on visitors were assessed in the following domains: transportation, emotional support, physical care, communication, and advocating for the patient. ED and hospital outcome measures pertaining to ED length of stay (LOS) and charges, hospital admission rate, hospital LOS and charges were obtained from patient medical records and hospital billing. Data analyses included frequencies, Student's t-tests for continuous variables, and chi-square tests of association for categorical variables. All tests for significance were two-sided. Objectives: To examine the effect of Sunday alcohol availability on ethanol-related visits and alcohol withdrawal visits to the ED. Methods: Study design was a retrospective beforeafter study using electronically archived hospital data at an urban, safety net hospital. All adult non-prisoner ED visits from 1/1/2005 to 12/31/2009 were analyzed. An ethanol-related ED visit was defined by ICD-9 codes related to alcohol (291.x, 303.x, 305.0, 980.0 ). An alcohol withdrawal visit was defined by ICD-9 codes of delirium tremens (291.0), alcohol psychosis with hallucination (291.3), and ethanol withdrawal (291.81). We generated a ratio of ethanol-related ED visits to total ED visits (ethanol/total) and ratio of alcohol withdrawal ED visits to total ED visits (withdrawal/total). A day was redefined as 8 AM to 8 AM. The ratios were averaged within the four seasons to account for seasonal variations. Data from summer 2008 were dropped as it spanned the law change. We stratified data into Sunday and non-Sunday days prior to analysis to isolate the effects of the law change. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate the association of the ratio with the law change while adjusting for time and the seasons. Each ratio was modeled separately. The interaction between time and the law change was assessed using p < 0.05. Results: During the study there were a total of 212,189 ED visits including 12,042 (6% of total) ethanol-related visits and 5,496 (3% of total) alcohol withdrawal visits. Unadjusted ratios in seasonal blocks are plotted in the figure with associated 95% CI and best fit regression line for before and after law change, respectively. After adjusting for time and season in the multivariable linear regression, we found no significant association of either ethanol/total or withdrawal/total with the law change. This remained true for both Sunday and non-Sunday data. All interactions assessed were not significant.",

Background: Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) with actions at the serotonin/histamine receptors. Post-marketing reports and a case report have documented dangerous lowering of blood pressure when this antipsychotic is paired with benzodiazepines, but a recent small study found no bigger decreases in blood pressure compared to another antipsychotic like haloperidol. Decreases in oxygen saturations, however, were larger when olanzapine was combined with benzodiazepines in alcohol-intoxicated patients.

Vital signs were calculated as pre-dose minus lowest post-dose vital sign within 4 hours, and were analyzed in an ANOVA with route (IM/PO), benzo use (+/)), and alcohol use (+/)) as factors. Significance level was set to <0.05. Results: There were 482 patients who received olanzapine over the study period. A total of 275 patients (225 PO, 50 IM) met inclusion criteria. Systolic blood pressures decreased across all groups as patients reduced their agitation. Neither the route of administration, concurrent use of benzos, nor the use of alcohol were associated with significant changes in systolic BP (p = ns for all comparisons; see Figure 1 ). Decreases in oxygen saturations, however, were significantly larger for alcoholintoxicated patients who subsequently received IM olanzapine + benzos compared to other groups (route: p < 0.001; alcohol: p < 0.01; route x alcohol: p < 0.001; route x benzos x alcohol: p < 0.05; see Figure 2 ). Conclusion: Alcohol and benzos are not associated with significant decreases in blood pressure after PO olanzapine, but IM olanzapine + benzos is associated with potentially significant oxygen desaturations in patients who are intoxicated. Intoxicated patients may have differential effects with the use of IM SGAs such as olanzapine when combined with benzos, and should be studied separately in drug trials.",

A cohort of all patients with a mental health-related final ICD-9 coded diagnosis (Axis I or Axis II) was extracted from the electronic medical record. Using a standard abstraction form, a medical chart review collected information about medical comorbidities, substance abuse, race, age, sex, and insurance coverage, as well as diagnosis, disposition, and time of each visit. Results: Our sample consisted of 109 frequent users ( \u20214 visits in a 365 day period) and 442 infrequent users (\u00a33 visits in a 365 day period). Frequent users were more likely to be male (68% vs. 54.5% p = 0.01), black (86% vs. 59% p < 0.0001), and had a higher average number of comorbid conditions (2.0, 95%CI 1.73,2.26) as compared to infrequent users (1.0, 95%CI 0.90,1.10). A higher percentage of visits in the infrequent user group occurred during the day (49% vs. 38.3% p < 0.0001) while a higher number of visits in the frequent users occurred after midnight (24.3% vs. 16.6% p = 0.0003). Visits in the frequent user group were less likely to be for a psychiatric complaint (34.3% vs. 81.2%) and less likely to result in a psychiatric admission (18.3% versus 56.7%) as compared to the infrequent user group (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our data indicate that among patients with psychiatric diagnoses, those who make frequent ED visits have a higher rate of comorbid conditions than infrequent visitors. Despite their increased use of the ED, frequent visitors have a significantly lower psychiatric admission rate. Many of the visits by frequent users are for non-psychiatric complaints and may reflect poor access to outpatient medical and mental health services. Emergency departments should consider interventions to help address social and medical issues among mental health patients who frequently use ED services. Background: The World Health Organization estimates that one million people die annually by suicide. In the U.S., suicide is the fourth leading cause of death between the ages of 10 and 65. Many of these patients are seen in ED, while outpatient visits for depression are also high. No recent analysis has compared these groups in the recent years.",

We evaluated the relationship between the presence of an ED triage physician and waiting room (WR) time, time to first physician order, time to ED bed assignment, and time spent in an ED bed. Methods: The study was conducted from 11/2009-2/ 2011 at an academic ED with 55000 annual visits and a dedicated on-site emergency psychiatric unit. We performed a pre/post retrospective observational cohort study using administrative data, including weekend visits from noon-10pm, 8 months pre and post addition of weekend triage physicians. After adjusting for patient age, sex, insurance status, emergency severity index score, mode of arrival, ED occupancy rate, WR count, boarding count, and average WR LOS, multiple linear regression evaluated the relationship between the presence of a triage physician and four ED throughput outcomes: time spent in the WR, time to first order, time spent in an ED bed, and the total ED LOS. Results: 565 visits met inclusion criteria, 280 in the 8 months before and 285 in the 8 months after physicians were assigned to triage on weekends. Table 1 reports demographic data; multivariate analysis results are found in Table 2 . The presence of a triage physician was associated with an 8 (95% CI 0.6-15.2) minute increase in WR time and no associated change in time to first order, time spent in an ED bed, or in the overall ED LOS. Conclusion: Use of triage physicians has been reported to decrease the time patients spend in an ED bed and improve ED throughput. However, for patients with psychiatric complaints, our analysis revealed a slight increase in WR time without evident change in the time to first order, time spent in an ED bed, or total ED LOS. Improvements in ED throughput for psychiatric patients will likely require system-level changes, such as reducing ED boarding and improving lab efficiency to speed the process of medical clearance and reduce time spent in the unsecured WR. These findings may not be generalizable to EDs without a dedicated ED psychiatric unit with full-time social workers to assist with disposition. Initial assessment included CIWA scoring, repeated hourly, as well as other variables (see Table 1 ). Treatment and admission to the inpatient hospital was indicated for a CIWA score of 10 or higher. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing repeated measures general linear modeling for CIWA scores and ANOVA for all other variables. Results: There were 123 patients who fit the inclusion criteria, with 9 admitted for treatment at initial intake and another 27 admitted during the following 10 hours. The table below compares the three most prevalent ethnic populations seen at our hospital. Native Americans presented at a significantly younger age (p < 0.05) than the other two ethnicities. Initial CIWA scores taken on admission were significantly lower in the Native American group than the other two groups (p < 0.05) and at 1 hour a difference existed but failed to reach significance. Repeated measures analysis indicate that CIWA scores progressed in a U-shaped curvilinear fashion (See Figure 1 ) Conclusion: Initial assessment utilizing CIWA scores appears to be affected by ethnicity. Care must be taken when assessing and making decisions on a single initial CIWA score. Further research is needed in this area as our numbers are small and differences might be seen in subsequent scoring. In addition, our study consists of primarily male patients and does not include African-American patients.

Under-triage increased markedly for patients over 60 years, reaching 58% for those over 90 years ( Figure 1 ). Mandatory age triage criteria decreased under-triage, while substantially increasing over-triage: one ISS \u2021 16 patient identified for every 65 additional patients triaged to major trauma centers. Among patients not identified by other criteria, age had a strong non-linear association with ISS \u2021 16 (p < 0.01); the probability of serious injury steadily increased after 30 years, becoming more notable after 60 years ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion: Under-triage in trauma increases in patients over 60 years, which may be reduced with mandatory age criteria at the expense of system efficiency. Among patients not identified by other criteria, serious injury steadily increased after 30 years, though there was no age at which risk abruptly increased.

All the patients with a documented scan interpreted by a radiologist and a normal INR, defined as a value less then 1.6, were included. We determined the correlation between INR value binned by 0.1 and the proportion of patients with an ICH. Threshold was defined by consensus as an abrupt change of more than 10% in the percentage of patients with ICH. Univariate frequency distribution was tested with Pearson's chisquare test. Logistic regression analysis was then used to study the effects of INR on ICH with the following confounding factors: age, sex, and intake of warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin. Results are presented with 95% confidence intervals. Results: 751 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 55.3 years \u00b1 29.9 and 65% were men. 267 patients (35.6%) had an ICH on brain scan. We found a significantly lower risk of ICH at a threshold of INR less than 1.0 (p < 0.001, univariate OR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.25-0.54) and a strong correlation between the risk of bleeding for every increase of the INR (R 2 = 0.8987). In fact, after adjustment for confounding variables, every 0.1 INR increase was associated with an increased risk of having an ICH (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.31-1.72). Conclusion: We were able to demonstrate an INR threshold under which the probability of ICH was significantly lower. We also found a strong association between the risk of bleeding and the increase in INR within a normal range, suggesting that clinicians should not be falsely reassured by a normal INR. Our results are limited by the fact that this is a retrospective study and a small proportion of traumatic brain injured patients in our database had no scan or INR at their ED visit. A prospective cohort study would be needed to confirm our results. Background: Increasingly, patients with TBI are being seen and managed in the emergency neurology setting.

The median length of hospital stay was 2 days, with an IQR of 1-5 days. Of those admitted, 53% had an ICU stay as well. The median ICU LOS was also 2 days, with an IQR of 1-6days. Twenty nine (6%) patients died during their hospital stay. Lower GCS was predictive of inpatient admission (P = 0.0003) as well as ICU days (P < 0.0001). Significant predictors of re-admission to the hospital within 30 days included hypotension (P = 0.002) upon initial presentation. The prehospital and ED GCS scores were not statistically significant. Significant predictors of in-hospital death in a model controlling for age included bradycardia (P = 0.0042), hyperglycemia (P = 0.0040), and lower GCS (P = 0.0003). The incidence of bradycardia (HR < 60) was 4.4%. Conclusion: Early hypotension, hyperglycemia, and bradycardia along with lower initial GCS are associated with significantly higher likelihood of hospital admission, including ICU admission, as well as intrahospital death and re-admission.

The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) is a previously validated objective measure of lower extremity function.",

Both groups had improvement in their pain and functionality and did not differ significantly during the study period. Limitations include small study size and large number of participant refusals. Methods: A structured chart review of all ICD-9 radius fracture coded charts spanning March 18, 2010 to July 17, 2011 was conducted. Specific variable data were collected and categorized as follows: age, MOI, body mass index, and fracture location. The charts were reviewed by two medical students, with 10% of the charts reviewed by both students to confirm inter-rater reliability. Frequencies and inter-quartile ranges were determined. Comparisons were made with Fisher's exact test and multiple logistic regression. Results: 187 charts met inclusion criteria. 46 charts were excluded due to one of the following reasons: no fracture or no x-ray (14), isolated ulnar fracture (19), or undocumented or penetrating MOI (13). Of the analyzed patients (n = 141), distal radius fractures were most common (66%), followed by proximal (32%) and midshaft (2%). Chart reviewers were found to be reliable (j = 1). Age and MOI were significantly associated with fracture location (see table) . Ages 18-54 and bike accidents were more strongly associated with proximal radius fractures (odds ratio: 12 [2-94] and 5 [2-13], respectively). Conclusion: Patients presenting to our inner city ED with a radius fracture are more likely to have a distal fracture. Adults 18-54 and bike accidents had a significantly higher incidence of proximal fractures than other ages or MOIs. Background: Trauma centers use guidelines to determine the need for a trauma surgeon in the ED on patient arrival. A decision rule from Loma Linda University that includes penetrating injury and tachycardia was developed to predict which pediatric trauma patients require emergent intervention, and thus are most likely to benefit from surgical presence in the ED. Objectives: Our goal was to validate the Loma Linda Rule (LLR) in a heterogeneous pediatric trauma population and to compare it to the American College of Surgeons' Major Resuscitation Criteria (MRC). We hypothesized that the LLR would be more sensitive than the MRC for identifying the need for emergent operative or procedural intervention. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of prospectively collected trauma registry data from two urban Level I pediatric trauma centers with a combined annual census of approximately 115,000 visits. Consecutive patients <15 years old with blunt or penetrating trauma from 1993 through 2010 were included. Patient demographics, injury severity scores (ISS), times of ED arrival and surgical intervention, and all variables of both rules were obtained. The outcome (emergent operative intervention within 1 hour of ED arrival or ED cricothyroidotomy or thoracotomy) was confirmed by trained, blinded abstractors. Sensitivities, specificities, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for both rules. Results: 8,079 patients were included with a median age of 5.9 years and a median ISS of 9. Emergent intervention was required in 51 patients (0.6%). The LLR had a sensitivity ranging from 59.4%-59.7% (95% CI: 25.9%-93.5%) and specificity ranging from 49.5%-86.5% (95% CI: 21.6%-82.1%) between both institutions. The MRC had a sensitivity ranging from 73.6%-81.6% (95% CI: 54.7%-95.1%) and specificity ranging from 69.4%-84.7% (95% CI: 54.7%-90.1%) between institutions. Conclusion: Emergent intervention is rare in pediatric trauma patients. The MRC was more sensitive for predicting the need for emergent intervention than the LLR. Neither set of criteria was sufficiently accurate to recommend their routine use for pediatric trauma patients.",

Given the changes in renal function, potentially harmful non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be minimized to prevent exacerbating acute kidney injury. Background: More than 10% of the elderly abuse prescription drugs, and emergency medicine providers frequently struggle to identify features of opioid addiction in this population. The Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire (PDUQp) is a validated, 42-item, patient-administered tool developed to help health care providers better identify problematic opioid use, or dependence, in patients who receive opioids for the treatment of chronic pain. Objectives: To identify the prevalence of prescription drug misuse features in elderly ED patients. Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted between 07/2011 and 08/2011 in the ED of an urban, university-affiliated community hospi-tal that serves a large geriatric population. All patients aged 65 to 89 inclusive were eligible, and were recruited on a convenience basis. Exclusion criteria included known dementia, and critical illness. Outcomes of interest included self-reported history of prior prescription opioid use, substance abuse history, aberrant medication-taking behaviors, and PDUQp results. Results: One hundred patients were approached for participation. Two were excluded for inability to read English, three were receiving analgesia for metastatic cancer, 28 had never taken a prescription opioid, and seven refused to participate beyond pre-screening. Sixty patients completed the study (see table 1 ). Of those, 13.3% reported four or more visits within 12 months; chronic pain was reported by 56.7%; debilitating pain by 55.9%; prior pain management referral by 18.3%; and storing opioids for future use by 30%. Seventeen patients reported current prescription opioid use, and were administered the PDUQp (see figure) . In this population, 47.1% thought their pain was not adequately being treated; 41.2% reported having to increase the amount of pain medication they were taking over the prior 6 months; 35.3% saved up future pain medication; 11.8% had doctors refuse to give them pain medication for fear that the patient would abuse the prescription opioids; and 29.4% reported having a previous drug or alcohol problem. Conclusion: Screening instruments, such as the PDUQp, facilitate identification of geriatric patients with features of opioid misuse. A high proportion of patients in this study save opioids for further use. Interventions for safe medication disposal may decrease access to opioids and subsequent morbidity. Age extremes, male sex, and several chronic health conditions were associated with increased odds of heat stroke, hospital admission, and death in the ED by a factor of 2-3. Chronic hematologic disease (e.g. anemia) was associated with a 10-12 fold increase in adjusted odds of each of these outcomes. Conclusion: HRI imposes a substantial public health burden, and a wider range of chronic conditions confer susceptibility than previously thought. Males, older adults, and patients with chronic conditions, particularly anemia, are likely to have more severe HRI, be admitted, or die in the ED. Background: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a remarkable cause of death worldwide. CO, produced by the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons, has many toxic effects on especially the heart and brain. CO binds strongly to cytochrome oxidase, hemoglobin, and myoglobin causing hypoxia of organs and issues. CO converts hemoglobin to carboxyhemoglobin and makes transport of oxygen through the body impossible and causes severe hypoxia. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the levels of S100b and neuron specific enolase (NSE) measured both during admittance and at the sixth hour of hyperbaric and normobaric oxygen therapy carried out on patients with a diagnosis of CO poisoning. Methods: The study is designed as a prospective observational laboratory study. Forty patients were enrolled in the study: 20 underwent normobaric oxygen therapy (NBOT) and the other 20 underwent hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Levels of S100b and NSE were measured both during admittance and at the sixth hour of admittance of all patients. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcome measures were recorded. All data were statistically analyzed. Results: In both treatment groups, mean levels of NSE after therapy were significantly lower than admittance levels. Although levels of NSE measured before and 6 hours after treatment in HBOT group were high, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). In both treatment groups, mean levels of S100b after therapy were significantly lower than admittance levels; likewise NSE. Although levels of S100b measured before and 6 hours after treatment in HBOT group were high, the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Additionally, while levels of S100b measured after treatment in the HBOT group were lower compared to the NBOT group, the difference between groups was also not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion: Levels of S100b and NSE as evidence for brain injury elevation in case of CO poisoining and decrease by therapy according to our study as well as previous studies. Decrease in levels of S100b is more significant. According to our results, S100b and NSE may be useful markers in case of CO poisoning; however, we did not meet any data providing more value in determining HBOT indications and determining levels of COHb in the management of patients with a diagnosis of CO poisoining.",

We recruited a convenience sample of residents and students rotating in the pediatric emergency department. A two-sided form had the same seven clinical decisions on each side: whether to perform blood, urine, spinal fluid tests, imaging, IV fluids, antibiotics, or a consult. The rating choices were: Definitely Not, Probably Not, Probably Would, and Definitely Would. Trainees rated each decision after seeing a patient, but before presenting to the preceptor, who, after evaluating the patient, rated the same seven decisions on the second side of the form. The preceptor also indicated the most relevant decision (MRD) for that patient. We examined the validity of the technique using hypothesis testing; we posited that residents would have a higher degree of concordance with the preceptor than would medical students.

The students were surveyed before voluntarily participating in a student-led ACLS course in March of their final year. The surveys were distributed before starting the training course. Both BLS and ACLS training, comfort levels, and perceptions were assessed in the survey. Results: Of the 182 students in the graduating class, 152 participated in the training class with 109 (72%) completing the survey. 50% of students entered medical school without any prior training and 49% started clinics without training. 83.5% of students reported witnessing an average of 3.0 in-hospital cardiac arrests during training (range of 0-20). Overall, students rated their preparedness 2.0 (SD 1.0) for adult resuscitations on a 1-5 Likert scale with 1 being the unprepared. 98% and 92% of students believe that BLS and ACLS should be included in the medical student curriculum respectively with a preference for teaching before starting clerkships. 36% of students avoided participating in resuscitations due to lack of training. Of those, 95% said they would have participated had they been trained. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to address the perceptions and needs for BLS and ACLS training in U.S. medical schools. Students feel that BLS and ACLS training is needed in their curriculum and would possibly enhance perceived comfort levels and willingness to participate in resuscitations. Background: Professionalism is one of six core competency requirements of the ACGME, yet defining and teaching its principles remains a challenge. The ''social contract'' between physician and community is clearly central to professionalism so determining the patient's understanding of the physician's role in the relationship is important. Because specialization has created more narrowly focused and often quite different interactions in different medical environments, the patient concept of professionalism in different settings may vary as well.",

Background: Although emergency physicians must often make rapid decisions that incorporate their interpretation of an ECG, there is no evidence-based description of ECG interpretation competencies for emergency medicine (EM) trainees. The first step in defining these competencies is to develop a prioritized list of ECG findings relevant to EM contexts. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to categorize the importance of various ECG diagnoses and/or findings for the EM trainee. Methods: We developed an extensive list of potentially important ECG diagnoses identified through a detailed review of the cardiology and EM literature. We then conducted a three-round Delphi expert opinion-soliciting process where participants used a five-point Likert scale to rate the importance of each diagnosis for EM trainees. Consensus was defined as a minimum of 75 percent agreement on any particular diagnosis at the second round or later. In the absence of consensus, stability was defined as a shift of 20 percent or less after successive rounds. Results: Twenty-two EM experts participated in the Delphi process, sixteen (72%) of whom completed the process. Of those, fifteen were experts from eleven different EM training programs across Canada and one was a recognized expert in EM electrocardiography. Overall, 77 diagnoses reached consensus, 42 achieved stability, and one diagnosis achieved neither consensus nor stability. Out of 120 potentially important ECG diagnoses, 53 (43%) were considered ''Must know'' diagnoses, 62 (51%) ''Should know'' diagnoses, and 7 (6%) ''Nice to know'' diagnoses. Conclusion: We have categorized ECG diagnoses within an EM training context, knowledge of which may allow clinical EM teachers to establish educational priorities. This categorization will also facilitate the development of an educational framework to establish EM trainee competency in ECG interpretation.",

High quality CPR has been shown to impart greater cardiac arrest survival; however, retention of basic CPR skills by health care providers has been shown to be poor. Objectives: To evaluate practitioner acceptance of an in-service CPR skills refresher program, and to assess for operator response to real-time feedback during refreshers. Methods: We prospectively evaluated a ''Rolling Refresher'' in-service program at an academic medical center. This program is a proctored CPR practice session using a mannequin and CPR-sensing defibrillator that provides real-time CPR quality feedback. Subjects were basic life support-trained providers who were engaged in clinical care at the time of enrollment. Subjects were asked to perform two minutes of chest compressions (CCs) using the feedback system. CCs could be terminated when the subject had completed approximately 30 seconds of compressions with <3 corrective prompts. A survey was then completed by to obtain feedback regarding the perceived efficacy of this training model. CPR quality was then evaluated using custom analysis software to determine the percent of CC adequacy in 30-second intervals. Results: Enrollment included 88 subjects from the emergency department and critical care units (55 nurses, 17 physicians, 16 students and allied health professionals). All participants completed a survey and 61 CPR performance data logs were obtained. Positive impressions of the in-service program were registered by 81% (71/88) and 74% (65/88) reported a self-perceived improvement in skills confidence. Eighty-three percent (73/88) of respondents felt comfortable performing this refresher during a clinical shift. Thirtynine percent (24/61) of episodes exhibited adequate CC performance with approximately 30 seconds of CC. Of the remaining 37 episodes, 71.1 \u00b1 29.2% of CC were adequate in the first 30 seconds with 80.1 \u00b1 28.6% of CC adequate during the last 30 second interval (p = 0.1847). Of these 37 individuals, 30 improved or had no change in their CPR skills, and 7 individuals skills declined during CC performance (p = 0.007). Conclusion: Implementation of a bedside CPR skill refresher program is feasible and is well received by hospital staff.

Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled educational trial of two methods of teaching IO skills. Preclinical medical students with no past IO experience completed a written test and were randomized to either an online or classroom curriculum. The online group (OG) were given password-protected access to a website and instructed to spend 30 minutes with the material while the didactic group (DG) attended a lecture of similar duration. Participants then attended a 30-minute unsupervised manikin practice session on a separate day without any further instruction. A videotaped objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) and post-course written test were completed immediately following this practice session. Finally, participants were crossed over into the alternate curriculum and were asked to complete a satisfaction survey that compared the two curricula.

Objectives: Using published US guidelines, we developed four Observed Structured Competency Evalua-tions (OSCE) for four common EM US exams: FAST, aortic, cardiac, and pelvic. Inter-rater reliability was calculated for overall performance and for the individual components of each OSCE. Methods: This prospective observational study derived four OSCEs that evaluated overall study competency, image quality for each required view, technical factors (probe placement, orientation, angle, gain, and depth), and identification of key anatomic structures. EM residents with varying levels of training completed an OSCE under direct observation of two EM-trained US experts. Each expert was blinded to the other's assessment. Overall study competency and image quality of each required views were rated on a five-point scale (1poor, 2-fair, 3-adequate, 4-good, 5-excellent), with explicit definitions for each rating. Each study had technical factors (correct/incorrect) and anatomic structures (identified/not identified) assessed as binary variables. Data were analyzed using Cohen's and weighted k, descriptive statistics, and 95% CI. Results: A total of 185 US exams were observed, including 33 FAST, 53 cardiac, 53 aorta, and 46 pelvic. Total assessments included 185 ratings of overall study competency, 691 ratings of required view image quality, 2998 ratings of technical factors, and 2978 ratings of anatomic structures. Inter-rater assessment of overall study competency showed excellent agreement, raw agreement 0.84 (0.77, 0.89), weighted k 0.87 (0.82, 0.91).

The compressibility was assessed at baseline, and then further assessed with one proximal tourniquet, two tourniquets (one distal and one proximal), and a proximal blood pressure cuff inflated to 150 mmHg. Compressibility was defined as the vessel's resistance to collapse to external pressure and rated as completely compressible, moderately compressible, or mildly compressible after mild pressure was applied with the ultrasound probe. Results: One-hundred patients were recruited into the study. Ninety-eight subjects were found to have a completely compressible basilic vein at baseline. When one tourniquet and two tourniquets were applied 64 and 58 participants, respectively, continued to have completely compressible veins. A Fisher's Exact test comparing one versus two tourniquets revealed no difference between these two techniques (p = 0.46). Only two participants continued to have completely compressible veins following application of the blood pressure cuff. The compressibility of this group was found to be statistically significant by Fisher's Exact test compared to both tourniquet groups (p < 0.0001).

Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an underused test that can provide valuable information in the evaluation of emergency department (ED) patients with altered mental status (AMS). In AMS patients with nonconvulsive seizure (NCS), EEG is necessary to make the diagnosis and to initiate proper treatment. Yet, most cases of NCS are diagnosed >24 h after ED presentation. Obstacles to routine use of EEG in the ED include space limitations, absence of 24/7 availability of EEG technologists and interpreters, and the electrically hostile ED environment. A novel miniature portable wireless device (microEEG) is designed to overcome these obstacles.

Inclusion: Patients \u202113 years old with AMS. Exclusion: An easily correctable cause of AMS (e.g. hypoglycemia, opioid overdose). Three 30-minute EEGs were obtained in random order from each subject beginning within one hour of presentation: 1) a standard EEG, 2) a microEEG obtained simultaneously with conventional cup electrodes using a signal splitter, and 3) a microEEG using an Electrocap. Outcome: operative characteristics of micro-EEG in identifying any EEG abnormality. All EEGs were interpreted in a blinded fashion by two board-certified epileptologists. Within each reader-patient pairing, the accuracy of EEGs 2 and 3 were each assessed relative to EEG 1. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LR) are reported for microEEG by standard electrodes and Electrocap (EEGs 2 and 3). Inter-rater variability for EEG interpretations is reported with kappa. Results: The interim analysis was performed on 130 consecutive patients (target sample size: 260) enrolled from May to October 2011 (median age: 61, range: 13-100, 40% male). Overall, 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76-88%) of interpretations were abnormal (based on EEG1). Kappa values representing the agreement of neurologists in interpretation of EEG 1-3 were 0.54 (0.36-0.73), 0.57 (0.39-0.75), and 0.55 (0.37-0.74), respectively. Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of microEEG are comparable to those of standard EEG but the unique ED-friendly characteristics of the device could help overcome the existing barriers for more frequent use of EEG in the ED.

At the time of discharge, for patients randomized to comprehensive care, we reinforced their diagnosis, shared a migraine education presentation from the National Library of Medicine, provided them with six tablets of sumatriptan 100 mg and 14 tablets of naproxen 500 mg, and if they wished, provided them with an expedited free appointment to our institution's Headache Clinic. Patients randomized to typical care received the care their attending emergency physician felt was appropriate. The primary outcome was a between-group comparison of the HIT6 score, a validated headache assessment instrument, one month after ED discharge. Secondary outcomes included an assessment of satisfaction with headache care and frequency of use of migraine-specific medication within that one month period. The outcome assessor was blinded to assignment. Results: Over a 19 month period, 50 migraine patients were enrolled. One month follow-up was successfully obtained in 92% of patients. Baseline characteristics were comparable. One month HIT6 scores in the two groups were nearly identical (59 vs 56, 95%CI for difference of 3: )5, 11), as was dissatisfaction with overall headache care (17% versus 18%, 95%CI for difference of 1%: )22, 24%). Not surprisingly, patients randomized to the comprehensive intervention were more likely to be using triptans or migraine-preventive therapy (43% versus 0%, 95%CI for difference of 43%: 20, 63%) one month later. Conclusion: A comprehensive migraine intervention, when compared to typical care, did not improve HIT6 scores one month after ED discharge. Future work is needed to define a migraine intervention that is practical and useful in an ED. Background: Lumbar puncture (LP) is the standard of care for excluding non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and is usually performed following head CT (HCT). However, in the setting of a non-diagnostic HCT, LP demonstrates a low overall diagnostic yield for SAH (<1% positive rate).",

Patients with a final diagnosis of non-traumatic SAH were screened for case inclusion, defined as an initial HCT without SAH by final radiologist interpretation and a LP with >5 red blood cells/mm 3 , along with either 1) xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid, 2) angiographic evidence of cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, or 3) head imaging showing SAH within 48 hours following LP. Control patients were randomly selected among ED patients diagnosed with headache following a negative SAH evaluation with HCT and LP. Controls were matched to cases by year and presenting ED in a 3:1 ratio. Stepwise logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree Analysis (CART) were employed to identify predictive variables. Inter-rater reliability (kappa) was determined by independent chart review. Results: Fifty-five cases were identified. All cases were Hunt-Hess grade 1 or 2. Demographics are shown in Table 1 . Thirty-four cases (62%) had angiographic evidence of SAH. Five variables were identified that positively predicted SAH following a normal HCT with 98% sensitivity (95% CI, 90-100%) and 25% specificity (95% CI, 19-32%): age > 50 years, neck pain or stiffness, onset of headache with exertion, vomiting with headache, or loss of consciousness at headache onset. Kappa values for selected variables ranged from 0.75-1.0 (18% sample). The c-statistic (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value for the logistic regression model are 0.87 and 0.74, respectively (Table 2) . Conclusion: Several clinical variables can help safely limit the amount of invasive testing for SAH following a non-diagnostic HCT. Prospective validation of this model is needed prior to practice implementation. Background: Post-thrombolysis intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with poor outcomes.

Retrospective data were collected from four hospitals from 1996-2005, and 24 distinct hospitals from 2007-2010 as part of a cluster randomized trial. The same chart abstraction tool was used during both time periods and data were subjected to numerous quality control checks. Hemorrhages were classified using a pre-specified methodology: ICH was defined as presence of hemorrhage in radiographic interpretations of follow up imaging (primary outcome). Symptomatic ICH (secondary outcome) was defined as radiographic ICH with associated clinical worsening. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to adjust for clinical factors previously identified to be related to postthrombolysis ICH. As there were fewer SICH events, the multivariable model was constructed similarly, except that variables divided into quartiles in the primary analysis were dichotomized at the median. Results: There were 830 patients included, with 47% having documented pre-existing AP treatment. The mean age was 69 years, the cohort was 53% male, and the median NIHSS was 12. The unadjusted proportion of patients with any ICH was 15.1% without AP and 19.3% with AP (difference 4.2%, 95% CI )1.2% to 9.6%); for SICH this was 6.1% without AP and 9% with AP (difference 3.1%, 95%CI )1 to 6.7%). No significant association between pre-existing AP treatment with radiographic or symptomatic ICH was observed (table) . Conclusion: We did not find that AP treatment was associated with post-thrombolysis ICH or SICH in this cohort of community treated patients. Pre-existing tobacco use, younger age, and lower severity were associated with lower odds of SICH. An association between AP therapy and SICH may still exist -further research with larger sample sizes is warranted in order to detect smaller effect sizes. Background: Post-cardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia (TH) improves survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest, but the parameters required for optimal neuroprotection remain uncertain. Our laboratory recently reported that 48-hour TH was superior to 24-hour TH in protecting hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after asphyxial cardiac arrest in rats. Cerebellar Purkinje cells are also highly sensitive to ischemic injury caused by cardiac arrest, but the effect of TH on this neuron population has not been previously studied. Objectives: We examined the effect of post-cardiac arrest TH onset time and duration on Purkinje neuron survival in cerebella collected during our previous study. Methods: Adult male Long Evans rats were subjected to 10-minute asphyxial cardiac arrest followed by CPR. Rats that achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) were block randomized to normothermia (37.0 deg C) or TH (33.0 deg C) initiated 0, 1, 4, or 8 hours after ROSC and maintained for 24 or 48 hours (n = 21 per group). Sham injured rats underwent anesthesia and instrumentation only. Seven days post-cardiac arrest or sham injury, rats were euthanized and brain tissue was processed for histology. Surviving Purkinje cells with normal morphology were quantified in the primary fissure in Nissl stained sagittal sections of the cerebellar vermis. Purkinje cell density was calculated for each rat, and group means were compared by ANOVA with Bonferroni analysis. Results: Purkinje cell density averaged (+/) SD) 35.9 (2.4) cells/mm in sham-injured rats. Neuronal survival in normothermic post-cardiac arrest rats was significantly reduced compared to sham (10.7% (5.0%)). Overall, TH resulted in significant neuroprotection compared to normothermia (38.9% (15.7%) of sham). Purkinje cell density with 24-hour duration TH was 35.0% (11.2%) of sham and 48-hour duration TH was 43.3% (15.6%), both significantly improved from sham (p = 0.245 between durations). TH initiated 0, 1, 4, and 8 hours post-ROSC provided similar benefit: 44.6% (21.6%), 33.2% (8.1%), 36.6% (12.9%), and 41.1% (9.3%) of sham, respectively. Conclusion: Overall, these results indicate that postcardiac arrest TH protects cerebellar Purkinje cells with a broad therapeutic window. Our results underscore the importance of considering multiple brain regions when optimizing the neuroprotective effect of post-cardiac arrest TH.",

For shock, participants failed to ask for a dextrose check in 71% (95%CI 51-86%), and it was delayed by more than 60 seconds for all others. Conclusion: The most common error across all scenarios was delay in pulse check. Delays in starting CPR and inappropriate defibrillation were common errors in non-shockable arrests, while failure to identify rhythm, CPR omission, and delaying defibrillation were noted for shockable arrests. For shock, omission of rapid dextrose check was the most common error, while delaying the test when ordered was also significant. Future training in pediatric resuscitation should target these errors. Background: Many scoring instruments have been described to measure clinical performance during resuscitation; however, the validity of these tools has yet to be proven in pediatric resuscitation. Objectives: To determine the external validity of published scoring instruments to evaluate clinical performance during simulated pediatric resuscitations using PALS algorithms and to determine if inter-rater reliability could be assessed. Methods: This was a prospective quasi-experimental design performed in a simulation lab of a pediatric tertiary care facility. Participants were residents from a single pediatric program distinct from where the instrument was originally developed. A total of 13 PGY1s and 11 PGY3s were videotaped during five simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios. Pediatric emergency physicians rated resident performances before and after a PALS course using standardized scoring. Each video recording was viewed and scored by two raters blinded to one another. A priori, it was determined that, for the scoring instrument to be valid, participants should improve their scores after participating in the PALS course. Differences in means between pre-PALS and post-PALS and PGY1 and PGY3 were compared using an ANOVA test. To investigate differences in the scores of the two groups over the five scenarios, a two-factor ANOVA was used. Reliability was assessed by calculating an interclass correlation coefficient for each scenario. Results: Following the PALS course, scores improved by 8.6% (3.8 to 13.3), 15.7% (8.6 to 22.7), 6.3% ()1.8 to 14.3), 18.2% (9.3 to 27), and 4.1% ()3.0 to 11.2) for the pulseless non-shockable arrest, pulseless shockable arrest, dysrhythmia, respiratory, and shock scenarios respectively. There were no differences in scores between PGY1s and PGY3s before and after the PALS course. There was an excellent reliability for each scoring instrument with ICCs varying between 0.85 and 0.98. Conclusion: The scoring instrument was able to demonstrate significant improvements in scores following a PALS course for PGY1 and PGY3 pediatric residents for the pulseless non-shockable arrest, pulseless shockable, and respiratory arrest scenarios only. However, it was unable to discriminate between PGY1s and PGY3s both before and after the PALS course for any scenarios. The scoring instrument showed excellent inter-reliability for all scenarios.",

The results from this pilot study are encouraging and support a larger, more rigorous study. Initial approaches to common complaints are taught using a standard curriculum of lecture and small group case-based discussion. We added a simulation exercise to the traditional altered mental status (AMS) curriculum with the hypothesis that this would positively affect student knowledge, attitudes, and level of clinical confidence caring for patients with AMS. Methods: AMS simulation sessions were conducted in June 2010 and 2011; student participation was voluntary. The simulation exercises included two AMS cases using a full-body simulator and a faculty debriefing after each case. Both students who did and did not participate in the simulations completed a written post-test and a survey related to confidence in their approach to AMS. Results: 154 students completed the post-test and survey. 65 (42%) attended the simulation session. 48 (31%) attended all three sessions. 58 (38%) participated in the lecture and small group. 15 (10%) did not attend any session. Post-test scores were higher in students who attended the simulations versus those who did not: 7 (IQR, 6-8) vs. 6 (IQR, 4-7); P < 0.001. Students who attended the simulations felt more confident about assessing an AMS patient (58% vs. 42%; P = 0.05), articulating a differential diagnosis (66% vs. 47%; P = 0.03), and knowing initial diagnostic tests (74% vs. 53%; P = 0.01) and initial interventions (79% vs. 56%; P = 0.003) for an AMS patient. Students who attended the simulations were more likely to rate the overall AMS curriculum as useful (94% vs. 61%; P < 0.001).",

Trainees participated in two simulation scenarios (ectopic pregnancy and status asthmaticus) in which they were responsible for clinical management (CM) and patient interactions (PI). This was the first simulation exposure during an established simulation curriculum for MS1, MS3, and PGY1. Two independent raters reviewed videotaped simulation scenarios using checklists of critical actions for clinical management (CM: 0-11 points) and patient interactions (PI: 0-17 points). Inter-rater reliability was assessed by intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs Objectives: We explored attitudes and beliefs about the handoff, using qualitative methods, from a diverse group of stakeholders within the EMS community. We also characterized perceptions of barriers to high-quality handoffs and identified strategies for optimizing this process. Methods: We conducted seven focus groups at three separate gatherings of EMS professionals (one local, two national) in 2010/2011. Snowball sampling was used to recruit 48 participants with diverse professional, experiential, geographic, and demographic characteristics. Focus groups, lasting 60-90 minutes, were moderated by investigators trained in qualitative methods, using an interview guide to elicit conversation. Recordings of each group were transcribed. Three reviewers analyzed the text in a multi-stage iterative process to code the data, describe the main categories, and identify unifying themes. Results: Participants included EMTs, paramedics, physicians, and nurses. Clinical experience ranged from 4 months to 36 years. Recurrent thematic domains when discussing attitudes and beliefs were: perceptions of respect and competence, professionalism, teamwork, value assigned to the process, and professional duty. Modifiers of these domains were: hierarchy, skill/training level, severity/type of patient illness, and system/ regulatory factors. Strategies to improving barriers to the handoff included: fostering familiarity and personal connections between EMS and ED staff, encouraging two-way conversations, feedback, and direct interactions between EMS providers and ED physicians, and optimizing ways for EMS providers to share subjective impressions (beyond standardized data elements) with hospital-based care teams. Conclusion: EMS professionals assign high value to the ED handoff. Variations in patient acuity, familiarity with other handoff participants, and perceptions of respect and professionalism appear to influence the perceived quality of this transition. Regulatory strategies to standardize the contents of the handoff may not alone overcome barriers to this process. miology, public health) then developed an approach to assign EMS records to one of 20 symptom-based illness categories (gastrointestinal illness, respiratory, etc). EMS encounter records were characterized into these illness categories using a novel text analytic program. Event alerts were identified across the state and local regions in illness categories using either change detection from baseline with (CUSUM) analysis (three standard deviations) and a novel text-proportion (TAP) analysis approach (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results: 2.4 million EMS encounter records over a 2year period were analyzed. The initial analysis focused upon gastrointestinal illness (GI) given the potential relationship of GI distress to infectious outbreaks, food contamination and intentional poisonings (ricin). After accounting for seasonality, a significant GI event was detected in Feb 2010 (see red circle on graph). This event coincided with a confirmed norovirus outbreak. The use of CUSUM approach (yellow circle on graph) detected the alert event on Jan 24, 2010. The novel TAP approach on a regional basis detected the alert on Dec 6, 2009. Conclusion: EMS has the advantage of being an early point of contact with patients and providing information on the location of insult or injury. Surveillance based on EMS information system data can detect emergent outbreaks of illness of interest to public health. A novel text proportion analytic technique shows promise as an early event detection method.",

The instrument was distributed to a systematic probability sample of EMTs and paramedics (n = 12,000). The survey also included the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, 1983) to assess for convergent construct validity. Results: The survey attained a 13.6% usable response rate (n = 1633); respondent characteristics were consistent across demographic characteristics with other studies of EMTs and paramedics. The sample was split in order to allow for exploratory and confirmatory fac-tor analyses (n = 847/n = 786). In the exploratory factor analysis, principal axis factoring with an oblique rotation revealed a two-factor, 34-item solution (KMO = 0.943, v 2 = 23344.38, df = 561, p \u00a3.001). Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a more parsimonious, two-factor, 20-item solution (v 2 = 632.67, df = 168, p \u00a3 0.001, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.91, SRMR = 0.04). The factors demonstrated good internal reliability (operational stress a = 0.877, organizational stress a = 0.868). Both factors were significantly correlated (p \u00a3 0.01) with the hypothesized convergent validity measure. Conclusion: Theory and empirical research indicate that exposure to chronic workplace stress may play an important part in the development of psychological distress, including burnout, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Workplace stress and stress reactions may potentially interfere with job performance. As no extant measure assesses for chronic workplace stress in EMS, the validation of this chronic stress measure enhances the tools EMS leaders and researchers have in assessing the health and well-being of EMS providers.",

Conclusion: Age, as an independent variable, is the best predictor of CIN, when compared with SCr and GFR. Due to a small number of cases with CIN, the confidence intervals associated with the odds ratios are wide. Future research should focus on patient risk stratification and establishing ED interventions to prevent CIN. 694 A Rat Model of Carbon Monoxide Induced Neurotoxicity Heather Ellsworth",

INTERVENTIONS: We measured continuous heart rate (HR), sBP, MAP, cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ). Laboratory values monitored included pH, pCO 2 , bicarbonate, lactate, and amitriptyline levels. Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, standard errors of measurement, and confidence limits were calculated. Results: Of 14 swine, seven each were allocated to IFE and SB groups. There was no difference at baseline for each group regarding HR, sBP, MAP, CO, SVR, or SvO 2 .

Gaieski, Anne Grossestreuer, Marion Leary, Lance B. Becker, Benjamin S. Abella University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PABackground: Lactate levels rise during the no-or lowflow state associated with cardiac arrest. Lactate clearance has been proposed as a marker for adequacy of resuscitation in critically ill patients including post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) patients. These findings need further investigation in health systems delivering state-of-the-art PCAS therapy including therapeutic hypothermia (TH), hemodynamic optimization, and other aspects of modern critical care. Objectives: To measure the relationship between lactate clearance and outcomes in PCAS patients treated with TH. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of 155 PCAS patients admitted to an academic medical center between April 2005 and October 2010 who were treated with bundled post-arrest care and had serial lactate values drawn during the first 48 hours of postarrest care. Unadjusted (t-test) analyses were performed to determine the association between lactate clearance and mortality in these patients. Results: The mean lactate value immediately after return of spontaneous circulation (121 patients) was 9.5 mmol/L (SD 5.0; range 1.2-21.9); for the second lactate measured (105 patients), 6.0 mmol/L (SD 4.6; range 0.7-20.); for 6 hours post-arrest (112 patients), 3.8 mmol/L (SD 3.2; range 0.5-16.4); for 12 hours postarrest (130 patients), 3.6 mmol/L (SD 2.8; range 0.3-14.3); for 24 hours post-arrest, 2.6 mmol/L (SD 2.4; range 0.4-13.0); and for 48 hours post-arrest, 2.2 mmol/ L (SD 1.9; range 0.5-9.4). The amount of lactate clearance between the first and second lactate value demonstrated a trend toward increased survival with increased clearance (p = 0.054); increased lactate clearance between the 6-and 48-hour post-arrest values was significantly associated with improved survival (p = 0.045). Conclusion: Increased lactate clearance is associated with improved survival in PCAS patients treated with bundled post-arrest care.",

In this study group, almost one-third of patients admitted to ED OBS with cellulitis ultimately were admitted to an inpatient unit. We found no significant difference in admission rates based on age, sex, diabetes, IVDU, or prior course of oral antibiotics. Patients with hand infections had the highest admission rates compared to other body locations.

We have previ-The goal of the investigation was to examine and quantify hospice eligibility and code status in a cohort of patients transferred from nursing homes and other extended care facilities to EDs who are subsequently admitted to the hospital. Additionally, it was hypothesized that demographic variables would influence whether an HPC intervention was received and that hospital course would differ for those patients who received an HPC intervention. Methods: A retrospective chart review of a random sample (n = 97) of non-cancer terminally ill NH patients admitted to a Level I trauma center via the ED was performed. Nursing home residents who presented to the ED were excluded if they were transferred back to the NH after a period of observation of less than 24 hours.

Methods: An anonymous 15-item web-based survey was sent to the department chairs of all accredited civilian emergency medicine residency programs in March and April of 2011. Respondents were asked to rate different parts of the candidate's application using a fivepoint Likert scale, rank important attributes, and list any desirable fellowships. They were also asked to give the current number of available job openings. Results: 84 of 152 eligible chairs responded, giving a response rate of 55%. The most important parts of a candidate's application were the interview (4.Ability to work in a team.'' Other common responses included ''Clinical productivity,'' ''Teaching potential,'' and ''Substantial publications.'' Advanced training in ultrasound was listed as the most sought after fellowship by 55% of the chairs. Other fellowships receiving >30% of affirmative votes include critical care, pediatrics, and toxicology. Overall, department chairs did not have a difficult time in recruiting EM-trained physicians (2.5 \u00b1 1.3 on a five-point scale), with 56% of respondents stating that they had no current job openings. Conclusion: This study is the first attempt to examine what academic ED chairs are looking for when they hire new attendings. How a physician relates to others was consistently rated and ranked as the most important part of the candidate's application with the interview and recommendations taking the lead. As they are tasked with training the next generation of physicians, academic programs are also concerned with teaching and research ability. Overall, finding a job in academic emergency medicine is difficult, with graduates having limited job prospects.Background: The Revised Professional Practice Environment Scale (RPPE) is a 39-item multidimensional measure designed to evaluate eight components of professional clinical practice in the acute care setting. Developed for and used primarily with registered nurses, the RPPE is a valuable tool for evaluating clinicians' perceptions of the practice environment, the efficacy of changes in practice, for strategic planning, and for developing supports for the IOM's six dimensions of quality. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the reliability and validity of the RPPE when used with a sample of emergency physicians. Methods: A psychometric evaluation of the RPPE was undertaken with a sample of emergency physicians. Participants completed the 39-item instrument in an anonymous fashion using a pencil and paper format. Analyses included evaluations of: a) internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's alpha coefficient and item analysis, b) principle components analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization, and c) internal consistency reliability of the components identified through PCA. Results: The initial Cronbach's alpha for all 39 items was 0.88; 11 items were then removed from analysis due to low (<0.30) corrected item-to-total correlations. Cronbach's alpha for the remaining 28 items was 0.905, indicating high internal consistency reliability. The 28 items subjected to PCA yielded a six-component solution explaining 76.1% of observed variance. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the individual components comprising the scale ranged from 0.70 to 0.89, indicating that the subscales may be used independently to measure the various aspects of the emergency physician's professional practice environment.Conclusion:The results of this pilot study suggest that a shortened, 28-item version of the RPPE scale is psychometrically sound when used with emergency physicians to evaluate their perceptions regarding their practice environment. While the RPPE holds promise as a method for evaluating changes to the practice environment and for creating an environment supportive of the IOM's dimensions of quality, additional research with a larger, more diverse sample of physicians is indicated prior to widespread utilization of the instrument in the physician population.",

            "text": "Background: In April, 2009 the District of Columbia adopted a policy in which Medicaid reimbursement rates are now on par with Medicare. It is unclear whether this policy has improved access to care in this population. This policy is similar to what will be adopted as part of the nationwide health reform initiative. Objectives: To evaluate changes in realized access to care since implementation of a local policy change affecting Medicaid reimbursement. We hypothesized that access would be improved among persons with Medicaid in 2011 as compared to years before implementation of the policy change. Methods: We used a scripted hypothetical patient scenario of a patient with hypertension seen in the emergency department requiring close outpatient follow-up. We compared our results in 2011 to prior results from studies conducted with similar methodology in 2005 and 2008. Calls were made to private providers (Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, and private insurance scenarios) and safety net clinics (Medicaid HMO and uninsured scenarios). Appointment success rates were compared across scenarios using bivariate (chi-square) analysis. Results: Calls were made to a total of 31 private provider offices(Medicaid, private, uninsured, and Medicare scenarios)  and 35 safety net clinics (uninsured, Medicaid, and DC Alliance safety net scenarios). When comparing 2011 appointment success rates, the Medicaid fee for service scenario calls to private providers had the lowest success rate (30.8%) as compared to the highest success rate of 50.6% among the private insurance scenario calls (p = 0.09). Analyzing trends over time, access to appointments for private providers for all insurance scenarios combined decreased from 60% in 2005 to 53.8% in2008 and  46.2% in 2011 (p = 0.02 comparing 2005 to 2011). For the Medicaid fee for service scenario, there was no significant change in appointment success rate before and after implementation of the reimbursement changes.Conclusion: Despite high rates of insurance coverage in Washington DC, our study indicates that accessing care was more difficult for consumers in 2008 and 2011 as compared to 2005. Policy changes designed to improve Medicaid reimbursement to private providers did not improve appointment accessibility among the Medicaid fee for service population. Health reform initiatives that expand insurance coverage should also address realized access to care.Access to Urgent Pediatric Primary CareAppointments in the District of Columbia Rachelle Pierre Mathieu, Janice Blanchard, Adith Sekaran, Rachel Nash, Lauren Winter, Christine Prideaux George Washington, Washington, DC Background: Timely access to acute primary care appointments after an emergency department (ED) visit has become a challenge for both providers and patients. Previous studies have documented disparities in accessing adult primary care and pediatric specialty care, especially among those lacking private insurance. There are little data regarding urgent pediatric primary care access.Objectives: This study measured pediatric access to urgent primary care appointments within the District of Columbia following an ED visit. We hypothesized there would be a disparity in access for uninsured children and those with Medicaid. Methods: We used mystery caller methodology to evaluate rates of appointment access for pediatric patients. Calls were made to randomly selected private pediatric practices as well as pediatricians at safety net clinics. Research assistants posed as a parent calling to secure an urgent appointment for their child following a recent ED visit for a urinary tract infection using a standardized clinical script varying by insurance status. We calculated rates of appointment success as well as average appointment wait time, and analyzed differences using bivariate (chisquare) analysis. Results: We sampled 57 safety net clinics and 29 private clinics. As compared to private scenario calls made to private providers (36.8% success rate), appointment success rates were lowest for the Medicaid scenario calls made to private providers (27.8%). Calls made to safety net providers for the Medicaid patient scenario (48.8%, p = 0.38) and uninsured patient scenario (47.7%, p = 0.42) had higher appointment success rates but longer wait times. Average appointment wait time at safety net clinics was 12.3 days (95% CI, 3.5 to 21.1) for Medicaid patients and 10.4 days (95% CI, 6.7 to 14.1) for uninsured patients. Average appointment wait times for the privately insured at private practices were 1.9 days (95% CI, 1.0 to 2.7). Conclusion: This study demonstrated disparities in access to urgent pediatric primary care appointments by health insurance in the District. Although appointment success rates were not different by practice setting or insurance type, wait times were significantly longer for callers to safety net providers as compared to private practices. Pediatric provider access needs to be improved with public and private insurance expansions in the wake of health reform. and midline or paraspinal tenderness) to determine the number of patients who would require cervical immobilization. Our secondary objective was to determine the percentage of missed cervical spine injuries, had each protocol been followed with 100% compliance. Methods: Design: Cross sectional. Setting: Inner city ED. Subjects: Patients \u202118 yrs transported by EMS after a traumatic mechanism. For patients meeting inclusion criteria, a structured data form which obtained demographics and data for all three protocols was completed by the treating physician immediately after the history and physical exam but before radiologic imaging. Medical record review ascertained cervical spine injuries. Both physicians and data abstractors were blinded to the objective of the study. Analysis: Chi-square. Results: Of the 498 enrolled patients, 58% were male and the mean age was 48 \u00b1 20 yrs. The following proportions of patients would have required cervical spine immobilization based on the respective protocols: PHTLS, 95.4% (95% CI 93.1-96.9%); Domeier, 68.7% (95% CI 64.5-72.6%); Hankins, 81.5% (95% CI 77.9-84.7%), p < 0.001. There were a total of 16 (3.2%) cervical spine injuries: 11 (2%) vertebral fractures, 2 (0.4%) subluxations/dislocations, and 3 (0.6%) spinal cord injuries. Complete compliance with each of the three protocols would have led to appropriate cervical spine immobilization of all injured patients. Conclusion: The mechanism-based PHTLS protocol required immobilization of the greatest percentage of patients, as compared to the Domeier and Hankins protocols. Although physician-determined presence of cervical spine immobilization criteria cannot be generalized to the findings obtained by EMS personnel, our findings suggest that mechanism-based criteria may result in unnecessary cervical spine immobilization without any benefit to injured patients.The Cost-Effectiveness Of Improvements In Prehospital Trauma Triage In The U.S M. Kit Delgado 1 , David Spain 1 , Sharada Weir 2 , Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert 1 1 Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 2 University of Massachusettes Medical School, Shrewsbury, MA Background: Trauma centers (TC) reduce mortality by 25% for severely injured patients but cost significantly more than non-trauma centers (NTC). The CDC 2009 field triage guidelines set targets to reduce undertriage of these patients to NTC to <5% and reduce overtriage of minor injury patients to TC to <50%. Objectives: Determine the cost-effectiveness of reaching CDC targets for prehospital trauma triage performance in U.S. regions with <1 hour EMS access to Level I TC. Methods: Using a decision-analytic Markov model, we evaluated the effect of incremental improvements in prehospital trauma triage performance on costs and survival given a baseline undertriage rate of major injury patients to NTC of 20% and overtriage rate of minor trauma patients to TC of 75%. The model followed patients from injury through prehospital care, hospitalization, first year post-discharge, and the remainder of life. Patients were trauma victims with a mean age of 43 (range: 18-85) with Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS) from 1-6. Cost and survival probability inputs were derived from the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma for patients with moderate to severe injury (AIS 3-6), National Trauma Data Bank, and published literature for patients with minor injury (AIS 1-2). Outcomes included costs (2009$), quality adjusted life-years (QALY), and incremental costeffectiveness ratios. Results: Reducing undertriage rates from 20% to 5% would yield 4.0 (95% CI 3.5-4.4) QALYs gained (or 0.16 to 0.20 lives saved) per 100 patients transported by EMS. Reducing overtriage rates from 75% to 50% would save $108,000 per 100 patients transported. Reducing undertriage is cost-effective at less than $100,000/QALY as long as overtriage rates do not proportionally increase by a factor >0.7. Ideal simultaneous reductions of undertriage to 5% and overtriage to 50% would be cost-effective at $17,400/QALY gained. Results were only sensitive to situations in which the cost of treating patients with minor injures at TC, relative to NTC, was smaller than expected. Conclusion: Reducing prehospital undertriage of trauma patients would be cost-effective provided overtriage does not proportionally increase by a factor >0.7. Improving prehospital trauma triage should be a national priority; reducing undertriage by 15% could save 7,000-8,800 lives/year and reducing overtriage by 25% could save up to $4.8 billion/year.Background: PHTLS provides guidelines for prehospital cervical spine immobilization in trauma patients and is followed by many EMS personnel. Yet, it is unknown how closely EMS providers adhere to these guidelines.Objectives: To determine EMS compliance with the PHTLS guidelines in trauma patients transported to a Level I trauma center ED who did not result in a trauma alert. Our secondary objective was to identify criteria associated with inadequate cervical spine immobilization by EMS which then led to immobilization in the ED. Methods: Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Urban, academic ED. Subjects: Patients \u202118 years transported by EMS after a traumatic mechanism. Trained research associates screened all EMS patients for inclusion. For patients meeting inclusion criteria, a structured data form which obtained demographics and PHTLS data was completed by the treating physician immediately after the history and physical exam but before radiologic imaging. Both RAs and physicians were blinded to the objective of the study. Analysis: Chi-square and multivariable regression. Results: Of the 498 patients who were enrolled, 58% were male, mean patient age was 48 \u00b1 20 years, and mean GCS was 14.8 \u00b1 0.8.

However, since linkage of EMS and trauma center (TC) outcome data is highly challenging, there is a paucity of large, multisystem studies that directly assess the association between EMS GCS and distal outcomes. Objectives: To evaluate the association between EMS GCS and outcomes in patients with moderate or severe (m/s) TBI in a statewide EMS system. Methods: The Arizona State Trauma Registry (ASTR) contains EMS and TC data from all trauma patients transported by 300 EMS agencies to any of the eight formally designated Level I TCs in the state. We evaluated the associations between initial EMS GCS and various TC outcomes in all m/s TBI cases based upon final diagnoses (CDC Barell Matrix Type 1, 1/1/09-12/31/10). EMS GCS showed strong association with survival and other outcomes, with lower GCS associated with lower survival, greater hospital LOS, higher hospital charges, and greater proportion of survivors discharged to R/SCF. While initial GCS was strongly associated with outcomes, it is notable that two-thirds of all patients with final diagnosis of moderate or severe TBI had an initial GCS of \u202113. Furthermore, 17.3% of patients with ''mild'' GCS were discharged to R/SCF. Thus, while EMS GCS is useful for risk stratification, a substantial number of patients with a ''good'' prehospital GCS actually have significant TBI.Background: Dating violence is a serious cause of emotional and physical injury among adolescents.

It is unclear whether IPV victims engage in health screening behaviors at different rates than other women, placing them at varying risks for other diseases. Objectives: To assess the association of IPV with health status and preventative screening behaviors in an ED population. We hypothesized that IPV victims would report poorer physical and mental health and have lower frequencies of preventative screening behaviors than nonvictims. Methods: Adult female patients who presented to three EDs on weekdays from 11 AM to 7 PM were asked by trained research staff to participate in a computerized survey about ''women's health'' over a 14-month period. Women were excluded if they were critically ill, did not speak English, intoxicated, or exhibited signs of psychosis. Validated measures were used, including the Universal Violence Prevention Screen to identify IPV and the Danger Assessment Scale to measure IPV severity. We also assessed respondents' physical and mental health using the Short Form-12. Patients were asked about chronic disease history, including diagnoses of HIV and diabetes, if they had a regular doctor, and how often they had received pap smears, selfbreast exams, and doctor or nurse-performed breast exams. We used chi-square tests, t-tests, and linear regression analyses to measure associations. on the Short Form-12. IPV victims who reported HIV testing had significantly higher Danger Assessment scores than victims who had not been tested (p = 0.048). Conclusion: IPV victims are more likely to report lower measures of health status, higher rates of HIV, and less frequent self-breast exams than other female ED patients, putting them at risk for other chronic diseases.Background: In an effort to reduce underage drinking, Iowa City, IA adopted a 21-only ordinance prohibiting persons under 21 from being in bars after 10 PM. This ordinance went into effect on June 1, 2010. Preliminary data studied over a 3-month period showed a significant decrease in alcohol related emergencies. Iowa City is mainly a college town and home of the University of Iowa (UI). Objectives: The primary goal was to determine whether there was a change in alcohol-related (AR) emergency visits over a one year period from the start of the ordinance. Secondary goals were to measure the effect on underage alcohol emergencies, student alcohol-related emergencies, and arrests for public intoxication. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of emergency department patients, ages 18 to 22, presenting for AR reasons fromJune 1, 2010 to May 31,  2011 and compared data to the same time period a year earlier (AY2009). Data were also obtained from UI student records and public arrest data. Pearson chi square analysis compared categorical variables. Results: There were 2954 total visits in AY2009 and 2989 total visits in AY2010. AR visits decreased from 453 in AY2009 (15.3%) to 359 in 2010 (12.0%, p < 0.001) and underage AR visits decreased from 15.9% to 12.3%, p < 0.005, seetable.UI student AR visits decreased by 16% from 218 to 183, and Non-UI student AR visits decreased by 25% from 235 to 176. Public intoxication bookings for 18 to 20 year olds decreased from 598 to 409 (32%),",

A list of potential factors predicting success was obtained from a review of the literature and included age, sex, Glasgow Coma Scale, location of intubation attempt, paralytics and sedation given, a difficult airway prediction score, and type of call (trauma, medical, or cardiac arrest). Results: Data from 549 intubations were analysed. The success rate on first attempt at intubation was 317/549 (57.7%) and the overall success rate was 87.4%. The mean age was 43.5 years and 69.4% were male and 56.4% were trauma patients. Of these, 498 had complete data for all predictive variables and were included in the multivariate analysis. The factors that were found to be statistically significant were age per decade (OR 1.CI 0.41-0.91). This model demonstrated a good fit (Hosmer Lemeshow = 8.906) with an AUC of 0.632. Conclusion: Use of a paralytic agent, age, and sex were associated with increased success of intubation. The association of sedative use only with decreased success of intubation was unexpected and may be due to confounding related to the indications for sedation, such as patient agitation. Our findings may have implications for RSI-capable paramedics and require further study. St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI; 8 University of Florida, Jacksonville, FL",

Objectives: To derive a simple four-variable prognostic model of mortality for patients with confirmed PE, the ''Pulmonary Embolism Triage Score'' (PETS), with equal performance characteristics to the more complicated PESI and sPESI. Methods: PETS was retrospectively derived from 1438 patients with data to compute PESI in the Emergency Medicine Pulmonary Embolism in the Real World Registry (EMPEROR), an observational database of 1880 image-confirmed PE patients prospectively enrolled at 22 U.S. academic and community hospitals from 1/1/ 2005 to 12/29/2008. Logistic regression identified four variables that when positive were independently associated with higher 30-day mortality: presence of massive pulmonary embolism (SBP<90 mm Hg), tachypnea (respiratory rate \u202124 breaths per minute), history of cancer, and leukocytosis (WBC>11,000 cells per cubic mm).

Abella, David F. Gaieski University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PABackground: The 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Consensus recommend immediate treatment of hypotension to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) is <65 mmHg, they recommend infusion of fluid and use of vasopressors to restore adequate pressure. However, there is no literature to date examining the relationship between early blood pressure goals and outcomes in post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Objectives: We examined the relationship between MAP at specific time points post-arrest and neurologic and survival outcomes for PCAS patients. Methods: All consecutive PCAS patients treated with algorithmic post-arrest care including hemodynamic optimization and TH at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between May, 2005 and October, 2011 were included. Hemodynamic data, including MAP and number of vasopressors, were analyzed at 1, 6, 12, and 24 hour time points after return of spontaneous circulation. Outcomes data collected included survival to hospital discharge. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and ANOVA in repeated measures over time.Results: 168 patients were included in the analysis; 45% (75/168) survived, and 35% (58/168) had a good neurological outcome at hospital discharge. The majority of the 168 patients were at or above goal MAP (80-100 mmHg) at all time points and between 51-59% were on at least one vasopressor at any time point.Conclusion:In comatose PCAS patients undergoing TH, early optimization of MAP as a measure of adequacy of perfusion may improve outcomes. Further prospective studies with specific MAP goals and hemodynamic optimization algorithms need to be performed.Background: Lactate levels rise during the no-or lowflow states associated with cardiac arrest. Prior studies have demonstrated that initial post-arrest lactate levels correlate with mortality (higher levels associated with worse outcomes). These findings need further validation in health systems delivering state-of-the-art post-arrest care including therapeutic hypothermia (TH), hemodynamic optimization, and other aspects of modern critical care. Objectives: To assess the relationship between initial lactate levels and outcomes in post-cardiac arrest syndrome patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed of 155 post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) patients admitted to an academic medical center between April 2005 and October 2010 who were treated with bundled post-arrest care and had serial lactate values drawn during the first 24 hours after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Unadjusted (t-test) analyses were performed to determine the association between initial and serial lactate values and mortality in these patients. Results: The mean post-ROSC lactate value (121 patients) was 9.5 mmol/L (SD 5.0; range 1.2-21.9). This value did not correlate with mortality, including when limited to initial lactate values >10 mmol/L. The mean value for the second lactate measured (105 patients) was 6.0 mmol/L (SD 4.6; range 0.7-20.0); higher second lactate values were associated with higher mortality (p = 0.049). Similar results were seen at 24 hours. Conclusion: Initial lactate levels are not associated with mortality in PCAS patients treated with bundled postarrest care. Subsequent lactate levels(second, 12-hour,  and 24-hour)  were associated with mortality with lower levels associated with better survival.

However, little is known about how differences in building type affect the provision of bystander CPR and AED use for OHCA victims. Objectives: To categorize the locations of public OHCA events and to estimate and compare the prevalence of AED use and bystander CPR performance between these building types. Methods: Design: Secondary analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) dataset. Setting: CARES comprises 29 U.S. cities in 17 states with a catchment of over 22 million people. Population: Consecutive arrests restricted to those that occurred in a public location (excluding street/highway) and had an AED used by either layperson or first responder from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009. Street address and latitude/longitude information were used to identify the type of building. Buildings were categorized using an adaptation of the City of Toronto Employment Survey Classification Protocols. Satellite and street imagery and property/tax records were used to categorize the business/institution. Results: A total of 20,018 arrests occurred during the study period. Of the 971 public arrests which had an AED used, 77 were unable to be geocoded, while an additional 150 were found to be misclassified. The most common reasons for misclassification were the use of the categories ''Public Building'' and ''Other'' for structures that were non-public (e.g. private residences or health care facility). The final sample included 744 OHCA events (seetable). An AED was used by a layperson in 224 (30.1%) or first responder in 520 (69.9%) of these arrests, while bystander CPR was performed in 441 arrests (59.3%). Almost one in six arrests where an AED was used occurred in a retail shopping center. Colleges (1.2%, n = 10) and convention centers (1.0%, n = 8) made up a small percentage of the public arrests where an AED was used, but a large proportion of events occurring in these locations received bystander CPR (80, 87%) and had a layperson use an AED (60, 62%). Conclusion: Building types have differing layperson bystander CPR and AED use. Building types in which larger proportions of OHCA victims are receiving these life-saving interventions could be models for successful public education campaigns.Ethnic Disparities In The Utilization Of EMS Resources And The Impact On Doorto-PCI Times In STEMI Patients Nick Testa, Garren MI Low, David Shavelle, Stephanie Hall, Kim Newton, Linda Chan Los Angeles County + USC Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA Background: EMS literature has shown that the use of 9-1-1 services varies with ethnicity. Objectives: In this study, we examined whether ethnic variability exists among STEMI patients utilizing EMS and whether there is a difference in door-to-PCI time between ethnic groups. Methods: We analyzed data prospectively collected from January 2009 through June 2011 to assess the difference in door-to-PCI time between the two largest ethnic groups of STEMI patients (Hispanic and African Americans). Results: Of a total of 494 STEMI patients, 276 (56%)were Hispanic and 95 (19%) were African American. African Americans utilized EMS more than Hispanics (75% versus 40%, p < 0.0001).

Enander, Richard E. Wolfe, Edward R. Marcantonio, Nathan I. Shapiro Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA Background: Delirium is common in the ED, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and is often under-diagnosed by ED physicians. A better understanding of predictors of ED delirium would help to target case-finding, prevention, and treatment efforts. Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify independent risk factors for delirium in the ED utilizing patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Methods: We performed a prospective, observational study of elderly patients in our urban university ED. Inclusion criteria were: ED patient >= 65 years and ability of patient or surrogate to provide informed consent and cooperate with testing. A trained research assistant performed a structured mental status assessment including the MMSE and Delirium Symptom Interview. Delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). We collected data on patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, and ED course. Using the outcome of delirium from the CAM, we identified univariate correlates of delirium. Variables with a p < 0.1 were included in a multivariate logistic regression model; backward selection was used to create a final model of significant predictor variables with a p <= 0.05. We allowed approximately 1 predictor per 10 delirious patients to avoid over-fitting the model. Model accuracy was assessed by the c-statistic and Hosmer Lemeshow tests. Patients with preexisting neurological disease, evidence of respiratory distress, or presenting with a urinary tract infection or intracranial hemorrhage were most likely to present with ED delirium. This simple risk prediction model, easily performed in the emergency setting, demonstrated excellent discrimination and calibration. Hospitalization Rates and Resource Utilization of Delirious ED Patients Maura Kennedy, Richard A. Enander, Richard E. Wolfe, Nathan I. Shapiro, Edward R Marcanatonio Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MABackground: Delirium is common in elderly ED patients and under-diagnosed in the ED. Delirium in the hospital is associated with higher health care expenditures and mortality, but these associations have not been well-studied in ED delirium.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare resource utilization and mortality among delirious and non-delirious elderly ED patients. Methods: We performed a prospective, observational study of elderly patients in our urban university ED. Inclusion criteria were ED patients >= 65 years and ability of patient/surrogate to provide informed consent and cooperate with testing. A trained research assistant performed a structured mental status assessment after which delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method. Patients were followed through their ED and hospital courses, and by telephone at 7 and 30 days. Data were collected on hospital and ICU admission, length of stay, hospital charges, and 30-day re-hospitalization and mortality. Proportions and Fisher's exact tests are reported for nominal data. Medians, 25%-75% interquartile ranges (IQR), and Wilcoxon Rank tests are reported for non-normally distributed continuous data. Delirium on presentation to the ED is associated with greater health care utilization and costs, and higher rates of discharge to a long term care facility and 30-day mortality. Further research is needed to determine if early diagnosis in the emergency setting may improve the outcome of patients presenting with delirium. Adam N. Frisch, Brian P.

In multivariable analysis, the relationship between increasing age and EMS use remained statistically significant and was not confounded by other variables. Additional research is needed to account for potential unmeasured confounders (e.g., insurance status and access to alternative transportation) and to elucidate reasons for the increased likelihood of EMS use among older adults. St Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor/ University of Michigan EM Residency, Ann Arbor, MIBackground: Senior (geriatric) EDs are opening with increasing frequency around the US, providing elders with more comprehensive screening for depression, polypharmacy, and other concerns, which may decrease the frequency of return visits (recidivism). Evaluation in the ED by social workers may also decrease admissions and allow earlier hospital discharge. Currently little information describes the effect on recidivism, rate of admission, or hospital length of stay for this important new phenomenon. Objectives: To investigate the effect of a Senior ED on recidivism, rate of hospital admission, and hospital length of stay, comparing a group before and after this intervention in a large suburban community hospital. Methods: We created a propensity variable for recidivism within 30 days for each of 66 DRG categories in the pre-Senior ED group, only. These DRG categories were then ranked by quintiles of propensity to return, and the rankings were applied to each patient in both cohorts. Multivariable analyses were used to balance any chance difference in risk between recidivism, admission rate, and LOS. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to test whether the intervention affected time to return within 30 days. Length of stay, propensity to return, and age were summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR). Triage level, sex, and insurance type were summarized using percentage.Results: A total of 8154 patients were included, 4252 in the pre-Senior ED group and 3902 in the Senior ED group. Subsequent exclusions were: 201 in the highest emergency severity index (ESI level 1), in 274 cases ESI was not determined, and one had an unrealistic recorded age of 130 years, leaving 7678, with 3936 in the pre-Senior ED group and 3742 in the Senior ED group. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 77.2 (8.3), ranging from 65 to 102, and 51% were female (seetable). The risk of being admitted was lower in the Conclusion: A new senior ED resulted in a small decrease in rate of admission, but no significant effect on either recidivism or LOS was seen.

To fill this void, the Clerkship Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) tasked a committee with development of an end-of-rotation examination geared towards fourth-year (M4) EM students, based on a national syllabus, and consisting of examination questions written according to published question writing guidelines. Objectives: To describe the development of the examination and provide data concerning its initial usage and performance. Methods: Exam Development: The CDEM Testing Committee systematically reviewed an existing EM, student-focused question database at www.saemtests.org. Question assessment included statistical performance analysis, compliance with published item writing guidelines, and topic inclusion within the published EM M4 syllabus. For syllabus topics without existing questions, committee members wrote new items. Committee members developed a system for secure online examination administration. Data Analysis: LXR 6.0 testing software was used to administer the examination. Data gathered included numbers of examinations completed and institutions participating, mean and median scores with standard deviation, and point biserial correlation (rpb) for each question.Results: Thirty-six questions meeting the stated criteria were selected for inclusion in the National EM M4 Examination. An additional fourteen questions were written by committee members to generate a 50-question examination. The National EM M4 Examination was released online on August 1, 2011. Three months into its availability, the examination had been completed 703 times by students from 22 participating clerkships. The mean score was 80.2 (SD 4.0) and the median score was 82.0. The average rbp was 0.226 (range 0.021-0.385). Conclusion: The National EM M4 Examination is a 50-question multiple choice high-stakes examination developed to help fill a void in the assessment of EM students. Initial data demonstrate acceptable mean and median scores as well as acceptable rpbs.",

Cranial CT scans are often used to detect intracranial injuries, but are also sensitive for unexpected non-traumatic findings that may be inconsequential or clinically important. Objectives: To describe the prevalence and urgency of incidental findings on CT in children evaluated in a large, multi-center observational study of children with blunt head trauma. Methods: This was a planned secondary analysis of a study of children with blunt head trauma. Radiologist CT reports were reviewed. Reports were abstracted and categorized into three groups of clinical urgency based on an a priori list of diagnoses: Category 1) requires prompt evaluation/intervention, 2) requires timely outpatient follow-up, 3) no specific follow-up needed. Consensus was achieved on diagnosis and urgency by a pediatric emergency medicine physician and pediatric neurosurgeon. Results: 43,904 patients were enrolled in the parent study, of whom 16,137 (37%) received a cranial CT scan in the ED. We identified incidental, non-traumatic findings on 830/16,137 (5%) CT scans. Of these, 125/830 (15%) were reclassified as normal variants. Of the remaining 705, the most common non-traumatic findings were: ventricular abnormality (12%), arachnoid cyst (10%), and increased extra-axial fluid (10%). Four percent were category 1, with hydrocephalus most common. Category 3 represented 70%, and category 2 represented 26%. Conclusion: Incidental non-traumatic findings on cranial CT are present in 5% of children evaluated in the ED for blunt head trauma. Most do not require specific intervention. However, 30% (category 1 + 2) warranted either prompt or timely subspecialty consultation. ED providers should be alert to the possibility of incidental findings on cranial CT obtained following trauma, and engage mechanisms to ensure appropriate follow-up.

Singer Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NYBackground: Pain is a multidimensional experience. Fear and anxiety may bias pain reporting and interfere with measuring pain. Few studies on pain severity reporting in children have evaluated discriminate validity. Objectives: The objective of our study was to determine discriminate validity of the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WBS). We hypothesized that children (3-6 years) would be able to appropriately use the WBS for reporting pain. Methods: Study Design: Prospective observational. Setting: University-based, suburban pediatric ED. Subjects: Patients age 3-6 years. Measures: Research assistants recorded demographic variables along with presence of pain (yes/no) and pain severity rating using the six-category WBS. Patients also completed a 26item Likert questionnaire assessing fears in medical settings: the Child Medical Fear Scale (CMFS), minimum score 26, maximum 78. Analysis: Descriptive statistics. Pearson's correlation was used to measure agreement between dichotomous and ordinal/categorical data. Spearman's correlations were used to measure agreement between WBS and CMFS. Results: One hundred and thirty four children were enrolled; 118 with pain, 16 without. There was an even distribution of WBS ratings. Five children with no pain utilized face categories reflective of pain. Likewise, 23 children (20%) with reported pain provided assessments using the ''no pain'' face. The correlation between pain presence and WBS reporting was poor (r = 0.38; 95%CI 0.23 to 0.52). Only 50% were able to complete the CMFS. Young children appear to have difficulty reporting pain on the WBS. However, young children do not appear to mistake fear for pain presence or misuse face categories for fear severity.Timeliness and Effectiveness of Intranasal Fentanyl Administration for Children Ryan J. Scheper, Amy L. Drendel, Marc H. Gorelick, Martha W. Stevens, Steven J. Weisman, Raymond J. Hoffmann, Kim Gejewski Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI Background: Inadequate treatment of children with painful conditions is a significant problem in the emergency department (ED). Intranasal (IN) fentanyl is a painless, rapid means to administer analgesia for moderate to severe pain that may be particularly useful for the pediatric patient. Objectives: Determine if IN fentanyl 1) improves the timeliness of analgesic administration for children with fractures and 2) improves the treatment of pain for children compared to usual treatment in the ED prior to its utilization. Methods: A retrospective observational study, before and after the introduction of IN fentanyl on September 1, 2009, was performed. All children ages 0-18 years with a fracture and an Emergency Severity Index triage level 2 were identified. A random sample of children evaluated during a 15-month period prior to initiation of IN fentanyl (Group A) was compared to a consecutive sample of children administered IN fentanyl during the first 15 months of IN fentanyl use (Group B).A chart review identified demographic information, ED analgesic used, time to analgesic, and pain scores. Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were used to test for significant differences. Results: 255 children (Group A) prior to, and 121 children (Group B) after initiation of IN fentanyl were enrolled. Most children in Group A received morphine (87.9%), oxycodone with acetaminophen (5.2%), or ibuprofen (3.6%). There was no difference in age, race/ ethnicity, sex, or initial pain score between the two groups. Median time to analgesic administration was 28.2 minutes for Group A, compared to 15.0 minutes for Group B (p < 0.0001). The median decrease in pain score on a 10-point scale was 2 points for Group A, compared to 3 points for Group B (p = 0.04). One hour after receiving an analgesic, only 60.83% of children in Group A achieved a clinically relevant (2-point) improvement in pain score, compared to 84.93% in Group B (p = 0.0006). Conclusion: IN fentanyl was associated with a more timely analgesic administration and more effective pain relief for children with fractures compared to usual care in the ED.Background: The ED centers on the stabilization and resuscitation of the acutely ill and injured patients.",

Objectives: To characterize the incidence of ED-associated deaths nationally and to compare characteristics of patients who die during or immediately following ED visits (within 3 days of admission), to those that are admitted to the hospital and survive to discharge. Methods: We analyzed adult participants of the 2006-2009 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual, nationally representative sample of all U.S. ED visits. We grouped deaths as those who were dead on arrival, died during the ED visit, and admitted to the hospital and died prior to hospital discharge. We analyzed the survey-weighted data to generate nationally representative estimates. year died during hospitalization after an ED visit. Of the 130,000 patients/year who died within 3 days of hospital admission, the majority (120,000) were admitted to a critical care area. Patients who died in the ED, compared to those who died during hospital stay, were more likely to have been hypothermic (28% vs. 17%), bradycardic (29% vs. 6%), and hypotensive (44% vs. 11%) on ED vitals signs. Of note, for patients who died during their ED stays, 71% \u202193%). Of note, only 73% of patients who died during their ED visit were triaged as category 1 (immediate). Conclusion: Despite the large number of patients, emergency physicians identified most patients that died within 3 days of admission and triaged them to ICU care. Many patients who died during the ED visit had lower triage acuity and were without severe vital sign abnormality at presentation; this finding was magnified in those that were admitted and died during hospitalization.Background: Emergency department (ED) crowding has led to increased length of stay for intubated patients, leaving early post-intubation care to the emergency physician. The quality of post-intubation care in the ED has not been extensively studied. We sought to determine how frequently common post-intubation interventions are performed while patients board in the ED. Objectives: We hypothesized that few intubated patients receive all interventions while boarding in the ED.Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of all patients intubated in the Washington Hospital Center ED between 11/14/09 to 6/1/11. Patients were excluded if they were in the ED for <2 hours post-intubation, had emergent surgery within six hours post-intubation, were managed by the trauma team, had incomplete data, or had their status changed to ''do not resuscitate''(DNR) during their admission. Trained research assistants blinded to the objectives reviewed each chart to determine if the following interventions were performed in the ED post-intubation: appropriate initial tidal volume (6-10 cc/kg ideal body weight), sedation given <30 minutes of intubation, oro/nasogastric tube (OGT) placement, chest x-ray (CXR), arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling, and use of continuous endtidal capnography (ETCO 2 ). Additionally, ventilator duration, ICU length of stay, mortality, and development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were recorded. Results: 622 charts were reviewed, with 453 charts excluded (158 in the ED for <2 hours post-intubation, 143 trauma patients, 112 DNR, 40 other reasons), leaving 169 patients in our cohort. Of the six post-intuba-3%). The percentage of patients receiving all interventions was 2.4%; 5 of 6 interventions was 42.0%. Mean duration of ventilation and ICU length of stay were 3.4 days, and 5.2 days respectively with a VAP rate of 5.9% and a mortality rate of 8.9%. Conclusion: In this single center study, few patients received all six measured post-intubation interventions while boarding in the ED.Background: Recent evidence has suggested a potential role of vitamin D in modulating innate immune function.

Escobar 2 1 Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA; 2 Kaiser Permanente, Division of Research, Oakland, CA; 3 George Washington University, Washington, DC Background: ED patients admitted to hospital wards who are subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 24 hours have higher mortality than direct ICU admissions. Objectives: Describe risk factors for unplanned transfer to the ICU within 24 hours of ward arrival from the ED. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of all ED non-ICU admissions (N = 178,315) to 14 U.S. community hospitals from 2007-09. We tabulated patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and hospital volume by the outcome of unplanned ICU transfer. We present factors that were independently associated with unplanned ICU transfer within 24 hours after adjusting for patient and hospital differences in a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model. Results: Of all ED non-ICU admissions, 4,252 (2.4%) were transferred to the ICU within 24 hours. After adjusting for patient and hospital differences, the top five admitting diagnoses associated with unplanned transfer were: sepsis (odds ratio [OR] 2.6; 95% CI 2.1-3.1), catastrophic conditions (OR 2.3; 95% 1.9-2.8), pneumonia/acute respiratory infections (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4-1.8), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.3-1.8), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.3-1.7). Other factors associated with unplanned transfer included: male sex, Comorbidity Points Score (COPS) >145, Laboratory Acute Physiology Score (LAPS) >7, and arriving on the ward between 11 PM-7 AM. Decreased risk of unplanned transfer was found with admission to monitored transitional care units vs. non-monitored wards (OR 0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.96) and admission to a high-volume vs. low-volume hospital (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59-0.89). Conclusion: ED patients admitted with respiratory conditions, sepsis, AMI, multiple comorbidities, and abnormal lab results are at higher risk for unplanned ICU transfer and may benefit from better inpatient triage from the ED, earlier intervention to prevent acute decompensation, or closer monitoring. More research is needed to determine how intermediate care units, hospital volume, time of day, and sex affect risk of unplanned ICU transfer.

Our secondary endpoint was to determine inter-subject variation in IVC-US measurements. Methods: The authors performed a prospective randomized double-blinded trial using fasting volunteers to determine the inter-subject variation of baseline IVC-US and changes associated with different acute weightbased volume loads. Subjects with no history of cardiac disease or hypertension fasted for 12 hours and were then randomly assigned to receive a normal saline bolus of 2 ml/kg, 10 ml/kg or 30 ml/kg over 30 minutes.

The overall composite score for care was 75.6 of Calgary patients and 74.1 of Edmonton patients, respectively in the pre-OCP phase and did not change in the post-period (77.3 and 76.1 for both cities in the post-OCP phase comparison; P = NS). The global rating also remained unchanged following the intervention for both Calgary and Edmonton zones. Other dimensions of care remained unchanged. (See tables.)Conclusion: Improving ED crowding results in significant, albeit modest, improvements in patients' perceptions of crowding in busy urban hospital EDs. Site level variability in these effects should be explored further.Background: ED observation units are increasingly utilized nationwide and allow continued medical care for patients who are unable to be safely discharged but who may not require a full hospital admission. In addition to providing effective care, observation units have been tied to decreased ED crowding and lower rates of diversion. Additionally, ED observation units have the potential economic benefit of avoiding the high cost of hospital admissions. Interventions to reduce admission are vital to cost-savings in health care; however, the cost savings associated with preferential use of observation units has not been specifically described.Objectives: To determine the cost savings associated with using ED observation stays as compared to a 1-day inpatient admission in the state of Massachusetts. Methods: Using the Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy Acute Hospital Case Mix Databases, we analyzed patient visits in Fiscal Year 2008 from 65 hospitals for ED observation stays and 1-day length-of-stay (LOS) inpatient admissions from the ED as well as the total charges for each category of visit. Within each hospital, we first calculated the average charge for observation visits. The cost savings was then calculated as the difference between the calculated charges for 1-day LOS and the charges that would have been accrued if these additional admissions had instead been ED observation status. We determined total cost savings, mean cost savings per hospital, and average savings per patient with a 95%CI constructed around the difference in savings.",

Outcomes include hospital length of stay, direct costs, and ED revisits, and re-hospitalization at 12 weeks.Results: Twenty-three patients were enrolled and randomized. Twenty-eight patients were approached but excluded, and 19 additional patients met inclusion criteria but chose not to participate. With the exception of one patient who enrolled and whose family subsequently declined participation, all patients randomized to the intervention group received palliative care consultation. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Median hospital length of stay and direct costs of hospitalization for the intervention and control group were 8 versus 5 days, and $7782 versus $4029, respectively. At 12 weeks, the intervention and control group made 0.42 versus 0.55 ED revisits, and were re-hospitalized 0.50 versus 0.73 times. Conclusion: Enrolling and randomizing ED patients with advanced cancer to early palliative care consultation versus care as usual is feasible in a crowded, urban, academic ED. Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN; 2 Indiana University School of Nursing, Indianapolis, IN Background: Successful communication between physicians and nurses can minimize errors and improve patient safety in providing patient care; however, little opportunity is present in the professional practice curricula to engage in teamwork and collaboration. In this study, Indiana University (IU) nursing students, medical students, and EM residents participated in high-fidelity, mannequin-based interprofessional simulations.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine whether interprofessional simulation improves self-confidence in interprofessional communication, attitudes toward reporting medical errors, and barriers to nursephysician communication.Methods: Senior IU EM residents (R3) and senior IU medical students (MS4) are required to participate in separate simulation sessions throughout the academic year. Senior Bachelors of Science in Nursing students (BSN) were recruited on a volunteer basis to participate. A pre and post survey was administered to all participants. The survey was a collaborative effort by physician and nurse simulation faculty experts to include three sections: self-confidence in communication, error reporting, and barriers to physician-nurse communication.Results: There were 168 simulation surveys completed (12 R3, 119 MS4, 37 BSN). The testing tool was found to be reliable, with Chronbach alphas from 0.69-0.90. Following the sessions, overall mean confidence in interprofessional communication improved in all three groups: R3 (p = 0.078), MS4 (p = 0.262), and BSN (p = 0.026). Attitude towards reporting medical errors also improved in the MS4 and BSN groups (p < 0.001 for each), but not in the R3 group (p = 0.455). Barriers to communication showed a variable and not statistically significant difference between pre and post surveys in all groups. Conclusion: Self-confidence in interprofessional communication and error reporting was improved through interprofessional simulation sessions, with statistically significant improvement in the senior medical student and senior nursing student groups. Given the divergence of nursing and physician undergraduate medical education over the past few decades, interprofessional simulation may provide an opportunity for both groups to improve communication prior to clinical practice. New Haven Hospital, New Haven, CTBackground: In the past decade, there has been increased recognition of the importance of teaching end of life and palliative care skills to emergency physicians.

            "text": "). The mean scores on the post-test were 4.54 for the intervention group and 4.3 for the control group (p = 0.15), with no significant difference between the two groups. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in post-test scores (p < 0.01). Scores on the 12-item test reached a mean of 37.8% correct, and a high score of 66.7% correct. Conclusion: Simulation/debriefing alone does not account for the improvement in students' scores from the pre-test to post-test. Other experiences while on rotation may have been more influential. Further studies to determine whether the intervention affected student comfort level and feeling of preparedness dealing with end-of-life issues would be beneficial. Limitations of the study include difficulty level of the tests.Background: Simulation has become accepted as a valuable tool to the emergency medicine educator. Despite its recognized role, its use remains heterogeneous. Objectives: We sought to determine if there is any consensus on simulation scenarios that belong in emergency medicine simulation curricula. Methods: An online survey was distributed to members of the Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors mailing list. Information regarding each individual's academic title, involvement in resident education, and use of simulation in resident education was obtained. Additionally, respondents were asked to provide their opinion on the most important simulation scenarios in free text. Results were then analyzed and scenario themes were extracted from free text response. Results: 101 survey responses were analyzed. 95% of respondents noted that high-fidelity mannequin based simulation is being used in resident education. Individuals responding identified themselves as Program Directors (23%), Associate Program Directors (8%), Assistant Program Directors (9%), Simulation Directors (10%), and other faculty. Of the respondents, 75% reported that their program has a formal simulation curriculum. 43% of individuals reported that their simulation curriculum was developed based on an individual's decision, while 38% reported that it was the result of program consensus. Respondents reported that the most important simulation scenarios were those that incorporate protocols of Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and Advanced Traumatic Life Support. Additionally, teamwork/leadership, acute coronary syndrome, sepsis, respiratory failure, and OB/pregnancy-related disorders were identified as having high priority. Conclusion:",

Craven, Orhan Cinar, Troy Madsen University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT Background: Hispanic ethnicity has been reported as an independent risk factor for oligoanalgesia, and exploration of the ethnic basis for the differences in analgesic practice in the emergency department (ED) has been recommended in previous studies. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the pain management practices in Caucasian and Hispanic patients in the ED to determine whether potential ethnic differences exist in treatment of these groups. Methods: This study was a prospective analysis of a convenience sample of patients presenting to an urban, academic, tertiary care hospital ED over the 10-year period from 2000 through 2010. We compared patients who self-identified their race as Caucasian and Hispanic and evaluated analgesic administration rates, opioid administration and dosing, and pain and satisfaction scores (0-10 scale). Results: 15,060 patients presented to the ED during the 10-year study period and agreed to participate in the study. 81.2% (n = 12,232) of the patients were Caucasian while 11.2% (n = 1680) were Hispanic. Caucasian patients had a mean age of 39 + /-16 years while the mean age of Hispanic patients was 35 + /-13 years. Caucasian and Hispanic patients were similar in rates of analgesia and opioid administration for pain-related complaints. These findings contrast with previous studies reporting lower rates of analgesia administration among Hispanic patients in the ED.Background: Prior studies have shown that patients with non-specific abdominal pain are high utilizers of ED care. In addition, some causes of non-specific abdominal pain have also been shown to be associated with depression. For ED patients with non-specific abdominal pain, it is unknown if depression is independently correlated with high ED utilization.",

As compared to control patients, 33.9% of persons with chronic pain screened positive for depression as compared to 13.9% of persons without chronic pain. When controlling for other demographic factors, the OR for MDD among persons with chronic pain was 2.95 (95% CI 2.10, 4.15). 36% of patients with chronic pain with a positive depression screen had a new diagnosis of MDD made on the emergency department visits. Among persons with chronic pain with a prior history of MDD, only 61% were actively receiving treatment. Conclusion: Individuals with self-reported chronic pain had a higher likelihood of current depressive pathology, yet frequently do not receive psychiatric treatment for MDD. These findings suggest that the ED may play a major role in screening and treating patients with chronic pain and depression. Castillo, Theodore C. Chan, Jesse J. Brennan, James P. Killeen, Gary M. Vilke University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CABackground: As fiscal resources continue to shrink and ED overcrowding rises, communities need to better pool resources to optimally improve care of a region's patients. One issue is that of frequent flyers (FF) and ED super-users (SU). If these patients can be identified and determine if patterns of ED use/misuse are occurring, hospital systems and county public health can potentially intervene to offer case managing and other options such as pain contracts and more consistent management plans.Objectives: To evaluate the pattern of hospital use of frequent flyer (FF) and super user (SU) patients compared with infrequent user (IU) patients who have painassociated diagnoses.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of region-wide San Diego hospital ED visits between 2008 and 2010 using data submitted to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSH-PD) from 16 hospitals. Patients included in the inpatient (IP) discharge dataset who were admitted from an ED were extracted and merged with the ED discharge dataset to construct a complete ED utilization database. Patients without a valid patient identifier were excluded. FF were defined as having between 6 and 23 ED visits between any consecutive 12 months during the study period. SU were defined as having 24 or more ED visits. Demographics and patterns of use were identified for IU, FF, and SU groups for primary diagnosis of migraine or pain. Comparisons between groups were made and differences in proportions and 95% CI are presented.Results: During the study period, there were 11,213 SU, 86,185 FF, and 294,542 IU patients identified. When looking at hospitals visited, 98.3% of SU, 69.9 % of FF, and 13.1% of IU visited multiple hospitals. Pain and migraine visits accounted for a total of 5,649 (7.3%) visits by SU, 9,021 (2.6%) visits by FF, and 14,486 (0.9%) visits by IU overall. There were significantly more ED visits based on percentage of visits by SU and FF compared with IU for the diagnosis of migraine (4.4%, 1.4%, 0.5%) and pain (2.9%, 1.2%, 0.4%). The largest differences were between SU and IU and were 3.9% (3.8, 2.6) for migraine and 2.5% (2.4, 2.6) for pain. Conclusion: SU and FF patients have a significantly higher use of EDs for certain-pain related complaints and tend to visit multiple hospitals. Use of a Single Dose of Intramuscular Methadone for Acute Opioid Withdrawal Fiona M. Garlich 1 , Jessica Hetherington 1 , Nichole Williams 1 , Nick Williams 1 , Rama B. Rao 2 , Lewis S. Nelson 1 , Robert S. Hoffman 1 1 Bellevue Hospital Center, New York, NY; 2 Weill-Cornell Medical Cetner, New York, NY Background: ED treatment of acute opioid withdrawal (OW) is controversial and challenging. Methadone is commonly used for opioid maintenance and detoxification. Although unstudied, it is also used in low dose at our hospital for acute OW. Objectives: This observational study quantifies the subjective and objective effects of intramuscular (IM) methadone in OW. Methods: A convenience sample of adult, Englishspeaking patients who received IM methadone for OW in a large urban public hospital ED were prospectively enrolled and assessed with four parameters: vital signs; the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), a validated OW rating system (scores range from 0-47); the Altered Mental Status Scale (AMSS; scores sedation and agitation from )4 to 4); the Withdrawal Symptoms Scale (WSS), a Likert scale (range )2 [severe withdrawal] to +2 [high]). Patients were assessed prior to methadone and at fixed intervals for 2 hours or until discharge. The ordering physician independently assessed OW symptoms using the WSS. Adverse events, oxygen saturation <95%, respiratory rate <12/ min, or CNS depression (AMSS score \u00a3)2) were recorded. A paired Student's t-test was used to calculate significance.",

Age Alone is Not a Predictor of Poor Outcome in Post-Cardiac Arrest Brandon Giberson, Justin Salciccioli, Tyler Giberson, Matthew Bivens, Shiva Gautam, Cristal Cristia, Michael N. Cocchi, Michael W. Donnino BIDMC Center for Resuscitation Science, Boston, MA Background: Age is an independent predictor of mortality in most forms of acute illness, although reports remain conflicting in cardiac arrest. Objectives: Our objective was to determine if age is associated with mortality in the out-of-hospital post cardiac arrest patient. Secondarily, we examined the point at which age becomes a significant predictor of mortality. Methods: We performed an observational study of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age > 16 years, 2) OHCA, 3) ROSC, and 4) survival to hospital admission. Traumatic arrests were excluded. Data were collected and analyzed from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) database. Data collected included baseline demographics, arrest characteristics, and mortality (in-hospital death). We describe the population with simple descriptive statistics. We performed a multivariate logistic regression with age as the primary predictor variable to predict in-hospital death and report odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We used non-linear models to assess the point at which age becomes a significant predictor of mortality. Results: A total of 30,730 OHCA patients were in the CARES database. Of those, 7,495 met all inclusion criteria for this study. The mean age of the cohort was 64 (+/) 15 years) and 3056 (41%) were female. Age was a significant predictor of mortality in a univariate model (OR: 1.018, 95%CI: 1.015-1.022). After adjustments for initial arrest rhythm, sex, race, and location of arrest, age remained a significant predictor of mortality (OR: 1.015, 95%CI: 1.011-1.019). The point at which age becomes a significant predictor of mortality is 65. For patients under 65, age is not a significant predictor of mortality (OR: 0.997, 95%CI: 0.992-1.001).Conclusion: As an independent variable, age is a predictor of mortality in OHCA patients who achieve ROSC, but only after the age of 65. These results remain significant when adjusting for arrest and demographic characteristics.Background: Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been widely used to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure in ED patients. There is no clear evidence supporting the usefulness of quantitative BNP values for improving the outcomes or safety of ED heart failure patients. Objectives: To evaluate the usefulness of quantitative BNP values in identifying the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) in ED patients with heart failure. Methods: We prospectively measured BNP values (NT-ProBNP with Roche Elecsys 2010 system) in ng/L for adult patients who presented with shortness of breath due to acute decompensated heart failure. This prospective cohort study was conducted in six large, academic EDs and treatment plans were similar at each hospital. We included both patients admitted and those discharged from the ED and followed patients for 30 days. The primary outcome measure was SAE, defined as death, intubation, admission to a monitored unit, myocardial infarction, or relapse back to the ED within 14 days and requiring admission. We conducted both univariate and multivariate data analyses to test the association of NT-proBNP values (and suitable cutpoints) with the occurrence of SAE. Results: We enrolled 305 patients who had: mean age 76.2 years, male sex 58.7%, arrived by EMS 32.5%, initial heart rate \u2021110 9.8%, initial SaO 2 < 90% 8.7%, and elevated troponin 23.3%. The NT-proBNP values were: median 4,000.3 ng/L; range 11.0 to 52,852.0 ng/ L; \u20215,000 ng/L = 44.3%. For all patients, outcomes were SAE 9.5%, admission to a monitored unit 5.3%, intubation 0.3%, myocardial infarction 1.0%, and mortality 1.0%. Comparing the 29 SAE cases to the 276 without SAE, we found mean NT-proBNP values were 11,245 vs. 6,782 ng/L (P < 0.05) and the proportions with values \u20215,000 were 75.9% vs. 40.9% (P < 0.001).After adjustment for relevant clinical and laboratory covariates, logistic regression found that NT-proBNP \u20215,000 had an odds ratio for SAE of 4.39 (95% CI 1.36-14.16), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-offit p = 0.97. Conclusion: We found a very strong and independent association of elevated NT-proBNP values with poor outcomes in ED patients with heart failure. We suggest that quantitative NT-proBNP can play an important role in risk stratification and management planning, thus leading to better and safer care for ED heart failure patients.",

            "text": "Of the 373 patients enrolled, the mean age was 60 years; 69% were male. Seventy-one (19%) had coexisting COPD. Compared with non-COPD patients, COPD patients were older (65 vs. 59 years, P < 0.001) and were more likely to have diabetes (41% vs. 28%, P = 0.04). At acute hospitalization phase, of the seven biomarkers tested, COPD patients had higher levels of VCAM (805 vs. 718 ng/ml) and MCP-1 (194 vs.188 pg/ ml). Patients were followed for up to 6.6 years (median, 4 years). After adjusting for potential confounders in a Cox regression model, COPD (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-3.0) and a higher level of VCAM (adjusted HR, the highest vs. lowest quartile: 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5-6.6) independently predicted MACE outcomes. Conclusion: COPD is prevalent and significantly increases the long-term risk of major adverse cardiac outcomes among patients with ACS. VCAM is associated with COPD and predicts long-term outcomes for ACS. COPD management and the use of VCAM to guide therapy could potentially improve ACS outcomes.What is the Quality of Our Documentation for Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department with Acute Aortic Dissection?

            "text": "Abstract 614: Secondary Measures of Documentation QualityBackground: Over the past decade, several out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) interventions have been proposed to improve survival, including chest compressions before rhythm analysis (''CPR First''), emphasis on basic life support, and therapeutic hypothermia. However, little is known about the real-world effectiveness of these interventions on overall survival from OHCA when implemented in large EMS systems. Objectives: To examine the survival and neurologic outcomes in OHCA patients before and after the implementation of three system-wide interventions (CPR First, basic life support emphasis, and therapeutic hypothermia) in a large, urban EMS system. Methods: Design: Before-after interventional study. Setting: Denver EMS services a catchment of approximately 600,000 individuals and responds to approximately 80,000 9-1-1 calls annually. The EMS system is two-tiered with 10 adult receiving hospitals. Population: Consecutive adult patients ( \u202118 years old) with nontraumatic OHCA who had attempted resuscitation. The pre-intervention cohort included patients from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2004, whereas the postintervention cohort included patients from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. Structured chart abstraction was used to obtain demographics, arrest characteristics, survival, and neurological outcomes with good neurologic function defined as a Cerebral Performance Category Score of1.  Results: In 2003-2004 and in 2009-2010 there were 1,619 and 1,479 total OHCA events, of which 715 and 837 had attempted resuscitation, respectively. Shockable initial rhythm decreased significantly between the time periods (p < 0.001), while witnessed arrests (p = 0.01), and use of therapeutic hypothermia (p < 0.001) increased. Although overall survival decreased between the time periods (p < 0.001), survival with good neurological function increased (p < 0.001)(Table). Conclusion: System-wide introduction of three OHCA interventions appears to improve survival with good neurological function following OHCA. Further research is needed to examine why overall survival may have decreased during this same time period.Background: Every year international and global health fellowships multiply in both number and diversity. The first international emergency medicine fellowship program began in 1997; currently there are 34 fellowship programs spanning the fields of international emergency medicine (IEM) and global health (GH). To date, there is no accurate updated database to inform applicants of the process. There is no uniform application process or deadline for application. The application process can therefore be daunting and confusing. Applicants often do not fully understand the various options available to them and ultimately make unin-formed decisions. Fellowship programs are left unfilled in some years.",

Local training curricula are developing, but graduate medical education programs remain very limited in number. The public, governmental system in India provides graduate medical education in EM for nine residents each year. Private, for-profit hospitals have been an important provider of graduate medical education in EM through partnership with US universities adopting established curricula from mature EM systems. Objectives: To describe current private sector programs affiliated with US universities providing postgraduate EM training in India, and to evaluate the effect of these programs on recent graduates. Methods: Post graduate programs were established in private, for-profit hospitals in three cities in India in partnership with a US academic institution committed to EM development in India. Trainees were enrolled in a full-time education program, with combined educational methods including didactics, clinical rotations, research, and annual exams. Faculty members affiliated with the US institution visit monthly to provide onsite didactics, bedside teaching, and program support. Regular evaluations have been utilized to improve the programs and a faculty development program has been implemented for local faculty. A survey was conducted of graduates over the past 3 years to learn about their current employment, involvement in EM education, and the perceived program impact. Results: Currently, in partnership with five private hospitals in India, 76 trainees are enrolled in the EM post graduate education program. In addition, 55 physicians have graduated from the program to date. Of the 50% who responded to the survey, 93% are currently practicing EM, 82% of those in India. 71% of respondents are involved in teaching EM, 32% are involved in research. Most cite the program as very important or essential in their current career. Challenges cited include the lack of formal recognition of the program both in India and abroad. Conclusion: This unique partnership with private sector Indian hospitals is playing a major role in providing EM graduate medical education in India. Future goals include official recognition by the Medical Council of India, expanded numbers of training sites, and a gradual transition of training and education to local faculty. Health Care Access and Needs after a Disaster: Impact of the 2010 Pakistan Floods Thomas D. Kirsch 1 , Aqsa Durrani 2 , Lauren M. Sauer 1 , Christina L. Catlett 1 , Shannon Doocy 1 1 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; 2 University of Illinois, Chicago, IL Background: Over 1.6 million homes were damaged or destroyed and 2,946 direct injuries and 1,985 deaths were reported following the 2010 Pakistan floods. Infrastructure damage was widespread including critical disruptions to the power and transportation networks. Hundreds of thousands of people were reachable only by air, which complicated initial relief efforts. This will affect the population's ability to seek and access adequate health care for years to come. Objectives: To assess variables predicting access to health services among populations affected by the 2010 Pakistan floods. Methods: Population proportional, randomized cluster sampling of the 29 most-affected districts, with 80 clusters of 20 households (HH) in the general population were selected for the study. Heads of HH were interviewed approximately 6 months after onset. Results: Flood effects were widespread, with 95.1% reporting home damage and 95.4% reporting loss of income or livelihoods; direct injury and mortality were less common and both reported by 4.3% of HHs. Rural HHs were less likely to report injuries than urban (3.7% vs. 8.0%, p < 0.01). Overall, 39.8% of respondents reported worse access to health services after the floods, 46.1% reported no change in access, and 14.1% reported improved access. 79.1% needed health care within the first month after flooding began and HHs sought health care an average of 7.7 times in the 6 months period following the onset of floods. 27.1% were unable to obtain needed health services in the post-flood period. Reasons provided for not seeking care included the cost of services (61.5%), followed by the distance (31.0%), poor quality (16.7%), unavailability of medications (13.2%), hours of operation (10.0%), and other reasons (13.5%). Of all HHs, 39.7% (n = 631) were defined as having inadequate access to health care, reporting either that HH members needed but were not able to seek care (n = 448) or that travel time to a health provider was more than 60 minutes (n = 292). Conclusion: Adequate health care access after the 2010 Pakistani floods was associated with the number of times HHs relocated after the disaster, suggesting that locating health care providers in new locations may be difficult. Access to health services was also associated with post-flood income level, suggesting health resources are not readily available to HHs suffering great income losses. The Nepal Village Ultrasound Project (VUP): A Successful Education Program of Nurses in Bedside Trans-Abdominal Ultrasound in Pregnancy Davut J.

Wilson 1 , Mingmar Sherpa 4 , Mary Beth Johnson 1 1 UCSD, San Diego, CA; 2 Scripps Mercy Hospital, San Diego, CA; 3 Hands for Humanity, Inc., Denver, CO; 4 Nepal Ministry of Health, Kathmandu, Nepal Background: Nepal bears the worst maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in South Asia with 280 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies as of 2009. Every 2 hours, one woman dies from complications related to pregnancy and delivery as 40% of women do not receive prenatal care. Most birth at home while only 9% are delivered in health care facilities. Simple trans-abdominal diagnostic ultrasound exams can provide vital information of high-risk pregnancies including placenta previa, twin gestation, and breech presentation. Prior rural ultrasound teaching programs have been shown to improve ultrasound knowledge and skills over a 6-month period but not over a shorter time frame.Objectives: Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of VUP, a focused 3-week ultrasound educational program, in providing knowledge to nurses in rural Nepal for diagnosis of high-risk pregnancies. Secondary objective is to assess number of high-risk pregnancies as referred from VUP to health care facilities.Methods: This was a prospective evaluation of an educational ultrasound skills course from March to April 2011. Twelve nurses were recruited from rural districts throughout Nepal and convened for an intensive educational program in Phaplu, Nepal. Nurses undertook a 3week intense course of didactics and hands-on ultrasonography of pregnant females under the supervision of six physicians and an RDMS-certified sonographer. Skills and knowledge were tested using a pre-and post-test performance metric. High-risk pregnancies diagnosed and referred to higher level of care during this intervention were also recorded. Results: Our ultrasound course revealed a 42% overall increase in nurse ultrasound knowledge as well as a 386% improvement in post-test scores as compared to pre-test scores. Post-test results revealed a mean improvement of 10.5 questions answered correctly out of 18 (t(11) = 15.7, p < 0.001) after the ultrasound course. Six breech presentation third trimester pregnancies (4.7%), no twin pregnancies, and five placentae previa (3.9%) were identified out of 128 patients total and referred to health care facilities for delivery. Conclusion: The Village Ultrasound Project (VUP) improved local nurses' knowledge of trans-abdominal ultrasound over a 3-week time period and assisted in the identification of high-risk pregnancies in the rural village of Phaplu, Nepal.Improving CPR Quality in Novice and Experienced Providers through Training with an Internal Chest Compression Monitoring Device Joshua Glick, Evan Leibner, Thomas Terndrup Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA Background: Despite the importance of high-quality chest compressions during cardiac arrest, in-hospital providers often fail to provide compressions that adhere to AHA guidelines. The use of audiovisual feedback provided by an internal monitor may improve adherence to established recommendations. Objectives: To determine whether the use of an internal, computer-based training device would lead to improvements in relevant aspects of chest compression performance (rate, depth, hand placement, and recoil). Methods: This was a randomized, controlled study measuring the effect of simulation-based training on the performance of chest compressions. Medical students and ED personnel with current CPR certification were enrolled between July 2011 and October 2011. All participants completed three 1-minute sets of chest compressions on a mannequin. Variable group participants received audiovisual training throughout the second set of chest compressions, while control group participants did not receive any feedback until the end of study participation. Data regarding compression depth, recoil, hand placement, and rate were analyzed. Results: Out of 200 enrollments, data from 197 participants were analyzed. Subjects receiving audiovisual training demonstrated significantly improved depth compliance (39% to 81%, p < 0.001), recoil compliance (83% to 90%, p < 0.001), and accuracy of hand placement (77% to 92%, p < 0.001) from baseline to evaluation, as compared to control subjects. Chest compression rate did not significantly improve in either group, as the majority of participants in both groups consistently demonstrated rates of 100 or greater. Significant improvements in depth were also demonstrated by both novice (37% to 80%, p < 0.001) and experienced (42% to 82%, p < 0.001) providers. Novice providers also demonstrated improved recoil compliance (85% to 94%, p < 0.001) and accuracy of hand placement (74% to 97%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: The use of an internal, computer-based simulation device leads to improved chest compression performance through increased depth compliance, recoil compliance, and accuracy of hand placement. The implementation of such devices in the training of both novice and experienced providers may lead to sustained improvements in chest compression performance during in-hospital cardiac arrests.

Scott Forsythe 2 1 Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; 2 University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC Background: Simulation has become standard practice for teaching pediatric resuscitation concepts to multiple levels of medical providers. Standardized checklists are a key part of assessing providers' skills; however, validated, comprehensive, pediatric-focused checklists are lacking. Objectives: As part of a project to create a sustainable education program to improve pediatric resuscitation skills at Critical Access Hospitals (CAH), we sought to validate a checklist that could be used to assess pro-vider performance in simulated pediatric resuscitation scenarios. Methods: After a review of the simulation literature, PALS, and ATLS guidelines, a 35-question pediatric simulation checklist was created by the primary author and reviewed by attending physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) and Pediatric Critical Care (PCC) Divisions at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Consensus was reached on a final version. Each question is answered ''yes'', ''no'' or ''not applicable'' and, where appropriate, the timing of the event from initiation of the scenario is recorded. As part of a day long series of simulation exercises, a group of five providers (a mix of physicians, nurses, and a respiratory therapist) drawn from multiple CAH emergency departments was observed as they participated in three standardized pediatric resuscitation scenarios using high-fidelity infant and child sized mannequins. Two PEM physicians simultaneously completed blinded checklists for each scenario. A kappa statistic was calculated for each scenario. A time comparison between the two observers was calculated using a paired t-test and the degree to which the observer's times correlated was calculated using a pair-wise Pearson's correlation. Results: Kappas ranged from 0.61-0.65 with an overall kappa of 0.65 (p < 0.001). Time comparisons revealed an overall mean difference of 11.68 seconds across the three scenarios (range 0.87-21.21, p = 0.14). The time correlations ranged from 0.91-0.99 with an overall correlation of 0.97 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This 35-question pediatric resuscitation checklist shows good inter-rater reliability, both in terms of yes-no questions and timing of events. It could be useful as an assessment tool to evaluate performance during pediatric simulation exercises. It remains to be seen if it can be used effectively to assess longitudinal performance improvement. Percutaneous Transtracheal Ventilation: Benefits of Simulation Training in the Difficult Pediatric Airway Elizabeth M. Whitman, Kevin Reed, Sangeeta Wood, David Milzman, Jesse Jamieson Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC Background: According to the American College of Emergency Physicians, emergency physicians (EPs) receive more training in pediatric emergencies than other physicians, including pediatricians. Their responsibilities include managing situations in which standard methods of airway intervention unexpectedly fail. Percutaneous transtracheal ventilation (PTV) is an alternative technique for emergent respiratory support that is seldom used and infrequently practiced. Objectives: To assess EM residents' existing knowledge and ability to learn and retain knowledge and skills in performing PTV. Methods: EM residents (PGY 1,2,3) received didactic and simulation training in PTV. A pre-training survey rating knowledge, skills, and confidence level was performed followed by didactic and simulation trainingwith a pig trachea model. A post-training survey was completed after the session and was repeated 2 months later to assess retention and the benefits of the simulation session.Results: Fifteen residents completed the training and assessment. Mean pre-test scores were 52.27 (SD 11.53, 95% CI 5.83). Post-test scores significantly increased to 71.36 (SD 12.61, 95% CI 7.45, p < 0.05) on same-day testing and held at 66 (SD 12.13, 95% CI 6.14, p < 0.05) on 2-month post-test survey. Using a five-point Likert scale, resident mean scores for confidence in set-up and performance of PTV on pre-training were 1.The use of PTV in the management of the difficult pediatric airway is a crucial skill for EPs but not one commonly encountered in clinical practice.",

Objectives: To compare median length of stay (LOS), mean percentage of patients who leave before treatment is complete (LBTC), median door to bed time (DTB), and median door to doctor time (DTD) among EDs with varying visits per square foot and visits per treatment space, using data from the Emergency Department Benchmarking Alliance (EDBA) database. We hypothesized that EDs with a higher number of visits per square foot and per treatment space would experience greater LOS, % LBTC, DTB, and DTD times. Methods: A retrospective analytic cohort study examining selected data points from the EDBA database was conducted. The EDBA consists of nearly 500 EDs ranging in census from under 25,000 to over 100,000 visits per year. The EDBA database contains operational data submitted by member hospitals on a yearly basis. Data from 2004-2010 were included in this study. EDs were grouped into quartiles based on patient visits per square foot and patient visits per treatment space. ED LOS, % LBTC, DTB time and DTD time were compared among the quartiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls. Results: As displayed in the tables, there were no differences observed amongst quartiles for median LOS, mean % LBTC, median DTB time, or median DTD time when EDs were stratified by either visits per square foot or visits per treatment space.Conclusion: While significant differences in operational metrics have been reported previously when EDs were compared by census size, no differences in ED LOS, %LBTC, DTB, or DTD times were observed in this study when EDs were stratified by visits per square foot and visits per treatment space. These results suggest that the ''density'' of patient visits does not significantly affect traditional measures of operational efficiency. As ED volumes continue to increase, it will be important to understand how EDs with greater visits per square foot and visits per treatment space are able to compensate in order to maintain comparable operational metrics.Predictors Of Failure Of Empiric Outpatient Antibiotic Therapy In Emergency Department Patients With Uncomplicated Cellulitis Danny Peterson 1 , Shelley McLeod 1 , Andrew McRae 2 , Karen Woolfrey 1 1 The University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada; 2 University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, CanadaBackground: Despite several expert panel recommendations and cellulitis treatment guidelines, there are currently no clinical decision rules to assist clinicians in deciding which emergency department (ED) patients should be treated with oral antibiotics and which patients require intravenous therapy at first presentation of uncomplicated cellulitis.",

However, on the propensity-adjusted analysis, no difference in mortality was observed (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.14-1.73). A similar finding was observed when restricted to head injured patients only (0.43, 95% CI 0.09-2.08). Conclusion: Patients who have ETI by air medical providers are more severely injured with worse prognostic indicators of survival than those who do not have ETI. However, the use of ETI in such patients is not associated with increased mortality634 Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing 2 mg IV Hydromorphone to Usual Care Andrew K. Chang, Jason B. Lupow, Polly E. Bijur, E. John Gallagher Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY Background: The underdosing of pain medication persists in the ED. Hydromorphone is an underused and potent opioid which has the potential to improve pain treatment in the ED. Objectives: To compare 2 mg IV hydromorphone (2H) against usual care (UC). Methods: Prospective randomized clinical trial of adults 21 to 64 years old presenting to an urban academic ED with an annual census of 100,000 adults. Consecutive patients with acute severe pain judged by the attending physician to warrant an IV opioid were enrolled from March 2010 to November 2010. Patients randomized to the 2H arm received 2 mg IV hydromorphone. Patients randomized to the UC arm received any IV opioid (including hydromorphone) in a dose chosen by the ED attending physician. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients in each arm who achieved sufficient pain relief by 30 minutes, defined as indicating they did not need additional pain medication when asked. A 10% difference in rate of successful treatment was chosen as a clinically meaningful difference based on prior work. Continuous and dichotomous variables were calculated as means and proportions, respectively, with 95% CIs, using the exact method. Results: 175 subjects were randomized to the 2H arm and 175 subjects were randomized to the UC arm. 169 patients in the 2H arm and 165 patients in the UC arm had sufficient data for analysis. The sample was predominantly female and Hispanic. More than half reported their initial pain severity as 10. 76.3% of patients in the 2H group declined additional pain medication at 30 minutes compared to 66.1% in the UC group. This difference of 10.2% was both statistically (95% CI 0.6% to 19.8%) and clinically significant, according to a priori criteria. 32.7% of the UC arm subjects received IV hydromorphone as their opioid. Of the UC subjects who received IV morphine, the mean dose was 5.3 mg (median 6.0 mg). Safety profiles and adverse effects were similar in both groups. No patient required naloxone. Conclusion: 2mg IV hydromorphone provided statistically and clinically better pain relief than usual care. There was no significant difference in safety profiles or adverse effects.

A Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the patients treated with AP or SM. Inter-rater agreement was measured in 10% of the eligible charts by intra-class correlation (ICC). Evaluation of 20% of all ED visits was estimated necessary to yield at least 200 patients eligible for the AP. Results: Among the 2952 visits, 591 were randomly selected. From these, 216 visits were eligible: 41 (19%) treated with the AP and 175 (81%) with SM. Median time between arrival and corticosteroid administration in AP was 66 (IQR 47, 97) min compared to 90 (IQR 58, 123) min for SM (p = 0.02). Median LOS for patients in AP was 263 (IQR 219, 420) min compared to 283 (IQR 206, 384) min for SM (p = 0.99). The patients of the AP were older, were more often seen by a medical student or resident first, had a lower saturation at triage, were more often treated with ipratropium in the ED, and were discharged more often with antibiotics. ICC for the primary outcome was 0.99. Conclusion: Corticosteroids were administered more rapidly if the AP was used, but this had no effect on LOS. Biases inherent to the uncontrolled study design may have limited the effect of the AP, probably because patients were sicker in that group.Reasons for Unscheduled Return Visits to a Pediatric Emergency Department: A Parental Perspective Charles Eldridge 1 , Karen Collins 2 , Donna Jeffe 2 , David Jaffe 2 1 St. Louis Children's Hospital, St. Louis, MO; 2 Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO",

The pediatric volume at these hospitals is low, and it is unclear if the emergency department (ED) staff has the experience needed to provide excellent care to critically ill or injured children. Objectives: To ascertain CAH ED staff perspectives concerning their current level of pediatric training and expertise, and to determine the value placed on pediatric education. Methods: Five CAH volunteered to participate in a pilot pediatric resuscitation educational program. Prior to initiation of the program, all ED staff (RN, MD, NP, and PA) were surveyed to establish pediatric experience and comfort level, access to ongoing pediatric training, and beliefs regarding the value of pediatric continuing education and mock codes. Questions were generated by consensus among board certified pediatric ED faculty, with input from an expert in survey research design. Surveys were administered online using Qualtrics software. Responses were tracked at the hospital level with individual respondents remaining anonymous. Results: 106/150 staff completed the survey, a 71% response rate. The majority of providers reported performing common pediatric procedures fewer than five times in the past year. 79% of providers started fewer than five infant intravenous lines, and over 90% of physicians reported fewer than five pediatric bag mask ventilations or intubations. No provider reported placing an intraosseous line. On a 0-100 point scale, staff reported an increased comfort level taking care of older children compared to infants (67 v 59, p < 0.001). Only 72% of ED staff reported completing PALS in the past 2 years (87% of RNs, 47% of MDs). 97% reported finding mock codes somewhat to very useful, and >90% felt mock codes would improve their pediatric skills and comfort level. However, only 19% reported that their institution had regularly scheduled mock codes, and 71% felt there was inadequate focus on pediatrics in their hospitals' continuing education programs. Conclusion: CAH providers have limited opportunity to utilize and refresh pediatric skills. ED staff feel they would benefit from additional pediatric training. A pediatric educational program, utilizing mock resuscitation scenarios, could increase ED provider facility and comfort with key skills and improve the level of care provided to children at CAH.

            "text": "Background: As abdominal and genitourinary (GU) complaints are the most common reasons for adolescent females to present to emergency departments (EDs), consideration of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as a diagnosis is critical given its associated morbidity. Therefore, in 2002 the CDC broadened the criteria for PID diagnosis to miss fewer patients. However, since implementation of this new definition, trends in adolescent PID diagnoses have not been evaluated. Objectives: To estimate trends in PID diagnosis among adolescent ED patients before and after the revised CDC definition. Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2000-2009 of female patients between ages 14 to 21 evaluated in the ED. PID cases were identified by ICD-9 codes of 614.9. PID rates were calculated and national estimates were obtained using validated patient visit weights. Multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with PID diagnosis and tests of trend were performed.Results: During 2000-2009,878 records were identified representing 77 million female adolescent ED visits. Of these, there were an estimated 1.8 million diagnosed cases of PID (2.3% of all female adolescent ED diagnoses; 8% of diagnoses among those presenting with lower abdominal pain or genitourinary complaints). The overall rate of ED visits for PID did not change, ranging from 134 to 256/10,000 adolescent female ED visits annually (Figure, p for trend = 0.3). In a multivariable model, older age (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08, 1.17), black race (OR 2.50, 95% CI 2.01, 3.10), and nonprivate insurance (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.24, 1.89) were significantly associated with PID diagnosis. Conclusion: Surprisingly, despite the broadened CDC diagnostic criteria and increasing rates of sexually transmitted infections among adolescents, PID diagnoses did not increase over time. This raises concern about awareness and incorporation of new definition into clinical practice and possible under-detection of PID.Ultrasound Findings of the Elbow Posterior Fat Pad in Children with Radial Head Subluxation Joni E. Rabiner 1 , Hnin Khine 1 , Jeffrey R. Avner 1 , James W. Tsung 2 1 Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Bronx, NY; 2 Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NYBackground: In young children with a non-mobile elbow, it can be difficult to differentiate radial head subluxation (RHS) from elbow fracture by clinical exam alone. Preliminary data demonstrate that the presence of an elevated posterior fat pad (PFP) or lipohemarthrosis (LH) of the PFP on ultrasound (US) is highly sensitive for fracture at the elbow, but it is not known whether these findings are present in children with RHS. Objectives: To determine if there are US findings of the elbow PFP in patients with the clinical diagnosis of RHS.Methods: This was a prospective study of children presenting to an urban emergency department with suspected RHS. Pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) physicians had been given a one-hour didactic and hands-on training session on musculoskeletal US including the elbow. Prior to performing reduction for RHS, PEM physicians performed a brief, point-of-care (POC) elbow US using a high-frequency transducer probe in both longitudinal and transverse views to evaluate for an elevated PFP and LH. Successful clinical reduction with spontaneous movement of the injured extremity served as the gold standard for RHS. Clinical telephone follow up was performed to ascertain outcomes. Recorded images and clips were reviewed by an experienced PEM sonologist. Results: 34 patients were enrolled with a mean age of 22.8 (\u00b111.6) months. The mean time to presentation was 5.4 (\u00b15.9) hours, and 8/34 (24%) children had a prior history of RHS. The majority of patients (29/34, 85%) had a normal POC elbow US. 4/34 (12%) patients had an elevated PFP and 1/34 (3%) had LH. There was no correlation between duration of symptoms or number of reduction attempts and positive findings on US. Clinical reduction was successful in 100% of patients, and there were no complications reported on follow up. The kappa for inter-observer agreement was 0.58 overall. Conclusion: The majority of children with RHS have a normal PFP on elbow ultrasound, but elevated PFP and LH are possible findings.The Effect of Opening a Dedicated Pediatric ED on Patient Satisfaction Adam J. Singer, Henry C. Thode Jr, Eric Niegelberg, Allison Rowe, Sergey Kunkov Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY Background: In 11/2009 a new pediatric ED (PED-ED) was opened. Objectives: We hypothesized that patient satisfaction would increase for pediatric patients due to the dedicated facility. Methods: Monthly mean patient Press Ganey satisfaction scores were obtained for pediatric (age < 19) and adult patients from 2/2008-10/ 2011.Stepwise linear regression was used to identify patient satisfaction patterns in each of the two populations, allowing for linear trends, two-slope trends, and interrupted twoslope trends where the change in trend or interruption would occur after November 2009. Comparisons of mean satisfaction scores were performed using paired t-tests. All analyses were performed using unweighted means.",

For LEP caretakers of children with asthma, communication barriers contribute to disparate asthma care. Asthma action plans can improve clinical outcomes for children with asthma. A paucity of research focuses on how language proficiency affects asthma action plan use by LEP caretakers. Objectives: The goal of this study is to identify the rate of asthma action plan use by Spanish-speaking LEP caretakers and compare it to the rate of use by English proficient (EP) caretakers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey study with prospective enrollment was carried out in an urban, pediatric emergency department (PED) at an academic children's hospital. The annual census for PED visits is 35,000. A convenience sample of caretakers presenting to the PED with a child 1-17 years old having an asthmarelated complaint were approached for participation. Participants completed an anonymous, self-administered survey. Using standard survey methods employed by the U.S. Census Bureau, LEP was defined as the ability to speak English less than ''very well''. Additional demographic data were obtained including relationship to child, race and ethnicity, health insurance type, level of education, and location of primary care provider. A sample asthma action plan was attached to the survey for review. Surveys were available in English and Spanish. Categorical data were analyzed with a 2x2 contingency table using a Fisher's exact test. Results: To date, 91 subjects have been approached and enrolled, and 91 surveys completed and analyzed. Surveys were completed by mothers in 88% of cases, fathers in 9% of cases, and other caretakers in the remaining 3%. The median age of the caretaker's children was 4 years. A local primary care center was identified 96% of the time. 36/91 of the respondents (40%) had some degree of LEP. Survey responses showed that 36/55 EP caretakers (65%) and 14/36 LEP caretakers (39%) utilize an asthma action plan for their child (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that disparate rates of asthma action plan use exist for caretakers with LEP. We feel that qualitative research methods would help yield important insights at the caretaker and provider levels and provide a deeper understanding of the facili-tators and barriers to effective asthma action plan use by this vulnerable population.",

Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant hospitalization, but little is known about families' perceptions of clinical improvement in bronchiolitis. Objectives: To examine differences in physician and caretaker judgment of clinical improvement for children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. Methods: We performed a 16-center, prospective cohort study of hospitalized children <2 years with a physician diagnosis of bronchiolitis. For three consecutive years starting in 2007, from November 1 -March 31, researchers collected data on caretakers' and physicians' independent observations of the date when the child was first observed to have improved clinically. Intensive care unit (ICU) status was defined as receipt of care in the ICU at any point during the hospitalization. Analysis used chi-square and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: Of 2,207 enrolled children, 1,773 (80%) had the date of both physician and caretaker first noting clinical improvement.

Conclusion: The high correlation between physician and caretaker reported dates of clinical improvement indicates the potential value of caretaker perceptions in judging clinical resolution, particularly among children not admitted to the ICU. This finding has implications for the development of safe discharge guidelines and the use of family-centered rounds in care of severe bronchiolitis.for observation. Further research is being conducted to compare demographics and cost of care differences between the cohorts and to determine if any complications resulted from this practice.Background: Patients with abdominal pain presenting to the ED commonly require CT imaging as part of their diagnostic work-up. However, given the increased risk of ionizing radiation in children, if the concern for appendicitis exists, practitioners may decide to forgo imaging and admit for observation. Little is known regarding the effect of different ED practice models on CT utilization. Objectives: Examine rates of CT utilization for suspected appendicitis at two different pediatric emergency departments (PEDs), one academic-affiliated tertiary PED with 24 hr in-house resident coverage for consultation, compared to a private-practice tertiary PED without residents for consultation. Methods: All visits with the ICD9 chief complaint of abdominal pain at two free standing PEDs in a large metropolitan area were retrospectively examined from 5/1/09-12/31/10. Suspected appendicitis visits were defined as any visit with the chief complaint of abdominal pain where a CBC was obtained. Patients who were transferred into the PED were excluded. A logistic regression model was developed to determine the adjusted odds ratio of obtaining an abdominal CT at each of the two sites. Results: There were 234,199 total combined patient visits; 89,776 at the academic PED, site A, and 144,423 at the private practice PED, site B. At site A, 1,039 (1.2%) of patients presenting to the PED had a chief complaint of abdominal pain and a CBC obtained, compared to 2,753 (1.9%) at site B. At site A, 6% of these patients had an abdominal CT compared to 29.5% at site B. Admission rates were significantly higher at site A compared to the site B (11.5% vs 3.5%). Mean age and ESI acuity were similar between the two sites. After controlling for differences in ESI acuity, age, sex, ethnicity, and payor status, the odds of having a CT scan performed were significantly higher at site B compared to site A (OR 6.1; 95% CI 4.6-8.0). Conclusion: At these two free-standing PEDs, CT utilization for appendicitis was significantly higher at the private practice site. The availability of 24 hr in-hospital resident consult and higher rates of admission for observation at the academic PED may be significant factors in CT utilization. Since most children nationwide present to non-academic EDs for care, reducing CT utilization in children with suspected appendicitis will require significant changes in clinical decision-making on a broad scale.Variations in Transfer Patterns in Northern California Pediatric Trauma Centers Jessica E. Pierog 1 , Elizabeth Pirrotta 1 , James F. Holmes 2 , John P. Sherck 3 , James M. Betts 4 , N. Background: A significant proportion of children with trauma are initially cared for in non trauma centers (TC). Patients initially brought to nonTCs may require interfacility transfer. California does not have a statewide trauma system; local emergency medical services (EMS) agencies establish geographically based trauma transport protocols. Catchment areas usually include the TC's county and adjacent counties. Lack of consistent guidelines for transfer of patients may delay specialty care for injured children. Objectives: To understand patterns of interfacility pediatric trauma transfers to all pediatric TCs within one geographic region. Our hypothesis was that few transfers would be from a county with a pediatric TC, and that the majority of transfers would be from surrounding counties within the pediatric TC catchment. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of trauma registry data for children \u00a318 years in all pediatric TCs in Northern California (2000-2009). Variables measured include: clinical and demographic characteristics, injury severity score (ISS), and source of transfer (within county, catchment, and other counties). The four pediatric TCs are unevenly distributed and serve different populations: a university hospital serving a widespread area (A), a freestanding urban children's hospital (B), a university hospital (C), and a county hospital in the same county as C (D). Results: A total of 16,973 pediatric trauma patients were cared for in the four regional pediatric TCs. 628 (12%), 1012 (19%), 684 (19%), and 207 (11%) of patients were transferred from outside hospitals to A, B, C, D pediatric TCs, respectively. Within-county transfers from A, B, C, and D were 22, 18, 22, and 77% respectively. Median ISS of in-county transfers was 9 for all pediatric TCs; median ages were 9, 5, 7, and 6 years for A, B, C, and D respectively. Out of catchment transfers were minimal for hospitals A and D; 49 and 26% of transfers were from out of catchment hospitals for B and C, respectively. For out of catchment transfers, median ISS was 9 and age was 5.4 and 13.5 years for B and C respectively. Conclusion: Pediatric trauma transfers comprise a minority of trauma patients cared for in Northern California pediatric TCs. Transfers from within a TC's county indicate potential to improve protocols for initial transport of pediatric trauma patients. Transfer patterns from non-catchment areas vary, indicating lack of a unifying EMS transfer protocol. (Originally submitted as a ''late-breaker.'') Impact on Triage-Based Guideline with Intranasal Analgesia in a Pediatric Emergency Department Kristin Anderson 1 , Roni Lane 1 , Kathleen Adelgais 2 , Jeffrey Schunck 1 1 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 2 University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO Background: Investigations have noted that pediatric pain remains undertreated and analgesic administration is delayed. Intranasal fentanyl (INF) is a safe and effective alternative to intravenous narcotics. Adult literature suggests that instituting a pain treatment protocol will decrease time to analgesia and increase the proportion of patients receiving an analgesic. Objectives: To determine the effect of a pediatric ED triage-based pain protocol using INF on time-to-analgesia, and parent and patient satisfaction. Methods: Patients with an isolated orthopedic injury and moderate-to-severe pain (pain score greater than or equal to 4) presenting to a tertiary children's hospital emergency department (ED) were eligible for enrollment. Convenience samples were enrolled before (cohort A) and after (cohort B) institution of a triage-based pain protocol in which patients could receive INF after assessment by nursing staff. Our primary outcome was time to analgesia. Other outcomes included proportion of patients who received IV placement, INF for pain, and parent and patient satisfaction with pain management. Results: During the study period, we enrolled 128 patients; 72 patients in Cohort A and 56 patients in Cohort B. The cohorts were similar with regard to percent of forearm fractures (50%), age (9 years), and percent male (65%). Time to analgesia was 43.3 minutes for cohort A and 41.2 minutes for Cohort B. Percent of patients who received INF for pain increased from 35% in cohort A to 57% in cohort B (p = 0.01). Rate of IV placement decreased from 35% in cohort A to 17.5% in cohort B (p = 0.03). When comparing parent and patient preference for route of medication administration, there was increased preference for IN route compared to IV route in the Cohort B. When assessing parent and patient satisfaction with rapidity of analgesic administration, it was similar between groups. Conclusion: Institution of a triage-based pain protocol utilizing INF was not associated with a reduction in time to analgesia, but was associated with an increase in INF use and a decrease in IV placement, and was preferred by patients and families to IV medication. INF is a viable alternative to IV narcotics while waiting to determine the extent of extremity injuries. Barriers to reducing time to analgesia administration require further investigation. Pulmonary Embolism in the Pediatric Emergency Department Beesan Shalabi Agha, Jesse J. Sturm, Harold K. Simon, Daniel A. Hirsh Emory University, Atlanta, GA Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) in children is rare but is under-recognized. Despite known predispo-sing risk factors, signs, and symptoms there is delay in time to accurate diagnosis of PE in the pediatric population. Objectives: To describe patients who present to the pediatric emergency department (PED) and are subsequently diagnosed with PE. Methods: The electronic medical record (EMR) from 2003 to 2011 of a tertiary care pediatric health care system was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients <21 years who had a final ICD9 diagnosis of PE. Patients were excluded if PE was diagnosed at an outside facility, were directly admitted, or had a known history of PE. Visits in which the initial diagnosis of PE was made or those that resulted in an admission that led to a diagnosis of PE were reviewed. Patient demographics, initial PED visit characteristics, time from ED encounter to diagnosis, hospital course, and subsequent ED utilization following PE diagnosis were recorded. Results: During the study period there were 1,185,794 ED visits, and 171 patients had an ultimate diagnosis of PE. 25 met study criteria, 52% were females, the median age was 15, and all patients were admitted. Only 40% of these patients had the PE diagnosed in the PED with the mean time to diagnose of 2 days. Of those diagnosed in the ED, 60% (6/10) had two or more risk factors compared with 40% (6/15) of those who were diagnosed after admission (p = 0.428). Of the patients who were admitted without an initial PE diagnosis, the top three PED diagnoses were DVT, respiratory distress, and pneumonia. Of all patients with PE, 80% had one risk factor and 48% had two or more risk factors with the most common risk factors being BMI >25 (50%, 10/20), OCP use (38% 5/13 females), and history of previous thrombus without PE (24%, 6/25). Triage vital signs showed tachypnea in (71%, 17/24) of patients, tachycardia in (67%, 16/24), and hypoxia in (17%, 4/23). Chest pain was reported in 52% (13/25) of patients and shortness of breath in 44% (11/25). Conclusion: PE is a rare event, but still occurs in children. Despite known risk factors and symptoms of PE, it remains a challenge for clinicians to diagnose during the initial ED presentation. All clinicians, including those who do not regularly care for children, should maintain a high index of suspicion for PE. This study emphasizes risk factors that should raise the suspicion of PE, even among children. 654 A Controlled Trial Evaluating the Outcomes Associated with a Discharge Action Plan Employing Single Dose Home Use Of Ondansetron In Patients With Acute Gastroenteritis Elizabeth J.

Gurr, Mary Frances Ward, Andrew Sama North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Manhasset, NYBackground: Dehydration is a common condition encountered in pediatric EDs (PED) and accounts for approximately 9% of PED visits in the U.S. each year. A ratio of IVC to aorta diameter measured by ultrasound has been used successfully to assess dehydration in children. Respiratory variation in IVC diameter has been used to guide fluid therapy in critically ill adults and may be applicable to dehydrated children. Objectives: To investigate the use of respiratory variation in IVC diameter during fluid rehydration in dehydrated children. Methods: A prospective, observational study was conducted using a convenience sample of pediatric patients (<18 years) who presented to the PED between April 2009 and October 2011. Clinical criteria categorized subjects as ''hydrated,'' ''mildly,'' ''moderately,'' or ''severely'' dehydrated. Two physicians trained in ultrasound obtained longitudinal anteroposterior diameter measurements of the IVC minimal (min) and maximal (max), distal to the confluence with hepatic veins, and proximal transverse measurements of the aorta. The IVC min and max and aorta measurements were performed at baseline and after each 20 cc/kg fluid bolus. An index of IVC respiratory variation (D IVC ) was defined as ([IVCmax -IVCmin] / IVCavg). Paired Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney Tests were used to analyze the D IVC change within subjects after fluid therapy, and among clinical signs of dehydration at baseline and after fluid bolus, respectively. Results: Twenty-two subjects were enrolled in the study with an average age of 5.07(SD 4.17). At baseline, 21 subjects were not hydrated, and D IVC was not significant in distinguishing among mildly, moderately, or severely dehydrated subjects. After a fluid bolus, D IVC was significantly greater in hydrated subjects After rehydration therapy, the D IVC and IVC/aorta ratio was found to decrease and increase, respectively, with fluid hydration as seen in the adult critical care population and previous pediatric studies. A larger sample is required to further assess the utility of D IVC in distinguishing among dehydration severities.Pediatric Emergency Airway Management in Japanese Emergency Department: Multi-Center Prospective Observational Study in Japan Masashi Okubo 1 , Kohei Hasegawa 2 , Yusuke Hagiwara 3 1 Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Okinawa, Japan; 2 Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; 3 Kawaguchi Medical Center, Kawaguchi, Japan Background: The advent of pediatric emergency medicine as a specialty has led to advances in emergency airway management. However, there is a paucity of comprehensive data regarding current practices of pediatric intubation in ED. Objectives: To characterize current practice with respect to pediatric emergency airway management using a multicenter data set. Methods: Design and Setting: We conducted an observational study of the prospectively collected database of pediatric ED intubations using the Japanese Emergency Airway Network (JEAN), gathered in 11 participating EDs over an 18-month time period. Data fields include ED characteristics, patient and operator demographics, method of airway management, number of attempts, and adverse events. Participants: All pediatric patients (age \u00a3 18 years old) undergoing emergency intubation in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Data analysis: We present descriptive data as proportions with 95% CIs. Results: Of 2710 intubations (capture rate 98%), there were 92 documented pediatric intubations. The intubation was performed for medical emergencies in 56 encounters (61%) and for trauma in 36 (39%). Twentythree patients (25%) were in cardiac arrest. The initial intubation method was nasal intubation in 2 and oral in 90, including rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in 15 patients (16%), sedation only in 24 (26%), neuromuscu-lar blockade only in 3 (3%), and without medications in 48 (52%). The success rates on the first attempt of RSI, sedation only, neuromuscular blockade only, and with-In this prospective multicenter observational study of pediatric ED intubations in Japan, we observed a high intubation success rate ultimately. However, the vast majority of patients were intubated with non-RSI methods. This study hints at the need for further research and education in pediatric ED airway management.

Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) has been slower to adopt the use of EUS, and as of 2006, only 65% of PEM fellowship programs had some EUS training, with only half having a formal rotation in EUS. Objectives: We sought to evaluate EUS training in PEM fellowships in 2011, hypothesizing that training has become widespread and formalized, and that characteristics such as lack of radiology ultrasound availability, pediatric emergency department (ED) residing within a general ED setting, high patient volume, large PEM fellowship, and Level I trauma designation would be associated with the presence of structured EUS training for PEM fellows as defined by the presence of an EUS rotation. Methods: We piloted a 32-question web-based survey with Canadian PEM fellowship directors and U.S. emergency medicine ultrasound fellowship directors, and then distributed the survey to all 69 U.S. PEM fellowship directors or associate directors in the Spring of 2011.

From 1979 to 1998 SIDS death rates dropped from 2.4 to 1.0 deaths per 100,000 respectively, related to 1992 epidemiologic recommendations by American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) to keep infants sleeping supine. The prone position may engender a risk of suffocation and hypoxia from the infant's bedding. It is well-known that oxygenation varies inversely with altitude, and, if the mechanism for SIDS is related to hypoxia, then we would expect that high altitude regions would have a higher mortality rate from SIDS. Objectives: To determine the relationship between SIDS and altitude. Methods: The SIDS death rate (ICD-9 code 798.0) vs. all-cause infant mortality by state (deaths/100,000) were obtained retrospectively from the CDC Wonder MortalityData (1979Data ( -1998. Mean state elevation was from the US Geologic Survey. Median income by state was from 1990 census. Statistics: Pearson's correlation, set to p < 0.01 for two-sided significance. p < 0.003) for all-cause infant mortality vs. elevation. Conclusion: A strong positive correlation exists in the US between the death rate from SIDS and mean state elevation. It is possible that a lowered partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude may further increase the effects of factors predisposing to infant hypoxia, such as lying prone. This study provides further rationale for the AAP recommendations. Prospective studies involving the relationship between children with SIDS or apparent life-threatening events and elevation on the county level may help clarify this novel ecologic relationship.Evaluation of the Bedside Pediatric Early Warning System Score for Pediatric Placement after Inter-facility Transports Jill Keyes 1 , Ken Yen 2 , Michael Meyer 1 , Marc Gorelick 1 1 Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI; 2 UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TXBackground: The Bedside Pediatric Early Warning System (BPEWS) score is a pediatric assessment tool that combines seven clinical measurements for the assessment of severity of illness. This tool has been shown to be effective in identifying sick children in the hospital setting. The effectiveness of this tool in identifying pediatric patients undergoing inter-facility transport that require critical care placement has not been evaluated.Objectives: We hypothesize that children with higher BPEWS scores are more likely to be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or emergency department (ED) than the general pediatric unit.Methods: A random sample of pediatric patients transported by the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW) Transport Team during a one-year period were assessed. All patient transports to the neonatal intensive care unit and all patients with tracheostomies who were admitted to the PICU according to placement protocols were excluded. Data were collected utilizing a retrospective chart review and included the components of the BPEWS score (heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, oxygen therapy, respiratory effort, and capillary refill time) at two different time points during the transport: when the transport team arrived at the outside facility, and again when the transport team arrived at CHW. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the BPEWS scores at each time point with patient placement to PICU, ED, or general inpatient unit. Results: Data have been collected for 144 patients. Overall, 36% were admitted to the PICU, 32% to the ED, and 32% to the floor. Forty percent are female. Significant differences were found in BPEWS scores based on site of admission. For the initial time point (team arrival at outside facility), scores for PICU, ED, and general inpatient The BPEWS score, measured at two time points in the transport process, is associated with site of admission. The highest scores are seen for patients admitted to the PICU and the lowest for those admitted to the ED. Logistic regression with ROC curves is planned to determine the optimal BPEWS score to discriminate placement in the PICU compared to the general inpatient unit. Trauma Center Designation and Emergency Physician Awareness of Local Child Passenger Safety Resources Michelle L. Macy, Gary L. Freed University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI Background: More than 140,000 children younger than 12 years old are treated in US EDs each year for motor vehicle collision (MVC) related injuries. Trauma centers (TC) provide expert treatment for injuries and deliver injury prevention programs. However, most injured children are treated and released from community EDs. Emergency physician awareness of availability and referrals to local child safety seat resources are unknown. Objectives: To compare emergency physician awareness of and referrals to local child passenger safety resources by TC designation (Level I or Level II Pediatric, Adult Only, or Not a TC). Methods: National mailed survey of 1,000 emergency physicians sampled from the AMA Masterfile who provide emergency care to children <15 years old with traumatic injuries. The survey examined physician report of TC designation, awareness of local child passenger safety resources, and referral to local resources in the clinical scenario of discharging a 2-year-old home following an MVC-related ED visit. Chi-square analysis was used to compare availability of and referrals to resources by TC designation. Results: Response rate was 64%. Overall 40% of respondents were female and 80% were parents. Most respondents practice in an ED with a Level I or II Pediatric TC designation (n = 334, 52%). One quarter (n = 160) do not practice in a TC and 144 practice in an Adult Only TC. Physicians practicing in a Pediatric TC were more likely to be female (51% vs. 26% in Adult Only vs. 31% Not a TC p < 0.001), have completed residency after 1998 (64% vs. 43% vs. 41%, p < 0.001), have completed pediatric emergency medicine fellowship (79% vs. 17% vs. 28%, p < 0.001), and more than half of their patients are children (80% vs. 30% vs. 31%, p < 0.001).

Patients from 74 counties with a median distance between presenting and the receiving site of 344 miles round trip/consult (range: 72-524). The majority (78%) of patients had Medicaid. Direct cost savings in gas and car expenses was a median of $178/consult (344miles x $0.55/mile). Based on travel speed of 55 miles/hr the median travel hrs saved/consult was 6.3 hrs (range 1.3-9.5). Given metro traffic, this underestimates actual travel time. In aggregate the 690 consults account for >$120,000 in direct cost savings and potentially could allow for up to 4,347 hrs of work (690x6.3) and 2,588 hrs of school (690 pts x6.3 hr/pt x86% school aged x 36/52 school wks/yr). Conclusion: TM represents significant direct cost savings in decreased travel expenses and time for patients and families. Indirect cost savings include travel time that can be reallocated to school, work, or other benefits. The high use by patients with Medicaid suggests that TM may improve access to care for this often underserved population. TM can further impact savings as Medicaid patients often use state-provided transport for care. TM can also be a resource for patients to better access pediatric subspecialty care following ED visits, especially from remote regions. Psych and Child Protection services, often difficult to access following an ED visit, were the most common utilized.University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; 2 University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; 3 Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; 4 Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD Background: As teenage pregnancy remains a significant public health issue, it is imperative that adolescent females routinely be evaluated for pregnancy when presenting for care. This is especially crucial in the emergency department (ED) setting, given that prior studies have found substantial unintended pregnancy risks among ED patients. Objectives: To estimate frequency of pregnancy testing among adolescent ED patients and determine factors associated with pregnancy testing. Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2000-2009 of female patients between ages 14 to 21 evaluated in the ED. Frequency of pregnancy testing was calculated and national estimates were obtained using validated patient visit weights. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate factors associated with pregnancy testing. Results: During 2000-2009, 22,878 records were identified representing 77 million female adolescent ED visits. Of these, only 13.9 million (18.1%) underwent pregnancy testing. Of patients presenting with lower abdominal pain, just 42.1% underwent pregnancy testing. In a multivariable model, older age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.07), black race (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09, 1.27), non-private insurance (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04, 1.21), and lower abdominal pain (OR 4.64, 95% CI 4.30, 5.01) remained significantly associated with pregnancy testing. Among patients presenting with lower abdominal pain, black patients were more likely to receive pregnancy testing (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05, 1.38) than nonblack patients. Conclusion: Surprisingly, a minority of adolescent females presenting to the ED underwent pregnancy testing, even when presenting with lower abdominal pain. Disparities in pregnancy testing were noted based on age, race, and insurance status. Future studies should focus on designing interventions to increase pregnancy testing in adolescent ED patients, especially among those presenting with lower abdominal pain.

ED charges were significantly higher for those with visitors ($1574 vs $1293, p = 0.012) but patient age, other ED and hospital outcome measures were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The majority of ED patients feel that visitors are important to their care. Patients with visitors have a higher hospital admission rate, but having a visitor does not affect most major ED and hospital outcome measures. The effect of visitors on patient satisfaction and safety merits future consideration.Change in Ethanol-Related Visits and Alcohol Withdrawal Visits to the Emergency Department Following a Law to Allow Expansion of Alcohol SalesBenjamin Hatten 1 , Michael Liao 2 , Emily Caruso 2 , Jason Haukoos 2 1 Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR; 2 Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO Background: On July 1 st , 2008, Colorado changed its alcohol laws to allow the sale of full-strength beer, wine, and liquor on Sundays.

Olives, Brian E. Driver, Stephen W. Smith Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN Background: The number of Somali-born immigrants to Minnesota has increased from 3 in 1990 to 13,390 in 2009. Language and cultural barriers are common in this population. Anecdotally, their symptoms and pain descriptions differ markedly from other ED patients. Although this may contribute to delayed recognition of pathology, literature is lacking to describe this phenomenon. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) benchmarks might be used to evaluate these differences. Objectives: To compare the chief complaints and time to ECG order of Somali and matched white ED patients diagnosed with AMI. Methods: Retrospective case-control study with identification in our electronic medical record of all Somalis presenting to the ED with an ultimate diagnosis of Type I AMI [ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-STEMI] between 1990 and 2010. White age-and sex-matched controls were identified consecutively in a similar fashion. AMI was defined by the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction proposed by Thygesen et al (2007). Patients who were already identified as critically ill, as defined by triage to the critical care area before any ECG order, were excluded. Chief complaints and time to ECG order were recorded. Statistics were completed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: Twenty-eight Somali patients with AMI were identified; 14 were triaged to the critical care area before ECG order. Fourteen Somali patients (11 males) remained and were matched to 14 white controls. Mean age was 63.7 years (Somali: 63.2 years, white: 64.1 years). Four (29%) Somali and zero white patients had a chief complaint other than chest pain, including abdominal pain, epigastric pain, diffuse pain, cough and fever, and vomiting. Median time to ECG order was 31.5 minutes for Somali patients (range 0-206 minutes, mean 54 minutes), and 8 minutes for white patients (range 2-29 minutes, mean 11.1 minutes). ANCOVA demonstrated that Somali race was significantly associated with a chief complaint other than chest pain (F = 5.20, p = 0.03) and time to ECG order (F = 6.06, p = 0.02). Conclusion: In this sample of urban ED patients, Somali patients with AMI presented with a chief complaint other than chest pain significantly more often than matched white controls. Time to ECG order was significantly longer for Somalis, with a wider range of time to ECG. Emergency physicians should be aware of these differences when evaluating Somali patients.

Without TBI, survival time remained longer with LR, 280 min (185, 360), but was not different than HBOC, 172 min (77, 267), or HBOC+NTG which increased to 179 min (84, 274). During initial hemorrhage, total catheter hemorrhage volume was less with TBI, 14.0 ml/kg (12.4, 15.6), vs. no-TBI, 21.0 ml/kg (19.5, 22.5), but mean lactate concen-tration at the end of the standard hemorrhage period was equivalent in both groups (TBI = 4.74 mmol/L vs. no-TBI = 4.72 mmol/L, p = 0.95) Conclusion: Survival was poor with HBOC-resuscitation in the setting of high pressure arterial bleeding regardless of TBI. Less hemorrhage was required in the presence of TBI, producing an equivalent degree of shock and conferring no survival benefit, likely due to impaired brain-specific compensatory responses. With internal UH, considering wound location and geometry is of paramount importance when choosing resuscitation strategy.Post-traumatic Intracranial Bleeding With Normal INR: Does A Safety Threshold Exist?

Such information is important for prevention, surveillance, and projecting climate change health effects. Objectives: To describe national ED epidemiology of HRI and identify demographic factors and comorbid conditions associated with severe disease, hospital admission (HA), and death. Methods: Summertime HRI cases were defined as ED patients seen in June-August 2006-2008 and given a primary or secondary diagnosis (PDX or SDX) of 992XX in the National ED Sample (NEDS). The NEDS is a nationally representative, stratified sample of ED visits gathered by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. SAS version 9.3 was used to perform descriptive and multivariate logistic regression using complex survey analysis methods. Differences between HRI as PDX and SDX were explored using descriptive statistics. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for demographics and chronic disease were calculated for the outcomes of heat stroke, ED disposition, and death in the ED. Results: There were 199,025 summertime ED visits for HRI from 2006-2008. 64.2% of cases had HRI as a PDX. 75.7% of cases had heat exhaustion, 5.4% heat stroke. HRI typically occurred in young men (80.6%), in the South (48.2%), and resulted in ED discharge (88.1%). Death in the ED was rare (n = 165; 0.08%). 88.2% of fatal cases had heat stroke, and heat stroke had a 1.28% (95% CI 1.08-1.51) ED case fatality rate. Patients with HRI as PDX had higher odds of heat exhaustion (OR 1.97; 1.94-2.01), being male (3.37; 3.31-3.42), and ED discharge (2.28; 2.24-2.33), and lower odds of HA (0.44, 0.43-0.46) and death in the ED (0.42, 0.31-0.57) but were otherwise similar to cases with HRI as SDX.",

It was reviewed for readability. Cognitive interviews were conducted at a single site using five clinical educators to clarify questions and responses. Descriptive statistics are provided. Results: We identified 108 eligible EM clerkship programs and directors. Overall, there were 62 respondents, yielding a response rate of 57.4%. EM rotations were noted to most commonly (95.2%) be 4 weeks long, and 27.4% were fourth year mandatory rotations while 65.0% were fourth year electives. While most (62.3%) programs reported providing direct observation, 72.6% had no requirement for each student to be observed, and 54.8% reported usually observing only a part of the studentpatient encounter. Of those that provide direct observation routinely, immediate feedback is reportedly provided by 72.6%, and of those, 93.4% do it verbally. The majority of programs (62.3%) do not use an instrument to document direct observation, while 27.9% use an instrument unique to their institution. Too little time on the part of attending physicians was reported as the most common difficulty for providing direct observation (91.2%). The lack of a validated measure for direct observation was also seen as a barrier by 31.9% of respondents. Conclusion: This study suggests that there is a significant gap between optimal educational practices, such as direct observation of student-patient encounters, in EM rotations and current practice. Barriers were most noted to include lack of time and lack of a validated assessment tool. The development of an easy to use tool may promote more direct observation of studentpatient encounters in EM rotations.

Results: Forty-two trainees participated in the study: 10 MS1, 12 MS3, 10 PGY1, and 10 PGY3/4 from June to November 2011. Inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.96 for CM and PI). Number of hours of prior simulation varied across years (MS1 = 0.13, MS3 = 0.79, PGY1 = 11.4, PGY3/4 = 41.9; p < 0.01 except MS1 vs MS3 p = 0.73). CM scores were higher with more training (MS1 = 4.6, MS3 = 5.2, PGY1 = 7.8, PGY3/4 = 9.5; p < 0.01). Trainees with significant prior simulation experience (PGY 3/4) demonstrated greater PI scores than those with minimal prior experience (MS1, MS3, PGY1) (p = 0.03).Conclusion: Clinical management skills were better with more training. PGY3/4 residents had better patient interaction skills compared to junior trainees. These results suggest that simulation experience with debriefing enhances patient interactions. Future studies are needed to determine if this effect transfers to interactions with actual patients.

            "text": "Background: HIV screening in EDs is advocated to achieve the goal of comprehensive population screening. Yet, HIV testing in the ED is sometimes thwarted by a patient's condition (e.g. intoxication) or environmental factors (e.g. other care activities). Whether it is possible to test these patients at a later time is unknown. Objectives: We aimed to determine if ED patients who were initially unable to receive an HIV testing offer might be tested in the ED at a later time. We hypothesized that factors preventing testing are transient and that there are subsequent opportunities to repeat testing offers. Methods: We reviewed medical records for patients presenting to an urban, academic ED who were approached consecutively to offer HIV testing during randomly selected periods from January 2008 to January 2009. Patients for whom the initial attempted offer could not be completed were reviewed in detail with standardized abstraction forms, duplicate abstraction, and third-party discrepancy adjudication. Primary outcomes included repeat HIV testing offers during that ED visit, and whether a testing offer might eventually have been possible either during the initial visit or at a later visit within 6 months. Outcomes are described as proportions with confidence intervals. Results: Of 824 patients approached, initial testing offers could not be completed for 120 (15%). These 120 were 62% male, 52% white, and had a median age of 41 (18-64). A repeat offer of testing during the initial visit would have been possible for 99/120 (83%), and 52/99 (53%) were actually offered testing on repeat approach. Of the 21 for whom a testing offer would not have been possible on the initial visit, 14 (67%) had at least one additional visit within 6 months, and 11/14 (79%) could have been offered testing on at least one visit. Overall, a repeat testing offer would have been possible for 110/120 (93%, 95% CI 85-96%). Conclusion: Factors preventing an initial offer of HIV testing in the ED are generally transient. Opportunities for repeat approach during initial or later ED encounters suggest that, given sufficient resources, the ED could succeed in comprehensively screening the population presenting for care. ED screening personnel who are initially unable to offer testing should repeat their attempt.",

Previous studies nationwide have shown acceptance rates for HIV screening of 20-90% in emergency departments. However, it is unknown how acceptance rates will vary in a culturally and ethnically diverse urban emergency department.Objectives: To determine the characteristics of patients who accept or refuse ''opt-out'' HIV screening in an urban emergency department.Methods: A self-administered, anonymous survey is administered to ED patients who are 18 to 64 years of age. The questionnaire is administered in English, Russian, Mandarin, and Spanish. Questions include demographic characteristics, HIV risk factors, perception of HIV risk, and acceptance of rapid HIV screening in the emergency department. Results: To date 145 patients responded to our survey. Of the 145, 102 (70.3%) did not accept an HIV test (group 1) in their current ED visit and 43 (29.7%) accepted an HIV test (group 2). The major two reasons given for opting out (i.e., group 1) was ''I do not feel that I am at risk'' (59.8%) and ''I have been tested for HIV before'' (25.5%). There was no difference between the groups in regards to sex (P = 0.737), age (P = 0.351), religious affiliation (P = 0.750), marital status (P = 0.331), language spoken at home (P = 0.211), and whether they had been HIV tested before (73.2% in group 1 and 59.4% in group 2; P = 0.123). However, there was a statistically significant difference with regards to educational level and income. More patients in group 1 (69.0%) and 46.1% in group 2 had less than a college level education (p < 0.05). Similarly, more patients in group 1 (58.3%) and only 34.8% in group 2 had an annual household income of \u00a3$25,000 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In a culturally and ethnically diverse urban emergency department, patients with a lower socioeconomic status and educational level tend to opt out of HIV screening test offered in the ED. No significant difference in acceptance of ED HIV testing was found to date based on primary language spoken at home or religious affiliation Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a problem that affects all emergency departments. Objectives: Our goal was to examine all urinary pathogens and their resistance patterns from urine cultures collected in the emergency department (ED).Methods: This study was performed at an urban/suburban community-teaching hospital with an annual volume of 40,000 visits. Using electronic records, all cases of urine cultures received in 2009 were reviewed for data including type of bacteria, antibiotic resistance, and health care exposure (HCX). HCX was defined as no prior hospitalization within the previous six months, hospitalization within the previous three months, hospitalization within the previous six months, nursing home resident (NH), and presence of an indwelling urinary catheter (UC). An investigator abstracted all data with a second re-abstracting a random 5% for kappa statistics between 0.697 and 1.00. Group Background: Approximately 12-20% of patients treated with epinephrine for anaphylaxis receive a second dose but the risk factors associated with repeat epinephrine use remain poorly defined. Objectives: To determine whether obesity is a risk factor for requiring 2 + epinephrine doses for patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with anaphylaxis due to food allergy or stinging insect hypersensitivity. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review at four tertiary care hospitals that care for adults and children in New England between the following time periods: Massachusetts General Hospital (1/1/01-12/31/ 06), Brigham and Women's Hospital (1/1/01-12/31/06), Children's Hospital Boston (1/1/01-12/31/06), Hasbro Children's Hospital (1/1/04-12/31/09). We reviewed the medical records of all patients presenting to the ED for food allergy or stinging insect hypersensitivity using ICD9CM codes. We focused on anthropomorphic data and number of epinephrine treatments given before and during the ED visit. Among children, calculated BMIs were classified according to CDC growth indicators as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese. All patients who presented on or after their 18th birthday were considered adults.Background: Transitions of care are ubiquitous in the emergency department (ED) and inevitably introduce the opportunity for errors. Despite recommendations in the literature, few emergency medicine (EM) residency programs provide formal training or standard process for patient hand-offs. Checklists have been shown to be effective quality improvement measures in inpatient settings and may be a feasible method to improve ED hand-offs. Objectives: To determine if the use of a sign-out checklist improves the accuracy and efficiency of resident sign-out in the ED as measured by reduced omission of key information, communication behaviors, and time to sign-out each patient. Methods: A prospective study of first-and second-year EM and non-EM residents rotating in the ED at an urban academic medical center with an annual ED volume of 55,000. Trained clinical research assistants observed resident sign-out during shift change over a two-week period and completed a 15-point binary observable behavior data collection tool to indicate whether or not key components of sign-out occurred. Time to sign out each patient was recorded. We then created and implemented a computerized sign-out checklist consisting of key elements that should be addressed during transitions of care, and instructed residents to use this during hand-offs. A two-week post-intervention observation phase was conducted using the same data collection tool. Proportions, means, and non-parametric comparison tests were calculated using Stata. Results: One hundred fifteen sign-outs were observed prior to checklist implementation and 72 after; one sign-out was excluded for incompleteness. Significant improvements were seen in four of the measured signout components: inclusion of history of present illness increased by 18% (p < 0.001), likely diagnosis increased by 17% (p = 0.015), disposition status increased by 18% (p < 0.01), and patient/care team awareness of plan increased by 19% (p < 0.01). (Figure 1 ) Time data for 108 sign-outs pre-implementation and 72 post-implementation were available. Seven sign-outs were excluded for incompleteness or spurious values. Mean length of sign out was 83s (95% CI 65 to 100) and 71.7s (95% CI 52 to 92) per patient. Conclusion: Implementation of a checklist improved the transfer of information but did not affect the overall length of time for the sign-out.",

Methods: This was a prospective cohort study of patients \u202118 years presenting with cellulitis to one of two tertiary care EDs (combined annual census 120,000). Patients were excluded if they had been treated with antibiotics for the cellulitis prior to presenting to the ED, if they were admitted to hospital, or had an abscess only. Trained research personnel administered a questionnaire at the initial ED visit with telephone follow-up 2 weeks later. Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using standard equations. Backwards stepwise multivariable logistic regression models determined predictor variables independently associated with treatment failure (failed initial antibiotic therapy and required a change of antibiotics or admission to hospital). Results: 598 patients were enrolled, 47 were excluded, and 53 were lost to follow-up. The mean (SD) age was 53.1 (18.4) and 56.4% were male. 497 (99.8%) patients were given antibiotics in the ED. 185 (37.2%) were given oral, 231 (46.5%) were given IV, and 81 (16.3%) patients were given both oral and IV antibiotics. 102 (20.5%) patients had a treatment failure.

Prior studies report that the average number of sticks to successfully place an IV in children is 2.4. Successfully placing an IV requires identification of appropriate venous access targets. The VeinViewer Vision\u00d2 (VVV) assists with IV placement by projecting a map of subcutaneous veins on the surface of the skin using near infrared light. Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of the VVV versus standard approaches: sight (S) and sight plus palpation (S+P) for identifying peripheral veins for intravenous catheter placement in children treated in a PED. Methods: Experienced pediatric emergency nurses and physicians identified peripheral venous access targets appropriate for intravenous cannulation of a cross-sectional convenience sample of English speaking children aged 2-17 years presenting for treatment of sub-critical injury or illness whose parents provided consent. The clinicians marked the veins with different colored washable marker and counted them on the dorsum of the hand and in the antecubital fossa using the three approaches: S, S+P, and VVV. A trained research assistant photographed each site for independent counting after each marking and recorded demographics and BMI. Counts were validated using independent photographic analyses. Data were entered into SAS 9.2 and analyzed using paired t-tests. Results: 146 patients completed the study. Clinicians were able to identify significantly more veins on the dorsum of the hand using VVV than S alone or S+P, 3.26 (p < 0.0001, CI 2.89-3.64) and 2.31 (p < 0.0001, CI 1.97-2.65), respectively, as well as significantly more veins in the antecubital fossa using VVV than S alone or S+P, 2.62 (p < 0.0001, CI 2.29-2.96) and 1.93 (p < 0.0001, CI 1.62-2.42), respectively. The differences in numbers of veins identified remained significant at p < 0.05 level across all ages, races, and BMIs of children and across clinicians and validating independent photographic analyses. Conclusion: Experienced emergency nurses and physicians were able to identify significantly more venous access targets appropriate for intravenous cannulation in the dorsum of the hand and antecubital fossa of children presenting for treatment in a PED using VVV than the standard approaches of sight or sight plus palpation.",

Although data are limited, there is a general perception that the availability of in-person psychiatric consultation in the ED and of inpatient psychiatric beds is inadequate. Objectives: To examine the availability of in-person psychiatry consultation in a heterogeneous sample of U.S. EDs, and typical delays in transfer of ED patients to an inpatient psychiatric bed. Methods: During 2009-2011, we mailed a survey to all ED directors in a convenience sample of nine US states (AR, CO, GA, HI, MA, MN, OR, VT, and WY). All sites were asked: ''Are psychiatric consults available in-person to the ED?'' (yes/no), with affirmative respondents asked about the typical delay. Sites also were asked about typical ED boarding time between a request for patient transfer and actual patient departure from the ED to an inpatient psychiatric bed. ED characteristics included rural/urban location, visit volume (visits/hour), admission rate, ED staffing, and the proportion of patients without insurance. Data analysis used chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. Results: Surveys were collected from 495 (91%) of the 541 EDs, with >80% response rate in every state. Overall, only 30% responded that psychiatric consults were available in-person to the ED. In multivariable logistic regression, ED characteristics independently associated with lack of in-person psychiatric consultation were: location within specific states (eg, AR, GA), rural location, lower visit volume, and lower admission rate. Among the subset of EDs with psychiatric consults available, 48% reported a typical wait time of at least 1 hour. Overall, 54% of EDs reported that the typical time from request to actual patient transfer to an inpatient psychiatric bed was >6 hours, and 47% reported a maximum time in past year of >1 day (median 3 days, IQR 2-4). In a multivariable model, location in MA and higher visit volume were associated with greater odds of a maximum wait time of >1 day. Conclusion: Among 495 surveyed EDs in nine states, only 30% have in-person psychiatric consultants available. Moreover, approximately half of EDs report boarding times of >6 h from request for transfer to actual departure to an inpatient psychiatric bed.Background: Many emergency departments (ED) in the United States use a five tiered triage protocol that has a limited evaluation of psychiatric patients. The Australian Triage Scale (ATS), a psychiatric triage system, has been used throughout Australia and New Zealand since the early 1990s. Objectives: The objective of the study is to compare the current triage system, Emergency Nurses Association (ENA) ESI 5-Tier, to the ATS for the evaluation of the psychiatric patients presenting to the ED. Methods: A convenience sample of patients, 18 years of age and older, presenting with psychiatric complaints at triage were given the ENA triage assessment by the triage nurse. A second triage assessment, performed by a research fellow, included all observed and reported elements using the ATS protocol, a self-assessment survey and an agitation assessment using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). The study was performed at an inner city Level I trauma center with 60,000 visits per year. The ED was a catchment facility for the police department for psychiatric patients in the area. Patients were excluded if they were unstable, unable to communicate, or had a non-psychiatric complaint. Results were analyzed in SPSS v16. The analysis of data used frequencies, descriptive and ANOVA. Results: A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study: 72% were African American, 14% Caucasian, 13% Hispanic, 1% Asian, and 1% Indian; 63% of subjects enrolled were male. The patients' level of agitation using RASS showed 59% were alert and calm, 22% were restless and anxious, 6% were agitated, and 5% combative, violent, or dangerous to self. The only significant correlation found was among the ATS and several self assessment questions: ''I feel agitated on a 0 to 10 scale'' (p = 0.031) and ''I feel violent on a 0 to 10 scale'' (p = 0.001). There were no significant correlations found among the ENA triage, RASS scores, and throughput times. Conclusion: The ATS test was more sensitive to the patient declaring that he or she was agitated or felt violent. This shows that this system might be a more useful system in determining the severity of need of psychiatric patients presenting to the ED.",

Objectives: To define an optimal HBOC dosing strategy and evaluate the effect of an added NO donor, we use a prehospital swine polytrauma model to compare the effect of low-vs. moderate-volume HBOC resuscitation with and without nitroglycerin (NTG) co-infusion as an NO donor. We hypothesize that survival time will improve with moderate resuscitation and that an NO donor will add additional benefit. Methods: Survival time was compared in groups (n = 7) of anesthetized swine subjected to simultaneous traumatic brain injury and uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock by aortic tear. Animals received one of three different resuscitation fluids: lactated Ringers (LR), HBOC, or vasoattenuated HBOC with NTG co-infusion. For comparison, these fluids were given in a severely limited fashion (SL) as one bolus every 30 minutes up to four total, or a moderately limited fashion (ML) as one bolus every 15 minutes up to seven total, to maintain mean arterial pressure \u202160 mmHg. Comparison of resuscitation regimen and fluid type on survival time was made using two-way ANOVA with interaction and Tukey Kramer adjustment for individual comparisons. Results: There was a significant interaction between fluid regimen and resuscitation fluid type (ANOVA, p = 0.011) indicating that the response to SL or ML resuscitation was fluid type-dependent. Within the LR and HBOC+NTG groups, survival time (mean, 95%CI) was longer for SL, 323.5 min ( injuries are common and result from many different mechanisms of injury (MOI). Knowing common fracture locations may help in diagnosis and treatment, especially in patients presenting with distracting injuries that may mask the pain of a radius fracture.Objectives: We set out to determine the incidence of radius fracture locations among patients presenting to an urban emergency department (ED).Background: Carbon monoxide (CO) is the leading cause of poisoning morbidity and mortality in the United States. Standard treatment includes supplemental oxygen and supportive care. The utility of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy has been challenged by a recent Cochrane review. Hypothermia may mitigate delayed neurotoxic effects after CO poisoning as it is effective in cardiac arrest patients with similar neuropathology. Objectives: To develop a rat model of acute and delayed severe CO toxicity as measured by behavioral deficits and cell necrosis in post-sacrifice brain tissue.Methods: A total of 28 rats were used for model development; variable concentrations of CO and exposure times were compared to achieve severe toxicity. For the protocol, six senescent Long Evans rats were exposed to 2,000 ppm of CO for 20 minutes then 1,500 ppm for 160 minutes, followed by three successive dives at 30,000 ppm with an endpoint of apnea or seizure; there was a brief interlude between dives for recovery. A modified Katz assessment tool was used to assess behavior at baseline and 2 hours, 1 day, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks post-exposure. Following this, the brains were transcardially fixed with formalin, and 5 lm sagittal slices were embedded in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A pathologist quantified the percentage of necrotic cells in the cortex, hippocampus (pyramidal cells), caudoputamen, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), dentate gyrus, and thalamus of each brain to the nearest 10% from 10 randomly selected high power fields (400x Background: There remains controversy about the cardiotoxic effects of droperidol, and in particular the risk of QT prolongation and Torsades des Pointes (TdP).Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the cardiac and haemodynamic effects of high-dose parenteral droperidol for sedation of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in the emergency department (ED). Methods: A standardised intramuscular (IM) protocol for the sedation of ED patients with ABD was instituted as part of a prospective observational safety study in four regional and metropolitan EDs. Patients with ABD were given an initial dose of 10 mg droperidol followed by an additional dose of 10 mg after 15 min if required. Inclusion criteria were patients requiring physical restraint and parenteral sedation. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who have a prolonged QT interval on ECG. The QT interval was plotted against the heart rate (HR) on the QT nomogram to determine if the QT was abnormal. Secondary outcomes were frequency of hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Results: ECGs were available from 273 of 424 patients with ABD given droperidol. The median dose was 10 mg (IQR 10-15 mg; range: 5 to 30 mg). The median age was 33 years (rnge: 16 to 92) and 163 were males (60%). A total of four (1%) QT-HR pairs were above the ''at-risk'' line on the QT nomogram. Transient hypotension occurred in 8 (3%), and no arrhythmias were detected.Conclusion: Droperidol appears to be safe when used for rapid sedation in the dose range of 5 to 30 mg. It rarely causes hypotension or QT prolongation.",

These specialists can be exposed to as many as a dozen lead-encased charges per day during training exercises.Objectives: This observational study was performed by the Breacher Injury Consortium to determine the effect of short-term exposure to blasts by Breachers on whole blood lead levels (BLLs) and zinc protoporphyrin levels (ZPPLs). Methods: Two 2-week Basic Breaching training classes were conducted by the United States Marine Corps' Weapons Training Battalion Dynamic Entry School. Each class included 14 students and up to three instructors, with six non-breaching Marines serving as a control group. To evaluate for lead exposure, venous blood samples were acquired from study participants on the weekend prior and following training in the first training class, whereas the second training class had an additional level performed mid-training. BLLs and ZPPLs were measured in a whole-blood sample using the furnace atomic absorption method and hematofuorimeter method, respectively. Results: Analysis of these blast injury data indicated students demonstrated significantly increased BLLs post-explosion (mean = 7 mcg/dL, SD 2.42, p < 0.001) compared to pre-training (mean = 3 mcg/dL, SD 1.60) and control subjects (mean = 3 mcg/dL, SD 2.73, p < 0.001). Instructors also demonstrated significantly increased BLLS post explosion (mean = 6 mcg/dL, SD 1.95, p < 0.02) compared to pre-training (mean = 3 mcg/ dL, SD 1.14) and control subjects (mean = 3 mcg/dL, SD 2.73, p < 0.001). Student and instructor ZPPLs were not significantly different in post-training compared to pretraining or control groups. Conclusion: The observation from this study that Breachers are at risk of mild increases in BLLs support the need for further investigation into the role of lead following repeated blast exposure with munitions encased in lead.",

            "text": "Direct Observation of the Background: Notification of a patient's death to family members represents a challenging and stressful task for emergency physicians. Complex communication skills such as those required for breaking bad news (BBN) are conventionally taught with small-group and other interactive learning formats. We developed a de novo multi-media web-based learning (WBL) module of curriculum content for a standardized patient interaction (SPI) for senior medical students during their emergency medicine rotation.Objectives: We proposed that use of an asynchronous WBL module would result in students' skill acquisition for breaking bad news. Methods: We tracked module utilization and performance on the SPI to determine whether students accessed the materials and if they were able to demonstrate proficiency in its application. Performance on the SPI was assessed utilizing a BBN-specific content instrument developed from the GRIEV_ING mnemonic as well as a previously validated instrument for assessing communication skills.Results: Three hundred seventy-two students were enrolled in the BBN curriculum. There was a 92% completion rate of the WBL module despite students being given the option to utilize review articles alone for preparation. Students interacted with the activities within the module as evidenced by a mean number of mouse clicks of 42.1 (SD 21.6). Overall SPI scores were 94.5%, (SD 4.4) with content checklist scores of 92.8% (SD 5.7) and interpersonal communication scores 97.9% (SD 4.7). Five students had failing content scores (<75%) on the SPI and had a mean number of clicks of 30.8 (SD 28.2), which is not significantly lower than those passing (p = 0.21). Students in the first year of WBL deployment completed self-confidence assessments which showed significant increases in confidence (2.86 toBackground: Pelvis ultrasonography (US) is a useful bedside tool for the evaluation of women with suspected pelvic pathology. While pelvic US is often performed by the radiology department, it often lacks clinical correlation and takes more time than bedside US in the ED. This was a prospective observational study comparing the ED length of stay (LOS) of patients receiving ED US versus those receiving radiology US. Objectives: The primary objective was to measure the difference in ED LOS. The secondary objectives were to 1) assess the role of pregnancy status, OB/GYN consult in the ED, and disposition, in influencing the ED LOS; and 2) to assess the safety of ED US by looking at patient return to the ED within 2 weeks and whether that led to an alternative diagnosis.Methods: Subjects were women over 13 years old presenting with a GI or GU complaint, and who received either an ED or radiology US. A t-test was used for the primary objective, and linear regression to test the secondary objective. Odds ratios were performed to assess for interaction between these factors and type of ultrasound. Subgroup analyses were performed if significant interaction was detected. Results: Forty-eight patients received an ED US and 85 patients received a radiology US. Subjects receiving an ED US spent 162 minutes less in the ED (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, even when controlling for pregnancy status, OB/GYN consult, and disposition, patients who received an ED US had a LOS reduction of 108 minutes (p < 0.05). In odds ratio analysis, patients who were pregnant were 11 times more likely to have received an ED US (p < 0.05). Patients who received an OB/GYN consult in the ED were five times more likely to receive a radiology US (p < 0.05). There was no association between type of US and disposition. In subgroup analyses, pregnant and non-pregnant patients who received an ED US still had a LOS reduction of 140 minutes (p < 0.01) and 112 minutes (p < 0.05), respectively. Sample sizes were inadequate for subgroup analysis for subjects who had OB/GYN consults. In patients who did not receive an OB/GYN consult, those who received an ED US had a LOS reduction of 139 minutes (p < 0.001). Finally, 10% of subjects returned within two weeks, but none led to an alternative diagnosis. Conclusion: Even when controlling for disposition, OB/GYN consultation, and pregnancy status, patients who received an ED US had a statistically and clinically significant reduction in their ED LOS. In addition, ED US is safe and accurate. Background: Although early surface cooling of burns reduces pain and depth of injury, there are concerns that cooling of large burns may result in hypothermia and worse outcomes. In contrast, controlled mild hypothermia improves outcomes after cardiac arrest and traumatic burn injury. Objectives: The authors hypothesized that controlled mild hypothermia would prolong survival in a fluidresuscitated rat model of large scald burns. Methods: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg intramuscular ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine, with supplemental inhalational isoflurane as needed. A single full-thickness scald burn covering 40% of the total body surface area was created per rat using a Mason-Walker template placed in boiling water (100 deg C) for a period of 10 seconds. The rats were randomized to hypothermia (n = 20) and nonhypothermia (n = 20). Core body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal temperature probe. Hypothermia was induced through intraperitoneal injection of cooled (4 deg C) saline. The core temperature was reduced by 2 deg C and maintained for a period of 2 hours, applying an ice or heat pack when necessary. The rats were then rewarmed back to baseline temperature. In the control group, room temperature saline was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity and core temperature was maintained using a heating pad as needed. The rats were monitored until death or for a period of 7 days, whichever was greater. The primary outcome was death. The difference in survival was determined using a Kaplan-Meier analysis or log rank test. Results: The mean core temperatures were 32.5 deg C for the hypothermic group and 35.6 deg C for the normothermic group. The mean survival times were 124 hours for the hypothermic group (95% confidence interval [CI] = 98 to 150) and 100 hours for the normothermic group (95% CI = 68 to 132). The seven-day survival rates in the hypothermic and non-hypothermic groups were 67% and 53%. These differences were not significant, P = 0.33 for both comparisons. Conclusion: Induction of brief mild hypothermia increases but does not significantly prolong survival in a resuscitated rat model of large scald burns.",

            "text": "Serum Objectives: We sought to determine levels of serum mtDNA in ED patients with sepsis compared to controls and the association between mtDNA and both inflammation and severity of illness among patients with sepsis. Methods: Prospective observational study of patients presenting to one of three large, urban, tertiary care EDs. Inclusion criteria: 1) Septic shock: suspected infection, two or more systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) criteria, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg despite a fluid bolus; 2) Sepsis: suspected infection, two or more SIRS criteria, and SBP >90 mmHg; and 3) Control: ED patients without suspected infection, no SIRS criteria, and SBP >90 mmHg. Three mtDNAs (COX-III, cytochrome B, and NADH) were measured using real-time quantitative PCR from serum drawn at enrollment. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured using a Bio-Plex suspension array system. Baseline characteristics, IL-6, IL-10, and mtDNAs were compared using one way ANOVA or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Correlations between mtDNAs and IL-6/IL-10 were determined using Spearman's rank. Linear regression models were constructed using SOFA score as the dependent variable, and each mtDNA as the variable of interest in an independent model. A Bonferroni adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.Results: Of 93 patients, 24 were controls, 29 had sepsis, and 40 had septic shock. We found no significant difference in any serum mtDNAs among the cohorts (p = 0.14 to 0.30). All mtDNAs showed a small but significant negative correlation with IL-6 and IL-10 (q = )0.24 to )0.35). Among patients with sepsis or septic shock (n = 69), we found a small but significant negative association between mtDNA and SOFA score, most clearly with cytochrome b (p = 0.001). Conclusion: We found no difference in serum mtDNAs between patients with sepsis, septic shock, and controls. Serum mtDNAs were negatively associated with inflammation and severity of illness, suggesting that as opposed to trauma, serum mtDNA does not significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of the sepsis syndromes. Methods: We consecutively enrolled ED patients \u202118 years of age who met anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria from April 2008 to July 2011 at a tertiary center with 72,000 annual visits. We collected data on antihypertensive medications, suspected causes, signs and symptoms, ED management, and disposition. Markers of severe anaphylaxis were defined as 1) intubation, 2) hospitalization (ICU or floor), and 3) signs and symptoms involving \u20213 organ systems. Antihypertensive medications evaluated included beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to measure the association between antihypertensive medications and markers of severe anaphylaxis. Because previous studies demonstrated an association between age and the suspected cause of the reaction with anaphylaxis severity, we adjusted for these known confounders in multivariate analyses. We report associations as odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs with p-values. Results: Among 302 patients with anaphylaxis, median age (IQR) was 44 (31-58) and 204 (67.5%) were female. Eight (2.7%) patients were intubated, 57 (19%) required hospitalization, and 139 (46%) had \u20213 system involvement. Forty-nine (16%) were on beta-blockers, 34 (11%) on ACE inhibitors, and 22 (7.3%) on CCB. In univariate analysis, ACE inhibitors were associated with intubation and \u20213 system involvement and CCB were associated with hospital admission. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and suspected cause, ACE inhibitors remained associated with hospital admission and beta-blockers remained associated with both hospital admission and \u20213 system involvement. Conclusion: In ED patients, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor use may predict increased anaphylaxis severity independent of age and suspected cause of the anaphylactic reaction. Background: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation requires rapid assessment and intervention. Some skills like patient assessment, quality CPR, defibrillation, and medication administration require provider confidence to be performed quickly and correctly. It is unclear, however, whether high-fidelity simulation can improve confidence with a multidisciplinary group of providers with high levels of clinical experience. Objectives: The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that providers undergoing high-fidelity simulation of cardiopulmonary arrest scenarios will express greater confidence. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at an urban Level I trauma center from January to October 2011 with a convenience sample of registered (RN) and license practical nurses, nurse practitioners, resident physicians, and physician assistants who agreed to participate in 2/4 high-fidelity simulation (Laerdal 3G) sessions of cardiopulmonary arrest scenarios about 3 months apart. Demographics were recorded. Providers completed a validated preand post-test five-point Likert scale confidence measurement tool before and after each session that ranged from not at all confident (1) to very confident (5) in recognizing signs and symptoms of, appropriately intervening in, and evaluating intervention effectiveness in cardiac and respiratory arrests. Descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and ANOVA were used for data analysis. Sensitivity testing evaluated subjects who completed their second session at 6 months rather than 3 months. Results: Sixty-five subjects completed consent, 39 completed one session, and 23 completed at least two Background: Prehospital studies have focused on the effect of health care provider gender on patient satisfaction. We know of no study that has assessed patient satisfication with patient and prehospital provider gender. Some studies have shown higher patient satisfaction rates when cared for by a female health care provider.Objectives: To determine the effect of EMS provider gender on patient satisfaction with prehospital care. Methods: A convenience sampling of all adult patients brought in to our ED, an urban Level I trauma center by ambulance. A trained research associate (RA) stationed at triage conducted a survey using Press Ganey EMS patient satisfaction questions. There were thirteen questions evaluating prehospital provider skills such as driving, courtesy, listening, medical care, and communication. Each skill was assigned a point value between one and five; the higher the value the better the skill was performed. The patient's ambulance care report was copied for additional data extraction.Results: A total of 225 surveys were done. Average patient age was 71, and 54% were female. Scores for all questions totaled 65 (mean 62.63 \u00b1 5.1). Prehospital providers pairings were: male-male (n = 141), male-female (n = 71), and female-female (n = 13). There were no statistically significant differences in scores between our pairings (mean scores for male:male 19.3, male:female 19.1, and female:female 19.2; p = 0.73). We found nonstatistical differences in satisfaction scores based on the gender of the EMT in the back of the ambulance: males had a mean score of 62.7 and females had a mean score of 62.6 (p = 0.91). We examined gender concordance by comparing gender of the patient to the gender of the prehospital provider and found that male-male had a mean score of 62.8, female-female 62.2, and when the patient and prehospital provider gender did not match, 62.5 (p = 0.71). Conclusion: We found no effect of gender difference on patient satisfaction with prehospital care. We also found that overall, patients are very satisfied with their prehospital care. Objectives: We set out to determine the sensitivity and specificity of EPs in determining the presence of recently ingested tablets or tablet fragments.Methods: This was a prospective volunteer study at an academic emergency department. Healthy volunteers were enrolled and kept NPO for 6 hours prior to tablet ingestion. Over 10 minutes subjects ingested 800 ml of water and 30 tablets. Ultrasounds video clips were performed prior to any tablet ingestion, after drinking 200 ml of water, after 10 tablets, after 20 tablets, after 30 tablets, and 60 minutes after the final tablet ingestion yielding six clips per volunteer. All video clips were randomized and shown to three EPs who were fellowship-trained in emergency ultrasound. EPs recorded the presence or absence of tablets.Results: Ten volunteers underwent the pill ingestion protocol and sixty clips were collected. Results for all cases and each rater are reported in the table. Overall there was moderate agreement between raters (kappa = 0.42). Sub-group analysis of 10, 20, or 30 pills did not show any significant improvement in sensitivity and specificity.Conclusion: Ultrasound has moderate specificity but poor sensitivity for identification of tablet ingestion. These results imply that point-of-care ultrasound has limited utility in diagnosing large tablet ingestion. Background: Intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) therapy is a novel treatment that has been used to reverse the acute toxicity of some xenobiotics with varied success. US Poison Control Centers (PCC) are recommending this therapy for clinical use, but data regarding these recommendations are lacking.Objectives: To determine how US PCC have incorporated IFE as a treatment strategy for poisoning. Methods: A closed-format multiple-choice survey instrument was developed, piloted, revised, and then sent electronically to every medical director of an accredited US PCC using SurveyMonkey in March 2011; addresses were obtained from the AAPCC listserv, participation was voluntary and remained anonymous; three reminder invitations were sent during the study period. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results: Forty-five of 57 (79%) PCC medical directors completed the survey. All 45 respondents felt that IFE therapy played a role in the acute overdose setting. Thirty (67%) PCC have a protocol for IFE therapy: 29 (97%) recommend an initial bolus of 1.5 mL/kg of a 20% lipid emulsion, 28 (93%) PCC recommend an infusion of lipids, and 27/28 PCC recommend an initial infusion rate of 0.25 mL/kg of a 20% lipid emulsion. Thirty-three (73%) felt that IFE had no clinically significant side effects at a bolus dose of 1.5 mL/kg (20% emulsion). Forty-four directors (98%) felt that the ''lipid sink'' mechanism contributed to the clinical effects of IFE therapy, but 26 (58%) felt that there was a yet undiscovered mechanism that likely contributed as well. In a scenario with cardiac arrest due to a single xenobiotic, directors stated that their center would always or often recommend IFE after overdose of bupivicaine (43; 96%), verapamil (36; 80%), amitriptyline (31; 69%), or an unknown xenobiotic (12; 27%). In a scenario with significant hemodynamic instability due to a single xenobiotic, directors stated that their PCC would always or often recommend IFE after overdose of bupivicaine (40; 89%), verapamil (28; 62%), amitriptyline (25; 56%), or an unknown xenobiotic (8; 18%).Conclusion: IFE therapy is being recommended by US PCC. Protocols and dosing regimens are nearly uniform. Most directors feel that IFE is safe but are more likely to recommend IFE in patients with cardiac arrest than in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise. Further research is warranted. levels drawn at 4 hours or more (240 mcg/ml at 5 hours, 198 mcg \u2044 ml at 4 hours, respectively). NPV for toxic ingestion of an initial APAP level less than 100 mcg/ml was 97.8% (95% CI 92.3-99.7%).Conclusion: An APAP level of less than 100 mcg/ml drawn less than 4 hours after ingestion had a high NPV for excluding toxic ingestion. However, the authors would not recommend reliance on levels obtained under 4 hours to exclude toxicity as the potential for up to 6.7% false negative results is considered unacceptable. Background: Genetic variations in the mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) mediate individual differences in response to pain and addiction.Objectives: To study whether the common A118G (rs1799971) mu-opioid receptor single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or the alternative splicing SNP of OPRM1 (rs2075572) was associated with overdose severity, we assessed allele frequencies of each including associations with clinical severity in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute drug overdose. Methods: In an observational cohort study at an urban teaching hospital, we evaluated consecutive adult ED patients presenting with suspected acute drug overdose over a 12-month period for whom discarded blood samples were available for analysis. Specimens were linked with clinical variables (demographics, urine toxicology screens, clinical outcomes) then de-identified prior to genetic SNP analysis. In-hospital severe outcomes were defined as either respiratory arrest (RA, defined by mechanical ventilation) or cardiac arrest (CA, defined by loss of pulse). Blinded Taqman genotyping (Applied Biosystems) of the SNPs were performed after standard DNA purification (Qiagen) and whole genome amplification (Qiagen REPLI-g). The PLINK 1.07 genetic association analysis program was used to verify SNP data quality, test for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and test individual SNPs for statistical association. Results: We evaluated 178 patients (37% female, mean age 41.2) who overall suffered 13 RAs and 3 CAs (of whom 2 died). Urine toxicology was positive in 33%, of which there were positives for 32 benzodiazepines, 26 cocaine, 21 opiates, 13 methadone, and 6 barbiturates. All genotypes examined conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The 118G allele was associated with 2.5fold increased odds of CA/RA (OR 2.5, p < 0.05). The rs2075572 mutant allele was not associated with CA/ RA. Conclusion: These data suggest that the 118G mutant allele of the OPRM1 gene is associated with worse clinical severity in patients with acute drug overdose. The findings add to the growing body of evidence linking the A118G SNP with clinical outcome and raise the question as to whether the A118G SNP may be a potential target for personalized medical prescribing practices with regard to behavioral/physiologic overdose vulnerability.",
