            "text": "Globally a woman's sense of psychological well-being is inextricably intertwined in the social-cultural fabric of her environment. Poverty, access to healthcare and education, domestic and sexual violence, stress related to multiple roles and gender discrimination are some of the major psycho social factors identified as having a significant impact on the mental health of women. This presentation will discuss the importance of the identification and modification of risk factors across the life span through research, policy and program development. Particular emphasis will be placed on the need for fostering social support networks for women within their cultural context, and the importance of listening to the stories women tell of their unique experiences and the individual meaning they give to their life stories. Strategies will be suggested for the creation of an advocacy agenda for women's mental health, beginning with a brief review of the recommendations from the UN Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in 1995 and the follow-up review conducted at a UN Special Session ''Women 2000: Gender, equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century, Beijing \u00fe5''. This presentation will also focus on the need for building grassroots coalitions of individuals, organizations and consumers in order to provide an effective voice for gender equality and the empowerment of women.",

            "text": "Abstract: Besides affecting the hypothalamus and other brain areas related to reproduction, ovarian steroids have widespread effects throughout the brain, on catecholaminergic neurons and serotonergic pathways and the basal forebrain cholinergic system, as well as the hippocampus and amygdala. Because of the widespread influences of these various neuronal systems, ovarian steroids have measurable effects on affective state as well as on cognition, with implications for dementia. One of the most interesting effects is the regulation of synapse turnover in the hippocampus of the female rat, mouse and rhesus monkey. In rat, where we know most about mechanism, the formation of new excitatory synapses is induced by estradiol (E) and involves NMDA receptors, and estrogen receptors (ER) whereas down-regulation of these synapses involves progesterone and intracellular progestin receptors. As far as the mechanism for synapse formation, besides NMDA receptor activation, inhibitory interneurons play a pivotal role as they express nuclear ER, and decreased GABAergic activity is believed to be involved. Considering the need for NMDA receptor activation, it appears likely that a more local regulation by E in the excitatory pyramidal neurons is also necessary. The rat hippocampus expresses both ER and ER. Although, at the light microscopic level, autoradiography shows nuclear 3H-and 125I-E uptake in a distribution that reflects the localization of ER-immunoreactive interneurons in the dorsal hippocampus, electron microscopic immunocytochemistry has revealed extranuclear ER immunoreactivity within select dendritic spines on hippocampal principal cells, axons, axon terminals and glial processes. These findings have led to studies of E regulation of signalling pathways involving PI3kinase and Akt phosphorylation, as well as CREB phosphorylation leading to transcriptional and translational events that increase production of key pre-and postsynaptic proteins. We have proposed a ''distributed model'' of E action including both genomic and non-genomic actions with inhibitory and excitatory neurons and include actions of estrogens pre-and post-synaptically as well as trans-synaptically. There is growing evidence that such E effects on synapses occur in other brain regions. Supported by NIH grants NS07080 and 5 P01 AG16765.",

            "text": "The differences in prevalence, course and response to treatment of major mood and anxiety disorders between men and women are believed to be affected by hormonal, reproductive and genetic factors. These differences are further highlighted by differential exposure=response to environmental influences and by physiological differences. The role and potential relevance of sex hormones to female specific psychiatric disorders is even more obvious. Levels of estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) vary significantly across the female lifespan. Behaviours such as moodiness, irritability and relationship conflicts around the time of puberty may in part reflect increased sensitivity of neurotransmitter systems to changes in sex hormone levels. The constant flux of E and P levels continues throughout the reproductive years. PMS=PMDD may be the result of an altered activity (or sensitivity) of certain neurotransmitter systems to hormonal fluctuations in genetically vulnerable women. Pregnancy and delivery also produce dramatic changes in E and P levels which help explain the increased vulnerability to perinatal depression, and finally at menopause the loss of modulating effects of E and P may underlie the development of perimenopausal mood disorders. Differences caused by genetic polymorphism, combined with the flux in the hormonal milieu, may determine how women react to environmental stress and predict the development of mood disorders.",

Wadhwa, University of California, Irvine College of Medicine, 3117 Gillespie Neuroscience Research Facility Irvine, CA 92697-4260, U.S.A., e-mail: pwadhwa@uci.edu Abstract: Behavioral perinatology is as an interdisciplinary area of research that involves conceptualization of theoretical models and conduct of empirical studies of the dynamic time-, place-, and context-dependent interplay between biological and behavioral processes in fetal, neonatal and infant life using an epigenetic framework of development. The biobehavioral processes of particular interest to our research group relate to the effects of maternal pre-and perinatal stress and maternal-placental-fetal stress physiology. We propose that behavioral perinatology research may have important implications for a better understanding of the processes that underlie or contribute to the risk of three sets of outcomes: prematurity, adverse neurodevelopment, and chronic degenerative diseases in adulthood. Based on an understanding of the ontogeny of human fetal development and the physiology of pregnancy and fetal development, we have articulated a neurobiological model of pre-and perinatal stress. Our model proposes that chronic maternal stress may exert a significant influence on fetal developmental outcomes. Maternal stress may act via one or more of three major physiological pathways: neuroendocrine; immune=inflammatory, and vascular. We further suggest that placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) may play a central role in coordinating the effects of endocrine, immune=inflammatory and vascular processes on fetal developmental outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of maternal stress are modulated by the nature, duration and timing of occurrence of stress during gestation. The conceptual and empirical basis for this model, as well as some relevant issues and questions, including recommendations for future research in this area will be highlighted.",

Many studies suffer from methodological limitations so far, and discussion often fails to clearly differentiate e.g. between perimenopause versus postmenopause, menopausal transition versus aging, mental disorder versus minor changes of wellbeing, incidence versus prevalence, changes as causal versus triggering factors, prophylaxis versus treatment. Not all, but certain vulnerable women may suffer from hormonal changes of perimenopause and=or from aging and=or the manifold psychosocial changes in this phase of life. Physiologic estrogen production is lost with menopause. As estrogens have important neuro-and psychoprotective activities, this loss can probably trigger or aggravate mental disorders in vulnerable women. Substitution might be helpful in some cases, but also bears risks. More research on indications and contraindications as well as on new, safer compounds is needed.",

The killing of an innocent elicits sorrow, anger, and horror. Yet the perpetrator of this act is often a victim, too, and that recognition makes for a more paradoxical response. These contradictions represent the theme of this discussion. Neonaticide or infant murder on the day of birth is often preceded by denial of pregnancy. Well-documented clinical case reports of neonaticide describe a presentation of pregnancy denial, dissociative symptoms or psychosis. This paper will be a discussion of infanticide associated with mental illness. Case vignettes of women who killed infants will be presented. Early identification of women at risk and detection of infanticidal ideation will be a central focus. Legislation will be compared from US where women are charged with murder to the UK and most European states who provide more lenient legislation through infanticide laws. Using contemporary diagnostic criteria and the biopsychosocial model of psychiatry the author identifies risk factors and clinical presentations, which may provide mechanisms for treatment, rehabilitation and education. This paper suggests that common variables exist in a subset of these women. Similarities in history, presentation and circumstances of pregnancy and delivery suggest a pattern of shared psychopathology. The goal of this discussion is to encourage further systematic exploration and early identification of women at risk.",

A double blind, placebo-controlled trial of estradiol significantly improved measures of mood in depressed perimenopausal women. Therapeutic response to estradiol was not predicted by either baseline or post-treatment plasma levels of estradiol or the presence of hot flushes. Twenty-nine asymptomatic premenopausal women were followed for an average of five years until their final menses. Nine of the 12 episodes of depression that were observed occurred in the 24 months around the final menses suggesting that the late perimenopause is a period of increased risk for depression. In younger women, GnRH agonist-induced hypogonadism was associated with changes in libido but not mood or cognitive function. Our data suggest that gonadal steroids do not display uniform effects on mood but do positively modulate mood in the context of perimenopausal depression.",

A relationship between DHEA and depression has been suggested by reports of alterations in plasma DHEA levels in depression (both decreased and increased) and initial reports of antidepressant like effects of DHEA (either as monotherapy or combined with traditional antidepressant agents). In this randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we examined the therapeutic efficacy of DHEA as monotherapy in men (n \u00bc 23) and women (n \u00bc 23) aged 45 to 65 years with midlife-onset depression. Medications (DHEA and placebo) were administered for 6 weeks each with a 2 week washout prior to crossover. The dose of DHEA was 90 mg=day for the first three weeks and 450 mg=day during the second three weeks. Outcome measures consisted of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression scale, and Derogatis's Inventory of Sexual Functioning. Results were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni t tests. We observed a significant improvement in depression severity (e.g., in both men and women on DHEA compared to both baseline (p < 0.01) and placebo conditions (p < 0.01). Additionally, DHEA administration was associated with a significant improvement in measures of sexual functioning (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 compared to baseline and placebo, respectively). There was no difference in the response to DHEA between men and women in any outcome measure. DHEA administration increased plasma testosterone in women but not men. Predictors of the therapeutic response to DHEA remain to be determined. These data suggest that DHEA is an effective monotherapy antidepressant in men and women with midlife-onset depression. Additionally, although there is a sexual dimorphism in the profile of steroid hormone metabolites of DHEA, the antidepressant response does not differ across genders.",

Among such adaptations, a dramatic change in the general stress responsiveness of the maternal organism has been described which will be in the focus of the symposium entitled ''Maternal stress coping from pregnancy to lactation'' chaired by Inga D. Neumann. This symposium will cover maternal alterations of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness in pregnancy and during parturition (Alison Douglas), as well as in lactation (Dominique Walker) which occur at different brain levels. Such adaptations include, for example, an attenuated responsiveness of the brain CRH system which results in lower HPA axis responses as shown in rats and mice. Also, in lactating women, reduced stress responses were described especially during breast-feeding (Markus Heinrichs). The attenuated stress responsiveness seen in pregnancy seems to be of particular relevance for the development of the fetuses, as exposure to prenatal stress by exposure of the mother to stressful events in pregnancy results in various maladaptations of the infants (Suzan King). Oliver Bosch will then summarize effects of chronic exposure to relevant stressors throughout pregnancy on maternal parameters post partum, which demonstrates that HPA axis downregulation might be effective to protect the maternal brain against dramatic fluctuations in circulating sex steroids which may otherwise result in emotional disturbances.",

We have investigated the central noradrenergic mechanisms underlying stress hyporesponsiveness in pregnancy and sympathetic activation in parturition. We have shown in pregnancy that a reduction in the noradrenergic input contributes to stress hyporesponsiveness: basal and stress-stimulated noradrenaline release within the paraventricular nucleus are less in pregnancy versus virgins, and antagonising central noradrenaline action inhibits stress responses in virgin but not pregnant rats. Stress responses to CCK, which increases ACTH secretion via noradrenergic pathways in virgins, are also attenuated in mid-late pregnancy. Additionally, a1-receptor mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus decreases perinatally. During parturition the HPA axis is not activated indicating that birth is not stressful; even exposure to stress during birth has no effect on the HPA axis. However, stress does delay birth in rodents, and evidently the sympathetic system is activated since peripheral administration of b-receptor antagonist restores the birth profile and giving a b-receptor agonist mimics the stress effects. Thus, decreased excitation and increased inhibition by noradrenaline in the stress axis contributes to perinatal stress hyporesponsiveness, but peripheral sympathetic responses to stress are retained and mediate delay in birth.",

Here, we stressed pregnant animals from two Wistar rat lines bred for high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxiety-related behaviour between pregnancy days 4 to 18 by defeating them as an intruder in the maternal defence test, a psychosocial stressor. After parturition, patterns of maternal behaviour including the retrieval of pups was different between lactating HAB and LAB rats (p < 0.01), but independent of prior pregnancy-stress. The maternal aggressive behaviour against a virgin intruder rat was significantly increased in pregnancy-stressed LAB dams compared to controls (p < 0.01), but unchanged in lactating HABs. In tests for anxiety-related behaviour and active vs. passive stress coping, line-specific differences could be seen without a significant influence of stress exposure in the pregnancy. When exposed to a mild stressor on lactation day 8 ACTH and corticosterone plasma levels increased significantly in pregnancy-stressed, but not in control HAB rats (p < 0.01); no change was seen in either pregnancy-stressed or control LAB rats.",

In animal research, oxytocin has been stimulated by exogenous (e.g., intracerebroventricular injection) and endogenous (e.g., lactation) methods. Intracerebral oxytocin has been shown to inhibit stress-responsive neurohormonal systems and to function as a regulator in social attachment. Similar to studies in animals, we determined the effects of endogenous stimulation (lactation, massage) and exogenous stimulation (intranasal administration) in humans. In lactating women, a suppression of cortisol stress responses (p < 0.001) was observed if breast-feeding starts 30 min before psychosocial stress exposure (Heinrichs et al., 2002) . Standardized massage by the partner 30 min before stress also reduced cortisol stress responses in women (p < 0.05). The combination of intranasal oxytocin (24 I.U.) and social support exhibited the lowest cortisol stress responses (p < 0.01) as well as increased calmness (p < 0.05) and decreased anxiety (p \u00bc 0.052) (Heinrichs et al., 2003) . These results concur with data from animal research suggesting an important role of oxytocin as an underlying mechanism for stress protective effects of breastfeeding and positive social interaction.",

In humans, hyporesponsiveness of breastfeeding (BF) mothers compared to bottlefeeders (BO) was found with a physical, but not a psychological stressor, although the role of infant-related emotional stimuli on the magnitude of the stress response remains unknown. Another important aspect of the HPA response is the ability to habituate to repeated stressors although no study has investigated parity effects on the stress axis. We tested whether stimulus salience and parity could modify the HPA response of post-partum (PP) mothers to psychological stressors. We measured basal diurnal and reactive salivary cortisol levels to two psychological stressors with (viewing of validated videos) or without (TSST) child-related content in BF and BO primiparous and multiparous mothers during the 6-18 weeks postpartum. Trait anxiety, sleep disturbances and salivary estradiol levels were covariates in the data analysis. We compared responses of PP mothers to nonpostpartum (NPP) mothers of older children (1-6 yrs of age). Despite significant perturbations in sleep pattern, basal diurnal cortisol rhythm of PP women remained similar to that of NPP mothers, except for blunting of the morning awakening peak. When presented with the TSST, primiparous PP mothers exhibited significant cortisol responses, comparable to NPP mothers. Multiparous BF, but not BO mothers showed blunted responses. Although NPP mothers had significant increases in salivary cortisol to the viewing of an emotional video, none of the post-partum groups, except the mutiparous BO mothers showed a cortisol response to this stressor. Our results suggest that the stress hyporesponsiveness of post-partum mothers is stressor-specific and influenced by parity. Unlike the rat model, human hyporesponsiveness to stress may be independent of the suckling stimulus in primiparous mothers, but the ''protective'' effect of suckling might be revealed in multiparous mothers.

The importance of sex steroids in triggering the symptoms is underlined by the findings that they can be reduced by ovulation inhibitors and reinstated by administration of estrogen \u00fe gestagens. A large number of controlled trials support the notion that serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are very effective for the treatment of PMDD; in contrast, non-serotonergic antidepressants are not. The onset of action of SRIs is much shorter when used for PMDD than when used for depression, enabling women with PMDD to restrict the medication to the luteal phase.

The search for a ''perimenopausal depressive syndrome'', however, has led to inconclusive findings. While some studies suggested that the menopausal transition might constitute a period of heightened vulnerability to depressive symptoms (and consequently cause psychosocial impairment) among sub-groups of women, others have failed to demonstrate such increased risk for depression. Most studies examining this question vary greatly in design. For example, data used to address this putative association derived from a variety of settings (gynecologic clinics, specialized 'menopause clinics'. In addition, there is a lack of consistency in the definition used for menopausal status, as well as the absence of more systematic assessment of psychiatric symptoms or disorders, or more rigorous criteria to define depressive disorders. This presentation will review recent data derived from The Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles, a population-based prospective study of women with and without a lifetime history of major depression. This study is unique from other population-based studies because of the rigorous systematic assessment of psychiatric morbidity and menstrual cycle changes over time.",

These putative causative agents include GABA receptors, serotonin (5HT) receptors and noradrenaline receptors. Altered GABAA receptor function has been demonstrated in clinical studies of PMDD. By use of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy it was recently established that the GABAergic system is substantially modulated in PMDD patients, particularly during the follicular phase. Another way of estimating the functional GABAA receptor sensitivity is by measuring specific behavioral responses to drugs that act at the GABAA receptor. The saccadic eye velocity (SEV) is one such measure, since the SEV reliably decreases in response benzodiazepines, operating via the GABAA receptor. In this pharmacodynamic model patients with PMDD have a reduced sensitivity to benzodiazepines. This subsensitivity to benzodiazepines was further accentuated in patients with severe premenstrual symptoms compared to those with moderate symptoms. Also, consistent with the subsensitivity to benzodiazepines in PMDD patients, is the finding of greater panic response to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil during the luteal phase among PMDD patients.

Becker, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A., e-mail: jbbecker@UMICH.EDU Abstract: Women begin using cocaine and enter treatment at earlier ages than men and have more severe cocaine use at intake than men. While there are still more men than women who are cocaine addicts, the percentage of women is increasing, and women may be more sensitive to the addictive properties of cocaine than men. This may be due, at least in part, to underlying neurobiological sex differences. Results of studies in laboratory animals find that the acute behavioral response to the psychomotor stimulants (cocaine and amphetamine) reflects both sex differences and is modulated differentially by gonadal hormones in male and female rodents. We find that in the adult rat there are sex differences in the rate of behavioral sensitization to cocaine and in the acquisition of cocaine selfadministration behavior. These sex differences occur independent of circulating gonadal hormones: ovariectomized females exhibit greater sensitization and more rapid onset of cocaine self-administration than do castrated males. Furthermore, estradiol treatment to ovariectomized females, but not to castrated male rats enhances both sensitization and acquisition of cocaine self-administration. There sex differences in the effects of cocaine are thought to be due to hormonal modulation of the ascending dopamine pathways, where estradiol rapidly enhances presynaptic dopamine release in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. We postulate that hormonal modulation of this pathway evolved because of its role in the motivation to engage in sexual behavior, since extracellular dopamine increases during sexual behavior in the female rat. The mechanism by which estradiol exert its effects on the behavioral and neurochemical responses to the psychomotor stimulants is novel. Estradiol appears to be acting on a membraneassociated receptor to rapidly down-regulate presynaptic inhibition of dopamine release.",

We analyzed mice in which cellular genetic sex is independent of the animal's gonadal sex. In primary cell cultures of embryonic mesencephalon, XY cultures develop more dopamine neurons than XX cultures irrespective of the gonadal sex of the embryo, showing that XX and XY cells have a different phenotype in identical hormonal environments. In adult mice, the density of vasopressin fibers in the lateral septum is greater in XY than XX animals of the same gonadal sex, suggesting a direct action of X or Y genes. In zebra finches, genetic females induced to develop testes have a feminine brain. We analyzed the brain of a gynandromorphic zebra finch (genetically male on the right side of its body and genetically female on the left side of its body). The right brain was more masculine than the left, a difference not caused by gonadal secretions. Male and female brains therefore may function differently because of the sex differences in expression in brain of genes encoded on the X and Y chromosomes.",

This regulation requires the actions of estradiol and progesterone on intracellular estrogen and progestin receptors acting as transcriptional regulators in neurons within the hypothalamus and related areas. However, in addition to hormones regulating sexual behavior, mating stimulation by male rats influences the subsequent behavioral response of female rats, and it modulates genomic response in populations of neurons. Like the effects of progesterone, the effects of mating stimulation on the sexually dimorphic neural substrate for feminine sexual behavior are mediated by activation of neuronal progestin receptors. In contrast, though, activation by mating stimulation is indirect and occurs in the absence of progesterone. Because activation of D1dopamine receptors also facilitates the expression of feminine sexual behavior by ligand-independent activation of neuronal progestin receptors, we suggest that social=genital stimulation modulates behavior, in part, by dopamine-mediated, hormone-independent activation of progestin receptors in populations of neurons involved in the regulation of sexual behavior. This neuroendocrine model provides a means to study the integration of hormones and sensory=social=environmental stimuli by steroid hormone receptors in populations of neurons and subsequent effects on sexually dimorphic brain functions.

            "text": "Abstract: Depression is twice as common in women and a number of theories have been proposed for this increased vulnerability. Stress is a critical trigger for the onset of depression, so stress systems have been a focus of research. Our studies have focused upon HPA axis regulation in depression and differences in stress responsiveness and glucocorticoid negative feedback between men and women. Sex differences in stress response have been shown for a number of species including rats and human. Basic science studies examining the direct effects of gonadal steroids on HPA axis function have suggested that estrogen increases stress responsiveness and inhibits glucocorticoid negative feedback, as well as decreasing the number of Type I glucocorticoid receptors. In normal women, we noted resistance to the suppressive effects of infused cortisol, when cortisol was administered during the luteal phase, but normal suppression to cortisol during the follicular phase, when progesterone levels were low. Similar data have beeen seen with dexamethasone suppression. Our data and those of others suggest an influence of ovarian steroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal that results in both greater stress responsiveness and resistance to the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids both of which may contribute to depression. Objectives: Participants will have a better understanding of the interaction of psychosocial work conditions, conflicting role demands and mental health outcomes for women. They will be able to recognize symptoms related to different psychosocial factors and stressors in the workplace. Sex differences in stress responses, symptoms and coping strategies will be demonstrated.",

A Swedish study showed that women had greater total workload, devoted more time to household work and children and perceived greater stress from paid work than men. Prevalence and intensity of symptoms was higher in women than in men. The stress experienced by women was influenced by an interaction between psychosocial work conditions and household duties, whereas men responded more selectively to work conditions. A Canadian study examined the psychological stress that the SARS epidemic had on physicians. All physicians experienced stress and their patient care, teaching and research activities were disrupted. The female physicians expressed more concern about infecting family members whereas male physicians were more worried about impact on their income and career. The emotional wellbeing of informally employed women in Lima was studied. They experienced more psychological distress and had a lower self-esteem than those formally employed. Increased autonomy in the workplace may improve health. A national US study found that time-flexible work policies reduced stress among women and men. Overall, the effect of specific stressors in the workplace, gender role and form of employment are important variables affecting women's mental health and wellbeing.",

Thus, although men have family and home responsibilities outside of work, women spend significantly more time working at home than men do, even when men and women work a comparable number of hours at their paid employment. Thus, I hypothesized that women would derive greater health benefits than men from flexible work arrangements that would allow them to control their time commitments. Data from the National Study of the Changing Workforce (1997) were used to test the hypothesis that employees who needed time-flexible work policies and who had these policies available, reported less stress, higher levels of commitment to their employer, and reduced costs to the organization because of fewer absences and fewer missed deadlines. The model provides persuasive findings for the hypothesized relationship for time-flexible work policies, but the model did not differ for women or men. This study offers important suggestions to employers who can translate reduced illness into savings on health benefits, fewer absences and late days into higher productivity, and increased commitment into better employees for both women and men. By showing that timeflexible work policies provide employer benefits, we can hasten the change to a new worker model -one that is family and employer friendly. The business case for family-friendly work policies may prove to be the best tool we have in changing how we live and work.",

This presentation will discuss contemporary American legislation and the insanity defense which essentially ignores the psychiatric vulnerability of postpartum women. US laws will be contrasted with infanticide legislation of the UK and other European countries. Furthermore the threat of abolition of infanticide legislation in the UK by the Victorian Law Reform groups will also be discussed. In addition, there will be a discussion of the American criminal and civil courts'; discrepant treatment of postpartum psychiatric disorders-contrast the admissibility of postpartum syndromes on women's behalf in the civil courts (as in child custody suits) versus their inadmissibility in criminal cases. The final goal will be to provide a mechanism for psychiatry to share our knowledge with the judicial system and vice versa, to discuss the importance of accepted knowledge in the psychiatric community as a scientific standard in the courtroom, propose a standard for the insanity defense in the United States and discuss the utilization of 1853 M'Naghton law in 21st century neuroscience and potential for change.",

However, greater consistency in the timing of screening and type of intervention in target populations is needed. Abstract: According to a report by the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, women account for the majority of the older population in almost every country, and the proportion women increases with age. Worldwide, women make up just over half of the age group 60-69, and they account for 65 percent of those 80 years and older. The challenges that women and men face as they age differ. Older women are more likely to be widowed, to live alone, and to live in poverty. Older women tend to have lower educational attainment, less formal labor force experience, and more family caregiving responsibilities than do older men. Women are also more vulnerable to certain age-related diseases. This session will focus on four areas of research in Women's Mental Health and Aging. Separate presentations will focus on two of the most common mental health challenges that women face as they age -depression and dementia. A third presentation will focus on findings from recent cross-cultural studies of sex differences in personality characteristics that may predispose women to certain mental health disorders. The final presentation will introduce the concept of ''active aging'' as an effort to improve quality of life in older women.",

Women have a longer life expectancy than men, and many more women than men die of AD. In 2001, the death rate from AD among American women was almost 2 1 2 times higher than that among men. It is unclear whether the higher prevalence of AD among women is due entirely to women's greater life expectancy or whether some other factor or combination of factors might put women at increased risk of the disease.

Women have more depressive symptoms in adulthood and later adulthood than their male counterparts. Higher rates are found in primary care offices or long-term care settings, where as many as 15-20 percent of older women have symptoms of depression. Depression in later life is associated with functional impairment, poor recovery from other illnesses, increased use of general medical services, and increased early mortality risk. This mirrors findings from the World Health Organization that depression is one of the leading causes of disease burden in the developed world. In addition, the global population is growing older, highlighting the urgency to apply preventive and treatment interventions to reduce disease burden. Despite substantial evidence that depression is treatable, recognition of depression remains problematic. It is often attributed to normal aging, particularly among persons who are widowed, live alone, and have multiple physical illnesses -the majority of older women in this country. While we have ways of adequately assessing, treating and possibly preventing depression in later life, challenges in implementing effective practices remain. Examples of effective interventions will be provided and discussed.

Studies using self-reports find that gender differences are also universal, with women scoring higher than men on Neuroticism and Agreeableness, as well as on some specific traits such as Warmth and Openness to Aesthetics. Surprisingly, sex differences are most pronounced in progressive, Western nations. New data from over 30 cultures (N \u00bc 7000\u00fe) suggest that similar sex differences emerge when observer ratings of personality traits are analyzed, and when either men or women are the raters. Observed sex differences are small, but they have implications for mental health. Because women are higher in Neuroticism, they are more prone than men to depression and anxiety disorders; because they are higher in Agreeableness, women are less prone to antisocial and psychopathic disorders. With age, Neuroticism declines and Agreeableness increases. As a result, some mental disorders (e.g., Borderline Personality Disorder) wane with age. In general, mental health should improve with age for most women around the world.",

For example, accumulating data suggest that an increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety exists among subgroups of women during periods of heightened hormonal variability (i.e., premenstrual periods, puerperium, and the menopausal transition). It is therefore intuitive that gender related characteristics and hormone aspects should be taken into account while planning treatment strategies for reproductiverelated mood and anxiety disturbances. This presentation will focus on female-specific characteristics regarding prevalence, risk factors, and phenomenology of mood and anxiety disturbances, and their impact on quality of life across the life cycle of women. Dr. Steiner will review existing findings on how sex hormones modulate mood and behavior in women. Dr. Pearlstein will address specific considerations regarding the disease burden and psychosocial impairment caused by premenstrual mood disturbances. Dr. Yonkers will review the extent to which depressive disorders may contribute to poor perinatal outcomes. Dr. Joffe will discuss the etiology and treatment of hot flushes and menopause related sleep disturbance, as well as recent data on psychotropic treatments of vasomotor symptoms. Lastly, Dr. Soares will explore the association between menopausal transition and mood disturbance, and review novel treatment strategies for symptomatic menopausal women, in light of recent controversy involving long term use of hormone therapy.

These differences are further highlighted by differential exposure= response to environmental influences and by physiological differences. The role and potential relevance of sex hormones to female specific psychiatric disorders is even more obvious. Levels of estrogen (E) and progesterone (P) vary significantly across the female lifespan. Behaviours such as moodiness, irritability and relationship conflicts around the time of puberty may in part reflect increased sensitivity of neurotransmitter systems to changes in sex hormone levels. The constant flux of E and P levels continues throughout the reproductive years. PMS=PMDD may be the result of an altered activity (or sensitivity) of certain neurotransmitter systems to hormonal fluctuations in genetically vulnerable women. Pregnancy and delivery also produce dramatic changes in E and P levels which help explain the increased vulnerability to perinatal depression, and finally at menopause the loss of modulating effects of E and P may Underlie the development of perimenopausal mood disorders. Differences caused by genetic polymorphism, combined with the flux in the hormonal milieu, may determine how women react to environmental stress and predict the development of mood disorders.

Among African-American women, the rates for PTD were 17% while LBW occurred in 13% demonstrating the disparate impact these events have for selected racial minorities. Two-thirds of all infant deaths occurred in this group, illustrating the disproportionate morbidity and mortality among babies that are LBW or preterm. Moreover, babies born preterm are about 15 times more likely to die in the first year of life than babies born at term. Regrettably, rates of PTD and LBW rose throughout the past decade underscoring the need for new approaches to address these adverse perinatal outcomes. A number of factors, including infection, coagulopathies, hypertensive disorders and multiple gestation underlie the risk of PTD and LBW. However, the important impact of psychosocial variables, in particular depression, is increasingly recognized. For example, in one study each point increase on the Beck Depression Inventory increased the risk of PTD and LBW increased by 7% and 6%, respectively, in adult women. A 2002 study found that among African-American women, the risk for spontaneous preterm birth was twofold greater for those scoring in the highest decile of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Scale for Depression (CES-D). After controlling for biomedical factors, depression conferred a risk for preterm birth that was higher than the risk for smoking, drug abuse or previous poor perinatal outcome. Large, controlled studies evaluating birth outcomes among women who took antidepressants during pregnancy show rates for PTD that are 1.5 to 3-fold higher than for untreated controls. This presentation will review data associating depression with poor perinatal outcomes and will address possible mechanisms underlying the possible association. postmenopausal women. Participants will also be able to use psychoactive medications to treat hot flushes in women unable or unwilling to take estrogen for management of menopausal symptoms.",

            "text": "Abstract: Hot flushes are the most common menopausal symptom, occurring in up to 75% of perimenopausal and recently postmenopausal women. Symptoms of hot flushes disrupt quality-of-life by interrupting sleep repeatedly throughout the night and interfering with daytime function. Erratic fluctuations and declining levels of estrogen in menopausal women cause hot flushes through the effect of estrogen on the thermoregulatory region in the hypothalamus. Like estrogen, serotonin and norepinephrine have hypothalamic inputs and may play important roles in hot flushes. Recent Women's Health Initiative reports on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have changed the risk: benefit ratio on HRT use for postmenopausal women such that the primary indication for HRT use is now short-term treatment of hot flushes. Although HRT remains the first-line treatment for hot flushes, there has been increasing attention to non hormonal treatments of hot flushes for women who are unable or unwilling to take HRT. In light of the Women's Health Initiative findings, this presentation will discuss recent advances in the management of hot flushes. Data supporting the use of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and other psychoactive medications in the treatment of hot flushes will be presented.

Types of violence may differ slightly depending on the cultural context. In North America attention is being paid to sexual harassment and stalking while in East Asian countries dowry deaths and honour killings are seen. Consequences of such violence include low self-esteem, hopelessness, depression, anxiety, substance abuse, physical injuries and death. Despite the policy statements and directives by the World Health Organization, governments do not seem to be taking a strong stand to change patterns in their countries. Patriarchal attitudes which accept views of women as secondary citizens must change in order to decrease violence against women. Laws against violence need to be enforced in order to give a clear message that such violence will not be tolerated. This symposium will present an international perspective on violence against women. Drs. Robinson, Rondon, Douki and Niaz will speak about violence in North America, South America, Arabic countries and East Asian countries respectively.

In this paper, I will argue that this is so because violence stems from deep cultural roots and because women are brought up in a patriarchal familial organization which promotes passivity and dependence. Traditional religious culture, which poses the Virgin Mary figure as role model, is ambivalent and distorted, repressing sex while overvaluing motherhood and self denial and demeaning women who do not conform to the established stereotypes. Patriarchal violence against the woman has serious emotional consequences for women. The stressful violent circumstances in women's lives leads to increased drug abuse which further exposes them to police and institutional violence. Political instability and civil wars in South America have caused many deaths, and have left many women with traumatic sequelae. Efforts at improving quality of life and diminishing violent conditions for women and girls in Latin America should include consideration of local cultural, political and economic peculiarities.",

Surveys in Egypt, Palestine, Israel and Tunisia show that at least one out of three women is beaten by her husband. The indifference to this type of violence stems from attitudes that domestic violence is a private matter and, usually, a justifiable response to misbehaviour on the part of the wife. Selective excerpts from the Koran are used to prove that men who beat their wives are following God's commandments. These religious justifications, plus the importance of preserving the honour of the family, lead abusers, victims, police and health care professionals to join in a conspiracy of silence rather than disclosing these offences. However, a fair reading of the Koran shows that wife abuse, like genital mutilation and ''honour killings'' are a result of culture rather than religion.",

Rigid cultures and patriarchal attitudes which devalue the role of women, result in the wide spread occurrence of violence against women. The family structure, in which the man is the undisputed ruler of the household and activities within the family are seen as private, allows violence to occur at home. As well as traditional forms of violence such as wife battering and sexual assault, women in these countries are also exposed to dowry crimes such as bride burning, kidnapping for the purposes of prostitution, and (honour killings). Laws permit discrimination against women and discourage reporting of violent acts. Efforts to remedy this situation must include changes in local laws as well as assistance from the United Nations and the international community.",

Forty to 51% of women experience some type of violence in their lifetime including child abuse, physical violence, rape and domestic violence. The perpetrator is most likely to be a current or former partner. Such violence stems from historical views of women as property and may flourish because of the public's reluctance to get involved in family matters. The concept of violence has been expanded to include non-traditional types such as sexual harassment, breeches of fiduciary trust and stalking. Treatment of victims of violence must include ensuring their safety, encouraging them to make healthy choices and helping them to understand they are not at fault.

If pregnancy is chosen, additional decisions include whether to use a known or unknown donor, whether to use fresh or frozen sperm, and if using a known donor, what the nature of his relationship will be with the child. Legal issues for lesbian mothers are also potentially quite complex. Multiple myths exist about families with gay or lesbian parents including that they will be unfit parents, that lesbians are less maternal, and that children will have abnormal development of their gender identity, gender role behavior, sexual orientation and peer relationships.

Antenatal midwives were provided additional training in structured interviewing techniques, psychometric assessments and brief counselling skills to provide a complete psychosocial assessment as well as antenatal monitoring of the pregnancy. Six hundred and forty-one women were interviewed at 12-16 weeks gestation in the crosssectional Phase I study. Invitations were then accepted by 422 women to continue in the Phase II component, a prospective randomised controlled repeated measures enquiry of moods, social supports and relationship quality carried out at 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum. Women allocated to the Intervention group had a significantly lower rate of negative moods compared with the Control group. Primiparous mothers benefited especially during the antenatal phase though there was no significant difference by parity group at the postnatal assessment. Midwives reported considerable satisfaction with their enhanced clinical role. These findings support the utility and feasibility of antenatal screening carried out by midwives, of negative moods and adverse psychosocial conditions that frequently remain unnoticed yet which can be assisted with immediate counselling assistance.",

However, as critical issues are identified in the field of genetics, physical health and mental health, such as, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's, cancer and obesity, social workers need to become more informed. The National Association of Social Workers (NASW) has also recognized the need to integrate knowledge of genetics into social work practice in the context of the NASW Code of Ethics. A social worker is often the first to provide psychosocial services to individuals and families with genetic disorders. Therefore, it is imperative that social workers become more aware of the ethical, legal and psychosocial implications of a genetic diagnosis, genetic testing and genetic research in order to empower individuals and families to speak out for their rights as public citizens. NASW's Standards for Integrating Genetics in Social Work Practice are designed to enhance social workers' awareness of the skills, knowledge, values, methods, and sensitivity needed to work effectively with clients, families, health care providers, and the community and to increase their understanding of the impact that the field of genetics has, and will have, on them.

The management of bipolar women who plan to conceive or those who are pregnant or puerperal poses significant challenges for clinicians who care for these patients. Recent data suggest that pregnancy is not ''protective'' against relapse of psychiatric disorder and that for bipolar women specifically, relapse is common after lithium discontinuation. This presentation reviews the major clinical dilemmas associated with management of pregnant bipolar patients as well as recent data on the course of bipolar disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Treatment guidelines for the management of bipolar illness for women trying to conceive and during pregnancy will be presented. An algorithm for assessment of risks and benefits using both older and newer psychiatric medications across a variety of classes of compounds including antipsychotics and mood stabilizers will be presented. Given the growing use of anticonvulsants to treat bipolar illness, particular attention will be given on available reproductive safety data regarding these compounds.

There has not been broad education focusing on promoting emotional health, or campaigns to make mental health an integral part of primary care. Awareness is needed by parents, educators and health providers of ways to promote emotional health and identify early signs of problems. Barriers that exist to children receiving mental health services include stigma, access and funding. Because of stigma fears, many families fail to seek help.

Abstract: A variety of data suggest that there are differences in the frequency of reported depression and anxiety between men and women. Less is known about the gender distribution of these disorders in childhood and even less is known about the etiology of these gender differences. This talk will review the research on gender differences in depression and anxiety during childhood and discuss factors, which may contribute to the etiology of these differences.",

Porter, American Institutes for Research, Washington, DC 20007, U.S.A., e-mail: gporter@air.org Abstract: The relationship between negative life events, low socioeconomic and=or minority status and psychiatric disorders especially depression, anxiety, and conduct disorder has been well documented. There is also increasing evidence that major medical problems, myocardial infection, cancer, diabetes and hypertension as well as less significant somatic symptoms are also often associated with stressful life events, especially when they are perceived as numerous, chronic and uncontrollable. Adolescent girls consistently report higher levels of subjective distress, especially depression and anxiety than their male peers. Their rate of distress is also much higher than their parents report. They are more likely than adolescent boys to be concerned and affected by multiple problems such as health and physical development, home and family issues, physical and sexual abuse, and peer and romantic relationships. However, like boys they are also concerned about their educational and vocational futures and their adjustment to school and work. Minority girls, especially lower income African Americans living in mother headed households, report higher numbers of negative life events i.e. parental deaths, poor health, violence than their Caucasian peer. The particular adaptive or maladaptive psychosocial or coping behaviors expressed by adolescent girls in response to: feelings of depression, anxiety or anger; and negative life events are significantly influenced by the impact of their racial=ethnic identity and or minority status on their sex-role socialization. This presentation will discuss specific interventions, which can be used to help girls in general, and minority girls in particular cope more appropriately and effectively with their life events and emotional reactions. Objectives: Recognize the impact of different ethnic, political, social and cultural circumstances on the well being of selected groups of women, and take these into account when approaching the individual patient.",

The reality of a glass ceiling, where women if accepted in non traditional roles do advance only to middle management positions and are still paid only a percentage of the male salary for the same job is still pervasive. The social inertia in accepting the challenge to traditional roles is paralleled by the presence of psychological factors that complicate the women's personal struggle when pursuing leadership positions. The still frequent negative social response often confuses women's assertion with aggression and domination. Women are made to feel less feminine, less true to their gender if venturing outside of the expected roles. Minority women who migrate to a host country and pursue leadership positions in their new country face issues of cultural identity, integration of different cultural norms, competition with members of the host country which compound the already complicated issue of women venturing into leadership positions. The author will elaborate on these issues utilizing her personal experience and clinical vignettes from her professional work with women in leadership positions.

Dr. Coons rotates to different clinical practice settings where she collaborates with physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and nurses in the care of women across the life span with a host of physical, mental health and psychosocial concerns. Consultation and treatment are provided to women with depression and panic disorder; chronic and life threatening medical problems (e.g., breast, ovarian and lung cancer, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, incontinence, Interstitial Cystitis and other pelvic pain symdroms, HIV=AIDS); infertility; pre and post-partum complications; changes in sexual functioning; PMS; histories of childhood sexual abuse, sexual assault and partner violence; relationship and occupational problems; etc. The presentation will review the three interdisciplinary practice settings, collaborative assessment and treatment strategies with providers from other disciplines, successful steps in practice development in women's health care, and the benefits and challenges involved in women's health practices. Abstract: This presentation will describe a systems-oriented approach to collaboration in which the mental health professional is part of the primary care treatment system, just as the patient is part of a family. Both systems, the team and the family (broadly defined), need to be taken into consideration in formulating a comprehensive treatment plan for women in primary care. Like a family, the dynamics of a professional treatment team can involve conflict and power dynamics, as well as support and consultation. This presentation will elaborate on the cultural differences between mental health and medicine that can inhibit or prevent successful collaboration. Cases from Family Medicine, drawn from the variety of problems across the lifespan that present in that setting, will illustrate the usefulness of tending to family relationships and professional collaboration in the successful treatment of complex primary care problems for women. Abstract: Many women's primary resource for mental health care is their obstetrician=gynecologist's office, yet women's health care providers often feel ill-prepared to address the vast array of psychosocial issues facing their patients. Integration of a mental health professional into a women's health care practice can assist providers in addressing more effectively the psychosocial needs of women coping with significant life stressors, mental disorders, chronic illnesses, and interpersonal problems. Practicing as a mental health professional in obstetrics and gynecology has been valuable for the opportunities to offer psychosocial care to women and their families who may not otherwise have access to treatment, and to facilitate the education of future practicing obstetrician=gynecologists and mental health professionals. This presentation will focus on a collaborative model of practice in an academic department of obstetrics and gynecology that involves: a) education of residents and psychotherapy trainees; b) facilitation of the mental health referral process; c) consultation to the women's health care providers; and d) provision of psychotherapy to the patients and families in close collaboration with their women's health care providers. Specific strategies used for coping with challenges and enhancing the development and growth of our program will be discussed. Objectives: At the conclusion of this symposium, participants should be able to: 1) describe three models for integrating mental health and health psychology services into women's primary care and ob=gyn settings, 2) distinguish between mental health services which are co-located versus integrated into women's health care settings, and 3) identify clinical strategies utilized in collaborative care models to enhance outcomes in women's health and mental health.",

In this discussion, the role of the mental health professional working within a medical practice will be explored as well as how the collaborative role extends to working with attorneys and administration. Women and men confront emotional issues and decisions that move fluidly between the realm of medicine and psychology. The mental health professionals who work in this field must have a working knowledge of reproductive medicine in order to be effective with their patients and the medical team. The medical team is comprised of physicians, nurses, embryologists, and other medical support professionals. Mental health professionals can be working independently of the medical team in private practice or can be an employee of the medical group, health system or hospital. There are many advantages and disadvantages of being independent or employed by the medical team. Particularly in areas in which the mental health professional is screening potential volunteer candidates, s=he must be careful about establishing the role s=he is playing and remain clear that it is independent of any financial pressures of the practice.

We sought to determine whether increased frequency of maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT M) has greater prophylactic effect than once-a-month treatment. We studied 99 women with recurrent depression who remitted with weekly IPT treatment and were randomly assigned to weekly, bimonthly or monthly IPT-M for two years. Only 19 (19.2%) subjects experienced a recurrence. Mean length of survival for recurring subjects was 36 weeks. Mean recurrence-free survival for the entire sample was 84 weeks in the 104-week trial. Survival analysis by randomized treatment frequency showed no effect on recurrence-free survival. Using actual frequency of treatment attendance, survival analysis demonstrated significantly longer survival in those attending ''monthly''. We conclude that IPT-M at any of the frequencies studied provided excellent prophylaxis although the modal patient was in her fifth episode of depression and had had at least one additional episode in the 2.5 years prior to study entry. A treatment sequence of weekly IPT followed by monthly IPT-M appears to hold considerable promise of long term prophylaxis for women with recurrent depression. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation participants should be familiar with the prophylactic capacity of maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy.",

Dr. O'Hara will address issues related to the psychotherapeutic treatment of postpartum depression, reviewing the relevant research from the U.S. and Europe, with an emphasis on the use of interpersonal psychotherapy. Dr. Miranda will present results from a trial comparing pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy among impoverished women suffering from depression. Dr. Frank will present outcomes from a long-term maintenance study of women with recurrent depression that compared the efficacy of different ''doses'' of maintenance interpersonal psychotherapy.

Only in recent years has there been a concerted effort to validate specific psychotherapeutic interventions for depressed pregnant and postpartum women. Initial findings from work done in the U.S., the U.K., and Europe more generally suggest that depressed women respond well to brief psychotherapies coming out of the traditions of IPT, CBT, and Client-Centered Counseling. With a few exceptions most of the existing work has been done with middle and upper middle class women. Important questions are unanswered regarding the applicability of conventional psychotherapies to poor women whose lives and cultures are very different from the women for whom existing treatments have been validated. Current efforts to address the needs of poor depressed perinatal women XXIV include specific efforts at outreach, engaging key opinion leaders in poor communities, presenting psychotherapy in a non-stigmatizing manner, and developing capacity within poor communities to provide good mental health care. Almost 100 Healthy Start programs that serve poor communities around the U.S. have begun an effort to identify depressed perinatal women and facilitate their entry into appropriate care. These efforts are providing new qualitative data that will assist researchers and clinicians in developing more effective psychotherapeutic interventions for these vulnerable women.",

This symposium focuses on understanding points of high risk for relapse to smoking in women, and how sex differences in withdrawal can inform the development of sex-specific relapse prevention interventions. The points of high risk that will be highlighted include adolescence, periods of dysphoric mood and affect dysregulation, and periods of hormonal change. Dr. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin will present prospective data on adolescent male and female smokers that show gender differences in subjective and objective abstinence measures during acute tobacco abstinence. These sex differences extend to pain tolerance and cognitive performance as well as to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Dr. Sherry McKee will present data from a laboratory study examining how presence of dysphoric mood, as another point of high risk, and cognitive mechanisms govern sex-specific smoking behavior. Dr. David Wetter will present real-time data examining affect regulationrelated constructs and their associations to tobacco withdrawal and relapse in women undergoing a quit attempt. Dr. Sharon Allen will present data demonstrating that ovarian hormones, modulated by menstrual cycle or hormone replacement therapy, appear to influence smoking cessation barriers such as withdrawal, certain premenstrual symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Dr. Ken Perkins will be the discussant and provide a critical review of this work and this area of research. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation participants will (a) be able to recognize tobacco abstinence effects in adolescent smokers, (b) be familiar with potential gender differences in tobacco abstinence effects, and (c) understand reasons why females are more compromised by, and at a greater risk of relapse to, cigarette smoking.",

Attention is being focused on factors that increase the HIV XXVI related risks for married women in the general population living in both rural and urban settings. Data from studies conducted in India and the U.S. were designed to identify socio-cultural, relationship-specific and sexual practices that increase rural and urban married women's risks for domestic violence and HIV. The study in India as conducted in four hospitals that serve urban and rural populations free of cost in Chennai and New Delhi. There were 459 HIV positive (n \u00bc 243) and negative women (n \u00bc 216), ages 18 and older. Women were recruited by health professionals who screened, consented and interviewed them privately for one half hour in Tamil or Hindi. Univariate, multivariate and logistic regression analyses revealed few differences between women residing in rural or urban areas or culture-bound circumstances of their marriages, regardless of sero status. However, HIV positive women were more likely to live alone and have fewer children. HIV positive women also reported being forced to have sex in marriage, to be beaten by their husbands, to have more depressive symptoms, and less marital satisfaction. With regard to sex-related risks, HIV positive women were more likely to report that their husbands had sex out of marriage and used condoms less in the past 6 months. The influence of coercion rather than culture appears to be related to these married, Indian women's HIV related risks. The implications of these findings for HIV prevention interventions in India and the U.S. will be discussed.",

All parents living with HIV face challenges of: 1) maintaining their own health, 2) stopping transmission to others, 3) caring for their children while ill, and 4) maintaining positive mental health over time, despite stigma, isolation, and increasing poverty. Psychosocial programs targeting these outcomes have been successful in the developed world where governmental safety nets provide schooling, shelter, health care, and food. In South Africa, strategies for implementing psychosocial programs in combination with economic development programs are necessary. While social safety nets are key in the United States, social and economic safety nets are needed by families in South Africa.

Many women occupy jobs with high demands and low decision latitude. The aim of an ongoing population-based study was to assess the health profile of perimenopausal women in reation to psychosocial factors and perceived quality of work role. 2000 women received a health questionnaire. A subsample of 150 women of those who responded participated in a biannual follow-up including biological stress measures, completion of self-rating scales and a psychological interview focusing on health and perception of work role. Factor analyses of symptom scales yielded seven independent factors; burnout, musculoskeletal symptoms, anxiety and vasomotor symptoms explaining most of the variance. Burnout was related to low social support and low decision latitude. Vasomotor symptoms were related to having a high strain job and to postmenopausal status. The results showed that working excessive hours and receiving low social support increased women's biological stress levels. In conclusion, perceived quality of work role and degree of social support are important contributors to women's health at menopause. Increasing autonomy and social support in the workplace may be critical for preventing stress-related disorders among perimenopausal women.",

For example, substance abuse and dependence disorders occur more commonly in men while prevalence rates for unipolar depressive disorders are higher in women. Less attention has been devoted to sex differences in the prevalence, characteristics and course of anxiety disorders despite the fact that some of the most robust sex differences exist for the expression of these illnesses. Some of the better documented differences in anxiety disorders include the highly replicated differences in prevalence rates for anxiety disorders and the sex differences in clinical course of disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder. A woman's reproductive function may also influence the expression of an anxiety disorder. In this panel, sex differences in the prevalence, course and presentation of panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder will be reviewed. In addition, the impact of gonadal steroids on risk of anxiety disorders will be discussed.",

In recent years, longitudinal, prospective studies have contributed to mapping the clinical course of anxiety disorders in males and females. Several studies in adolescents document that the sex difference in illness rates begins during childhood and increase over time contributing to the overall higher illness prevalence in females. Work in adults find low rates for recovery among individuals with agoraphobia in conjunction with panic compared to uncomplicated panic. This disproportionally increases risk in women since they are far more likely to have panic with agoraphobia than uncomplicated panic. After recovering, women are more likely to relapse into panic than are men. Conversely, men may be more likely to relapse after recovering from GAD. These and other differences will be discussed during the presentation.",

Anxiety disorders are likely to involve dysfunction of brain fear circuits, potentially through abnormalities in neurotransmitter=neuropeptide activity or structural changes within the fear circuits. There is evidence that reproductive hormones can alter both neurotransmitter activity and neuronal structure, although effects of reproductive hormones within the fear circuit has not been well described. Emerging evidence from animal studies indicates that females have less severe behavioral and neurobiological changes in response to stress, despite greater and prolonged HPA axis responses to stress. These findings highlight the potential dissociation between HPA axis and behavioral=neurobiological responses to stress and suggest a potential therapeutic utility of female reproductive hormones.",

Available evidence from experimental clinical studies and from animal studies indicate that estrogen and progesterone suppress HPA axis and autonomic responses to stress. Both estrogen and progesterone also seem to have anxiolytic effects in animal models of anxiety, but effects on anxiety in humans are less clear, and may vary depending on the type of anxiety disorder. In addition, hormonal changes during pregnancy and lactation suppress stress responsivity and may also modulate the course of anxiety disorders. Several neurobiological changes which occur during pregnancy may be maintained and gradually normalized during lactation and gradual weaning, while bottle-feeding immediately postpartum or abrupt weaning may lead to disruption of physiological homeostasis and increased anxiety in vulnerable individuals. Abstract: Gender is an important, yet underexplored issue in the prevalence, etiology, presentation and treatment of PTSD. A number of epidemiologic studies demonstrate that PTSD is approximately two times as common in men as compared to women. Gender is also a factor in the type of trauma exposure and the social environment that mediates the effect of trauma. Biologic differences between men and women may moderate the impact of trauma exposure as well as the expression of PTSD symptoms. Gender differences in stress responding and the impact of hormonal fluctuation on the stress response will be reviewed. There is evidence for gender differences in response to psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic treatments. Promising future directions for investigation will be discussed. (1997) .

In comparison to men, women with OCD appear to have some unique clinical features including a later onset of illness, a more severe course, and a higher risk of comorbid depression. Gender also appears to have a signficant impact on the relative lifetime risk of occurrence of certain comorbid conditions in OCD including Tourette's Syndrome, eating disorders, and trichotillomania. Available evidence supporting a critical role for female reproductive cycle events in the onset and clinical course of OCD in women will also be covered during this presentation. As will be discussed, most of the gender differences identified in OCD are derived from relatively small and=or preliminary investigations.

The WCDV Study is a five-year (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) initiative financed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to develop, implement and evaluate gender sensitive, integrated, trauma informed services for women with cooccurring disorders and histories of violence. The study employed prospective meta analytic methods to analyze outcomes of services provided to study participants. Data were collected at baseline, and at 3,6, 9 and 12 months follow-up at nine study sites located in Culver City, CA, Stockton, CA, Thornton, Co, Washington, DC, Avon Park, FL, Boston, MA, Cambridge, MA, Greenfield, MA, and New York City, NY. Symposia speakers will present papers describing the population characteristics and study outcomes. Presenters will describe women's trauma experience and the impact of services on mental health, substance abuse and trauma symptoms. Outcomes for children of women enrolled in the study and the parenting needs of the population will be discussed along with implications for policy and practice.",

Add a substance abuse disorder and history of abuse to the mother's situation and the problems become exponential. Despite the fact that a large proportion of women receiving behavioral health services are mothers, their special needs have received very little attention. Mothers who abuse alcohol and=or drugs and have a co occurring mental disorder have historically faced almost insurmountable obstacles when attempting to voluntarily access treatment for either or both disorders. Using quantitative and qualitative data from the Women Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence (WCDV) Study this presentation will describe the parenting status and parenting support needs of women (N \u00bc 2292) with children under 18 years enrolled in the study. The relationship between current mental health symptoms, substance abuse severity, trauma and child custody status will be discussed along with the importance of children in the lives of women studied. Qualitative data will include mother's perception of services received and the things that were both helpful and hurtful to their recovery.

In addition, both vaginal dryness and pain were decreased by estrogen replacement versus placebo. Another set of trials examined the affect of testosterone replacement therapy in the estrogen replete woman. When testosterone was added to estrogen replete women, they exhibited increased clitoral sensation, orgasm, desire, libido, fantasies, arousal, pleasure=orgasm, pleasure, pleasure with masturbation, increased enjoyment, satisfaction, relevancy=importance of sexuality, sexual activity=frequency of coitus, and overall sexual function.

Bernardi Department of Reproductive Medicine and Child Development, University of Pisa, Section of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Italy, e-mail: argenazzani@tiscalinet.it Abstract: The central nervous system (CNS) is one of the main target tissues for sex steroid hormones, which act on both through genomic mechanisms, modulating synthesis, release and metabolism of many neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, and through non genomic mechanisms, influencing electrical excitability, synaptic function, morphological features and neuron-glia interactions. During the climacteric period, sex steroid deficiency causes many neuroendocrine changes. At hypothalamic level, estrogen withdrawal gives rise to vasomotor symptoms, as well as to eating behaviour disorders and altered blood pressure control. Noradrenergic, dopaminergic and opioidergic tones are involved in the control of thermoregulatory centers: a fall in opioid tone occurs in postmenopause, while a sudden increase in plasma?-EP appears during hot flushes. On the other hand, at limbic level, the changes in serotoninergic, noradrenergic and opioidergic tones contribute to the modifications in mood, behaviour and nociception. ERT positively affect climateric depression throughout a direct effect on neural activity and on the modulation of adrenergic and serotoninergic tones and may revert the decrease in cognitive efficiency observed in climaterium. On the other hand, many biological mechanisms support the evidence that estrogens protect against Alzheimer's disease by influencing neurotransmission, increasing cerebral blood flow, modulating growth proteins associated with axonal elongation and blunting the neurotoxic effects of b-amyloid. The identification of the brain as a de novo source of neurosteroids modulating cerebral function, suggests that the modifications in mood and cognitive performances occurring in postmenopausal women could also be related to a modification in the levels of neurosteroids, particularly allopregnanolone and DHEA, GABA-A agonist and antagonist, respectively. HRT is able to modify neurosteroids levels influencing allopregnanolone=DHEA ratio. These findings open new perspectives in the study of the effects of sex steroids on the CNS and on the possible use of alternative and=or auxiliary HRT. Abstract: In the first quarter of 2003, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in four European countries (Germany, Great Britain, France and Spain) to ascertain the current profile of menopausal women. A stratified sample of 8,012 women aged 45-75 years was interviewed via standardized computer-aided telephone interviewing. Quota were used as to age, regional distribution and educational level to ensure that a representative sample of women was drawn from four different survey countries. A total of 73% of all interviewed women were aware of HRT as a treatment option for menopausal symptoms, this percentage varying from 41% in Spain to 90% in Great Britain. Among non-HRT users, the proportion of women who had heard of HRT was, on average, 60%. Women were well informed about the most widely discussed benefits and risks of HRT, osteoporosis prevention and breast cancer. When it comes to less well known risk such as uterine or colon cancer, the majority of HRT users as well as never users do not appear to be adequately informed. Regarding the effect of HRT on heart diseases, the opinion of two-thirds of the women rather reflect uncertainty either due to inadequate counseling or reinforced by the ongoing scientific debate on this topic. European women do not only start HRT usage for present symptom relief, although 70% of the users state that this was one of the main reasons to XXXIV initiate therapy. They also greatly value the possibility of preventing postmenopausal osteoporosis. Both effects of HRT remain unchallenged by the results of the WHI. Maintenance or improvement of general wellbeing is also closely linked to HRT usage. There is some variability in the ranking of the main reasons to start HRT use; e.g. French women putting highest weight on the prevention of osteoporosis instead of relief of hot flushes, British women rather consider relief from depressive mood, anxiety and irritability as highest ranking, only followed by osteoporosis prevention.",

However, while these differences are significant in Germany and the UK, the scores in France and Spain are indistinguishable.

Abstract: Historically, eating disorders have been considered to be primarily of sociocultural origin. Over the past decade, this perspective has been resoundingly rebuffed by a systematic series of enlightening family, twin and molecular genetic studies. Family studies have revealed that both anorexia and bulimia are highly familial with the relative risk between 10-12. Twin studies have shown that genetic factors are strong contributors to the observed familial patterns. Several population-based twin studies conducted around the world have similarly concluded that anorexia and bulimia nervosa, as well as related phenotypes such as perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, and drive for thinness are moderately heritable. In a series of studies supported by the Price Foundation of Geneva Switzerland, our group has completed linkage studies for both anorexia and bulimia nervosa leading to the identification of areas on chromosome 1 for anorexia and chromosome 10 for bulimia nervosa which may harbor susceptibility loci for these disorders. The next stages of our research will be to further refine our search for specific genes that may influence risk for eating disorders as well as to capitalize on our genetic findings in order to develop new approaches for understanding the manner in which environment influences risk. Sophisticated approaches to unraveling gene-environment interactions and gene-environment correlations will no doubt be critical to the full understanding of the etiology of these disorders. Abstract: Few studies have examined risk factors for eating disorders using longitudinal data and existing studies typically have very small numbers of full syndrome cases. The National Growth and Health Study-Wave II was initiated to examine correlates of and risk factors for eating disorders involving binge eating as a defining symptom (bulimia nervosa, BN, and binge eating disorder, BED). Risk factor data were collected annually for ten years. Diagnosis was established retrospectively. Data were analyzed using an exploratory method, signal detection. The analysis began with all participants with relevant data, including 67 women met research criteria for BN=BED and 1575 women with no history of an eating disorder. Results suggest three risk subgroups: those (1) who had high weight concern before age 14; (2) who were less weight concerned than group 1 but reported high perceived stress; and (3) whose weight concern and perceived stress were lower than groups 1 or 2 but who reported behavior conduct problems before age 14. Limitations of the design will be discussed. Objectives: To provide an overview of CAM therapies associated with the management of menopausal symptoms; to review how botanicals and dietary supplements are different from drugs; to review the role of NCCAM in the generation of objective data on safety and efficacy; to provide an international perspective (Japanese) on the menopausal transition; and to review factors and risk for memory disorders and dementia among women in this age group.",

It is noteworthy that while the risk of dementia accelerates with increasing age, such risk increases at a higher rate for women than for men. There is substantial evidence that dementia develops over many years and is related to aberrations of fundamental, biological repair and maintenance mechanisms. However, these aberrant processes may be amenable to intervention, even in the absence of effective pharmaceutical treatments. Alterations of western lifestyle habits involving diet, physical activity, and stress potentially would prevent or forestall the development of dementia. In addition, it may be possible to intervene effectively even at the initial stage of clinically evident cognitive decline, typically designated Mild Cognitive Impairment. Aerobic exercise and supplementation with phytoestrogen agents are among a number of alternative approaches that hold promise as potential therapies for age-associated cognitive deterioration.

We have demonstrated fundamental sex differences in cocaine induced behavioral effects. For example, female rats have exaggerated behavioral responses after acute and chronic cocaine administration, sensitize faster to cocaine induced behavioral responses and maintain this sensitization longer when compared to male rats. Female rats also develop associations between environmental stimuli and cocaine's rewarding effects more quickly and at lower doses than males do. We have three major clues suggesting the contribution of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone hormones to the observed sex differences in cocaine's behavioral effects and reward. First, cocaine-induced behavioral alterations are affected by the stage of the cycle. Second, after gonadectomy, females lose their ability to sensitize faster than males after repetitive cocaine administration, and their ability to produce a strong reward association between cocaine and the environmental stimuli. Finally, estrogen replacement enhances behavioral responses to cocaine, while progesterone can block cocaine-induced behavioral responses as well as cocaine-induced reward effects. The observed sex differences and differential effect of estrogen and progesterone in cocaine responses may in part explain current sex disparities in overall cocaine use and rates of relapse. Objectives: Participants will learn about evidence for sex differences in drug abuse and some of the neurological processes that may contribute to enhanced vulnerability in women.",

Since, the luteal phase, compared with the follicular phase, is characterized by higher progesterone levels, it was of interest to examine whether the attenuation of cocaine response in luteal phase was due to the effects of progesterone. Two studies were conducted to test this hypothesis. In the first study, the effects of a 200 mg dose of progesterone treatment on cocaine response were examined in 5 cocaine dependent women. Progesterone, compared to placebo attenuated some of the subjective effects of cocaine. In the second study, the effects of progesterone treatment on the subjective and physiological effects of cocaine and cocaine self-administration behavior were examined in both male and female cocaine users. A total of 10 subjects, 6 men and 4 female cocaine users had 2 experimental sessions. Before each session, subjects received either two oral doses of 200 mg of progesterone or placebo. Progesterone treatment attenuated the rating of some of the subjective effects of cocaine. These results suggest that progesterone may have utility for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

Research shows that women report more intense responses to cocaine and MDMA than men, and that female animals may voluntarily consume more cocaine or heroin. These drugs, like all addictive drugs, stimulate the dopamine system that controls sexual behavior and voluntary movement -the system that is damaged in Parkinson's disease. They stimulate it more in females than males. Do women have a different dopamine system? Animal studies suggest that the answer is yes, and that estrogen plays a critical role. Dopamine neurons may need estrogen to survive. The daily presence of estrogen also modulates this system in more subtle ways -affecting specific neuronal processes like the release of neurotransmitter and the way neurotransmitter stimulates its targets. These effects of estrogen might increase addiction liability in women. However, they may also explain why women have less Parkinson's disease. We are working to understand these differences.

Studies from our laboratory demonstrate that in addition to the steroid hormones, intracellular steroid receptors can be activated in a ''ligand-independent'' manner by factors that can alter the dynamic equilibrium between neuronal phosphatases and kinases. Using biochemical and molecular approaches we have elucidated that the signaling cascade initiated by neurotransmitter, dopamine, converges with steroid hormone-initiated pathway to regulate neuroendocrine pathways associated with reproductive behavior. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that such functional interactions could play an important role in mediation of psychotropic effects by drugs like cocaine and marijuana. The studies suggest a high level of cross talk and reinforcement among multiple intracellular signaling pathways for the mediation of hormone-dependent behavior in mammals. The molecular mechanisms, by which a multitude of signals converge with steroid receptors to delineate a genomic level of cross talk, provide new avenues for understanding the role of steroid hormones in drug abuse. 30, 2002) .

In addition to fertility and mating, successful reproduction requires appropriate alterations in such things as food consumption, energy balance, and maternal behavior. Thus, it is not surprising that estrogen influences many neuronal functions, and that multiple cellular mechanisms have evolved to mediate these influences. Emerging evidence indicates that in addition to regulation of gene transcription, estrogen can function at extranuclear and membrane sites linked to multiple signaling cascades that elicit rapid cellular responses. The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) provides an example of an important neuronal function that is modulated by estrogen via both rapid, nongenomic actions as well as by transcriptional mechanisms. For example, estrogen decreases the abundance of SERT mRNA. In addition, estrogen rapidly decreases serotonin reuptake in cell culture systems. Serotonin reuptake modulates neural circuitry important in multiple mental health problems, including depression and the response to abused drugs. Thus, an understanding of estrogen regulation of SERT activity by fluctuations in estrogen levels throughout the female life cycle as well as under pharmacological conditions of exposure are necessary to develop rational approaches to the assessment and treatment for these psychiatric problems.

During pregnancy, women at risk of psychiatric episodes can be managed prenatally in collaboration with midwives and obstetricians. Because immigrant women may be more vulnerable for social and cultural isolation, the network for their mental health care must include ethnological and psychiatric dimensions. Pathways towards specific forms of perinatal mental health care, such as mother-baby units, depend on the national characteristics of the health care system and on the legal status of parents and children.

These psychiatric disorders may have serious consequences on the course of pregnancy and on the mother infant relationship and they require specific psychiatric management in addition to the obstetrical follow-up. The concept of pregnancies at psychological risk, based on clinical symptoms and mother's history of the mother is a useful addition to that of pregnancies at obstetrical risk. Our purpose is to present the prenatal management (screening, observation and psychiatric care) implemented in the obstetrical hospital in Lille, a city in northern France. The psychiatric intervention is designed as a part of the global management of mothers-to-be, closely tied to the care provided by midwives and obstetricians and to community services. Our experience shows the importance of this collaboration in helping these women through pregnancy, birth and the postpartum period. Objectives: The participants will be able to understand what factors are related to mother-baby separation and=or to mental health improvement after a woman and her child were admitted to a mother baby unit.",

Boundary violations of providers may range from excessive personal disclosure or ill-advised humor to romantic relationships and inappropriate touch in the clinical setting. Offenders range from those naive about the coercive influence that a health care provider can have on a patient to the sexual predator who repeatedly and deliberately takes advantage of a patient's vulnerability. Consequences of sexual boundary crossings can be severe for both the patient and the offending provider. Key suggestions for maintaining appropriate boundaries might include the following: (1) Avoid intimate relationships with people over whom you have professional influence; meet your needs for intimacy outside the practice setting. (2) Be aware of risk factors that may make you or your patient vulnerable to a boundary violation. (3) When crossing a boundary with a patient, consider the possible consequences and consider the patient's needs above your own. (4) Seek peer consultation if you are caught in an ethical dilemma; document any questionable occurrences. Timely education of health professionals about boundary management is imperative not only for prevention but for assisting patients to address alleged sexual offenses by other providers.

Central arousal may or may not be associated with genital=physiologic arousal or may be inhibited despite vaginal lubrication. Women are more likely to experience problems with physiologic arousal when post menopausal due to diminished sex steroids, and=or if a desire disorder is present. In addition, an inadequate arousal phase may limit a woman's ability to achieve orgasm. A comprehensive sexual history should include information about reproductive function including onset of puberty, history of pregnancies, and phase of the woman's menstrual cycle or peri-or post-menopausal status; age and circumstances of the first sexual experience; history of sexual abuse or trauma=assault; current relationship status, and sexual orientation. The medical and psychosocial evaluation and history should focus on conditions associated with sexual dysfunction in women, and identify any substances that might contribute to sexual dysfunction such as medications, alcohol, illicit substances, and tobacco. A focused physical examination including genital exam, neurological evaluation, and assessment of vascular function can be helpful.

The program was constructed to initiate a crosscultural dialogue so that women might move beyond their own location to understand others. The experiences of these marginalized women provide a model for inter-group exchange that might be used in research and educational settings to expand the knowledge of women and women's mental health issues nationally and internationally. Autobiography or self-story telling was employed as an analytic tool for examining one group's experiences and comparing them with others. University and students from each group met in Chennai to interview and discuss feminist issues with each other. The dialogue and story-telling proved useful as it permitted the consideration of each individual's location of gender, class, and ethnic identity. Major issues that defined commonalities across groups were: a) the importance of family support as either a protective or inspirational factor, b) coming to awareness of self in relationship to outside dominance, c) development of moral certainty and the injustices imposed by society, and d) the strategies for selfempowerment that allowed women to deal with the emotional traumas of marginality.",

Focus groups were conducted with HIV \u00fe Latinas who were asked about their HIV experience (initial reactions to their HIV status, disclosure, and coping). Twenty women from Central and South America participated in the study. Women expressed deep feelings of depression and sadness when they learned about their HIV positive status. They noted the stigma associated with HIV among Latinos, such as viewing HIV \u00fe women as prostitutes. Stigma resulted in participants' reluctance to disclose their status to family and friends, in social isolation, distress and lack of social support. Main coping mechanisms involved relying on God and prayers, using available clinical resources, and attending support groups. These women demonstrated strong resilience by focusing on the ''positive aspects'' of their condition. They felt stronger self esteem and greater appreciation for their lives and their families. They noted the importance of educating people about HIV, but fear of stigma prevented them from actively educating others. Findings highlight the need to address HIV stigma among Latinos and to develop support interventions for HIV \u00fe Latinas, especially after they learn their diagnosis. Integrated interventions that emphasize coping strategies to enhance emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being are recommended. Objectives: Participants will gain an understanding of the cultural= protective factors associated with depression among low-income Latina pregnant women, and how these factors may be targeted in preventive interventions of maternal depression.",

Risk factors for maternal depression have been well documented. However, protective factors have not been widely studied, and little is known about the impact of culture on these factors. The purpose of this study was to examine protective factors that decrease risk of developing maternal depression in a sample of low-income Latina pregnant women receiving public sector obstetrics services in Northern California. Twelve Spanish speaking women (age: M \u00bc 24.1, SD \u00bc 4.6; 68% with annual income < $10,000) classified as ''vulnerable'' to developing depression participated in two focus groups after completing a 12 week cognitive behaviorally-and developmentally-based preventive intervention of maternal depression. Focus group content were transcribed and coded for themes that enabled these women to manage their reality in a healthy and positive way. Preliminary results indicate that seeking social support from family and friends, feeling competent as mothers-to-be, and spirituality served as protective factors to facilitate positive coping and enhance mood. Implications for incorporating protective factors in preventive intervention trials of maternal depression will be discussed.

The course of the disease seems to be better in young women than in young men and in elderly women. As to pathogenesis, there is some evidence that the age difference might be due at least partly to the female sex hormone estradiol being a protective factor. Differences in course might also have to do with this biological factor, but at the same time with the psychosocial advantages of a higher age of onset and other psychosocial factors like gender differences in illness perception, in help-seeking, coping behavior and compliance, in comorbidity and, last but not least, the differing roles of men and women.",

Elevated prolactin levels suppress normal hypothalamic-pituitary activity and disrupt ovarian function with resulting menstrual irregularities, amenorrhoea, infertility and hypooestrogenism. Recent studies suggest that some schizophrenic women may have an illness-related dysfunction in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis which predisposes them to menstrual irregularities. Nevertheless prospective studies leave no doubt that prolactin-raising antipsychotics frequently cause menstrual irregularities and that these resolve on cessation of medication. Recent studies indicate that prolactin has a role in the regulation of sexual behaviour. This evidence comes from clinical observations in patients with hyperprolactinemia unrelated to drugs, from the distribution of prolactin receptors in the brain and studies in healthy volunteers. In one recent study of women treated with prolactin raising antipsychotics, prolactin levels correlated with physical arousal problems such as poor vaginal response. It should be emphasized though that hyperprolactinemia is only one of several mechanisms by which psychotropic drugs can influence sexual behaviour. Its net outcome is also dependent on other central and peripheral drug actions, the effects of premenopausal oestrogen deficiency and factors related to the psychotic illness. Management options for antipsychotic-induced endocrine symptoms will be discussed.",

However, it remains controversial whether HT use by healthy women in the menopausal transition and postmenopause increases AD risk, decreases AD risk, or perhaps even does both depending on exposure characteristics. Recent results from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study demonstrate that estrogen plus progestin in the late postmenopause significantly increases dementia incidence after exposure durations as short as one year. This finding contrasts with that of most observational studies, including research reported by us, where the association between HT and AD has generally been one of reduced risk. One difference between observational studies and findings from the Women's Health Initiative is that most HT exposure in the former occurred in younger women, often during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause. One speculative interpretation is that early HT use may be protective, whereas late HT use is harmful. However, a strong biological rationale for an early critical window is not well established, and possible bias and confounding in observational studies suggest the need for caution in the face of seemingly conflicting clinical trial data. In the clinical setting, the answer is clear: HT is not indicated for the primary prevention of AD or other dementing disorders. However, in the scientific arena, the new question arises: What is the effect of early HT exposure on AD risk?",

A number of small randomized trials of younger women following surgical menopause and larger observational studies of older postmenopausal women, including the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), suggest benefits of HT on memory. In contrast, a larger trial of combination estrogen and progestin (E \u00fe P) in older women with cardiovascular disease did not support these findings, and data from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) suggest a small detrimental effect of combination E \u00fe P on changes in a global measure of cognitive function. Prior studies were limited by small samples, women with pre-existing disease, test batteries lacking sensitivity to age and hormone effects, or observational designs confounded by the healthy user bias. WHISCA, an ancillary study to WHIMS, investigates combination E \u00fe P and estrogen alone on age-changes in specific cognitive functions and affect in women without dementia within the context of a large randomized trial. This presentation will discuss the WHISCA study design, initial results for the E \u00fe P arm of the study, and will compare findings with those from the BLSA observational studies of HT.

The purpose of this symposium is to examine factors impacting psychological wellness and resilience. The first author, Susan XLIV Nolen-Hoeksema, PhD, will examine women's relationship and the ways that close relationships act as resilience and vulnerability factors for women's mental health. Deborah Belle, PhD, will discuss the implications of poverty and economic inequality for women's well being, including coping strategies that provide women with protection from the threats to well-being caused by being poor in a wealthy nation. Charlotte Brown, PhD, will present data on the similarities and differences in African American and Caucasian women's perceptions of their identity and security at midlife. The final speaker, Jeannette Ickovics, PhD., will present data from a study of resilience factors for women with HIV=AIDS, linking psychological resources to survival and immune function. Her guiding question, and that for the panel, is what psychological resources enable individuals to deal effectively with illness and other life events.

Depressive symptoms (i.e., decreased mood, helplessness) are the most common affective symptoms reported by cancer patients, although anxiety symptoms (i.e., worry, fearfulness) are also reported. Data from two studies examining the psychological responses of women with cancer are presented. In the first study, depressive symptoms in 210 women post-surgery for regional breast cancer were examined. Approximately 20% reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. Perceptions of global stress, rumination about cancer diagnosis= treatment, and financial concerns were significantly related to increased symptoms. In the second study, depressive and anxiety symptoms in 151 women were assessed at the gynecologic oncologist consultation. Even prior to confirming a cancer diagnosis (cervix, endometrium, or ovarian), 40% reported clinically significant depressive=anxiety symptoms. Women who were older, without a partner, and had more gynecologic symptoms reported increased depression and anxiety. These studies not only highlight the psychological distress experienced by women during their diagnosis and early treatment for breast or gynecologic cancer but also the need for timely intervention if quality of life and treatment outcomes are to be improved.

Although these relationships can be important sources of support and strength in times of stress, they can also create stress in a woman's life. I will explore the ways that close emotional relationships act both as resilience and vulnerability factors for women's mental health, focusing on the associations between close relationships and depressive symptoms in a large community-based sample of women and men. Objectives: Learning objectives are to understand better the stress produced among women by poverty and by economic inequality and to under-stand better the protective factors that buffer women who are experiencing economic stress.",

Not surprisingly, poverty is also one of the most consistent predictors of premature mortality, physical illness, and depression among women. Economic inequalities within societies are also associated with reduced life expectancy and with negative physical and mental health outcomes for women. This paper will review research exploring the processes through which poverty and economic inequality take their toll, and the factors which do help to maintain the well-being of women experiencing severe economic stress. Many of the stresses of poverty, such as poor diet, inadequate medical care, toxins in the environment, inadequate housing and homelessness, can be understood as elements of sheer material hardship. Yet much poverty-related stress derives from living in a society of great inequality. Coping strategies that provide women with ways to defend themselves from stigma while building pro-active social networks appear to offer the best hope of protection from the threats to well-being of being poor in a wealthy nation.

Cognitive Adaptation Theory suggests that psychological resources enable individuals to deal effectively with negative life events and result in better health -even with major illness. The study objective was to determine whether psychological resources (positive affect, perceived control over health, finding meaning in challenging circumstances) protect against HIV-related mortality and decline in CD4\u00fe counts among 773 women with HIV from four US cities. Psychological resources were independently associated with both HIV-related mortality and time to mortality, beyond the effects of potential confounding variables such as clinical status (e.g., viral load, symptoms, antiretroviral therapy), sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, race), and depression at study entry (p < .05). Psychological resources also were associated with CD4\u00fe count decline (p < .01), serving as a possible mechanism linking resources to mortality. In summary, psychological resources may protect against HIVrelated mortality and immune system decline. Findings have implications for understanding individual variability in HIV disease progression. Moreover, because psychological resources are potentially amenable to change, results can be applied to interventions aimed at improving the physical and mental health of women with HIV.",

Neumann, Dept. of Behavioural Neuroendocrinology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, e-mail: inga.neumann@biologie. uni-regensburg.de Abstract: In the peripartum period, dramatic behavioural, physiological and neuronal adaptations occur in the maternal brain which are at least partly due to altered activation of various brain neuropeptide systems. The symposium entitled: Neuropeptide actions in the maternal brain chaired by Inga D. Neumann will focus on the most relevant neuropeptide systems at this reproductive period including oxytocin, prolactin , neuropeptide Y and leptins. Brain oxytocin exerts not only crucial functions in maternal-infant relationships, but is also involved in hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal -dependent learning and memory during motherhood (Kazukito Tomizawa). Similarly, brain prolactin also regulates the pregnancy-induced increase in neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (Sam Weiss). A critical issue of maternal stress adaptations refers to the emotional adjustment including stress-sensitivity, anxiety-related and aggressive behaviour, and brain oxytocin, CRH (Tracy Bale) and=or brain prolactin (Luz Torner) seem to be involved in these behavioural alterations seen in lactating animals. Physiologically, lactation is a state of negative energy balance which can be met by an increase in food and water intake due to dramatic changes in the activity of hypothalamic neuropeptide systems, including neuropeptide Y, and a suppression of serum leptin (SU.S.A.n Smith). Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, the participants should be able to establish a link between stress sensitivity and the development of mood disorders.",

            "text": "Abstract: Anxiety and depressive disorders are thought to be the most prevalent form of mental illness. Women suffer from depression twice as often as males. Neuropeptides such as oxytocin and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) are produced in the hypothalamus and are involved in mediation of stress inputs and homeostatic balance. Genetic and environmental factors influence the susceptibility of an individual to stress-related disorders. Specifically, strong evidence links the sensitivity of the individual to stress with the development of depression. CRF and its family of ligands and receptors (CRFR1 and CRFR2) are important regulators of stress responsivity. Mice deficient in CRFR2 show elevated anxiety-like behaviors and a hypersensitive stress response. This mouse model of high stress responsivity provides evidence of the involvement of CRF pathways in mood disorders and a useful tool for examining the neurobiology of stress-related mood disorders. Our previous studies have shown that CRFR2-deficient female mice display significantly greater levels of depression-like behaviors compared to males, and also showed a more robust response to drug treatment than males. These results support a possible increased sensitivity to dysregulation of the CRF system in females. Further studies will examine the sex differences in expression patterns of CRF and oxytocin family members.",

The hormone is essential for the induction of normal labor through uterine contraction and for normal development of offspring through lactation in mammals. We recently discover a new function of oxytocin in causing plastic changes in hippocampal synapses during motherhood. Oxytocin receptors were strongly expressed in the hippocampus of female mice. In oxytocinperfused hippocampal slices, one-train tetanus stimulation induced longlasting long-term potentiation (L-LTP) and phosphorylation of cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), and MAP kinase inhibitors blocked these inductions. An increase in CREB phosphorylation and one-train tetanus-induced L-LTP was observed in the multiparous mouse hippocampus without oxytocin application. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of oxytocin in virgin mice improved long-term spatial learning in vivo, whereas an injection of oxytocin antagonist in multiparous mice significantly inhibited the improved spatial memory, L-LTP and CREB phosphorylation. In this symposium, we will review these findings and discuss the role of oxytocin in improvement of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory during motherhood.",

PRL enters the brain by an active transport at choroid plexus cells, but is also synthesized in the hypothalamus. During pregnancy, hypothalamic PRL expression increases and becomes maximal in lactation. Downregulation of brain PRL-receptor expression via chronic infusion of an antisense probe against the long form of the PRL-receptor (PRL-R AS) in the lateral cerebral ventricle (icv) increased anxiety of lactating rats on the elevated plus-maze (p < 0.01). PRL-R AS treatment also impaired maternal behavior (p < 0.05). Further, PRL-R AS treatment increased (p < 0.05) stressinduced ACTH release, unmasking an inhibitory role of PRL on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses during lactation. PRL inhibited stress responses of the oxytocin system as evidenced by higher stress-induced (p < 0.05) plasma oxytocin concentration in PRL-R AS-treated lactating rats. Using push pull perfusion we showed PRL release within, but not outside, the paraventricular nucleus and medial preoptic area of lactating rats during suckling. Further, a significant increase of PRL mRNA (p < 0.05) in the hypothalamus 60 min after suckling, was revealed by real-time PCR. Thus, brain PRL contributes to the adaptive behavioral and neuroendocrine changes in stress responsiveness during lactation in order to support reproductive functions.",

This condition typically presents in the form of polycystic ovary syndrome, which is characterized by anovulation, excessive androgen levels and polycystic ovarian morphology. The cause-effect relationship between hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism is not entirely clear, but most evidence supports the concept that excessive levels of insulin stimulate ovarian androgen production. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia is associated with extensive metabolic alterations, including dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. All these conditions result in increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical approach to patients with polycystic ovary syndrome= hyperinsulinemia includes management of excessive androgens, management of menstrual irregularities, and evaluation and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors. Recently, several studies also demonstrated the effects of polycystic ovary syndrome on mental health. Comparison with age-matched controls has revealed that patients with polycystic ovary syndrome have significantly decreased level of social and emotional function. Psychological alterations include increased likelihood of obsessive-compulsive behavior, depression, anxiety, and aggression. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome have significantly lower self-esteem and describe the adverse effect of their health on sexual function. Studies evaluating the degree of insulin resistance among patients with polycystic ovary syndrome demonstrated a correlation between the severity of insulin resistance and depression. In view of the broad-reaching effects of insulin resistance=PCOS, management of these patients should include careful evaluation of their endocrine and metabolic status, including cardiovascular risk factors, management of presenting symptomatology, as well as assessment and management of mental health issues, especially depression, low self-esteem, and psychosexual morbidity.",

Bergemann, Department of Psychiatry, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, e-mail: niels_bergemann@med.uni-heidelberg.de Abstract: The etiopathogenesis of various postpartum psychiatric disorders' postpartum dysphoria and depression, in particular has not been clarified yet. The available data concerning psychosocial, obstetric and endocrinological variables that can predict the onset of such disorders are heterogeneous and largely contradictory. However, a few of these variables have been validated in empirical studies. Hormones, in particular, have always been considered to play an important role in the development of postpartum disorders as pregnancy and the postpartum period not only represent phases of psychosocial change and re-orientation, but also significantly affect the hormonal system. Estrogens have been considered to be an important part of this process ever since their cerebral and psychotropic effects were demonstrated in numerous, and predominantly, animal studies. In addition, psychotropic effects of estrogens have also been demonstrated in conditions such as postmenopausal depression. However, the investigation of endocinological correlates of postpartum disorders has yielded contradictory data, which, in fact, can be attributed to considerable methodological difficulties. Last but not least, the simultaneous occurrence of numerous hormonal changes may confound the importance of hormone levels in the blood. Therefore, to be able to understand the influence of hormonal change processes on the onset of postpartum disorders, intervention studies are particularly important.

The decision to terminate, never an easy one, is more complicated when there is uncertainty about the consequences of the genetic defect. Health care workers must be able to provide information and counseling to help the individual make the appropriate decision and also handle their own stress. Elective abortion is the type of pregnancy loss that garners the most controversy with one side declaring a woman's right to choose and the other claiming this is murder and will also lead to severe depression in the woman. Dr. Stotland will discuss the evidence about the psychological outcomes.

Valid studies must take into account the fact that induced abortion is more often sought in situations that are inherently stressful than in happier circumstances. They must factor in the circumstances under which the abortion is performed. In some countries, safe, affordable, and legal abortion services are difficult or impossible to access. It is difficult, if not impossible, to identify and follow an appropriate control group. Most women who have psychiatric symptoms after abortion had them before the abortion. There is no psychological evidence supporting requirements that parents be informed of or agree to abortions performed on their underage minors, or that all women seeking abortions have counseling.

In addition, the psychosocial issues facing health care providers who care for patients undergoing second trimester abortions will be addressed. Topics covered will include counseling couples prior to the termination procedure, methods of second trimester pregnancy termination including medical and surgical abortion, and counseling following the procedure. The emphasis will be on helping couples make the decision whether or not to abort and guiding them toward the most appropriate method of pregnancy termination. Helping couples to grieve and to recover from their loss will also be addressed. I will provide some suggestions on helping health care professionals cope with the stress of caring for these challenging couples.

Women in the process of miscarriage often feel sad, frightened and helpless. They may feel guilty, wondering what they had done to cause the loss. Following the loss, women grieve for the child they will not have. They are also frequently fearful of never having a child. Especially in the first six months following the loss, there is an increase in depressive symptoms. The extent of the grieving appears to be independent of the length of gestation.",

            "text": "Abstract: The deleterious effects of cigarette smoking impact nearly 60 million Americans and tobacco-related illness remains the United States' leading cause of premature and preventable mortality. Voucher-based reinforcement therapy (VBT) is an effective behavioral strategy for reducing drug, alcohol and cigarette use that has not been widely studied in pregnant and parenting female substance abusers. While the cost of VBRT rewards has limited its dissemination, obtaining VBRT incentives through donations may be one way to overcome this barrier. Data from an ongoing, randomized controlled clinical trial of community-financed VBT for reducing cigarette smoking in urban, minority, low income, pregnant, postpartum and parenting substance abusers in two South Central Los Angeles community treatment programs are described. The VBT program incentives are supported entirely by donations from the local community and private corporations. Two-thirds third of a planned 90 women have been randomized to date for this 30 week study. They average 33 years old, have given birth about 5 times each, have smoked for about 19 years, and at intake had a mean carbon monoxide breath level of 17 ppm and smoked about 9.5 cigarettes=day. Two VBT conditions are being compared to a control group. In the VBT conditions, participants earn 10-point vouchers on a fixed-ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement for providing breath carbon monoxide levels <8 ppm or carbon monoxide levels <8 ppm and urine samples negative for illicit drugs during 3 data visits per week. Each voucher point can be exchanged for about 2 worth of goods or services in on-site clinic stores stocked entirely by donations. Outcome measures of carbon monoxide levels, attendance, voucher earnings and spending patterns, during the study and at follow-up will be discussed as well as the fund raising strategy used to garner donations for the VBT program. Results to date suggest that carbon monoxide levels decreased relative to baseline by about 30 to 40% in the experimental groups compared to a 10% decrease in the control group. Donations in excess of 160,000 have been received to date. Our study suggests that community-sponsored VBT programs may be an effective and feasible approach to providing relatively high magnitude, voucher-based reinforcement therapy for substance abuse treatment. L Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, participants will have gained understanding of the issues surrounding the treatment of pregnant opioid dependent women using buprenorphine and increased knowledge regarding the neonatal abstinence syndrome associated with prenatal exposure to opioid agonist pharmacoterapies. Additionally, participants will learn about the comprehensive services needed to effectively improve the treatment of this special population.",

Among the vast array of anxiety provoking decisions these women face, we will explore one of the most commonly encountered decisions: whether or not to have an amniocentesis. Today, two of the major types of screening for women in their second trimester are maternal age and maternal serum screening. While women in both groups may have an identical numerical risk for an identical indication (fetus at risk for Down syndrome), their levels of anxiety are often very different. Overall, women referred with an indication of advanced maternal age seem to have less anxiety when compared with women referred after receiving abnormal maternal serum screening results.

A depressed mother's lowered response to her infant has a detrimental effect on the infant's development, cognitive development, interactions and attachment style. It can also affect older siblings as the children of depressed mothers function less optimally socially, personally and behaviourally.",

All these, in turn, make the process of finding and keeping a stable partner difficult. Women, on the other hand, with a later age of onset and better social functioning are more likely to be separated=divorced, with children, have multiple heterosexual relationships, at high risk for HIV and other STDs, victims of abuse and violence and high users of the rehabilitation system.",

The patient is, however, left in her natal home. The marriage of other siblings, poverty or other stressors make the task of caring more burdensome. The female patient with schizophrenia is more likely to be abandoned, often in a religious healing center or left wandering on the street and is a victim of abuse and violence. With no alternate social support systems and the absence of adequate safe shelters, the mental hospital data in India show that women with mental illness have a longer duration of stay.

Women or their proxies (for the femicide victims) were inerviewed by telephone. Cases included 220 femicide victims and 845 women who served as abused (N \u00bc 427) and nonabused (N \u00bc 418) controls. Women in the control group were identified through random stratified digit dialing from the same metropolitan areas as the femicide cases.The Conflict Tactics Scale was used to identify abused women. This analysis focuses on the women in the control group. The interview schedule included questions regarding sociodemographic status, relationship characterisctics, weapon availability, drug use, psychological abuse, and responses to standardized instruments such as the Danger Assessment and the Harassment Scale. The questions on psychological abuse were based on those used in the Canadian Violence Against Women Survey. After conducting a multiple logistic regression analysis, the two variables representing women's characteristics were younger age and mental health where women who believed they had fair or poor mental health were 3.36 times more likely to be abused compared to the non-abused group. Partner risk factors independently associated with abuse included having no job, not being a high school graduate, being in fair or poor mental health, and having a problem with alcohol use. Relationship variables observed to be significant included an annual family income of less than $15,000 and the man being a former partner. These results emphasizes the importance of screening for IPV in all settings for both men and women particularly in mental health settings.",

Even so, suicide must be considered since it is an additional potential source of mortality for female abuse victims. The proportion of abused women who said they had attempted or seriously considered suicide was 6% among the 310 femicide victims (according to a proxy informant), 8% of the 183 attempted homicide victims, and 9% of the 324 randomly sampled abused controls. Among these 81 suicidal women, 28.4% were African American, 28.4% were Latina, 34.6% were anglo, and 8.6% were of other ethnic backgrounds, representing a lower proportion of African American women than in the sample overall. About 38% of the suicidal abused women had some college education while approximately 33% were not high school graduates and 45.7% were employed. Of the abused women who were suicidal, 19% had sought help for the violence they had experienced, including 47.6% who were seen in the mental health system during the year before they were killed. There was a significant association between severity of IPV and suicidality among these women. Using multivariate logistic regression we examined the risk factors for suicidality among the 324 abused women, a population based sample. Among risk factors tested were demographics and history of substance abuse of both partners, frequency and severity of stalking and harassment, and severity of violence. Significant predictors were a highly controlling partner, increasing severity of abuse, abuse during pregnancy, and male partner's threats to kill. The results of this analysis support routine screening for IPV in health care and women's substance abuse treatment settings with assessment for suicidality among women identified as battered, and assessment for suicidality in all domestic violence service agencies.",

            "text": "Biological aspects of sexual function in women at mid-life Abstract: There are a number of biological changes that occur as a result of decreased estradiol production which accompanies aging in women. In the vagina there is decreased elasticity, speed and volume of lubrication and vaginal expansion. Fewer orgasmic contractions occur. Overall, these changes result in a decreased intensity of physiological response and decreased rapidity of sexual response. Atrophy of the vagina due to decreased estrogen production can result in dysparuenia, vaginismus and avoidance of intercourse. There may also be postcoital dysuria or incontinence which further inhibits sexual interest. Androgens also play a role although there is no clear relationship between the levels of circulating androgen and sexual desire or frequency of sexual activity. Abstract: This workshop will integrate the latest information on the biology of sexuality in women in midlife with the important social and psychological determinants of sexual function and satisfactions. This has been an area of interest recently because of increased information about the importance of the special aspects of female sexual arousal and function and the controversies surrounding estrogen treatment. Women's sexuality has some factors that are different from male sexuality. The relationship context, emotional attunement, sensitivity of the partner and factors that are more general than the focused genital responses of males have been noted. Availability of partners is an important determinant for midlife and older women. These factors will be discussed. Both male and female sexual function are affected by physical and mental health including depression.",

Social expectations about women's mid-life sexuality vary widely from one society and subculture to another, and over the course of history. In most cultures, it is young women who are viewed as objects of sexual desire. Interpersonal sexual expression is largely dependent on the availability, expectations, personal characteristics, and sexual interest and sensitivity of one or more partners. Some mid-life women have male partners whose sexual performance and interest have declined with age, illness, or disability. The advent of medications and surgical techniques enabling formerly impotent men to have intercourse requires adjustments on the part of their female partners. Women who lose partners by separation, divorce, or death face an ever-decreasing pool of potential new partners. When they do find partners, they may find their adult children either supportive or disapproving. Mid-life women may find that their physicians assume that they are sexually inactive and are neither knowledgeable nor comfortable discussing their sexual concerns. A knowledgeable and comfortable clinician can play a major role in facilitating the healthy sexual adjustment of mid-life women.",

Those presenting with these disorders are often alexithymic, which suggests that the alexithymic personality may also be more common in women than men. The purpose of this paper is to explore possible reasons for this gender disparity from a feminist perspective. The development of alexithymia is often understood via attachment theory, which posits that mis-attunements during the separationindividuation process of infant development, particularly during the language acquisition stage, preclude the ability to linguistically process affective experience. Although it is often theorized that alexithymic women who somaticize affect and self-soothe through addictions to food or other substances experienced such dysfunctional attachment, there remains a lack of understanding as to why these patterns are more common in women. Several feminist theorists maintain that socio-cultural factors shape the ways in which mothers attach to their infant sons and daughters. These theories are discussed in order to elucidate how particular cultural contexts may influence these interpersonal processes and the subsequent development of psychosomatic disorders in women. Suggestions for future research and examples of the author's own research with alexithymic=bulimic women will also be presented.",

A blocked, randomized design study was conducted that included a baseline and follow-up interview with 41 female drug-involved offenders. In addition, official drug test and arrest records on this sample were collected. Preliminary examinations indicate that females who participated in the seamless system of care and completed treatment were more satisfied with their treatment experience and were more likely to feel they received fair treatment by their supervision officer -factors correlated with reduced recidivism, drug use, and improved employment outcomes. Additionally, these women also showed the most improvement in increasing their drug avoidance self-efficacy.

Kessler, R. C., Nelson, C. B., McGonagle, K. A., et al. (1996 . The epidemiology of co-occurring additive mental disorders: Implications for prevention and service utilization. American Journal of Orthopsychiat y 66 (1) Abstract: Mental health providers acknowledge the importance of life's developmental stages and differences in gender. From adolescence to adulthood is a stage of rampant with developmental and emotional changes, especially for females. Panic disorders, depression, phobias, eating disorders and anxiety disorders are all more common among females. ''I am nothing'' and ''I am bad or wrong'' are core beliefs that have been identified among female survivors of childhood abuse who are in recovery. Experiences of feeling inconsequential include not feeling protected, not being believed when relating the abuse, being told lies to conceal the abuse, and not being prepared for life's transitions. When victims feel ''bad,'' they are saying that experiencing emotions is equated with trouble. This can lead to shutting down, social isolation and self-medication to ease the psychic pain. However, females who use alcohol and other illicit drugs internalize negative attitudes and lead to even more attendant problems, thereby avoiding help and treatment. But, hope is omnipresent as Kessler and others have referred to the ''window of opportunity'' to prevent co-occurring disorders. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has articulated the problem and identified evidence-based, gender-specific, preventive and treatment strategies that can be utilized by consumers, communities, and providers.

The Network is primarily used for the rapid exchange of information regarding research, practice development and education, for accessing subject expertise and for determining professional trends and gaps in services. It further serves as an excellent UK wide forum of professionals willing to support new programmes by piloting them with professional and client groups. The Network was launched in June 2001. Since then outcomes, some of which will be discussed, have included: The development of national guidelines for use of the EPDS as part of a mood assessment, 3 national conferences, development of a set of posters in 6 languages encouraging depressed mothers to self refer, publication of a set of picture booklets in Urdu, Bengali, Chinese, Arabic and Somali promoting the discussion of issues relating of emotional health with non English speaking mothers and other publications. Forum members have provided expertise to many national initiatives in the UK.",

Twin psychometric scales for rating irritability were developed at the Women's Health Concerns Clinic, St. Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, Ontario. The scales were constructed using items derived from spontaneous descriptions of irritability by patients and healthy controls, and some items from existing measures of irritability. Following a pre-test, the scales were reduced to the core items (annoyance, anger, tension, hostile behaviour, sensitivity) of irritability. The reliability study for the 14-item Self-Rating (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc 0.9257; mean inter-item correlation \u00bc 0.4690) and the 5-item Observer-Rating (Cronbach's alpha \u00bc 0.7418; mean inter-item correlation \u00bc 0.3616) scales showed evidence for internal consistency and test-retest reliability (rs \u00bc 0.704, p \u00bc 0.01) in a relatively homogeneous sample, and 100% inter-rater agreement for 4 of 5 core items. There is early evidence that irritability is a distinctive phenomenon and that the measure can detect change in clinical status. The Born-Steiner Irritability Scale is poised to fill a significant gap in the assessment of emotional disturbances in women related to reproductive cyclicity. There will be a brief outline of the treatment implications and future studies. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, participants should be able to (a) report two indications of the prevalence; (b) describe demographic and clinical associated features; and (c) diagnose premenstrual exacerbation of depressive disorders.",

The essential feature of PMDD, persistent cyclic severity of mood-related symptoms, appears related to past depression. Despite theory suggesting otherwise, there was little evidence that PMDD is related to panic or posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants' recollection that premenstrual disorders started at an earlier age than depressive disorders started may suggest that premenstrual disorders represent a causal risk factor for depressive disorders, but longitudinal studies are needed to test this hypothesis. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, participants should be able to state (a) evidence regarding possible predictors (e.g., oral contraceptive use) of PMDD; (b) whether the DSM-IV criterion of functional impairment excludes women from the diagnosis; and (c) whether criteria for PMDD identify females with a disorder that is distinct from other psychiatric disorders.",

The purpose of this study is to identify multiple commonly-occurring factors shared by mentally-ill filicide offenders, in order to identify potential risk factors that may be present in parents planning to kill their children. We hypothesized that parents who murdered their children and committed suicide or were Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity would have the following clustered factors: severe mental disorder, prior contact with mental health professional, severe depression, past suicide attempts, psychotic features, history of abuse=neglect eglect as child, poor social support, and over-attachment to the child. A retrospective review of coroner and state hospital charts looked at sixty factors, some of which were demographic and some of which were suspected risk factors. Research is in progress, and this poster will present data from this ongoing project examining filicide. Through careful examination of shared characteristics, clinicians may be assisted in assessment of filicide risk, as traditional risk factors for violence appear different than risk factors for mentally-ill filicides. Abstract: Purpose: A Regulator mothering orientation (Raphael-Leff, 1993) increases the risk of early postnatal depression (Sharp & ramwBell, 2001 ). The present study tested the hypothesis that greater directional discrepancy between antenatal expectations and subsequent experiences (E-E) of childbirth in particular, would predict postnatal depression symptoms (PND) in women with a Regulator orientation (interaction effect).",

However, the dearth of related research in Turkey makes it difficult to assess the dimensions and the impact of the problem. The aim of this study is to investigate the basic characteristics related to eating behaviors in a group of university students. 450 consecutive students registering at Istanbul University were given a questionnaire including sociodemographic features, body image and eating habits. Mean age was 19 and half of the students were females. Average BMI was 21 kg=m 2 and 10% had BMI < 18, mainly consisting of girls (73%). 15% of whole group reported as feeling overweight and 65% of them were also girls. Induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic use, exercising was reported by 7%. Binge eating was reported by 21%. There were differences between female and male students with respect to perceiving themselves as overweight (F \u00bc %20.9, M \u00bc %10.7; X 2 \u00bc 8.08, p < 0.01), dieting (F \u00bc %27.4, M \u00bc %3.3; X 2 \u00bc 47.3, p < 0.001), presence of weight-losing periods with dieting (F \u00bc %12.1, M \u00bc %2.8, X 2 \u00bc 13.02, p < 0.001). There is a tendency among young women towards strict dieting and having discomfortable feelings about their body image, although the prevalence in our study is lower compared to that of western studies. Objectives: For this overall symposium, we aim that those attending will develop a deeper appreciation of the benefit of being able to use all existing PPD paradigms flexibly.

            "text": "Abstract: PPD can be conceptualized from several different perspectives, with the main paradigms arguably being biomedical, psychological, sociocultural and feminist. There has been an upsurge of research from all these angles in PPD in recent years but each paradigm needs to have replication of its key findings. No studies adequately address all these domains of interest simultaneously. Each paradigm can justify its methods and its underpinning data post hoc; each can and often does mount criticisms against the others. Yet the clinicians dealing with women who have PPD need to be able to hold all paradigms in their minds and move flexibly between them when planning a comprehensive management package for the distressed PPD individual before them. These conceptual tensions will be outlined in the introductory presentation and themes outlined will be echoed in the subsequent presentations. The presenters are experienced Canadian clinicians and researchers who work daily with PPD. We want to promote the idea that practitioners and patients=clients alike will benefit from appreciating the breadth of ideas about PPD. No paradigm should be rejected as irrelevant. Education to ensure this broad, inclusive approach is often necessary with patient=clients lients as well as health policy makers. There is much yet to do. Objectives: To review feminist and sociocultural conceptualizations of postpartum distress and postpartum depression. Abstract: Feminist critics of modern Western medicine argue that the prevailing influence of predominantly middle-class, Caucasian men has resulted in health care practices and policies that do not serve the interests of women. Specifically, traditional clinical and research practices have marginalized women on the basis of ethnicity, class, age, or other characteristics. Feminist theorists have criticized, in particular, the biomedical model of postpartum depression (PPD) for its emphasis on hormones, which they argue pathologizes women's normal reproductive biology. Instead, some feminists consider PPD to be a justified response to social values and structures that put women at a disadvantage. In particular, the myth of the ''good mother'', which isubiquitous in Western media, may lead to expectations that mothering behaviours will come naturally and will always be enjoyable, and to beliefs that mothers should be essentially the sole caregivers for their infant, not wanting or needing the help of partners or other family members. This presentation will review feminist perspectives on PPD and will examine whether these theories are supported by what is known about prevalence and antecedents of PPD in non Western societies. Preliminary data from an ongoing qualitative study of women who have sought care for PPD and who are recent immigrants to Canada will be presented.",

Postpartum Depression can have severe long-term consequences for both mother and infant yet knowledge of the etiology remains at the theoretical level. Although treatment is paramount, clinicians had little empirical evidence until recently to guide their treatment decisions. Currently, this area is receiving wider research attention and although more is urgently needed, there are now studies to base treatment decisions. Moreover, expert consensus guidelines have been developed. This presentation will briefly outline key current biomedical theories of Postpartum Depression and then evaluate and review all the current antidepressant clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of Postpartum Depression. Although the hormonal fluctuations that occur following childbirth are thought to be important, studies have failed to identify an etiological role. Treatment studies evaluating the use of hormones will also be examined. The expert consensus guidelines will be discussed in relation to the current empirical evidence.",

Abstract: Background: Attachment theory and research have focussed on unresolved loss in childhood as a basis for later depression. However poor parental care and child sexual abuse, and not parental loss, have emerged as the most consistent predictors of adult depression. The 'U' classification in the AAI combines lack of resolution of loss and of trauma, and hence may conflate different processes.",

The CECA assesses a range of positive and negative childhood experiences, and differs from the AAI in using multiple detailed questions and requiring examples of behaviours for rating.

Child sexual abuse was elicited in 16 AAI interviews, which means that 10 women reported CSA in the CECA but not the AAI. The 3-way classification of the AAI was 25 secure, 15 dismissing or preoccupied, and 12 unresolved with respect to loss or trauma.

Lack of resolution of mourning and of trauma may represent different processes, and hence should be analysed separately. The majority of reported perpetrators of CSA are not attachment figures, and so it cannot be assumed that lack of resolution of trauma assessed by the AAI reflects exclusively attachment processes.

Prior studies reported that carveouts reduce treatment duration, although some reported that increased numbers of people enter treatment after a carve-out. Concern exists that carve-outs lead to undertreatment, and hamper coordination of psychiatric and other medical care. In addition, carve-outs may have differential effects on women's mental healthcare. There are well-documented epidemiologic disparities between genders, with unipolar depression and anxiety disorders twice as prevalent in women. Women's care is more fragmented during their childbearing years when vulnerability to mood disorders is highest. Given women's differential behavioral health characteristics and needs, there may be gender differences in how carve-outs affect: 1) access to any specialty care, and 2) intensity of treatment. In addressing these questions, this study benefits from interview data collected in three waves on a random community sample of adults living in low-income areas of Puerto Rico, where a carve-out was implemented across regions in stages. Respondents' mental health was assessed using standardized diagnostic instruments. They were asked about recent outpatient services utilization as well as their self-perception of mental health. Data collection began in 1992, before the introduction of managed care, and continued until 1998, when approximately two-thirds of the island's population were enrolled in carve-out plans. Preliminary results indicate that there appears to be a gender difference in the intensity of service use after the carve-out, with women's use per user declining more than men's.",

This presentation will consist of three parts. Part 1 provides a brief explanation for the supposition that gonadal steroid hormones can affect the NSDA system. From these findings emerged the hypothesis that E may function as a neuroprotectant of the NSDA system. In Part 2, we show results from a series of studies which demonstrate the conditions under which E, as well as the anti-E, tamoxifen, can exert this capacity. Finally, in Part 3, we present data which indicate a mechanism by which E can serve to preserve neurodegeneration within the NSDA system. 196-206. Ernst, M. et al. (2002) .

This study investigated the ability of endogenous progesterone to modulate the effects of smoked cocaine in ten non-treatment seeking female cocaine smokers.

All women had normal ovulatory menstrual cycles ranging from 25 to 36 days. During the follicular phase that micronized progesterone was administered, mean progesterone levels were 6.6 ng=ml. Similarly, during the normal luteal phase mean progesterone levels were 7.2 ng=ml. Overall, micronized progesterone produced minimal changes in blood pressure or heart rate. ''Good Drug Effect,'' ''Drug Quality Ratings'' clusters and ratings of ''High'' were decreased during the follicular phase when progesterone was administered compared to the normal follicular phase, particularly after 25 mg cocaine. There was no evidence of side effects from micronized progesterone. These preliminary results indicate that exogenously administered progesterone during the follicular phase blunts the response to smoked cocaine in females.",

This study examines whether ISO alters cocaine's acute effects in adult female rats during different estrus stages. Litters were assigned to ISO (individual isolation; 1 hr=day; Postnatal days 2-9) or non-handled conditions and to one of four experiments. In Experiment 1, proestrus or estrus female rats were administered one of three cocaine doses (0, 5, 10 mg=kg) and activity monitored for 40-min. In Experiment 2, rats maintained on a fixed-ratio 15 schedule of food reinforcement were administered cocaine (0.3-30 mg=kg). The effects on response rates were determined in female rats during proestrus, estrus, and diestrus. In Experiment 3, proestrus or estrus female rats were administered cocaine (10 mg=kg) and plasma collected 15-min later. In Experiment 4, the estrus stages of female isolate and non-handled rats were tracked for 16 days. Cocaine induced dose-related increases in horizontal activity except in estrus non-handled females. Scheduled-controlled responding increased above baseline at the lowest cocaine doses in non-handled females during proestrus and diestrus but decreased during estrus. ISO blunted this estrus stage distinction leading to similar dose response functions across estrus stages. There were no significant estrus cycle or ISO effects on plasma cocaine levels but ISO tended to decrease the length of the diestrus stage. Results show that the estrus cycle stage modifies cocaine's acute behavioral effects and that these are attenuated by early life stress. Support: Donaghue Medical Research Foundation.",

This personality disorder has many features that are socially impairing ie. unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, affective instability, inappropriate intense anger, and that strongly alter quality of life ie. chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance, transient stress related paranoid ideation, self mutilation and=or suicidal behaviour Majority of personality disorder are young adult women. Therefore women with BLPD diagnosis are physiologically susceptible to undergo pregnancy and childbirth. However BLPD is not screened for during pre or immediate postpartum. BLPD is also linked with maternal history of child abuse and neglect. Assessing BLPD during pregnancy becomes a public mental health issue. Pregnancy and motherhood are optimal situations for screening and implementing therapeutic management for any disorder. We will review 30 cases of mothers with BLPD diagnosis and specific psychiatric perinatal management of such mother and infant cases. Mother infant interactions of BLPD have shown intrusiveness and distorsion. A specific program designed by our clinic to address these issues including treatment of maternal personality, mother infant relationship as well as body therapy for infant will be described. Objectives: To determine what psychological conditions during pregnancy are susceptible to be important for pregnancy, childbirth and mother-infant interaction outcome Abstract: A strong relationship exists between psychological condition of pregnancy, especially stress and depression and that of the postpartum period. Moreover, these prenatal conditions have a proven impact on physiological conditions of pregnancy, probably on the newborn's vigilance system by modifying hypothalamic-pituitary reactivity and an indirect effect on mother-infant interaction. Many studies on postnatal depression have shown a relationship between postpartum depression and infant cognitive outcome. However early intervention programs do not seem to have proven any difference in the risks that depression has for the child's development. It is a likely hypothesis that this relative inefficacy is linked with the tardiness of the interventions involved. They are unable to modify the conditions of foetal development and unable to durably transform the quality of interactions that will be established during the first months and that seem to be at the origin of patterns of communication and stable representations. We will present a prospective cohort study of 632 women establishing links between prenatal depression and anxiety and physiological and psychological factors such as preterm labor, eating disorder, anxiety and depression.

Several studies have reported high prevalence rates of anxiety and depression in this population. The presentation will discuss significant findings from three studies carried out by the authors at an assisted reproduction center in Bombay. These studies evaluated the prevalence of depression and anxiety in couples presenting for IVF and reported a high prevalence of depression and anxiety in this population. In one study which evaluated 30 consecutive couples, 40% of the study group met DSM-IV criteria for an axis I mood or anxiety disorder: 15% had major depressive disorder, 18.3% had dysthymic disorder, and 6.7% had an anxiety disorder. Women had a significantly higher prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders compared to men regardless of the etiology of infertility. However, men had a depressive or anxiety disorder only in the presence of a male factor as the etiology for infertility. Suicidal ideation was present in 30% of the study group, and was reported by significantly more women (50%) than men (10%). Across all scales, the factors of anxiety, depression and somatization were significantly higher than other factors. Seventy percent of couples had at least one partner with a psychiatric diagnosis. Another study covering 105 couples had similar findings. Objectives: 1. Demonstrate a knowledge base useful in clinical practice regarding the complex developmental process of families in a pregnancy following a perinatal loss. 2. Differentiate between unrecognized feelings of grief and symptoms of PTSD seen in parents in a subsequent pregnancy after a loss and identify interventions to help prevent PTSD. 3. Differeniate between prenatal attachment and unresolved grief in families and the need to address these differences to alleviate attachment disorders in the subsequent child.",

Little attention has been directed towards understanding the effect colic can have on maternal mental health. A woman's sense of competence and self-esteem is often compromised when she feels she is not effectively meeting her infant's needs. Sleep deprivation, stress, anxiety, depression and strained marital relationships are symptoms associated with mothers whose infants have colic. Utilizing a family centered, multidisciplinary team approach the Infant Behavior, Cry, and Sleep Clinic has worked with over 500 families whose infants experience extreme colic. Our focus is on identifying and treating causes of infant irritability alleviating maternal distress and promoting healthy parent-infant relationships. Mothers are treated as playing a pivotal role in alleviating their infants distress, provided the opportunity to discuss the effect their infants' difficulties have on them, given developmental information that often legitimizes their concerns and validates their feelings and available social supports are explored. This presentation will explain the clinic's design and treatment strategies and provide information about mothers' attempts to cope with colic as illustrated with clinical case examples.",

Traumatic events have a significant negative impact on the individual and the community. They are associated with increased medical and psychiatric comorbidity, including depression, substance use disorders, and anxiety disorders, in particular, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a highly prevalent, chronic and disabling disorder, with a reported prevalence of 7.8% in the general population. It is associated with increased comorbid psychiatric illnesses, impairment in physical health, substantial psychosocial dysfunction and an increased risk of suicide. PTSD has been found to respond modestly well to psychosocial as well as pharmacological intervention. Gender differences exist in the liklihood of traumatic exposure and the subsequent risk of developing PTSD. Women are more likely to report rape, sexual molestation and childhood physical abuse. They are approximately twice as likely to develop PTSD following traumatic exposure as men (1, 2) . The presentation will discuss exposure to traumatic events and trauma-related disorders in women. It will further focus on PTSD in women, including gender differences in clinical presentation, course and treatment of PTSD. The cultural aspects of PTSD in women will be discussed. In addition, findings from a study assessing the prevalence of PTSD in survivors of an earthquake will be discussed. The presentation will aim for a comprehensive coverage of this increasingly recognised and treated disorder.",

Learn alternative treatment strategies for use in women with trauma and psychiatric symptoms, and therefore decrease potential for substance use 3). Understand the benefits of integrating treatment for co-morbid substance abuse and psychiatric disorders Abstract: Despite the high rate of comorbidity of PTSD and substance abuse, most clinical programs treat PTSD or substance abuse, but rarely both. Many clinicians are trained to insist on abstinence first, yet being abstinent from substances does not resolve PTSD and some symptoms may worsen with abstinence. Most of the research that currently exists on PTSD has focused on male combat veterans, and recent efforts directed toward the treatment of women have tended to focus on recovery from acute trauma rather than chronic PTSD. Traditional means of treatment delivery to this population often fail to retain subjects due to unstable treatment alliances, multiple crises, erratic attendance and relapse. Alternate means of delivery are needed to reach this difficult-to-engage and retain population. Clinicians, researchers, and patients support an integrated model and view treating both disorders concurrently as more likely to succeed, more cost effective, and more sensitive to patient needs. According to Courtois (1999) in Women's Mental Health; A Comprehensive Textbook, psychoeducational groups that takes a structured, cognitive behavioral approach to teaching patients about the effects of trauma and PTSD symptom management techniques are being more frequently used by clinicians and show promise. In one study, in vivo exposure-based techniques, once a more predominant treatment for PTSD, showed marked decompensation rates when used to treat PTSD symptoms. Other therapies used in this study reduced PTSD symptoms nearly 50% more than the control group. According to Ritvo et al. (2003) who support the use of cognitive-behavioral techniques to treat substance abuse states the most important components in addiction are the powerfully held, distorted beliefs that drive unfortunate choices. Foa and colleagues (1991) note that Stress Inoculated Treatment (SIT), a cognitive-based approach which includes education, skill building, and application, was effective in treating fear, anxiety, tension, and depression in those with PTSD, and also that the SIT approach was indicated to be the most effective treatment of those assessed in the study for PTSD at immediate follow-up.",

Participants will be familiar with postpartum depression rating scales in general and in the symptom presentation of postpartum women. The utility of and implications for a partner rating scale will be discussed. Abstract: Although there are self-report and clinician-rated measures of depressive symptomatology suitable for use with postpartum women, no measure exists that provides for the partner's rating of the woman's depressed mood. The partner's perceptions of women's postpartum depression symptomatology could be useful in 1) corroborating women's self-report 2) detecting additional symptoms, and 3) as a psychotherapeutic tool.",

To address questions of reliability and validity of the EPDS-P, 101 couples were given multiple measures of depressive symptomatology, marital adjustment, and postpartum adjustment on several occasions from two days to six weeks postpartum. The reliability of the EPDS-P, evidenced by the measure's test-retest stability over a 4-week period and internal consistency was established. Substantial concurrent and predictive validity were found. The EPDS-P showed incremental validity over and above EPDS scores in predicting the woman's depressive symptomatology. Factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure for both the EPDS-P and the EPDS. Results supported the use of the EPDS-P as a valid partner-rating of postpartum depression.",

By the end of 2002, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 19.2 million women were living with HIV=AIDS worldwide, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the 38.6 million adults living with HIV=AIDS. Through the end of 2001, 141,048 adolescent and adult women in the United States were reported as having AIDS. Based on cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through December 2001, more than 49,226 women have been infected with HIV. Among adolescent and adult women, the proportion of AIDS cases more than tripled from seven percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 2001. Nonetheless, AIDS cases in adolescent and adult women have declined by 17 percent and have plateaued in the past 3 years, reflecting the success of antiretroviral therapies in preventing the development of AIDS.",

Participants were recruited to three groups according to family religion: 48 Muslims, 46 Hindus, 76 Christians. Hindu and Muslim participants were almost exclusively of Asian ethnic origin, whilst Christian respondents were 'white' British.Results: Showed significant between-group attitudes in attitudes but also experience. Briefly, the Hindu and Christian groups were found to be at opposite ends of a continuum of attitudes and experience and the Muslim group to fall somewhere in the middle. A similar trend was found for the relationships between attitudes and menstrual distress.",

Ethnic origin is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes and of the ways in which well-being and distress may be expressed. This study highlighted that family religion, a 'cultural' rather than 'ethnic' difference, can be more relevant. Literature References: Gross, K., Wells, C., Radigan-Garcia, A.,Dietz, P. (2002) .

The large (n \u00bc 25, 116) and demographically representative sample includes women from varying economic and ethnic groups. Low mood was assessed with one item: ''have you felt sad or miserable much of the time over the past two weeks'' which was positively endorsed by 16% of the women.Results: Bivariate analyses revealed that marital status, ethnicity, educational level, and income were associated with the presence of low mood. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses indicated that even after controlling for these other demographic variables, ethnicity was a significant predictor of low mood. Specifically, in comparison to Caucasian mothers, a significantly lower percentage of Asian and Hispanic mothers reported low mood. In contrast a significantly higher percentage of African-American mothers reported low mood as compared to Caucasian mothers.Conclusion: These results suggest that Hispanic and Asian cultures provide protective elements for the mental health of postpartum women and that African-American women are a particularly vulnerable group. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation, the participants will:1. be able to identify the diferent components of a model of service that works successfully to treat families with perinatal mood disorders. 2. learn some of the methods of partnership building between community, health and social service agencies.Abstract: Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders affect about 15% of all childbearing women. Similar rates of depression are now being identified during pregnancy. Untreated, it can lead to poor attachment, family breakdown, chronic forms of depression, developmental delays for the child, suicide and infanticide.This paper presents an integrated multidisciplinary model of early intervention, prevention and treatment of perinatal mood disorders. It was developed as a result of participatory research that included clients and the health=social service organizations serving this population in Canada.Key issues, opportunities and challenges emerged. Some of these were: lack of knowledge about perinatal mood disorders on the part of the public and health=social service providers, delayed identification, frustration finding or accessing appropriate care, lack of funding, lack of trust between the various professions involved.This model addresses the issues identified from the research. It has led to better wraparound service, prevented recurrence, reduced suffering and built partnerships between community=health=social service agencies. It has been adopted successfully in urban and rural communities with different multicultural and socio-economic blends.It is the hoped that the participant will learn from our research and take back new ideas to their communities to help families with perinatal mood disorders.The prevention of postnatal depression: a narrative systematic review Objectives: To explore the relation between shift work as stressor and the prevalence of cardiovascular and immunsystem affection.Abstract: The causality between shift work and cardio-vascular dysfunction remains unknown. Accordingly we attempted an approach to explore such association. Electrocardiographic, biochemical and physical data obtained from 61 shift and 18 day workers were assessed to clarify the impact of shift work on cardiovascular system, serum cortisol and salivary IgA levels. Our results suggested an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and statistically significantly higher levels of serum cortisol and lower levels of salivary IgA, which are considered as potential biomarkers of stress, among rotatory shift workers compared to the control group. The duration of shift work showed a statistically significant negative correlation with salivary IgA level and a positive one with serum cortisol level.Abstract: This presentation will describe a recently completed treatment development study aimed at adapting Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), an individual treatment found efficacious for the treatment of major depressive disorder, to treat low-income, predominantly minority women with current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after interpersonal trauma (e.g., sexual and=or physical assault or abuse, sexual molestation, domestic violence, etc.) in a group format. Subjects were recruited at public sector health and WIC clinics and treatment was provided where women received their usual health care. Forty-eight women were randomized to group IPT or a wait-list control group after assessments using structured diagnostic instruments. Only 5 women randomized to treatment dropped out prematurely. The results showed that women who received IPT for PTSD treatment did significantly better regarding PTSD symptoms and interpersonal functioning than women in the wait-list control group. Abstract: Background: Several sources of heterogeneity in major depression have been identified. These include age of onset, presence of comorbid disorders, and history of childhood sexual abuse. This study examined these factors in the context of the contrast between onset of depression in young women before and after age 16.",

Second phase subjects for interview (N \u00bc 197) were drawn from three strata defined on the basis of childhood adversities. Interviews conducted and rated independently assessed, a) recalled childhood experiences, psychopathology and parental psychiatric disorder, and b) adult personality functioning and adult lifetime psychopathology. Frequencies of predictor and response variables, effect estimates and their confidence intervals were weighted back to the general population questionnaire sample.Results: Compared to adult onset depression, juvenile onset adult depression was associated with comorbid childhood psychopathology and peer problems, poor parental care and child sexual abuse involving actual or attempted intercourse; those with juvenile onset depression were more likely to have a teenage pregnancy, and as adults they had higher levels of comorbid psychiatric disorders, and personality dysfunction. The adult onset depression group was characterised by a history of contact child sexual abuse without actual or attempted intercourse, and to a lesser extent, poor parental care. Juvenile onset depression was associated with a parental history of alcohol problems, and adult onset with a history of depression in parents.Conclusions: Although the childhood data in this study were based on retrospective reports, they were consistent with findings from prospective studies. They add to the evidence that juvenile and adult onset depression in adult life probably arise from different developmental pathways and causal processes. Juvenile onset depression appears to be a component of a broad set of emotional and behavioural problems, and social impairment starting in early childhood, in which the causal processes involve an interaction between Objectives: At the concludion of this presentation the participants should be able to recognize gender differences in Pathological Gambling, understand the concept of telescoping effect as well as ots consequences in female gamblers.Abstract: More women are having gambling problems, similar to alcohol and drug addiction. This can be related to: new gambling venues with increased access for women, women gambling to escape from problems, and a faster progression (telescoping effect-T.E.) of social to pathological gambling (PG) in women. Though T.E. has been identified in different studies, little has been done to investigate its causes. This study investigates gender differences that might explain T.E. and that can be important for prevention and treatment strategies of PG, comparing 78 male and 78 female gamblers in: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical features, psychiatric comorbidities, and risk-taking behaviors. Pathological gamblers were diagnosed through the SOGS and the DSM-IV criteria; the SCAN was used to investigate psychiatric comorbidity; the TCI, and the BIS were used to investigate personality features. More females are single; females start and have gambling problems later in life than males. More females prefer electronic games and gamble to escape from problems. Males have more alcohol abuse=dependence, while females have more of depression. Besides gender, starting to gamble later in life and preference for electronic games, are responsible for T.E. in PG. We conclude that gender should be considered in prevention and treatment strategies for PG. Abstract: Although at least one-third of problem=pathological gamblers are women, the majority of the scant literature available on treatment and recovery is derived from males. Recent gender comparisons find significant differences between men and women who have sought help for problems associated with their gambling, which raises the possibility of different treatment=recovery processes. However, the recovery process for women, particularly in non-clinical samples, is not well understood or documented. This study attempts to remedy this situation by reporting on the nature of formal and informal supports for a non clinical group of women who have achieved at least six months of abstinence from compulsive gambling (N \u00bc 136). Data was gathered from a 79 item online survey that was linked to various national and state problem gambling councils. The analyses indicate the respondents were primarily middle-aged, middle class, welleducated white women with a serious gambling problem of either slot machines or video poker. The majority of the women received either Gamblers Anonymous (GA) or professional help, and 20% were recovering ''on their own.'' Gender related barriers to GA attendance and professional help were reported. However, most women indicated the reputation of GA as a ''male preserve'' needs changing. After GA, informal support systems (spou-se=partner, friends, children) were most critical for recovery, although not without problems. Professional helpers were the least important. Objectives: Participants will be familiar with the efficacy of primary prevention for postpartum depression based on research findings to date, as well as methodological concerns in the area of prevention research, such as identification of high risk women, protocol adherence, use of adequate sample sizes, and the need for cost-benefit analyses.Abstract: Purpose: Postpartum depression is a major complication following childbirth (WHO), interfering significantly with daily functioning and resulting in adverse consequences in the child. Because the event of childbirth is largely predictable, primary prevention appears to be a reasonable undertaking. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a preventive intervention adapted from Interpersonal Psychotherapy (P-IPT) for women at high risk for postpartum depression.Methods: Forty-five high risk women were randomized to Preventive IPT (P-IPT) (n \u00bc 24) or a no treatment control group (n \u00bc 21). P-IPT consisted of five individual sessions, beginning in pregnancy and ending at one month postpartum. Assessments were conducted initially and at one and six months postpartum.Results: Women receiving P-IPT evidenced significantly lower rates of postpartum depression compared to women in the control group (0% vs. 25%) at one month postpartum. However, prophylactic effects were not maintained through six months postpartum. There were no significant differences between groups on self-report measures of depressive symptomatology, general psychiatric symptomatology, marital satisfaction, or general postpartum social adjustment.Conclusions: P-IPT had positive, but limited, prophylactic effects through one month postpartum. Methodological limitations and other important issues in the area of prevention research warrant further investigation. Objectives: At the conclusion of this presentation participants should be able to recognize the factors that may influence impoverished women's ability and=or willingness to access mental health services during pregnancy.",

A significant number of these women, particularly those of low socioeconomic status, do not receive treatment for their mental health difficulties. This paper describes qualitative data regarding treatment accessibility, and the willingness of indigent women to access available treatments for depression during pregnancy.Methods: Qualitative data was obtained from focus groups with pregnant women recruited from an OB-GYN clinic and five Maternal Health Care Centers (MHC) serving low-income women, and from discussions with staff members at these MHC's. Additionally, a self-report questionnaire regarding access to mental health treatment was administered to 1020 pregnant women at these sites.Results: The most compelling finding from these data is that women often avoid seeking services because they perceive the care available to them to be of low quality. Financial barriers and the stigma associated with mental health care are also barriers to seeking care for these women.Conclusions: Poor women are at high risk for depression yet have the most difficulty accessing care. This research presents the voices of these women and provides insight into how to better facilitate mental health treatment for impoverished women. Objectives: The participants will be able to:1. identify 4 ways in which trauma-informed treatment services improve outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders 2. list at least 3 clinical, evidence-based interventions for treating women with co-occurring disorders and their children 3. be able to differentiate between treatment-as-usual versus integrated treatment servicesAbstract: Historically, individuals who had co-occurring disorders of substance abuse, mental illness, and histories of violence were provided treatment sequentially to treat each disorder separately. A five-year, national, cross-site research project, the ''Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence Study,'' funded by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), examined outcomes for women and their children who were treated simultaneously for their co-occurring disorders. A trauma-informed series of treatment protocol, clinical interventions, and service and systems integration was developed and measured. Preliminary data suggests that trauma-informed, integrated treatment services yield better outcomes for women with co-occurring disorders and their children.

Relational systems change does not focus on relationships or systems but encompasses both. Systems are made up of people, who grow and change in the context of connections to others. Relational systems work creates environments that encourage, facilitate and inspire people to engage in change. Relational systems change strategies include building relationships and creating linkages, creating a safe environment, involving consumers, a collaborative approach, values clarification, ongoing support for change and working at multiple levels. The use of these strategies by the WELL Project at the local, community and state levels to move the service system in the direction of providing trauma informed, integrated care will be described. Systems changes that occurred as a result, including increased awareness of the impact of violence on women with mental health and substance abuse disorders, increased availability of trauma-specific services, and increased collaboration among state agencies to address these issues, will be discussed. The presentation will conclude that relational systems change is an effective way to promote change in service delivery systems. Objectives: Participants will be able to:",

Stra-tegies for service integration (the integration of substance abuse, mental health, and trauma services) in both a rural and an urban setting, as well as the benefits of a program developed, written, evaluated, and administered by women trauma survivors, will be discussed. This presentation will highlight how similar programs can be implemented throughout the country, using a community development approach that utilizes existing resources and natural helping networks.An intervention for children of parents with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders who are victims of violence Nancy VanDeMark, Arapahoe House, Inc., Thornton, CO, U.S.A., e-mail: nancyv@ahinc.org Objectives:1. Participants will be able to identify four challenges to implementation of services for children affected by parental substance abuse, mental illness, and violence. 2. Participants will gain an understanding of the key components of an intervention for children affected by parental substance abuse, mental illness and violence.Abstract: Purpose: Children of parents with co-occurring substance abuse and mental health disorders and histories of violence=trauma have been overlooked in behavioral health treatment systems. The Women, Co-Occurring Disorders and Violence study was a five-year initiative funded by the United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and included a Children's Subset Study that implemented and evaluated an integrated intervention for children of women facing these multiple challenges.Method: The intervention developed and implemented under this study included: (1) a clinical assessment of the child; (2) resource coordination and advocacy; and (3) a twelve session skills building group.Results: The collaborating study sites generated a number of lessons learned related to the design and implementation of interventions for this population. Issues of treatment engagement and retention, cross systems relationships and operational issues offered challenges to implementation and provided valuable insights for other researchers, administrators and clinicians.Conclusions: There are a number of challenges inherent in designing and implementing interventions for children from families affected by substance abuse mental illness and violence. Many of these challenges can be mediated through careful planning and implementation.",
