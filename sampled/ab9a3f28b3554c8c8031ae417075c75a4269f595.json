Strictly speaking, post-operative chylous ascites should be classified as traumatic chylous ascites, often occurring as a result of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, distal splenorenal shunt, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and liver transplantation, requiring dissection of Cisterna chyli and its major tributaries. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . The incidence of postoperative chylous ascites is not high, as the incidence rate reported after major abdominal surgery and retroperitoneal surgery is 0.005% -2% [8, 9] . However, the clinical treatment of chylous ascites is more difficult, the treatment Method can be of the following: fasting / low-fat diet / medium chain triglyceride diet, somatostatin and its analogues, abdominal paracentesis, surgical treatment [10], etc. In addition, lymphatic angiography and lymphatic glue embolization have also been reported in these recent years [9, 11, 12] . Surgeries involving resection of esophageal carcinoma and gastric cardia carcinoma in the department of Thoracic surgery involves dissection of lymph nodes around celiac trunk, occasionally Resulting in postoperative chylous ascites, this is where we will introduce our treatment Method of abdominal pressurization therapy using broad belly band process, and summarize the experience of this new treatment Method for chylous ascites.",

The symptomatic evaluation of patients who have been achalasia focuses on frequency of regurgitation, dysphagia, weight loss, retrosternal pain and pressure. Achalasia is treated by either forceful balloon dilatation or surgical myotomy. Esophageal dilation for achalasia involves the forceful disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This is usually completed between 30-40 mm diameter pneumatic balloon dilators. Balloon dilatation is the clasical approach to the achalasiainception treatment.

Laparoscopic-dominantabdominoperineal resection (LDAPR)with personalized levatorani resectionfor low rectal cancer Background and Objective: The extralevator abdominoperineal resection (ELAPR) for low advanced rectal cancer is still controversial due to its severe pelvic nerve injuries and complicated pelvic floor reconstruction. Abdominoperineal resection (APR) is still a common operation for the patients with low rectal cancer, however, its oncological outcome is relatively poorer than that of anterior resection (AR) because of its higher margin positivity and tumor perforation rate. Traditionally the levatorani resection was performed during the perineal dissection procedure in laparoscopic APR (LAPR). Theoretically, the levator muscles also can be resected with an abdominal approach under a direct visualization during laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this Conclusions: Laparoscopic CME with total medial approach is technically feasible after the precise identifications of surgical planes and spaces for right-hemi colon. The procedure is proved to own shorter operation time and lower vessel-related complications. Therefore it should be highly encouraged and disseminated.

In those rectal tumors not involving the levator muscle, the dissection plane may continue close to the external anal sphincter and the levator muscle, leaving the ischioanal fat and the terminal branches of the pudendal nerve intact. If the tumor penetrates into the levator muscle, the dissection should include the fat of the ischioanal fossa to achieve a clear CRM. If the tumor has only penetrated into one side of the levator muscle, the dissection might include the levator ani muscle and the fat of the ischioanal fossa on the side of the tumor to achieve a clear CRM, whereas the ischioanal fat and levator ani muscle on the other side of the tumor may be left.",

RT-qPCR also indicated 20 bacteria including Bifidobacteria and Butyrate-producing bacteria were remarkably decreased, while Enterococcus and Enterobacteria were increased in HCC patients. Based on the mRMR method , the top 35 OTUs were selected as gene markers to construct the final PDI. Based on the 170 training samples, the AUC (area under the curve) values of the PDI achieved 0.831 and 0.829 for the training and the external validation procedures (66 samples), respectively. Importantly, the PDI model performed perfectly well for patients with AFP less than 20, achieved 0.859 and 0.915 for the training (46 patients versus 85 controls) and the external validation procedures (57 samples), respectively.",

But the real concurrency mechanism remains to be further studied. Parathyroid carcinoma occurs rarely, and is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Ultrasound, CT, MRI, scintigraphy with 99mTc-MIBI scan, whole body bone scan, and fine-needle aspiration pathology, eluent PTH examination can help diagnose and preoperative localization. The frozen sections mean little in differential diagnosis of benign and malignant parathyroid tumors, but postoperative paraffin pathology and immunohistochemistry examination can help confirm diagnosis. The most effective treatment is surgery. Using \"en bloc resection\" therapy when initial surgery can provide the best prognosis. For local recurrence and metastases focus, embolization, ablation and PTH immune therapy can also attempt to be used. Parathyroid carcinoma is not only difficult to diagnose, but the local recurrence rate is also higher. It can metastasize via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes. So postoperative patients should persist monitoring serum calcium and serum PTH levels, and try hard to early detection of tumor recurrence or metastasis, and early treatment, in order to improve survival rate and disease-free survival. Methods: A single-surgeon series of 622 consecutive patients using standard IONM with 1047 RLNs at risk were enrolled.

When he reviewed after a year and a half, the neck ultrasound examination revealed a mass in the left neck, with elevated serum calcium and parathyroid hormone. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology results prompted the source of parathyroid tissue. So neck mass resection was carried out again and postoperative parathyroid hormone and serum calcium of this patient declined to normal level. Finally experts consulted the pathological specimens and confirmed the diagnosis for parathyroid carcinoma. After a year, his serum calcium and parathyroid hormone elevated again and further examination results suggested parathyroid cancer recurrence. So we attempted to use radiofrequency ablation as treat-Results: 19 RLNs experiencing EMG amplitude reduction > 50% were identified by this procedure, 18 nerves (16 were caused by traction injury and 2 by compression injury) showed progressive gradual amplitude recovery, and 1 nerve caused by thermal injury showed persistent decrease after 10 minutes.

Furthermore, for cases with recurrence after plug & patch repair, we do not recommend TEP but believe that most of the cases can be repaired by TAPP technique. Moreover, TEP approach is also not suitable for recurrence cases that after pre-peritoneal repair, while we suggest the application of TAPP approach as the first-choice attempt. If the TAPP approach cannot separate enough space for mesh implantation or there is not enough peritoneum tissue to cover the mesh, the IPOM can be considered as an alternative solution.",

Plica umbilicalis lateralis often interrupted the view of part of contralateral internal ring and so the observation of hernia sac or patent processus vaginalis. In order to obtain the clear view of peritoneum in the internal ring to evaluate whether indirect hernia or patent processus vaginalis coexisted, two techniques were adopted singly or in combination: 1) trocar that the laparoscope went through were pulled cranially to lift the laparoscope to the direction of umbilicus and so observation angle changed; 2) slight press of the contralateral internal ring from body surface so that sac or patent processus vaginalis, if existed, in the internal ring could protrude into peritoneal cavity. Objective: This study evaluated the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF 165 ) sustained-releasing ability and bioactive performance, mechanical properties, and cytotoxicity of the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) -porcine small intestinal submucosa (PSIS) composite scaffold in vitro, detected the optimal concentration of MWCNT in the scaffold, and evaluated the feasibility of repairing abdominal wall defects using the composite scaffold.",

The secondary lesion situated in this space had a higher probability to be at risk for developing complex fistulous abscess than the non-infected group (82.0% vs. 10.4%, Fisher's exact test: P < 0.01). The lesion had a specific tendency to develop into synchronous fistulas, transverse sphincter complex in a high level, form horseshoe abscess or supralevator extension (Fisher's exact test: P < 0.01 respectively). The severity in the deep posterior space had no correlation with the height of transsphincteric plane(r = 0.121, P = 0.121). The same is true between the supralevator group and non-supralevator group(W test, P = 0.146). But it is different significantly between the horseshoe extension group and the non-horseshoe extension group. A remarkable abscess is commonly seen in the midline of the horseshoe branch. Only 23 posterior primary fistulas proceeded to the deep postanal space and 5 of 29 ischioanal horseshoe extensionswere related to the abscess in this special space. 2 of 23 deep postanal space abscesses had traversed anococcygeal raphe into the presacral space but not the retrorectalspace.",

The model was adjusted by age, sex, stage at diagnosis, tumor grade, and metastases in liver or lung. The survival scale table was worked out.Results: Forty-five percent of CRC patients had comorbidity at diagnosis. During the study period, the survival time was obviously shortened along with the increase of the CCI score. Using CRC patients with CCI score 0 as reference, adjusted 5-year relative risk in patients with CCI score 3+ were 1.61(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.18-2.18) and CCI score 7+ were 9.70 (95% CI: 4.98-18.87). Different BMI values correspond to the survival curve were differing from each other, especially when the BMI value were below 17. Using BMI values 18.5 to 24 as reference, adjusted 5-year RR in patients with BMI values 14 to 15 were 2.86 (95% CI: 1.52-5.37) and CCI score 7+ were 9.70 (95% CI: 4.98-18.87). The Pearson correlation values of CCI and BMI was 0.112(P < 0.01), but we fail to found the ralationship of them. Conclusion: Both CCI and BMI are independent risk factors for colorectal cancer patients. Either high CCI or low BMI was associated with poorer prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer in south China. With the help of standardized survival scale table, we can get the 3-year or 5-year survival probability of any patients in a conveniently way.

Histological confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma patients (age: 18-80years, ECOG: 0-1) with local recurrent or metastatic focus and history of exposure to oxaliplatin were included. Anticipants were randomly assigned to receive either neoadjuvant FOFIRI (6 cycles) before surgery and postoperative FOFIRI (6 cycles) or adjuvant FOLFIRI (12 cycles) after surgery. Statistics analysis was performed according to treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT: 02087475).Results:  We randomly assigned 88 patients to receive either direct surgery (n = 45) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n = 43) till November 2014. 47% patients achieved CR/PR and 53% patients developed to unrectable after neoadjuvant FOLFIRI. 40% patients developed disease progression in the direct surgery group and 53% patients developed disease progression in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (P = 0.408). No treatment-related deaths happened.Conclusions: Our initial results show that perioperative FOLFIRI and adjuvant FOLFIRI shared similar outcomes in resectable advanced colorectal cancer who failed to oxaliplatin. Further recruitment and follow up are needed to confirm our conclusion.",

Methods: The clinical data of one patient with huge HCC associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) cirrhosis admitted in July 2014 to Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Medical University and undergoing ALPPS were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Preoperative assessment showed that the patient's future liver remnant (FLR) to standard liver volume ratio was 34.9%. The patient underwent first-stage operation of right portal vein ligation and splitting of the left lobe of left hepatic vein and hepatic left lateral lobe (II, III); on postoperative day (POD) 7, the patient's FLR to standard liver volume ratio reached 39.2%. For the first-and second-stage operation, the operative time was 300min and 200min. The patient was discharged from the hospital on POD 24. Conclusion: For huge HCC patients with non-active HBV cirrhosis, a proper expansion of the indications for the ALPPS procedure is safe and feasible.

We performed this study to find out if the Ultrapro Plug (UPP) adversely affects the femoral vein after femoral hernia repair through an infrainguinal approach. Methods: Fifteen femoral hernias repaired with UPP through an infrainguinal approach between March 2012 and December 2012 were included. Preoperative and postoperative (three days and one year after surgery) Doppler ultrasound were performed to detect the diameter and blood flow velocity of femoral vein. We observed clinical manifestations of vascular compression and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in all patients after surgery. Results: Mean follow-up was 27.4 months (range, 22-30 months) and no patient was lost to follow-up. No significant difference was demonstrated either in the mean diameter or in the blood flow velocity (EDV, end-diastolic velocity; MBFV, mean blood flow velocity; MD, mean diameter and PSV, peak systolic Velocity) of femoral vein. No patient in this study developed DVT during the whole follow-up. Conclusion: The UPP seems to have no adverse effects on femoral vein after femoral hernia repair an infrainguinal approach.

The patients were assigned to different treatment groups according to specific conditions and hernia classification. Methods: Group I: pediatric inguinal hernias \ufe64 6 year-old, had laparoscopic hernia sac high ligation vs traditional open operation (1464 vs 528). Group II: adolescent inguinal hernias in 6-18 year-old, had the herniorrhaphy with acellular tissue matrix grafts vs traditional repair (566 vs 274). Group III: nearly 12,000 cases of adult inguinal hernias, for whom the comprehensive evaluation was proposed according to gender, age, hernia type, general conditions, etc., had laparoscopic hernia repair (TAPP/TEP, as 3018/1194), or open tensionfree hernia repair in 7788 cases (Lichtenstein 1874, Plug 2120, Stoppa 3794). Group IV: in cases of abdominal wall hernia, especially huge incisional and parastomal hernia, a small-incision assisted laparoscopic hernia repair (as a hybrid technique), traditional open operations, or laparoscopic operations were performed (1193/812/1304).Group V: the giant ventral hernias (as defect diameter more than 15cm, the volume of secondary abdominal cavity larger than original cavity by 20%, BMI >28, and preoperative intravesical pressure >15), underwent Initiative Volume Reduction Surgery (IVRS).Results: Group I: 3 recurrence occurred in open group (3/528), and none in laparoscopic group; scrotal seroma was observed in 127 children from laparoscopic group (127/1464), and 39 in open group (39/528); no differences in recovery time or hospital stay.Group II: 2 recurrence in traditional group (2/274), none in laparoscopic group; there were no differences in seroma, pain, hospital stay and recovery time between two groups.Group III: there were 4212 in laparoscopic group and 7788 in open group, respectively. The complications in the former included recurrence (3), seroma (173), chronic pain (3). According to our experience, laparoscopy was suitable for bilateral, occult and recurrent hernias. While open tension-free hernia repair was more acceptable to patients who were older or in presence of comorbidities (complications: 31 recurrence, 139 seroma, 8 infection, 4 chronic pain).",

E-mail: changshu01@yahoo.com Objective: To report our early experiences of endovascular stent-graft repair combined with adjunctive techniques in treating acute aortic arch dissections.Procedure and Methods: From Jul 2002 to Feb 2013, 926 patients of type B aortic dissection were treated with endovascular stent-graft repair. All patients' medical records and imaging materials were collected and analyzed retrospectively. 255 patients had insufficient ideal proximal landing zone for endovascular aortic repair alone whose tear site located \ufe64 1.5cm distal to LSA (143 men, 51.3 \u00b1 11.4 year, range 20~86). 65 single chimney stents were inserted into LSA or LCCA, 3 double chimney stents of LCCA and innominate arteries, 23 extra-anatomic bypass performed prior to or followed intervention, 1 entire aortic arch bypass procedure without CBP performed before TEVAR, 14 PDA excluders were deployed to prevent retrograde flow from LSA after intervention, 1 branched stent-graft and fenestration stentgraft were deployed, retrospectively.Results: Technical success rate was 99.3%, 30-day mortality was 1.9%(5/255) due to myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, respiration failure, the overall endoleak rate was 5.8% (secondary TEVAR was performed for all typeI patients, 13 stopped, 2 continued). The mean duration of follow-up was 25.4 months (1~ 118 months). 3 patients suffered from LSA steal syndrome (surgery for 1, 2 recovered spontaneously). Expanded true lumen and reduced of the false lumen happened in 215 patients, with 212 cases revealed thrombosis filling in false lumen.Conclusions: Several supplemental techniques with endovascular aortic repair for aortic arch dissection are available, chimney and supra-aortic bypass should be selected due to different anatomic configurations, Chimney technique is a safe and less invasive method according mid-term Results.",

E-mail: changshu01@yahoo.com Objective: To summarize our single-center experience of double chimney technique in the treatment of aortic arch pathologies.Methods: From Dec 2009 to Nov 2014, 9 patients with acute aortic dissection with its primary entry tear in aortic arch received Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) combined with double chimney technique to reconstruct innominate artery and left common carotid artery. Emergent endovascular treatment was performed in 1 patient for acute left lower extremities ischemia; the other patients were received operation after strict conservative treatment. All patients had computed tomography scans 2 weeks after TEVAR and at 3, 6 months, and annually thereafter.Results: All of the aortic stent-grafts were deployed in Zone 0, completely (n = 4) or partially (n = 5) covered the orifice of innominate artery. Aortic arch lesions coverage and patent reconstructed branch artery were achieved in all patients. Immediate type Ia endoleak happened in 2 (22.2%) patients. Chimney stent-graft collapsed and leaded stenosis treated with another stent-graft overlapped with the previous one in 1 patient (11.1%). Migration of chimney stent-grafts treated with immediate secondary TEVAR in 1 patient (11.1%). No type II endoleak, neurological symptom and perioperative mortality happened. Median follow-up was 22.4 months (range 1 to 60). No TEVAR related death happened. Asymptomatic type Ia endoleak in the 2 patients lasted.Conclusions: TEVAR with double chimney technique to reconstruct innominate artery and left common carotid artery is an alternative in the treatment of aortic arch. The risk of perioperative complications, especially type Ia endoleak, should be cautious. More cases and long-term resultare needed to evaluate the durability and efficiency of this alternative endovascular technique.Keywords: aortic arch, thoracic endovascular aortic repair, chimney technique, type Ia endoleak Three-dimensional print of aortic aneurysm models aid preoperative planning in complicated endovascular repair procedure ZHANG Hong-peng 1 , LU Tong 2 , GUO Wei 1 , LIU Xiaoping 1 , JIA Xin 1 , XIONG Jiang 1 , MA Xiao-hui 1 , WANG Li-jun 1 .Objective: To investigate the value of oral enteralnutrition support (ENSURE) for senior (>60 years) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR).Methods: The data of 30 senior AAA patients who underwent endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) was restrictively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups (Group A = 15, with postoperative oral enteralnutrition support of ENSURE, 50 g, tid; Group B = 15, with postoperative common food. The postoperative data were compared between two groups, such as the hospital stay, infection of operative incision rate and nutritional state in the third and seventh day after operation.Results: The postoperative hospital stay and infection rate have no significant difference among two groups. The plasma albumin in group A in the third day and the seventh day were higher (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Oral enteralnutrition support (ENSURE) improved the nutritional status of AAA patients who underwent EVAR, and shorten postoperative hospital stays.Keywords: enteral nutrition; abdominal aortic aneurysm; endovascular; senior Carotid artery pseudoaneurysm after carotid endarterectomy: case report and literature review Diao Yong-peng*, Chen Yue-xin *, Zeng Rong*, Yan Sheng*, Chen Zuo-guan*, Li Yong-jun* * Department of Vascular Surgery, Peking Union Medical aid complicated preoperative planning in endovascular repair procedures.Methods: From October 2012 to May 2014, six patients with complicated aortic aneurysms (one aortic arch aneurysms, one thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms and four juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms) accepted preoperative contrast-enhanced CTA scans for procedural planning, 4 male and 2 female, average age 64 years (range 52-73). All the CTA data were processed with FitMe 3D image processing software to get the modified 3D reconstruction pictures and computer language that can be identified by the 3D printer. With the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology, we got the highly accurate models and aided to make preoperative endovascular planning.Results: All the patients' models were printed before operations. By the guidance of models, the endovascular procedure plans were drawn up. Three patients were performed extracorporeal simulating operations with the models and four patients' endovascular operations were guided by the models during the intraoperative time. The procedure technique success rate was 100%. No serious complications and patients dead during the perioperative period.Conclusions: The technology of three-dimensional printed highly accurate models of aortic aneurysm models is feasible and can help to make preoperative endovascular planning for improving the safety of complicated procedures.Keywords: Three dimensional print; Abdominal aortic artery; Thoracic aortic artery; Aortic aneurysms; Endovascular repairThe Impact of Serum Uric Acid Level on Arterial Stiffness in Chinese Essential Hypertensive Patients Corresponding author: Email: yongj_93@hotmail.com Objective: To describle two cases of carotid artery pseudoaneurysms after carotid endarterectomy(CEA) and give a systematic review of related literatures.Methods : We reviewed our process and experience of diagnosis and treatment of the two patients with carotid pseudoaneurysm after carotid endarterectomy(CEA) admitted in PUMCH between January 2000 and March 2014, searched Pub-Med, SpringerLink, ELSEVIER and ScienceDirect databases for related English literatures concerning carotid pseudoaneurysm after CEA, and then made a conclusion.Results: The incidence of carotid pseudoaneurysms after CEA in our hospital was 0.31% (2/641). The two patients were treated with surgery and intracavitary therapy respectively, and both recovered well after the treatment. We took in thirty-nine related literatures totally, including 187 patients with pseudoaneurysm. One hundred and forty-one patients were treated with artificial patches during CEA, and 36 patients suffered secondary infection in the surgical sites. One hundred and fifty-two patients were treated with surgery, while 33 patients were treated with intracavitary therapy, with the residual two patients accepting hybrid surgery. The overall incidence of cranial nerve injuries, the incidence of 30-day stroke and the incidence of 30-day mortality were 6.4% (9/141), 7.4% (12/163) and 2.7% (5/182) separately.Conclusion: In spite of the low incidence of pseudoaneurysm after CEA, its potential risk is quite high. Aneurysm resection with carotid reconstruction is still the main treatment of the disease. The intracavitary treatment can be utilized in partial patients, with its characteristics of minimal invasion and shorttime postoperative recovery, but its long-term effect still needs further observation.Keywords: pseudoaneurysm; Endarterectomy, carotid; Carotid artery stenosis Clinical research of different surgical procedures for portal hypertension",

When P < 0.05, the difference was statistically significant.Hybrid treatment of aortic arch disease with ascending aorta to carotid artery revascularizationand subsequent endovascular repair Guangqi Objective: To summarize the experience of treating aortic arch disease with ascending aorta to carotid artery revascularization and subsequent endovascular repair.Method: Since January 2002, ascending aorta to carotid artery revascularization with subsequent endovascular repair was performed in 10 consecutive patients of aortic arch disease. A retrospective analysis is included. There were 9 men and 1 women, with a mean age of 54.2 \u00b1 14.1(34-71) years old. Aortic arch disease included 8 aortic dissection and 2 thoracic aortic aneurysm. All aortic arch debranching was performed with midsternotomy, 7 patients had Ascending Aorta (AO) to Left Common Carotid Artery (LCCA) and Right Common Carotid Artery (RCCA) revascularization, 3 had AO to LCCA and Left Subclavian Artery (LSA) revascularization. Subsequently, simultaneous (n = 5) and staged (n = 5, mean interval = 6.8 \u00b1 4.2 days) endovascular repair was performed via femoral artery.Results: Technical success rate was 100% (10/10). The 30 day-mortality was 30% (3/10), including 1 brain stem infarction, 1 circulatory failure and 1 aorto-tracheal fistula. Complication included 1 type II endoleak. Median follow-up was 34.9 \u00b1 44.5 (1-132) months. CT scanning was performed at 1, 3months and annually after surgery. There was no death and no occlusion of bypass. No complication occurred except 1 existing type II endoleak.Conclusions: Ascending aorta to carotid artery revascularization with subsequent endovascular repair extends the indication of endovascular repairing aortic arch and is suitable for high risk patients of poor general condition with little tolerance to aortic replacement.Keywords: Aortic arch disease; hybrid procedure; endovascular repair; ascending aorta based revascularization",

Methods: One helical stent and one controlled straight stent were separately implanted into both carotid arteries of 14 pigs. Quantitative angiographic measurements, duplex-estimated wall shear stress (WSS), and quantitative histomorphometry were measured in 30 days.Results: A spiral blood flow was confirmed in the helical stents; and the average lumen diameter stents was significantly higher in the helical (P = 0.001). The WSS was decreased by either helical or straight designs, but helical stent demonstrated Background: To analysis the reasons and propose the preventions of stroke after endovascular therapy of aortic expanded diseases.Methods: In the last decade, 8 cases of stroke after endovascular therapy of aortic expanded diseases were included, among which 3 were aortic dissection and the rest were diagnosed as aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.Results: Stent grafts were successful implanted in all cases, while 62.50% of them had the hatch of LSA covered. 75% of the cases were cerebral infarction and 25% were cerebral hemorrhage. The level of blood pressure between pre-operation and post-operation were different significantly(systolic pressure: 132.80 \u00b1 10.99mmHg vs 110.09 \u00b1 23.18mmHg, P < 0.05; diastolic pressure: 74.21mmHg \u00b1 3.86 vs 60.17 \u00b1 12.93mmHg, P < 0.05). All cases suffered from cerebral hemorrhage have used large dose of heparin within the operation. Results: The occult lymph node metastasis in central compartment was 61.0%.The average number of positive lymph nodes was 2.47 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .Fifty-four patients had less than three positive lymph nodes and twenty-nine had equal to or more than three. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age less than 45(P = 0.001, OR 3.571, 95% CI 1.681-7.587) and extracapsular spread (ECS) (P = 0.015, OR 2.99, 95% CI 1.241-7.202) were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in central compartment.Ten year cumulative overall survival rate was 98.3% and cumulative lateral neck metastasis rate was 25.2%. Multivariate analysis with cox regression model showed that ECS (P = 0.001, OR5.211, 95%CI1.884-14.411) and positive lymph nodes in central compartment\u22653 (P = 0.009, OR4.005, 95%CI1.419-11.307) were independent risk factors for lymph node recurrence in lateral neck region.The distribution of recurrent lymph nodes: level IV (82.4%), level III (64.7%), level II (29.4%) and level V (11.8%).Conclusion: Routine central lymph node dissection should be conducted for cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma(at least unilateral).Attention should be paid to the lateral neck region with cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma.Selective neck dissection is suggested for cN0 PTC with one or both of the risk factors, such as ECS and positive central lymph nodes \u2265 3.The range of dissection should include level III and IV at least.

Incisional biopsy was performed in 4 cases. 16 cases received adjuvant chemotherapy, 5 cases underwent radiotherapy and 8 cases received a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The clinical stage of I E was in 8 cases, II E in 23 cases, IIIE in 1 case respectively. About the postoperative pathological results, 19 cases were DLBCL (total 22 cases) and 10 cases were mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. About follow-up up to July 2014, 29 cases survived for periods from less than 1 year to more than 5 years.Conclusion: The diagnosis of PTL should be considered when dealing with rapidly growing goiters of aged women with Hashimoto's thyoiditis in a short period. Fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy and open surgical biopsy are helpful for the diagnosis of PTL. MALT patients of Stage I E are candidates for local therapy, including surgery and/or radiotherapy, others should receive a combined chemo-radiation therapy.Keywords: Primary thyroid lymphoma; Surgery; Radiotherapy; Chemotherapy Estrogen induces the growth of papillary thyroid cancer cells through estrogen receptor \u03b1 and \u03b2 Objective: Through summarizing the characteristics of cervical lymph node metastases(LNM) in papillary thyroid carcinoma(PTC), to provide theoretical basis for selective neck dissection.Methods: From July 2006 to August 2014, 462 cases of PTC at our hospital were retrospectively analyzed, We analyzed the regulations and predictive factors of cervical LNM, And the accuracy of cN0 standard was evaluated. Results: All cases accepted ipsilateral central cervical lymph node dissection(regionVI), 320 underwent lateral cervical lymph node dissection (region II -V) or elective lymph node dissection (some or all of region II -IV), 90 accepted contralateral central cervical lymph node biopsy. 73.2% (338/462) were cN0 patients, but of which 184 cases were pathologically confirmed with lymph node metastasis, the misdiagnosis rate of cN0 standards was 60.9%. The cervical LNM rate was 65.4% (302/462) in total, and the lateral compartment 42.6% (197/462), 13.1% (42/320) skip lateral cervical lymph node metastasis leaping central compartment, 50% (45/90) with contralateral region VI metastasis. Male, tumor involving upper 1/3 gland, tumors T3 or T4, multicentricity were all predictive factors of LNM. Patients with tumor involving upper 1/3 gland prone to had prelaryngeal lymph node(PLN) metastasis and \"skip metastasis \". Lateral compartment LNM increased significantly when PLN(+) and \u22652 central lymph nodes metastasis (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Existing CN0 standards is not suitable for lymph node dissection. PTC prone to lymph node metastasis, and region VI is most likely to be involved, then III, II, IV, V. Ipsilateral central lymph nodes should be routinely dissected and intraoperative frozen examination is suggested in initial surgery.If PLN metastasis /2 or more central lymph nodes metastasis/Tumor involving upper 1/3 gland, lateral cervical lymph node dissection (or elective lymph node dissection) is necessary. Attention should be paid to Contralateral region VI for it's high metastasis rate. Subdivision of central compartment is of great significance and needs thoroughly research.Keywords: PTC lymph node metastases cN0 Intraoperative frozen Prelaryngeal lymph node Clinicopathologic Analysis of Central Lymph Node Metastasis in cN0 Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: Risk Factors of it Background: High incidence of parastomal hernia was reported after construction of a stoma, either by physical examination or computerized tomography evaluation. Recent studies suggested that a prophylactic implantation of synthetic mesh at the time of stoma formation may reduce the risk of parastomal hernia, though it was controversy.Methods: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing with and without synthetic mesh prophylactic implantation during the initial surgery were retrieved for meta-analysis. Statistical analysis was accomplished by Review Manager 5.2.Results: After a thorough search of the literature published until January 7th, 2015, we identified five RCTs involving 264 patients (Mesh group, 131; No Mesh group, 133) for final analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that the incidence of parastomal hernia was significantly lower in the Mesh group (16.8%) than in the No Mesh group (40.6%, OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27-0.60, P < 0.00001). No significant differences were found between these two groups regarding stoma site infection, overall morbidity and mortality.Conclusions: A prophylactic implantation of synthetic mesh at the time of stoma formation is safe and could remarkably reduce the risk of developing a parastomal hernia. Objective: It is uncertain whether prophylactic implantation of a mesh at the time of a stoma formation could prevent the occurrence of parastomal hernia. We sought to investigate the role of a prophylactic mesh in prevention of parastomal hernia in patients with colostomy.Methods: A total 232 consecutive patients who underwent abdominoperineal resection from January 2002 to June 2012 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were analysed retrospectively. Primary end point was parastomal hernia, secondary end point compromised of stomal size infection, intra-abdominal infection, morbidity and mortality.Results: A total of 30 patients received prophylactic implantation of Dual-mesh at the time of stoma formation (Mesh group), while the remaining 202 patients received traditional surgery (No Mesh group). One out of 30 (3.3%) patients developed parastomal hernia in Mesh group, which was significant lower than that of No Mesh group (66/202, 32.7%, P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in terms of stomal size infection, intraabdominal infection, morbidity and mortality whether mesh was used or not.Conclusion: Prophylactic use of a mesh during an APR operation could remarkably prevent the occurrence of parastomal hernia. To draw a definite conclusion, a large multicenter, randomized control trial is guaranteed. between the experimental groups and control groups in degree of inflammation (P>0.05).Conclusion: New type polypropylene meshes could be obtained by grafting PLA on PP meshes and showed a new added property of anti-adhesion in the procedure of animal abdominal wall defects repair.Keywords Results: 58 lateral inguinal hernias operations were successful, the mean surgery time was 64.9 \u00b1 21.4min.11 cases of incarcerated hernia performed after released the entrapmentintestine, including that repaired the perforation of intestine and enterectomy of intestinal necrosis for respective 2 cases, furthermore one for appendectomy.Any of postoperativeincision infection wasn't observed. One case of incisionhematoma, was cured for 2 times debridement; three patients occurred fever and removed without any antibiotic.No recurrence and obvious incision pain and foreign body sensation after 3 months of their operations were observed.Conclusions: Biological mesh (Surgisis) in inguinal hernia repair is safe and effective, and seems suitable for incarcerated hernia repair.Keywords: Hernia, inguinal, surgical mesh, absorbable implant Preventing Parastomal Hernia with Prophylactic Mesh A Meta-analysis of Randomized Control Trials Zhihui Chen 1 MD, PhD, Hong Yang 2 , Yin Li 1 MD, PhD, Kaiwu Xu 1 MD, Yulong He 1 MD, PhD, Xinming Song 1 * MD, PhD AIMS: Postoperative pain is a common complication after inguinal hernia repair, sometimes maybe very severe. It is necessary to seek a valid method to relieve the pain symptom.Methods: From January 2012 to Jun 2014, totally 72 outpatients complain about inguinal area pain who underwent tension free hernia repair. The methods of tension free hernia repair were analyzed in these pain patients. A pain ruler (visual analogue scale, VAS) was used to measure the degree of pain in these patients. Score 1-3 was mild pain, score 4-7 was moderate pain, score 8-10 was severe pain. 24 mild pain patients were given Celecoxib capsules 0.2g Bid oral take one week. Of the 31 moderate pain patients were given Bucinnazine 0.1g Bid oral take one week and nerve block twice. 17 severe pain patients were given pulsed radiofrequency treatment in L3 spinal nerve.Results: All of the mild and moderate pain patients were relieved from pain. 15 severe pain patients got relieved from pain, 2 of the severe pain patients (2/17) have to be re-operated to remove the mesh due to the intractable pain.Conclusion: Postoperative pain is a torturous complication after tension free inguinal hernia repair. It is more important to prevent the occurance of postoperative pain. Non-operation treatment of postoperative pain is the main therapy method . Different non-operative treatment method may be used according to the degree of pain.The outcome of laparoscopic surgery forgastroesophageal reflux disease complicated with hiatal hernia and asthmatic symptoms: a single center study of 476 cases Objective: To investigate the outcome of laparoscopic hiatal hernia (HH) repair plus fundoplication forgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complicated with HH and asthmatic symptoms.Methods: GERD patients complicated with HH and asthmatic symptoms treated in GERD Department of the Second Artillery General Hospital from January 2008 to January 2012 were documented.

(3) The esophagusbody peristalsis amplitude were higher than baseline in different way of fundoplication (all \ufe64 0. 05).Conclusion: Laparoscopic fundoplication has good and durable antireflux effect and is associated with a lower incidence of post-operative complications compared to Nissen fundoplication, and can be employed as a routine procedure for treatment of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease.Keywords: Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication; Laparoscopic anterior 180\u00b0 partial fundoplication; High Resolution Manometry Objective: To know the feasibility and advantage of the laparoscopic herniorrhaphies in inguinal hernia repair, we adopt 7 common factors to compare laparoscopic with Lichtenstein procedure.Methods: A total of 454 patients were involved in this study and all of them were received Tension-free inguinal hernia repair from March 2005 to March 2014. 299 patients were received laparoscopic herniorrhaphies (164 of TEP and 135 of TAPP) and 155 patients were received the Lichtenstein procedure of inguinal repair. 7 factors of the average operating time, numerical rating scale (NRS), scrotum seroma, esthesiodermia, chronic pain, recurrence rate and cost of hospitalization were included in our comparative study.Results: 299 patients who suffered laparoscopic surgery were successfully completed, and in which of 243 patients were followed up. The NRS and recurrence rate were significantly better in the laparoscopic herniorrhaphy group than those in the Lichtenstein procedure group (P < 0.05), the cost of hospitalization was more in laparoscopic herniorrhaphy group than those in the Lichtenstein procedure group (P < 0.05). But no significant difference was found in operating time, scrotum seroma, esthesiodermia and chronic pain between two groups (P > 0.05).Conclusions: The laparoscopic herniorrhaphy is a good methods for inguinal hernia repair and it is a safe and feasible technique for inguinal hernia repair and especially forIV cases and bilateral hernia by TAPP. However, the relatively high cost might be a reason for its postponed popularization. Laparoscopic hernia repair would certainly have been widely used with the laparoscopic technique developmented and received the conception of minimally invasive. Background: It is well known synthetic mesh cannot be applied to contaminated hernia repair. For the ventral hernia repair, most scholars believed that the operation should be terminated or biological mesh should be used when the separation of severe bowel adhesions caused contamination. The synthetic mesh for contaminated fields has remained a heavily debated topic, at least, it was not recommended. To investigate the safety and feasibility of synthetic mesh in contaminated ventral hernia repair, we retrospectively analyzed 19 patients.Methods: The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 19 patients with contaminated incision hernia and parastomal hernia who had undergone surgery from January 2006 to October 2013. We analyzed the concomitant diseases, contamination of operation, characteristic of synthetic mesh, preoperative nia contents included omentum and, less commonly. One TSH repairs were performed as an emergency procedure with incarcerated small intestine. Three cases were repaired by continuous suture with Prolene 2-0, and the last one was performed tension-free hernioplasty. All the patients recovered well and then discharged.Conclusion: The risk of TSH repair is low, but the risk of an emergency operation for TSH is relatively high, so that all patients with a TSH should be offered elective repair. It is important to clearly and unequivocally classify trocar site hernias to improve management of laparoscopic procedures.Use of acellular dermal matrix combined with components separation technique for repair of contaminated large ventral hernias: a possible ideal solution for this clinical challenge Background: Repair of large contaminated ventral hernias is always challenging because of massive loss of muscular and fascial tissues, high risk of surgical infection and recurrence, and contraindication to use of permanent prosthesis. This study aimed to provide an appropriate solution for this challenge.Methods: This study reviewed retrospectively data of 35 patients with contaminated large ventral hernias who received repair using acellular dermal matrix combined with components separation technique from 2009 to 2011. Patient demographics, contamination sources, comorbidities, operative techniques, perioperative managements, complications, and recurrences were analyzed.Results: 21 males and 14 females were identified, with a mean age of 45.5 \u00b1 12.5 years and a mean body mass index of 22.5 \u00b1 5.8 kg/m 2 . Simultaneously, 9 patients underwent bowel fistula resection, 13 patients underwent ostomy takedown, 5 patients underwent recurrent colon cancer dissection, 8 patients underwent infectious permanent mesh removal and wound debridement. Mean defect size was 125.0 \u00b1 23.5 cm 2 . The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle was transected and separated from internal oblique muscle to reach abdominal closure. Acellular dermal matrix was placed in onlay fashion and mean mesh size was 300.0 \u00b1 65.0 cm 2 . 35 patients had a mean follow-up period of 36.5 \u00b1 12.5 months. A wound bleeding and partial dehiscence occurred at 36 hours postoperatively. 5 patients reported abdominal wall pain during the first postoperative month. 5 patients developed surgical site infection. 4 patients were detected to develop seroma with volume more than 20 ml by routine B-ultrasound examination. No recurrence and chronic foreign-body sensation were followed up.Conclusions: Use of acellular dermal matrix combined with components separation technique is a safe and efficient management for repair of contaminated large ventral hernia, in which permanent prosthesis placement is contraindicated. Conclusion: Considerable increasing of the abdominal capacity is achieved only by Ramirez's method ! Low risk of: compartment syndrome, postoperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications Advantages of Ramirez method with triple mesh technique are: More flexibility of anterior abdominal wall is maintained consequently an amplitude of diaphragm movement higher; lower risk of pulmonary complications, Less seroma formation, mesh expenses are considerably less.",

The improvement rate of co-morbidities such as fatty liver, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were 88.6%, 91.6%, 74.6% and 83.5%, respectively..Conclusions: PLRYGB modified and optimizedthe traditional surgical techniqueswhich is not significantly increasing the operation time. It is safe and feasible.The postoperative weight loss effect is significant and it can effectively improve the related co-morbidities in low complication incidence. Methods: Thirty-four patients whose diagnosis were gastroesophageal reflux disease or hiatal hernia underwent laparoscopic operationsfrom Jun.2009 to Dec.2010, and were followed up at least 36 months. Outpatient follow-up, combination with telephone and letterswere used. The follow-up included weight, symptoms (acid reflux, heartburn, dysphagia, sleep), changes in the types and doses of prescriptiondrugs. After 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36monthsof operation, the patients had gastrointestinal barium meal and endoscopy.Results: Sixteen cases had metabolic problems in 34 patients, including 11 cases of hypertension, 6 diabetes and 3 hyperlipidemia (2 patients at the same time had hypertension and diabetes, 2 patients had hypertension andhyperlipidemia). A part of these patients'symptoms had been alleviated (oral medication reduction or even discontinuation) including 7 patients with hypertension, 2 cases withdiabetes and 2 patients withhyperlipidemia.Conclusions: The mechanism of improvement of this group during follow-up after Nissenfundoplication is still unknown. It is proposed to contain some possible reasons, for example: postoperative weight loss, gastrointestinalhormone changes, useless of gastric fundus, which need further validation of the clinical and laboratory studies as well as the bulk of cases, multi-center follow-up study.Correlative study between the effect of Rouxen-Y gastric bypass on type 2 diabetes and Akkermansia muciniphila",

Introduction: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the bariatric procedure that is most commonly used. Despite not causing malabsorption, deficiencies in micronutrient after SG are frequent, despite routine supplementation.Objectives: To assess some vitamins and minerals deficiencies in patients underwent SG and to evaluate patient's adherence in following the prescribed supplementation.Materials and Methods: Forty obese patients (25 females and 15 males) with mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of 45.4 Kg/m 2 \u00b1 6.1, mean age 45.5 \u00b1 12.2 years were enrolled and underwent SG. Patients were assessed for nutritional status, as regards iron, zinc, vitamin D, folic acid and vitamin B12, every three months throughout 12 months. The patient adherence in following the prescribed supplementation were also assessed by using pill's count method .Results: The following deficiencies were observed: iron in 18%, zinc in 34%, vitamin D in 32%, folic acid in 22% and vitamin B12 in 18%. Patient's adherence in following the prescribed supplementation was 33% while patient's non-adherence was 67%.Conclusion: In this study, we showed that despite routine supplementation, deficiencies in micronutrient after SG are present. In addition, we showed that those deficiencies could be also attributed to the fact that patients do not follow regularly, or even abandon, the prescribed supplementation. Considering that patient adherence in following the prescribed supplementation is crucial to avoid micronutrients deficiencies, we are actually studying the clinical efficacy and compliance of micronutrient supplement drops for the treatment of vitamin and mineral deficiencies of obese patients after SG.",

The coordination with the 3 arms, the compensation of the loss of tactile, with actually consist of two parts, the visional information and the acrobatic endowrist, gery resulted in minimal rates of symptomatic VT and bleeding. Future studies evaluating VT prophylaxis after obesity surgery should include Low molecular weight heparin to identify the equilibrate risk of symptomatic VT and postoperative bleeding (LOS) is a necessity and costeffective surgical process in order to decrease the postoperative morbidity and ensure the early return to work. Widely used ports site closure apparatus indispensable incorporate muscle and subcutaneous fat. We aimed to compare the endoclose technique(Carter Thomason Closure System, CTC) and hand stitch with the Portege by aid of farabeuf retractor (HSP) method in obese patients at our advance clinic.Methods: Data was gathered for a total of 186 morbid obese patients over the study of 2 year from November 2012 to November 2014. These patients were choosed from experienced surgeons laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy operations.All of the patients were compared with demographic datas, body mass index (BMI), additional analgesic doses time, morbidity and complications retrospectively.Results: In this study we identified 186 obese patients who had performed laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Sex of the all patients were 128 (%69) females, 58 (%31) males.The mean age of all patients was 41.2 years (range 28 to 63). Of these, 103 (%55) patients underwent port site closure using the Endostitch (Carter Thomason Closure System, CTC) and 83 (%45) patients underwent port site closure with the hand stitch with postoperatively, all patients have taken analgesic doses by nurses 3 times per day. Demographic datas, body mass index (BMI) were determined similarly however additional analgesic doses time and morbidity resultwere significantly different in both of the groups. Analgesic drug time in group CTC were longer than the HSP group also the morbidity of CTC group was lower than HSP group because of happening lower rate of fat necrosis and achieve lesser tension. We have not seen any mortality in patients after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG).Conclusion: Laparoscopic port sites with the Endostitch suture(CTC) has a significantly feasible and less rate of morbidity than using HSP apparatus.This is an interesting use for an apparatus used for closing more controlled port sites in less controlled ones.Although no remarkable differences were seen in the postoperatively period in LSG, subjectively, the model was found to be beneficial and we would recommend it to other experienced surgeons to utilize.Purpose: To observe the clinico-pathological of patients with umbilical metastasis associated with intra-abdominal malignancy (Sister Mary Joseph Nodule, SMJN), and the outcomes in these patient underwent surgery.Methods: A consecutive series of 17 patients with SMJN at Sun Yat-sen University from January 1980 to January 2011 were retrospectively analyzed.Ten of seventeen patients received surgery(surgery group), seven patients received conservative treatment(conservative group).The clinical features of patients and the effect of operation on patient survival were investigated. The difference between groups and subgroups were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method.Results: All 17 cases of SMJN were histopathologically diagnosed, and the results showed that metastatic lesions were derived from epithelial ovarian carcinoma (six cases), gastric adenocarcinoma (six cases), colon adenocarcinoma (two cases), endometrial carcinoma (one case), gallbladder carcinoma (one case) and undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (one case, without the identified primary foci). The median survival time was 13.5 months and the survival rate at six months, one year and two years were 60%, 20% and 10%, respectively in the group who underwent palliative surgery plus chemoradiotherapy. Whereas, the median survival time was decreased to 8.25 months and the survival rate at six months was 85.7% in those treated nonoperatively, with no patient surviving more than one year in this group. Statistical analysis showed that the prognosis in palliative operation group is better than that in non-operation group (P = 0.0047).Conclusions: SMJN is a hallmark of advanced intra-abdominal malignancies and poor prognosis. Whenever possible, optimal debulking surgery plus chemoradiotherapy are necessary to prolong patients survival.Keyword Methods: a prospective study design, meet in this study of the criteria of patients; record the general data, nutritional risk screening; surgical treatment need to record theCatheter, nasogastric tube, abdominal drainage, bile duct drainage pipe, the drainage tube, central venous catheter and the peripherally inserted central catheter, using a visual analog scale method , recording in patients with catheterization after 24, 48 and 72hours readings, pain degree evaluation of different catheter for patients caused by.Results: In 157 patients, 70 males, 87 females; age 60.5 \u00b1 12.5 years of age, (23.8 \u00b1 3.2) kg/m2 body mass index; total nutrition risk rate 42%; according to visual analogue scale readings, this group of patients with subjective feelings of pain degree is as follows: the nasogastric tube (4.91 \u00b1 1.65), wound drainage Others Prevalence, diagnosis and misdetection rate of intra-abdominal hypertension in critically ill adult patients: a single-center cross-sectional study Methods: A one-day cross-sectional study based on the WSACS 2013 guidelines was conducted in the general ICU of Daping Hospital. The epidemiologic data and risk factors (RFs) at 24h after admission to ICU, 24h before the survey, and 24h during the survey were recorded. IVP measurements were conducted by investigators every 4h.IVP result of the same patients measured by ICU work staff and investigators were compared to evaluate the diagnosis rate. A questionnaire was used to investigate the extent of the knowledge of the guidelines.Results: Thirty-two patients were included. The prevalence of IAH during the survey was 15.63%.The diagnosis rate of IAH was 20.00%. During each period all patients had more than one RF, which met the IVP measurement recommendation, but the misdetection rates were 90.63%, 96.88%, and 96.88%, respectively.Fourteen doctors and 5 nurses were surveyed. The average scores of the doctors and nurses were 27.14 \u00b1 20.16 (0~60) and 16.00 \u00b1 8.94 (0~20), respectively. None had studied the WSACS 2013 guidelines thoroughly.Conclusion: Insufficient knowledge of the guidelines may be the main cause of the low IAH diagnosis rate and the high IVP misdetection rate. Future training should focus on disseminating and carefully following the WSACS guidelines.Keywords: Intra-abdominal pressure; intra-abdominal hypertension; abdominal compartment syndrome; questionnaire; intensive care unit Sister Mary Joseph's nodules secondary to intraperitoneal cancer: A report of 17 cases and mini literature review Corresponding author: HE Yu-long, Email: yulongh.sysu@ gmail.com Objective: The peritoneal carcinomatosis commonly occurs in end stage of various digestive malignances. Combined cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) have been widely accepted as effective palliative treatments for patients in end stage malignances. This study was designed to investigate whether a stable perfusion temperature could enhance bowel recovery after palliative surgery.Methods: A consecutive series of 59 patients underwent CRS and HIPEC between January 2012 and July 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were artificially divided into two groups according to the stability of perfusion temperature: study group with stable perfusion temperature and control group with unstable temperature. After three cycles of HIPEC treatments, flatus time, enteral nutrition initiation time, defecation recovery time and postoperative pain (VAS score) were utilized to compare bowel function recovery between the two groups.Results: In all, 33 of 59 (55.9%) patients underwent relatively stable hyperthermic perfusion treatments. Compared with those who had unstable perfusion temperature, the average flatus time (2.3 \u00b1 1.2 vs 3.9 \u00b1 2.2 days, P = 0.002) and time of enteral nutrition initiation (4.3 \u00b1 1.5 vs 6.7 \u00b1 2.3 days, P < 0.001) were significantly decreased in the study group, as well as the defecation recovery time (5.2 \u00b1 2.1 vs 7.1 \u00b1 2.9 days, P = 0.004). Besides, the average VAS score was markedly decreased (4.5 \u00b1 2.3 vs 6.3 \u00b1 1.3, P < 0.001).Conclusions: A stable perfusion temperature during the HIPEC therapy can promote bowel function recovery, reduce postoperative pain, and benefit the initiation of subsequent enteral nutrition therapy. Background: Infectious complication is a severe complication after major abdominal surgery. Procalcitonin (PCT), widely used in intensive care units has already shown its usefulness for detection of infection. However, with the trauma and stress, its value in the postoperative period of major abdominal surgery is not well proven. The objective of this study was to determine the approximate range of PCT in patients without complication after major abdominal surgery and to evaluate PCT as a parameter for detection of infectious complications.Patients and Methods: Between January 2011 and July 2013, a total of 432 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were included in the study. Routine blood samples, for determining PCT level, neutrophil ratio, white blood cell count and temperature were obtained on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 7. Predictive values for each of the markers were examined.Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that complication affects PCT level on POD1, 3, 7. Patients with infectious complication exhibited significantly higher PCT levels (on POD 1, 3, 7), neutrophil ratio and temperature (on POD 3 and 7) than did those without complication. According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, PCT showed the highest AUC on POD1, 3, 7 (AUC = 0.991 and 0.938, 0.964respectively), which was much higher than the other parameters. In the patients without complication, the PCT level declined 33% and 35% from POD1 to POD3 and from POD3 to POD7 respectively. When determining the baseline of PCT level of patients after major abdominal surgery, we excluded those undergoing emergency surgery, with preoperative suspected infection or postoperative complication. The baseline on POD 1, 3, 7 was 1.25ng/ml, 0.98ng/ml, 0.58ng/ml respectively. With an AUC of 0.938, making the PCT ratio between POD3 and POD1 more useful for predicting infectious complication after major abdominal surgery. The best cutoff value was calculated at 1.83. Ratios greater than 1.83 suggested underlying infectious complication. The PCT ratio between POD7 and POD3 was not sufficient to differentiate patients with infectious complication from those not.Conclusion: The baseline of serum PCT level on POD 1, 3 and 7 is 1.25ng/ml, 0.98ng/ml, 0.58ng/ml respectively. PCT level and its ratio could serve as a diagnostic tool for the early identification of infectious complication after major abdominal surgery, which Objectives: This study was intended to investigate the clinical significance of serum homocysteine(HCY) concentration in patients with adult moyamoya disease before and after semiencephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis. The correlation between HCY and pathogenic mechanisms of moyamoya disease was discussed.Methods: For this study, we selected 250 cases of patients with moyamoya disease, who were admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery at Hospital 307 between Jan 2009 to Jan 2013. All these patients had undergone semi-encephalo-duro-arteriosynangiosis surgery. According to the MRA images, the moyamoya disease was divided into 6 phase. Phase I, II, III are known as early stages while phase IV, V, VI are late stages. The serum HCY levels of the 250 patients in each stage of moyamoya disease and those of 250 people in normal control group were determined. Laboratory data was analyzed by statistical methods.Results: 201 patients were ischemic stroke, accounting for 81.40%(201/250) of the 250 patients with moyamoya disease. 45 patients developed cerebral hemorrhage, accounting for 18.00%(45/250). 4 patients were hybrid, accounting for 1.60%(4/250). The pre-operative and post-operative serum HCY levels in moyamoya disease group were significantly higher than those in normal control group(P < 0.001). There was no significant diference between pre-operative and post-operating serum HCY levels (P = 0.95, P > 0.05) or between the late stage group and early stage group in serum HCY levels (P = 0.79, P > 0.05). There were 89 patients with high pre-operative levels of HCY, accounting for 35.60%. No cerebral hemorrhage occurred in 32 patients with starting symptoms for cerebral hemorrhage. Among the 166 patients with starting symptoms for ischemic stroke, 145 patients recovered and 21 patients did not improve. There were 87 patients with high post-operative levels of HCY, accounting for 34.80%.Conclusions: High HCY levels may be related with moyamoya disease. Surgery can not change levels of HCY. HCY test is needed to monitor the diagnosis and treatment effect of patients with moyamoya disease.Keywords: Moyamoya Disease, Encephalo-Duro-Arterio-Synangiosis; Homocysteine; \u2021 Corresponding author Yang Yu, MD, PhD, Ming Gao Background: miR-24 is one of the most significantly upregulated miRNAs in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). PTEN, one target gene of miR-24, plays an important role in the cell survival and cisplatin resistance of cancers. However, it remains unclear what role does function and mechanism of miR-24 and PTEN play in TSCC.Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, miR-24 expression was tested in 79 cases of paired TSCC and normal tissues and 8 TSCC cell lines by real-time PCR and the relationships between miR-24 expression and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. Further, we demonstrated that deregulation of miR-24 was found to associate with high grade and late stage tumor. In addition, miR-24 induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance through targeting 3'-UTR region of the PTEN, which leads to dowregulation of PTEN protein and activation of Akt prosurvival pathway.Conclusions: Significance in conclusion, our resultdemonstrated that deregulation of miR-24 is a recurrent event in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma and associate with tumor progression and that miR-24 induces cell survival and cisplatin resistance primarily through targeting PTEN/Akt pathway. Thus, miR-24 could be important targets for intervention of this malignancy.Keywords Objective: This study mainly focus finding the relationship between high blood pressure and true lumen expansion (TLE) after TEVAR foraortic dissection.Methods: and Material: Our hypothesis is high blood pressure before TEVAR may have negative influence to TLE after TEVAR. The study is divided into two parts: first we established a computational model to calculate hemodynamic parameters, then we retrospectively analyzed our patients' follow up data to find the long-term effect.Results: The model showed higher systolic pressure and bigger pressure gap between false and true lumen (PGBL) is statistical relevant (R2 = 0.999). Clinical data showed there is positive correlation between systolic pressure and TLE after TEVAR at 49mm level below aortic arch (R = 0.631, P = 0.01). The TLE differences were statistically significant when divided by systolic pressure at 130mmHg (P = 0.005).",

            "text": "Methods: Data of unilateral early breast cancer patients who underwent surgeries in our institute from Jan 1999 to Dec 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' baseline information, pathology characteristics, and surgical treatment modalities were included into analysis. Cochrane Armitage trend test was used to estimate the changing trend of various surgical treatment options. Chi-square test and t test were used to estimate the differences between subgroups.Results: A total of 18677 breast cancer patients were enrolled into the study. The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 51.44 \u00b1 11.39 years old. Among all patients, 37.0% were staged as 0-I, 37.5% as stage II, 15.7% as stage III and 9.7% cases could not be staged. A significant changing trend among surgical options was observed (P < 0.001). The proportion of radical mastectomy has decreased tremendously. Modified radical mastectomy experienced a trend of increase then decrease, which correlated with the increasing trend of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), so that a great number of axillary lymph node dissection surgeries were avoided. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) increased from 8% in 1999 to 17% in 2007 and remained constant over the past few years. Compared with mastectomy, BCS was related with younger age, earlier pT/pN stage and ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative disease (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Mastectomy remained the major surgical strategy for breast cancer treatment. The relative low percentage of BCS was related to various factors. Modified radical mastectomy was gradually replaced by simple mastectomy and SLNB.

            "text": "Purposes: we aim to review and discuss the relationship between gut microbiome and cancer initiation and progression.Methods: the domestic and foreign studies about the relationship between gut microbiome and cancer initiation and progression are searched and read, trying to obtain insightful conclusions.Results: the latest metagenomic sequencing technology has revealed that there are more than 1000 microbial species in the human gut. They are not only important to keep human healthy, but also closely related to the initiation and progression of some disorders. Recent years, more and more studies focus on the relationship between gut microbiome and cancer and there may be several mechanisms supporting it. Nearly all of human body cells harbor TLRs. Gut microbiome and its products, especially LPS, can combine with TLRs such as TLR-4, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), which resulting in the expression of the inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factoralpha, interleukin (IL) -1, IL-6 and IL-8. Consquently, the survival advantages of precancerous or cancer cells will be enhanced. Gut microbiome can also lead to the initiation and progression of cancers such as colorectal cancer (CRC) through the biosynthesis of genotoxins interfering with the cell cycle regulation or directly damaging DNA, the production of toxic metabolites, and the activation of dietary heterocyclic amines to pro-carcinogenic compounds. So far, studies researching the association between gut microbiome and cancer mainly focus on CRC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, animal experiment found that using of antibiotics to reduce the level of endotoxin or removing TLR-4 of hepatic cells could effectively slow down the growth of HCC. Researches on other cances such as breast cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer are still very limited.Conclusions: current studies have shown that gut microbiome are closely associated with the initiation and progression of certain types of cancers, mainly on CRC and HCC. The relationship is urgently needed to be studied in depth and breadth. Making clear the mechanisms how gut microbiome contribute to occurrence and development of cancer has the potential of providing a novel direction for cancer diagnosis, prevention and treatment.",

            "text": "There are no potential conflicts of interest Background: Bloodstream infections such as bacte remia are prevalent worldwide andare potentially life-threatening. DNA microarray-based assays have been developed, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets by using low sample volumes with greater accuracy and reduced assay times than currently used methods. Rapid identification of sepsis-causing bacteria could enable early initiation of species-specific antimicrobial therapy, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate nutritional status, the prevalence of nutritional risk, and implementation of nutrition therapy among patients in Chinese teaching hospitals.Methods: Patients admitting to four Chinese teaching hospitals from April to December 2008 were enrolled. Patients were divided surgical wards (Departments of GI Surgery, hepatic surgery, Breast & thyroid surgery and Thoracic Surgery) and internal medicine wards (Departments of Gastroenterology, Pulmonology, Neurology and Nephrology). The Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 tool was used for nutritional risk screening. Prevalence of malnutrition, nutritional risk and implementation rate of nutritional therapy were compared between patients in surgical wards and those in internal medicine wards.Results: A total of 1278 patients were in the final analysis. Among them, 551 patients were in surgical wards (the surgical group) and 727 patients were in internal medicine wards (the internal group). There were no significantly differences in prevalence of malnutrition between surgical and internal groups (15.06% vs. 16.23%, P > 0.05). Compared to the internal group, the prevalence of nutritional risk was significantly lower in surgical group (27.22% vs. 39.48%, P = 0.0001). The percentage of nutrition therapy in those who are at nutritional risk was higher in surgical group(56.67% vs 34.15%, P < 0.0001). The percentage of nutrition therapy in those who are not at nutritional risk was lower in surgical group(13.97% vs 22.27%, P < 0.01).Conclusion: Nutritional risk and inappropriate nutritional therapy are more common among patients in internal medicine wards than those in surgical wards. The NRS-2002 is a worthwhile nutritional risk screening tool for hospitalized patients. Background: Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) is a distinctive, locally infiltrative, often recurrent mesenchymal neoplasm that typically develops in the pelvic and perineal region in women. Preoperative diagnosis of AAM is very important for developing rational surgical strategies. However, AAM and angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF) are difficult to distinguish preoperatively.Methods : We reviewed 113 cases of AAM and AMF in case reports published in international databases. Objective clinical characteristics such as sex, age, duration of disease, surgery history, tumor location, greatest diameter of the tumor, and tumor margin definition were analyzed. We built a clinical diagnosis Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and validity of the novel real-time ultrasonography (US) -computerized tomography (CT) imaging fusion navigation system for the percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL).Materials and Methods: The fusion navigation system consisted of a computer, an ultrasound scanner and an electromagnetic tracking (EMT) device allowing spatial localization of US image and insertion needle. An agar gel phantom with 5 tips simulating the target renal calyx was designed for this PCNL experiment in vitro. US images and pre-procedural CT images of the phantom were fused by the external markers registration methods The relevant images of US and CT were displayed side by side on the screen, as well as the fusion images. Objective assessment was obtained by PCNL tests in vitro with or without the US-CT fusion navigation system. The overall success rates and the mean puncture time were assessed.Results: The fusion navigation of US and CT images were achieved after external fiducial markers registration. Four urologic trainees were recruited to assess the navigation system. The success rate for US-CT fusion navigated VS traditional US guided puncture was 100% vs. 98% (p>0.05), and the mean puncture time was 18s vs. 46s (P < 0.05).Conclusion: Our fusion navigation system based on EMT decreased the procedural time remarkably and also had a high success rate. The system was feasible and valid for PCNL in a preliminary experimental study. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to validate its efficacy.Keywords: image fusion; percutaneous nephrolithotomy; real-time navigation Preparation of volumetric skeletal muscle whole organ acellular matrix to regenerate contractile, vascularized, innervated muscle in rodent and canine model Introduction: Biologic scaffolds prepared from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of acellular mammalian tissues have been Methods: We developed a prototype DNA microarray-based assay for the detection of 8 bacterial genera (16 species), which were selected based on our previous epidemiologic study in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Beijing, China. The array design consisted of 68 species-specific 20-mer DNA probes,which were amplified from reference strains. Evaluation of 92 positive blood culture samples from patients with clinically suspected sepsis were investigated for bacterial samples by using this DNA microarray. Operators of the test assay were not aware of culture results.Results: Comparison of oursults with conventional methods, the assay had a clinical sensitivity of 81.8-100 % and a specificity of 100 %. in our analysis of turnaround time for the 92 blood samples the median time difference was 28.9 h (including culture time), some reults were available during the same working days.Conclusion: This novel DNA microarray assay was highly sensitive, specific, and faster than culture-based method. This assay could be useful for applications in pathogen detection for clinical sepsis.",

The polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were isolated by the Density Gradient Centrifugation, and placed in culture medium. Three types of fat emulsions were then added respectively. Each set up control group and four concentrations (0.01%, 0.1%, 1%, and 10%). All of above were cultured together in vitro. Detect respectively the phagocytosis of PMN by Yeast phagocytosis test, the chemotaxis by Agarose plate test, and the production of oxygen free radicals by nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT) reduction test.Results: (1) As the concentration increased, the LCT group and the LCT/MCT group both reduced PMN's phagocytosis. But in the LCT/MUFA group, the extent of reduction was less than that of the first two groups, the difference was significant (P < 0.05). (2) The values of NBT reduction of PMN were significantly decreased in each of the three groups. The decrease in the values of NBT reduction had negative correlation with the concentrations of fat emulsions, which appeared in a dose-dependent way (b = -1.28, P < 0.01). (3) As the concentration increased, the chemotaxis of LCT group and LCT/MCT group decreased significantly, while in the LCT/MUFA group it was not significant (P < 0.05).Conclusions: In vitro conditions, the fat emulsions composed of different fatty acids could inhibit the immune functions of PMN. The higher the concentration of fat emulsion was, the more obvious the inhibition was observed. Compared with the LCT/MUFA group, the LCT group and the LCT/MCT group showed more pronounced inhibition on human neutrophil immune functions. confirmed the capability of stimulating restoration of significant muscle mass in injured sites. As the ECM of every tissue has a unique composition and structure that likely has direct effects on the host response, we hypothesize that skeletal muscle whole organ acellular matrix(SMWOACM), provides distinct advantages in muscle regeneration. Methods: Prepare volumetric porcine SMWOACM by perfusion decellularization and the resulting matrix was characterized the structure, composition, in vitro bioactivity, and in vivo remodeling in rodent partial thickness abdominal wall defect model, compared to nonhomologous ECM. After heparin pretreatment, myogenic cells systemically seeded or non-seeded SMWOACMs were implanted for canine rectus defect repair with the vascular bed inside SMWOACM connected to host circulation.Results: SMWOACM presented thorough decellularization while preserving the native architecture including hierarchical and complex three-dimensional organization of parallel arrayed basal lamina with tendinous connection surrounded by capillary network. SMWOACM contained growth factors, glycosaminoglycans, and basement membrane structural proteins. Myogenic cells proliferated, differentiated and arrayed well in SMWOACM in vitro. SMWOACM implanted area was shown better constructive remodeling response associated with scaffold degradation and myogenesis than nonhomologous ECM in rodent model. As to canine model, blood flow was maintained up to 48 hours followed by coagulation in SMWOACM, however the animals survived well without signs of infection and were still under follow-up.Conclusion: SMWOACM facilitates constructive and functional remodeling in injured tissues and it is a promising scaffold for volumetric muscle defect repair.Keywords: Skeletal muscle regeneration; Extracellular matrix; Whole organ acellular matrix; Vascularization; Innervation",

            "text": "Aim: To identify the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) tissues that could serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for GIST detection.Methods : We performed a quantitative RT-qPCR assay to analyze the expression of 1888 miRNAs from a sample set that included 54 GIST tissue samples.Results : We found that dysregulation of several miRNAs may be related to the malignance of GISTs. Six of these miRNAs, hsalet-7c, miR-218, miR-488#, miR-4683, miR-34c-5p and miR-4773, were selected as the final list of biomarkers to separate the malignant GISTs (M group) from the benign GISTs (B group). In addition, were used to distinguish between the borderline (BO group) and M groups. There were 11 common miRNAs selected to separate the benign and borderline (BB) group from the M group, including hsa-let-7c, miR-218, miR-628-5p, miR-204-3p, miR-204, miR-891b, miR-488#, miR-145, miR-891a, miR-34c-5p and miR-196a. CONCLUSION: The identified miRNAs appear to be novel biomarkers to distinguish malignant from benign GISTs, which may contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms of GIST Methods: The model of cancer-associated cachexia was generated by injecting murine C26 adenocarcinoma cells into BAlB/C mice. CFZ and z-VAD-fmk were administered into individually or in combination at 5 and 12 days after inoculation. Changes in body weight, gastrocnemius muscle mass, tumor burden, spontaneous activity, survival, and metabolic profiles were noted. Also evaluated were the circulatory levels of renin and angiotensin II, and levels of apoptotic, proteolytic, and renin-angiotensin system-associated markers and transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in gastrocnemius muscle.Results: The CFZ and z-VAD-fmk treatments were associated with less muscle wasting, reduced tumor burden, modulated metabolism, higher levels of glucose, albumin, and total proteins, and lower levels of triglyceride fatty acids, more spontaneous physical activity, and longer survival in C26-inoculated mice compared with PBS-treated cachectic mice. CFZ and z-VAD-fmk treatments resulted in higher levels of caspase-3 and Bax and lower level of Bcl-xL in gastrocnemius muscles and altered the level of proteins in the renin-angiotensin system. The combined treatment administered 5 days after C26 inoculation was more effective than other regimens.Conclusion: Combined treatment with CFZ and z-VAD-fmk early in the development of cachexia was associated with signs of less proteolysis and apoptosis and less severe cachexia in a mouse model of cancer-induced cachexia.",

Email address is: xuliangxman@ hotmail.com Purpose: In order to overcome the obstacle that detailed spatial relationships of the omental bursa to its related spaces cannot be displayed clearly by thick-slice sectional anatomical imaging and computed tomography, we designed a new approach to three-dimensional visualization.Methods: By Amira\u00ae software, we employed thin-slice crosssectional images of the upper abdomen retrieved from second Chinese Visible Human datasets to display the spatial relationships of the omental bursa to its related spaces, especially to the left subphrenic extraperitoneal spaces. Moreover, these spatial relationships were presented on three-dimensional sections reconstructed from second Chinese Visible Human images and computed tomography images.Results: Of importance, the left extraperitoneal space is located among the superior, inferior and splenic recesses. The appearance of the foramen bursae omenti majoris is the only pathway communicating between the superior and inferior recesses of the omental bursa, and also is the anatomic landmark between the superior and inferior recesses. The splenic recess is surrounded laterally by the splenic bare area, the left retroperitoneal space from anterior to posterior.Conclusion: As one of the subphrenic spaces, the omental bursa with its related spaces was imaged three-dimensionally using a visualization technique. Familiarity with the spatial relationships of the omental bursa to its related spaces, especially to left subphrenic extraperitoneal spaces, will be beneficial to determining the CT severity index score, as well as for locating the lesions in the left upper quadrant on CT or magnetic resonance images.Keywords Results: There were 660 cases with moyamoya disease, of which men had 326 cases of patients total 49.39%; Female patients with 334 cases, 50.61%. Of 660 Patients with moyamoya disease, 184 (28%) were positive for autoimmune antibodies, while 152 (83%) contained one antibodies was positive. 32 (17%) of these patients contained two or more than two antibody were positive.

Less frequently, ES/PNET has been reported in some extraskeletal locations primarily involving paravertebral locations, and along the genitourinary tract (kidneys, urinary bladder, and vagina). Retroperitoneal extraskeletal ES/PNET is exceedingly rare, with \ufe64 10 cases reported in the English literature.Methods : We present a case of retroperitoneal extraskeletal ES/PNET. A 40-year-old woman presented with a 6-month history of intermittent right flank pain was admitted to hospital. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 10-cm retroperitoneal mass that occupied the right hepatorenal recess. The patient eventually underwent retroperitoneal tumor resection.Results: Microscopic examination, immunohistochemical staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the diagnosis of ES/PNET. The patient's recovery was uneventful, and then she received a cycle of systemic chemotherapy including pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide.Conclusion: The overall prognosis of extraskeletal ES/PNET is poor. Multimodal therapy, combining adjuvant chemotherapy with local control treatment (surgery and radiation therapy), should be used to improve the prognosis. Objective: This MRI-based study was designed to identify a more accurate extension course of the posterior complex fistulous abscess and determine the significance of the deep posterior intersphincteric space and the deep postanal space.",

PICC can help avoid the pain of repeat punctures as well as reduce incidence of cytotoxic drug extravasation-induced phlebitis and tissue necrosis. With PICC, patient activity is not limited, which improves quality of life. Mechanical phlebitis is one of the most common postoperative complications of PICC. It can lead to patients` unplanned extubation if tube is not handled in time, not only increase the pain of the patients, but not be conducive to treatment and nursing work, also influence the treatment effect. To study the causes and features of mechanical phlebitis caused by peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) placement. Provide theoretical basis for the prevention of PICC-related mechanical phlebitis.The Methods: 77 patients were recruited to participate in a randomised, controlled trial in Qingdao, China. Demographic and Background: data, data related to PICC placement, complications after PICC placement, the patients' degree of comfort (determined via a questionnaire), and patients' costs for PICC maintenance were collected to compare the effects of the two methods. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to analyse the data; P < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. 77 cases of patients' nursing situation were analyzed retrospectively, to discuss the causes of mechanical phlebitis and the nursing measures.Results: In 77 cases, there are 8 cases turned out to be mechanical phlebitis. The occurrence rate is 10.4%. They occurred between 5 to 16 days and 6 cases occurred within 7 days. Among them, there are 5 cases of I degree phlebitis, 2 cases of II degree phlebitis, and 1 case of III degree phlebitis. The factors causing mechanical phlebitis are placement method placement position and nurses' experience.Result: Based on this analysis, we observed that these genes were the targets of approved therapies for colorectal cancer, and suggested that drugs approved for other indications may be repurposed for the treatment of colorectal cancer.Conclusion: This study highlights that use of publicly available data is cost effective solution to derive biological insights, and provides empirical evidence that the molecular basis of colorectal cancer can provide important leads for the discovery of new drugs.Keywords Objective: To summary the postoperative complications and investigate the main factors for prognosis of modified extended Morrow procedure on patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).Methods: We retrospectively summarized 150 consecutive HOCM patients who underwent surgical treatment by one surgeon in our hospital from June 2012 to December 2014.

The objective of this study was to examine the potential protective effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) and iloprost (IL) therapy on lung damage induced by limb ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rabbit model, using both biochemical and histopathological aspects.Methods: Forty New Zealand white rabbits were randomly allocated into one of five study groups: HBO group (single session of HBO treatment); IL group (25 ng/kg/min infusion of IL); HBO + IL group (both HBO and IL); Control group (0.9% saline only); and a sham group. Acute hind limb ischemia-reperfusion was established by clamping the abdominal aorta for 1 h. HBO treatment and IL infusion were administrated during 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion period. Blood pH, partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and levels of bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined at the end of the reperfusion period. Malondialdehyde was measured in the plasma and lung as an indicator of free radicals. After Aim: To investigate the effects of intramuscular IL-8 injection on hepatic tissues in an animal model in-vivo histopathologically.Methods: Twelve New Zealand white rabbits were used for this randomized, controlled, single-blinded interventional study. For six days, one gluteus maximus muscle was injected daily with 1 mcg/kg of IL-8 in six rabbits (Group A). The remaining 6 rabbits (to determine to normal porto-hepatic morphology of the rabbit genus) were in the sham group (Group B). At the end of the 7th day, all rabbits were sacrificed and livers were meticulously harvested. Microscopically, regional tissues were scored according to portal inflammation, focal necrosis, piecemeal necrosis and total impact. Results: Total impact score, portal inflammation, focal necrosis, and piecemeal necrosis were the histopathologic changes present in a higher incidence in the IL-8 group compared with the control group. The differences were significant when the groups were compared according to total impact score, portal inflammation, focal necrosis, and piecemeal necrosis according to Pearson's correlation (P < 0.05). The most significant differences were detected at the total impact scores (P = 0.002) and the portal inflammation scores (P = 0.008).Conclusion: Our results showed that IL-8 may damage hepatocytes. This can be the determined target for new therapeutic strategies. Further trials should be designed to obtain definitive results. Purpose: Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases (EGD) with the absence of any other disease which might cause eosinophilia in the gastrointestinal system (like parasitic infection, drug reaction, inflammatory intestinal disease) is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration and inflammation. EGD divides into subgroups like eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) and eosinophilic colitis (EC). All patients will not necessarily exhibit a serum Ig E increase and peripheric eosinophilia. Final diagnosis is established by biopsy.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the obtained data was conducted.Results: Shoulder belt and shoulder hypothermia was found in 22% of patients with CRS while this change has not been identified in patients with HAS. In the forearm hypothermia was detected in 15 patients (16, 8%) with CRS and in 17 patients (38, 6%) with HAS. \"Thermo amputation\" of hands and \"glove\" Background: Inadvertent hypothermia is a common effect of anesthesia and surgery which increases rates of perioperative adverse cardiovascular events, hematologic disturbances and infectious complications. Aim of this study is to investigate the efficiency of a standard normothermia protocol and effects on postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) rate.Methods: Between June 2013 and December 2014 elective, clean-contaminated, open major abdominal operations (hepatobiliary, upper gastrointestinal or colorectal; under general anesthesia, longer than 30 minutes) were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were emergent surgery, local/locoregional procedures, laparoscopic operations, minor abdominal operations (e.g. hernia repair, colostomy closure), malign hyperthermia, signs of active infection or fever, immunosuppression, severe malnutrition, kidney/liver failure and antibiotic use within the previous 1 week. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. In normothermia group perioperative management and warming was performed according to a standard normothermia protocol. Routine patient warming method regardless of a standard protocol was performed in control group. Except for normothermia protocol perioperative care considering ERAS protocols, medications and warming method were the same in both groups. Hypothermia was defined as body temperature (BT) lower than 36\u00b0C. Body temperature was monitored with infrared tympanic thermometer perioperatively and esophageal probe intraoperatively. Demographic characteristics, hospital stay, ASA, ASEPSIS and NNISS scores as well as BT in preoperative waiting room (T1), BT at 1st hour after intubation (T2), BT after extubation (T3) and BT in postoperative recovery room (T4) were recorded. Primary outcome was comparison of SSI rates between groups.Results: Of 73 patients 59 (22 in normothermia, 37 in control groups) were included in the analysis. Mean operative time was 203 (80-665) min, mean operation room temperature was 21.9 (17-26) \u00b0C. Groups were similar regarding demographic and surgical characteristics, operative time, wound classification; ASA, NNIS and SENIC scores. Mean T1, T2, T3 and T4 were 35.6 \u00b1 0.6, 35.9 \u00b1 0.6, 36 \u00b1 0.8 and 36.3 \u00b1 0.4, respectively. In normothermia group mean T2 (P = 0.018) and T3 (0.015) were significantly higher than control group. Overall SSI rate was 18.6% (n = 11). In normothermia group SSI rate was less (13.6%, n = 3) than control group (27.5%, n = 8) but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.512).Conclusion: Preliminary result of this study promote the benefits of a standard normothermia protocol in terms of maintaining normothermia and preventing SSI. maintained using chemotherapy in lower than maximal referred for HIPEC. The procedure remained safe not compromising the postoperative period.

The capacity of 1 center is not enough for 10 million population.A variety of gene polymorphisms associated with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis Background: Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare and chronic inflammatory disorder. Etiology of IGM remains unclarified. IGM mimics breast cancer regarding its clinical and radiological features.Although, IGM is generally considered as a benign disease, recent findings postulated that IGM may associate with and even be a precursor to breast cancer.Methods: In this study, we aimed to highlight that known genetic disorders that are associated with breast cancer may involve in the etiology of IGM.Results: Patient was female and 37 years old. She had a family history of breast cancer in aunt.The number of gravidity was 6 whilst parity was 4.Patient who was suffering from erythema, pain and swelling in the right breast applied our clinic on 5. months of pregnancy.Solid, hypoechoic mass lesions that were suspicious for malignity was determined by breast sonography. An increase in the level of serum leukocytes, C-reactive protein, sedimentation, prolactin, fibrinogen, CA 125 and CA 15-3 was determined in patient.Several polymorphisms in genes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase(MTHFR) C677 TT, \u03b2-fibrinogen-455 G/A, plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI) -1 5G/5G, angiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE) I/D, apolipoprotein(APO) -E E3/ E3 were detected by genetic analysis.IGM was diagnosed by trucut biopsy that helped for the differential diagnosis of IGM with breast cancer.Conclusion: Genetic polymorphisms may involve in the development of IGM as it was seen in our case.An association was also reported between breast cancer and mutations in MTHFR-C 677T, PAI-1, ACE, Apo-E genes.Other findings suggested that chronic IGM may eventually resultin breast cancer.A number of gene polymorphisms may initially cause to IGM and then the development of breast cancer. Further studies should be conducted to better clarify this plausible association. symptom were detected in 11 (2, 5%) and in 7 (15, 9%) of patients respectively with HAS.Quantitative analysis showed that the depth of hypothermia in shoulder girdle and shoulder of patients with CRS was -0,8 \u00b1 0,3\u00b0C. In patients with HAS these changes have not been identified. On the forearm segments hypothermia was -1,8 \u00b1 0,5\u00b0C at CRS and -1,4 \u00b1 0,5\u00b0C at HAS. At presence of CRS in the areas of hands and fingers hypothermia was -2,0 \u00b1 0,5\u00b0C and -3,1 \u00b1 0,6\u00b0C, but at presence of HAS -2,3+0,6\u00b0C and -2,9+0,6\u00b0C, respectively.These Results: can be used for differential diagnosis at CRS and HAS.Conclusions: CRS and HAS are characterized by a decrease in IIRR of the upper extremities.At the presence of HAS thermoasymmetry of shoulder belt and shoulder is not detected unlike in CRS.The most profound hypothermia of distal segments up to \"glove\" symptom and \"thermo amputation\" revealed at the presence of HAS.Cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC -15 years experience Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal peroperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) is currently a standard procedure for peritoneal surface malignancies of various origin. For slowly progressive, indolent, malignancies -pseudomyxoma peritonei and epithelial peritoneal mesothelioma -CRS+HIPEC became a frontline treatment with a curative potential maintaining a long-term survival. In other malignancies -ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, primary peritoneal carcinoma -CRS+HIPEC brings clear therapeutic benefit despite its effect is not curative.The availability of the procedure remains limited in CZ. For the last 15 years there has been only 1 active center covering 10 milion population. The therapeutic benefit for particular diagnoses has been compared.There were 279 procedures in 225 patients in a period 1999 -2014. The patient group included peritoneal pseudomyxoma (PMP) (62), ovarian cancer (46), peritoneal mesothelioma (36), colorectal cancer (CRCA) (34), primary peritoneal cancer (10) and others. The surgery included maximal cytoreduction, omentectomy and parietal peritonectomy as could be achieved. Open coliseum hyperthermic peritoneal chemotherapy followed using standardized regimens with mitomycin (PMP, CRCA), carboplatinum (ovarian, primary peritoneal cancer) or mitomycin C + doxorubicin combination (mesothelioma). The dosage based on an estimated absorbed dose that does not exceed a standard dose in systemic treatment. Early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) followed for PMP and CRCA using 5 day 5-fluorouracil.Letality of the procedures were 2.15%(6 pts), morbidity 23%. A median post-treatment survival illustrates the potential of the procedure. It has not been reached for PMP. It is 60 months for peritoneal mesothelioma, 26 months for CRCA and 22 months for ovarian cancer. The toxicity is mild, gr. III-IV toxicity is rare, 1 treatment related death was registered (haematologic toxicity). Completeness of cytoreduction (CCR 0-3) is a significant prognostic factor as expected. A routine procedure has been developed within 15 years providing treatment results comparable to those referred in earlier clinical trials.
