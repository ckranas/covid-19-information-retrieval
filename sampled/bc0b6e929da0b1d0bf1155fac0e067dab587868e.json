Results: 905 procedures were performed in 442 patients. The size of the treated tumors ranged from 5 to 60 mm (mean 28 mm). Major complications were diagnosed after 10 of 905 treatments (3 pneumothorax, 2 bleeds, 4 abscesses, 1 stenosis of the common bile duct) and minor complications were diagnosed after 37 of 905 treatments (24 small capsule hematoma, 10 prolonged pain, 3 small pneumothorax). No treatment related death happened. Conclusion: RFA with an overall complication rate in our series of about 5 % and a major complication rate of about 1% is a safe therapeutic option for patients suffering from primary or secondary liver tumors.",

Methods and Materials: During 2 years a total of 61 patients underwent salineenhanced RFA of liver tumors (59 secondary, 2 primary; mean size 41 mm, range 15-80, 1-4 nodules treated per session); 34 patients under local anesthesia with sedation (group 1) and 27 under general anesthesia (group 2). Results: Mean effective ablation time (min), ablation volume index (ablated volume/total nodule volume), % of patients with complete tumor ablation and % of patients free of recurence after 6-12 months in groups 1 vs. 2 were: 12 vs. 22; 61 vs. 94, 48 vs. 70, and 29 vs. 48, respectively. Incomplete tumor ablation and recurrence were more frequent in patients with larger tumors and in group 1. Apart from minor complications in 13%, only 5% of patients had major complication (1 liver abscess, 1 track seeding, 1 gallbladder injury). No procedure-related mortality was observed. Conclusion: RFA is a safe and efficient technique for local control of growth of liver tumors < 5 cm in diameter. Pain during procedure is a limiting factor and RFA under general anesthesia results in a better therapeutic response.",

            "text": "Purpose: When coagulation volume is insufficient in initial radiofrequency (RF) ablation additional concentric expansion of coagulation would be an ideal solution. However vaporization occuring around the electrode after RF application that hinders current delivery limits further coagulation. Whereas hypertonic saline injection prior to RF ablation is known to increase current conductivity and thereby enlarge coagulation volume. We tested whether hypertonic saline injection in the area of vaporization, followed by additional RF application could enlarge the coagulation volume. Methods and Materials: RF coagulation of excised porcine liver was performed in five different areas. First an RF electrode (Cool-tip) was coaxially placed through a cannula and coagulated a maximal area at output power of 40 W. Temperature of the liver near the electrode was continuously measured by a thermocouple and the margin of maximal coagulation was determined as a 49 \u00b0C area after 15 minutes. The RF electrode was then removed, 1.5 mL of 36% saline was infused through a coaxially placed PEI needle and RF application was resumed. Margin of maximal coagulation was then determined in the same way. Finally, coagulation areas were observed on cross-sections. Results: Enhancement of coagulation volume (by a distance of 4-15 mm; mean: 9 mm from the electrode) was confirmed in all cases after injection of 36% saline. The coagulation area was left-right symmetrical with a margin immediately adjacent to the thermocouple. Conclusion: Injection of a small amount of 36% saline in the area of vaporization followed by additional RF application can concentrically expand the coagulation volume, simplifying the treatment of larger lesions. Purpose: To evaluate clinical experience of percutaneous ablation of renal cell carcinoma using combined radiofrequency coagulation and ethanol injection. Methods and Materials: Nine patients (5 males, mean 68 years) presented with renal tumours. The tumour size was < 2 cm in 3, 2-3 cm in 4 and 3-4 cm in 3. All patients were either considered unfit for surgery or had refused it. Absolute ethanol (0.5-3 ml, mean 1.4 ml) was injected into the tumour immediately before treatment with radiofrequency. Radionics cool-tip electrodes were used in 8 patients and a Rita electrode in 1. CT follow-up was carried out the day after the procedure and three monthly thereafter for the first year. Follow-up 4-38 months, mean 20 months. Results: Complete coagulation necrosis was observed on CT in six patients after the first procedure. Two patients were retreated because of enhancing areas on CT, which may have represented residual disease. The mean hospital stay was 2 days. All the patients are well, except for one patient who has developed a colonic carcinoma. One patient had a subcapsular haematoma. Two patients had transient loin pain, treated conservatively. Conclusion: Combined therapy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection of renal tumours is an effective method of treatment, which destroys the tumour. It is tolerated well and is associated with few complications.",

Different primaries, mainly colorectal carcinomas (10/42 patients), had caused metastatic disease. Lesion size ranged from 8 to 85 mm (median 27.6 mm). Follow-up CT was performed monthly for the first three months, then after 3 and 6 months. Median follow-up was 7.6 months. Results: Ablative therapy was technically succesful in 62/64 lesions. In 7 cases therapy was completed after 2 sessions and in 2 cases after 3 sessions. An initial increase in size of the visualized correlate was seen in 25 cases and secondary cavities in 8 cases. Marked size reduction of the imaging correlate on further follow-up was demonstrated in 32 lesions. These patients were diagnosed successfully treated. Residual CT findings were: ground-glass opacity or cavitary defects. Complications were not significantly different to diagnostic lung biopsy. Incidence of recurrent tumor growth was significantly higher in lower segments (7-10), whereas there was no difference between central vs. peripheral location. Conclusion: Laser-induced thermal ablation is a promising option in multimodal therapy of non-resectable lung metastases. Feasibility is correlated to target location. Interval reduction for therapy success evaluation is a future task. Background: It is well described that \"vulnerable\" atheromatous plaque has a thin, fibrous cap and extensive lipid core with associated inflammation. This inflammation can be detected as areas of signal drop on MR imaging using a novel contrast medium, Sinerem, an Ultrasmall Super-Paramagnetic Iron Oxide (US-PIO). Studies using USPIO have, thus far, not reported its additional T1 effect of enhancing fibrous cap. Methods: 20 patients with carotid stenosis (10 symptomatic, 10 asymptomatic) were imaged with 1.5 T, pre and 36 hours post USPIO infusion. Images were anonymised, plaque seen was manually segmented into quadrants (CMR tools, London) and focal regions of signal drop post contrast. Signal change was normalised to adjacent muscle. Results: There were 9 males and 11 females and mean ages were 71 (symptomatic) and 73 (asymptomatic). Mean stenoses were 82% (symptomatic) and 72% (asymptomatic). Symptomatic patients had significantly more quadrants with signal drop post USPIO than asymptomatic patients (75% vs 32%, p < 0.01)and more focal regions of signal drop (0.68 vs 0.26 regions/image, p < 0.01). Asymptomatic subjects had more quadrants with signal enhancement than those with symptoms (68% vs 25%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Symptomatic plaques had more focal areas of signal drop than asymptomatic plaques, suggesting that they harboured a greater inflammatory burden. Asymptomatic plaques showed more enhancement than symptomatic plaques, suggesting thicker fibrous caps and greater stability, although some focal areas of signal drop were noted suggesting vulnerability.",

Methods: 30 previously untreated symptomatic patients (24m,6w) suffering from suspected carotid artery stenosis were included. Standardized MD-CT-angiography was performed using 16-row-and 64-row-scanners. 3D-CE-MRA was performed using a 1.5 Tesla scanner with 12-channel surface-coils. PAT using SENSE reconstruction with an acceleration factor of 2 was applied. MIP and MPR were calculated for CTA and MRA. Two blinded neuroradiologists independently quantitatively assessed the degree of stenosis separately for each modality following modified NASCET criteria. Furthermore visual assessment and evaluation of plaque morphology were performed. Image reading results were compared to surgical and duplex sonographic findings which served as a standard of reference in all patients.

However, the association of CCA-IMT with risk for transient ischemic attacks (TIA) is less clear. Moreover, recent data suggest that incidence of stroke is related to CCA-IMT even in the absence of carotid plaque. We investigated whether CCA-IMT and presence of carotid plaque are associated with risk for non-embolic TIA after adjusting for major risk factors in a case-control series. Methods and Materials: Our study population comprised of 80 consecutive patients undergoing carotid ultrasonography during hospitalization for documented first TIA (TIA Working Group Definition 2002) and 245 asymptomatic control subjects undergoing screening evaluation. Patients with known cardioembolic sources were excluded. We selected 160 controls (2:1) by propensity score matching in order to estimate with minimal bias the independent effect of CCA-IMT and plaque presence. Results: Patients and controls were matched for age (66 \u00b1 10 vs. 65 \u00b1 13 yrs, p = 0.492), gender (55.0% vs. 56.2% male, p = 0.854), smoking (28.8% vs. 30.6%, C D E F B A G p = 0.686), hypertension (57.5% vs. 61.2%, p = 0.576), diabetes (18.8% vs. 20.0%, p = 0.817), and dyslipidemia (39.4% vs. 36.2%, p = 0.639). Compared to control subjects (0.68 \u00b1 0.13 mm), CCA-IMT in TIA patients (0.73 \u00b1 0.13 mm) was significantly higher (p = 0.01). The incidence of plaques did not differ in the two groups (63.8% vs. 71.2%, p = 0.31). In multivariate analyses, only CCA-IMT emerged as independent predictor (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Increased CCA-IMT is associated with higher risk for non-embolic TIA in addition to established risk factors. This effect is independent of the presence of carotid plaque.",

Purpose: To evaluate whether pre-treatment CT perfusion analysis in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (CAS) can be used to distinguish between groups of patients that differ with respect to improvement in cerebral perfusion after carotid intervention. Methods and Materials: Thirty-six patients with symptomatic CAS and no significant contralateral disease were scanned before and 1 month after primary stent placement (n = 21) or carotid endarterectomy (n = 15) using a multi-detector CT scanner. We calculated the difference in mean transit time (dMTT) and ratio of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between symptomatic and asymptomatic hemispheres. We classified patients into three groups according to the pre-treatment dMTT: group 1, dMTT < 1s, group 2, dMTT 1-2s and group 3, dMTT > 2s. We studied changes in brain perfusion for the whole group and separately for the three subgroups by comparing pre-and post treatment dMTT and rCBF using a paired ttest. Results: For the total group mean dMTT decreased from 1.3s before to 0.1s after treatment (p < 0.001), mean rCBF increased from 0.85 to 0.93 (p = 0.02). In group 1 (n = 16) dMTT and rCBF did not significantly improve, in group 2 (n = 12) only dMTT improved significantly, and in group 3 (n = 8) both dMTT and rCBF improved significantly. Conclusion: Pre-treatment dMTT is a suitable CT perfusion measure to distinguish between groups of patients with different improvement of cerebral perfusion after carotid intervention. In 22% of patients significant improvement in dMTT and rCBF was seen. This might hold promise for selecting patients that benefit most from carotid intervention. Purpose: Patients with critical ICA stenosis benefit from endarterectomy but those with occlusion or long-segment tight stenosis (trickle-flow) do not. Distinguishing between these two on conventional ultrasound is problematic as it is insensitive to very slow flow. The current reference standard is digital-subtraction angiography (DSA).

High resolution post contrast acquisition in the optimal image orientation should always be applied for the diagnosis of myometrial invasion and acquired between 90 and 150 seconds after intravenous contrast injection; optimal timing of image acquisition depends on the chosen 2D or 3D technique. If cervical invasion is suspected additional slice orientation according to the axis of the endocervical channel is recommended. Due to the limited sensitivity of MR imaging to detect lymph node metastasis retroperitoneal lymph node screening with pre-contrast sequences is optional. Possible lymph node invasion should be suggested indirectly based on tumor grade at endometrial tissue sampling and myometrial and cervical invasion detected at MR imaging. Purpose: Despite excellent contrast /spatial resolution at 3 T Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) in neuro-imaging, its potential for body area remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate MR imaging of the female pelvis at 3 T/ 1.5 T on high-resolution T2 weighed image (T2WI), HASTE, and Diffusion weighted image (DWI). Material and Methods: MR images of 19 healthy women were obtained by 3 T/ 1.5 T (Trio/Symphony:Siemens) MR unit using phased array coil with the following imaging parameters; T2WI (Axial/Sagittal): TR/TE=3200-3600/94-103 ms, FOV/voxel size = 260x195/0.8x0.6x2.0 mm, NEX=2.

Concordance between MR imaging and histological diagnosis was 88.4% (23 over 26 cases), with mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy respectively of 89.5%, 97.5% and 95.1%. Conclusion: Our preliminary results show that 3 T MR imaging proved to be a reliable and accurate tool in assessing the depth of myometrial infiltration in endometrial cancer. Its accuracy falls in the highest rate of diagnostic accuracy achievable by 1.5 T MR imaging. Our inclusion MR imaging criteria for adnexal malignancy were: contrast-enhanced solid lesions, contrast-enhanced solid component in mixed lesions (except those with low-signal intensity solid component on T2WI), contrast-enhanced papillary projections in cystic lesions (except those with low-signal intensity papillary projections on T2WI) or septal thickness \u2265 3 mm. Ascites, peritoneal metastasis and pelvic enlarged lymph nodes were also inclusion criteria for malignancy. Results: By MR imaging evaluation 90 adnexal lesions were malignant and 64 C D E F B A G were benign. Histologically, 85 masses were confirmed to be malignant (ovarian: 62 carcinomas, 15 epithelial borderline tumors (BT), 2 tumors with uncertain malignant potential; 5 fallopian tube carcinomas and 1 mesosalpinx BT); 69 were benign (63 ovarian tumors, 4 functional cysts), 1 peritoneal pseudocyst and 1 epiploic appendix esteatonecrosis. Correlating MR imaging with histology results we confirmed 83 were malignant (true positive) and 62 were benign (true negative) lesions. The MR sensitivity and specificity for malignancy were 90% and 98%, respectively. MR reached an accuracy of 94% with a 92% positive predictive value and 97% negative predictive value for malignant adnexal lesions. Conclusion: MR has an excellent accuracy with a very high predictive value for the diagnosis of malignant adnexal lesions. Purpose: Ovarian tumours with borderline malignant potential have a favourable outcome. Characterisation of mixed solid and cystic ovarian masses pre-operatively can aid in surgical planning and may allow preservation of fertility in younger patients. This study examines the imaging characteristics of borderline ovarian tumours in comparison with other encapsulated ovarian masses. Methods and Materials: 49 patients with 59 encapsulated ovarian lesions were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent MR evaluation of suspicious pelvic adnexal masses between June 2001 and June 2004. MR imaging was performed at 1.5 or 3 T (GE LX Signa systems) using a flexible 4 or 8 channel torso coil respectively. FRFSE images were acquired sagittally, axially and obliquely followed by T1W FSPGR \u00b1 fat suppression as determined clinically. Buscopan and a dielectric pad at 3 T were used to minimise artefacts. Histopathology was available in all subjects. Results: Ovarian cysts ranged in size from 0.9 to 26 cms. All cystadenomas (14), fibromas (2), a haemorrhagic cyst (1) and 2/3 cystadenocarcinomas were correctly diagnosed. MR correctly called 49% of cystadenofibromas, but 51% was misclassified as cystadenomas or fibroma (1/31). 3/6 borderline tumours were correctly identified, 2 classified as cystadenoma or indeterminate cyst and one termed cystadenocarcinoma, although omental deposits were present in this case. Typical features seen in the correctly diagnosed borderline tumours included endocystic projections separately identified from an intact ovarian capsule. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of MR imaging in pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses and indicates the need for high resolution imaging preferably at 3 T.",

All nodules had well-defined borders, low signal intensity with small hyperintense spots on T2weighted MR (18 cases). All were homogeneous and hypoechoic on TVUS. Spiculated strandings were more often seen on MR (44 cases) than on TVUS (35 cases). Deep wall extension was correctly diagnosed as a hypoechoic or hypointense homogeneous thickening of muscle layer in 32 cases on TVUS (Se : 74%) and 41 cases on MR (Se : 95%). An additional pattern as a hyperintense layer of mucosa surrounding the nodule was found on MR in all cases.

The FAIR value and rCBV of all cases showed positive linear correlation (P < 0.05). Conclusion: FAIR and CE MR imaging methods are both helpful in differentiating benign from malignant glioma. The significant positive linear correlation in detecting tumoral blood perfusion between FAIR and CE MR imaging methods suggests that FAIR imaging, like CE MR imaging perfusion, is complementary to routine MR imaging in the assessment of tumoral perfusion. Furthermore, because there is no need for contrast enhancement, FAIR imaging, a non-invasive technique, will be more acceptable in clinical application. Purpose: Pathologically, there is microscopic infiltration of tumoral cells across the corpus callosum (CC) in patients with high grade gliomas. The aim of this study is to determine if there are DTI changes within the normal appearing CC and contralateral white matter (WM-CONT) and if there are differences between glioma grades. Methods and Materials: 30 patients with primary glioma -classified using the WHO classification as low-grade (n = 10), anaplastic (n = 12) and glioblastoma multiforme (n = 8) -had DTI performed using a pulsed gradient, double spin echo, echo planar imaging (TR/TE=5300/74; 128x128 matrix; 220x220 mm FOV; fortyfive 3 mm contiguous slices; b= 1000 s/mm 2 ) at 1.5 T. ROIs were placed in the CC in three locations, the ipsilateral callosum (CC-IPSI), central callosum (CC-CENT) and contralateral callosum (CC-CONT) to the side of the glioma, as well as within the WM-CONT. FA and ADC were measured. Results: There is significantly increased ADC (p = 0.003) and decreased FA (p < 0.001) in the CC-IPSI and in the CC-CENT (p = 0.007, and p < 0.001 respectively) in grade III gliomas compared with grade II. There is also significantly decreased FA in the normal appearing WM-CONT (p = 0.017), as well as the CC-IPSI (p = 0.02), CC-CENT (p = 0.001) and CC-CONT (p = 0.012) in grade IV compared to grade II. Conclusion: DTI is able to demonstrate changes in FA and ADC in the normal appearing corpus callosum of grades III and IV and contralateral white matter of grade IV, indicating potential microscopic tumoral infiltration. Purpose: New treatments for patients suffering from glioblastoma have shown promising results.

The analysis used clinical parameters combined with classical criteria on tumour size variation to focus on disease progression. Results: Among the 41 patients included in the study (311 MR imaging examinations), 32 demonstrated disease progression at some time in their follow-up.

Negative correlation existed between MD values and Ki-67 LI (r s = -0.570, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In brain gliomas, Ki-67 LI bears a significant relationship to MD values.

The MD value of DTI is regarded as a noninvasive MR imaging biomarker for evaluating cell proliferation in gliomas. Purpose: To asses the validity of a treatment response evaluation system established for malignant gliomas to patients with primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL). Methods and Materials: MR imaging examinations of 112 immunocompetent patients with biopsy-proven PCNSL were retrospectively evaluated for response to primary MTX-based chemotherapy according to the Macdonald criteria. The response classification was compared to the further course and treatment of the disease with the aim of identifying patients who did not achieve complete response (CR) but nevertheless remained progression-free for at least 6 months without receiving further therapy. Results: Sixty-eight patients had persisting contrast-enhancing lesions after primary therapy. Four patients of this cohort did not receive further tumour-directed therapy. After follow-up of 9, 24, 32 and 54 months, all 4 patients did not present with progressive tumour growth. In all 4 patients, the residual lesions were 5 mm in diameter or smaller. In all patients, the residual lesion was found in the vicinity of the biopsy site. Conclusion: Residual contrast enhancement may be observed in PCNSL patients after successful therapy and does not necessarily indicate residual, biologically active lymphoma. On the basis of the morphology of the non-progressive residual lesions in the patients described above, we propose a modification of the Macdonald response criteria which, in the absence of perilesional oedema, classifies contrast-enhancing lesions < 3 mm in general, or contrast-enhancing lesions < 5 mm in the region of biopsy, haemorrhage, infection or a previously larger (> 5 cm) tumour lesion as CR. Purpose: To evaluate with MR imaging the spinal epidural and leptomeningeal infiltration in patients with lymphoma and leukemia and correlate the results with lumbar puncture. Methods and Materials: 50 patients with ALL, AML and NHL and with clinical suspicion of spinal extra-medullary intra-dural spread underwent MR imaging using a 1.0 T superconductive magnet. We performed sagittal-SE-T1-weighted scans (TR: 500 ms; TE: 20 ms; n-acq: 3; acq-time: 3'40\") and FSE-T2-weighted scans (TR: 2840 ms; TE: 96 ms; acq-time: 3'30\") at the level of the dorsal and lumbar spine (sl. thickn: 4 mm). Then we performed contrast-enhanced sagittal-T1-weighted scans. In positive cases we also performed axial FSE-T2-weighted scans and contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted scans. All the patients underwent lumbar puncture within two days after MR examination. Results: We detected 10 patients with positive features of spinal epidural and leptomeningeal infiltration on MR imaging. Among these 10 patients only 7 had a positive lumbar puncture (\"blast\" forms or lymphomatous cells in CSF). Lumbar puncture was negative when the neoplastic infiltration involved the epidural space and the nerve roots. The most sensitive MR imaging-sequence in the detection of spinal epidural and leptomeningeal involvement has been considered the sagittal T1-weighted scans performed after administration of Gadolinium-DTPA. Conclusion: In our limited experience MR imaging was more sensitive than lumbar puncture in the detection of spinal epidural and leptomeningeal spread by hemopoietic tumors. The diagnosis of leptomeningeal spread is fundamental because it modifies the therapeutic measures and its early symptoms are often nonspecific. In patients with a hemopoietic neoplasm and strong clinical suspicion of spinal epidural or leptomeningeal infiltration, when lumbar puncture is negative, MR imaging should be performed.",

The aim was to investigate the response of brain tumors to a modulation of venous blood oxygenation by breathing air, carbogen and oxygen. Methods and Materials: Data from six patients (four with glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV), one with astrocytoma (grade II), and one with a cerebral metastasis; all histologically confirmed) were acquired using a 3D gradient-echo, first-order velocity compensated sequence on a 1.5 T scanner (TE/TR/ alpha=40 ms/67 ms/25, FOV=256x192x64, matrix=512x192x64). One scan was acquired for each breathing condition. SWI was computed by multiplying the magnitude images with phase masks calculated from the same scans. Additionally, venous vascularization was assessed on minimum intensity projections of the SWI scan acquired during air breathing. Signal changes were evaluated over ROIs of typically 0.5 cm3 (15x15x10 voxels) and maps of relative signal changes were computed. Results: Signal intensities in the tumor decreased during carbogen breathing compared to oxygen inhalation in 3 cases. The glioblastomas displayed the strongest response and high heterogeneity (signal changes between -7% and +28%). The astrocytoma and cerebral metastasis showed a negative response to carbogen in all ROIs ranging from -9.3% to -2.0% (astrocytoma) and -8% to -16% (cerebral metastasis). C D E F B A G Methods and Materials: A total of 495 sets of screen-negative mammograms (prediagnostic mammogram and the immediate previous mammogram) were collected from women participating in the biennial Dutch screening programme (250 control-and 245 cancer cases). These mammograms were read by 15 experienced radiologists who were blinded to outcome. Results were used to calculate the relationship among recall rate, detection rate and numbers of false-positives. Results: Increasing the recall rate from 1% to 2% would increase the detection rate from 4.2% to 4.5% due to the earlier detection of interval cancers. Moreover, 0.5%of the screen-detected cancers would be detected 2 years earlier (late-detected cancers). For each 1% incremental increase in recall rate above 5%, the detection rate would increase by approximately 0.03% only, with positive predictive values decreasing to below 10%. Conclusion: Breast cancer can be detected earlier by lowering the threshold for recall, especially for recall rates of 1% -4%. To benefit most from a higher recall rate, radiologists should be able to identify the cancers with subtle mammographic features, which are often based on temporal changes. [JNCI 2005; 97:748] Purpose: We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that interval cancers arising soon after the previous screen and true interval cancers are biologically aggressive and have a relatively poor prognosis.

Clinical data, breast imaging reports, biopsy results and breast surgery reports were collected of all women with a positive screening result with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Results: Of 196,317 mammographic screening examinations, 2,106 (1.1%) were positive screens. Seven regional hospitals performed the workup of 2,097 women with a positive screen examination and complete follow-up. Breast cancer was diagnosed in 992 women. A total of 58 (5.8%) women with a true positive screen experienced a delay in breast cancer diagnosis exceeding three months. This delay was due to erroneous mammographic interpretation of suspicious lesions as benign or probably benign lesions (40 cases), benign biopsies from a malignant lesion (13), and omission to biopsy or remove a lesion, that was suspicious at breast imaging (4) or core biopsy (1). The proportion of women who experienced a delay exceeding three months in breast cancer diagnosis after a true positive screen ranged from 0-9.4% between the seven hospitals. Conclusion: Hospitals that are involved in the workup of women with a positive screen examination show a large variation in the percentage of patients who experience a delay in breast cancer diagnosis. A majority of the delays are caused by radiological misinterpretation of suspicious lesions.",

Mean reporting time was 13 min for primary 2D approach and 7 min 30 sec for 2D + CAD system. Conclusion: In our preliminary experience 2D + CAD approach does not improve accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for expert radiologists, but it reduces mean reporting time. Accuracy and sensitivity improve for the non-expert radiologist. Purpose: Can CAD-systems detect mammographically non-detected malignant breast lesions on priors and if so, how early? Methods and Materials: All available prior mammograms (PM) of patients suffering from breast cancer later detected at our department were retrospectively analyzed by CAD and by radiologist with full knowledge (and availability) of the malignancy containing mammogram (MCM), that yielded cancer detection. 278 mammograms (97 patients) were analyzed in consensus in order to verify whether a lesion was already visible earlier. Images were analyzed using Second Look 6.0 (iCAD) and correlated to MCM. The earliest mammogram with the correct C D E F B A G detection of the (later diagnosed) malignancy was used for statistical analysis. Time intervals PM-MCM was scored: G1:< 0.5; G2:< 1y; G3:< 1.5y; G4:< 2 y; G5:< 3y; G6:> 3y. Results: 53/97 and 17/97 patients had a retrospectively visible mass and microcalcification, respectively. 30/53 masses were detected by CAD in 1 and 4 in both views (64%). 8/17 MC were detected in 1 and 7/17 in both views (88%). Time interval vs. detection rate for masses was G1: 10/14 (71%), G2: 4/7 (57%), G3: 3/ 5 (60%), G4: 5/7 (71%), G5: 3/9 (33%), G6: 9/11 (81%); for microcalcifications G1: 1/2, G2: 3/4, G3: 1/1, G4: 2/2, G5: 2/2, G6: 6/6. Conclusion: About half of the initially non-detected cancer containing mammograms had a mammographically visible lesion, being not suspicious according to BI-RADs. CAD detected the majority of such MC and masses. Earliest detections of later diagnosed malignancies were dated more than 3 years prior to the radiological detection. Thus, CAD might be a promising tool in this application.",

Methods and Materials: 110 patients undergoing breast MR imaging (6/2003-12/2003 ) with histopathological verification were included. Wash in was differentiated into < 50% (CAD: No colour coding), 50-100% and > 100% uptake; later enhancement type into continued enhancement, plateau and wash out, as determined by 3 radiologists and compared to CAD and histopathology. Worst curve evaluation analysis by CAD (Confirma, USA) was used. Results: 11/110 examinations were not transferable to CAD (inoptimal data storage, incomplete data). Out of 117 malignant and 58 benign lesions enhancement was judged to be congruent in 71/117 and 23/58 lesions regarding wash in and 74/117 and 20/58 regarding later enhancement type (radiological interpretation vs. CAD result). Radiologists scored enhancement of 5 malignancies/DCIS as unsuspicious, CAD only 1 (thus CAD detected 4 more malignancies/DCIS). Benign lesions were scored as rapidly enhancing in 20 cases (radiologist) and 19 cases (CAD); wash out rate was 9 (radiologists) and 19 (CAD) (thus CAD detected 10 more false positive cases). Using updated software transferability increased, volume calculation was possible in all except one lesion, and dynamic coding was similar; no miscalculations of cardiac enhancement occurred. Conclusion: CAD offers for the very first time a reliable, automated analysis of enhancement types within a breast lesion. Analysis of enhancement types is not always congruent among radiologists and radiologists vs. CAD, suggesting a higher rate of pathological enhancement types in benign lesions using CAD; CAD is however more sensitive for any enhancement, including that of premalignancies. Purpose: Malignant melanoma is a tumor with rising incidence, frequently associated with multiple lesions throughout the body. Therapy monitoring requires reliable imaging and post processing methods for measuring tumor burden and therapy response. The RECIST criteria are the current standard for therapy monitoring of solid tumors, with inherent disadvantages. This pilot study evaluates the feasibility of volumetry as a more accurate measurement. Methods and Materials: Multislice-CT was performed in 25 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma, covering neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis with 1 mm collimation using a standardized imaging protocol. Post-processing was performed using semi-automated 3D-volumetric analysis software (OncoTreat, MeVis, Germany). Suspicious lymph nodes (LN), (n = 120) were evaluated by two independent readers using volume [ml] , time [s] , quality of segmentation [unacceptable-excellent] and number of corrections [n] . Additionally, 20 LN were segmented manually.",

The average time for automated segmentation per LN was 70-100s, including the manually corrected ones. Average segmentation time for the primary manual segmentation was 180-200s per LN. Conclusion: Semi-automated 3D-volumetric analysis allows a reliable, fast and convenient segmentation of lymph nodes and should be further evaluated for monitoring tumor burden in a larger patient population. Purpose: To develop a prototypical software assistant for the volumetric measurement of metastases and tumors in lung, liver, brain and lymph nodes to support planning and monitoring of chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: Hybrid segmentation algorithms have been developed that make use of contrasts in density as well as of morphology information to segment the different types of lesions. For follow-up examinations the task of locating the corresponding lesion in the new scan is simplified by automatic matching of corresponding lesion positions. Additionally, all information about the processed lesions is summarized in a report, which includes a table containing volumes, volume growth and doubling time for each lesion. Results: A reproducibility study was performed with 96 lung metastases (minimum diameter 4.6 mm, average 11.1, maximum 59.6) and showed a low interobserver variability of the volumetry (median: 0.1%) and a low inter-scan (i.e. volume of the same lesions in different scans obtained within a few minutes and measured by different observers) variability (median: 4.7%). A second reproducibility study was carried out with 86 liver metastases processed by 3 radiologists with the developed application and showed a low median inter-observer variability of 7 %. The average processing time for each lesion is about 1-2 sec. Conclusion: The proposed software tool is able to measure oncological lesions in lung, liver and brain as well as enlarged lymph nodes in the same application, and has the potential to improve treatment planning and monitoring with respect to accuracy, robustness, speed, and convenience.",

The aim was to develop, test, and evaluate a neural network-based quantification system for PBV by computer-assisted segmentation of multispectral MR imaging data. Methods and Materials: MR examination was performed in six women with relapsing-remitting MS (aged 23-46 years, 1.5-T system, T1w\u00b1C, T2w/PDw SE, FLAIR, MT\u00b1C). After preprocessing (image registration, automatic inhomogeneity correction), PBV was computed by automatic CSF segmentation using a threelayer feed-forward radial-basis-functions (RBF) neural network: The voxel-specific gray-level intensity spectrum forms a 7-dimensional feature vector which is classified by the neural network as belonging to CSF or not. As a reference, PBV results were compared to the conventional angle-image method which only uses T2w and PDw data. For quality assessment w.r.t. observer-induced effects, training data for the neural network were defined by two different observers independently. The same holds for threshold definition using the angle-image method. Results: Neural network-based PBV computation outperformed the conventional angle-image method as expressed by inter-/intra-observer agreement indices (British Standards Institution) of 0.971/0.982 for RBF-neural network compared to 0.937/0.952 for angle-image. The method-induced differences proved to be statistically significant (univariate F-test, N=6, p < 0.01). The neural network specifically performed better by avoiding misclassifications in white-matter-lesions that can hardly be distinguished from CSF by retrieving only T2w and PDw signals. Conclusion: Computer-assisted machine learning based PBV quantification using RBF neural network segmentation based on multispectral MR imaging data yields competitive results w.r.t. inter-and intra-observer agreement levels.",

Methods: Twelve calcaneus were imaged at 1.5 T and 3.0 T with a gradient echo (Flash) sequence and with a spin echo (TSE) sequence, using identical sequence parameters. Relaxation times were measured. SNR in corresponding sections of the calcaneus were evaluated and correlated with relaxation times (T 1 , T 2 , and T 2 * ). Results: Qualitative analysis showed a better contrast at 3 T than at 1.5 T. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that magnetic susceptibility effects reduce the T 2 * and, because of diffusion effects, also reduce the apparent T 2 relaxation time. Conclusion: Our results explain quantitatively the SNR gain obtainable in Flash and TSE images of trabecular bone at 3 T with respect to 1.5 T. Generally, in soft tissues like brain tissue, the SNR gain at 3 T with respect to 1.5 T is about 2, while in trabecular bone tissue is less than 30% in Flash images. This is because of the internal gradient effects due to magnetic susceptibility difference between trabecular compact bone and bone marrow in spongy bone.",

Mentzel, J. Blume, D. Tuchscherer, G. Lehmann, J. B\u00f6ttcher, E. Kauf, W.A. Kaiser; Jena/DE (hans-joachim.mentzel@med.uni-jena.de) Purpose: Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of developing osteopenia and osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate a radiogrammetrically based bone densitometric technology on children and adolescents. Methods and Materials: 25 patients (11 female, 14 male; 10y -18y) suffering chronic inflammatory bowel disease were included. Bone mineral density (BMD) was estimated from a plain radiograph of the non dominant hand using the Pronosco X-Posure System for Digital radiogrammetry (DXR). DXR-BMD and DXR-MCI were evaluated at the three middle metacarpals. BMD was also evaluated by DXA (Hologic, QDR 4500 A) at lumbar spine and femur and by pQCT at the distal radius (Stratec, XCT 900) . Spearman correlation between the results of the different methods was performed for statistical analysis. Results: There was a significant correlation (p < 0.01) between DXR-BMD and DXA-BMD at the lumbar spine (r = 0.79) and DXA-BMD at the femur (r = 0.56). DXR-MCI correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with DXA-BMD at the lumbar spine (r = 0.75) and DXA-BMD at the femur (r = 0.50), and cortical BMD at the distal radius (r = 0.43). Conclusion: This study suggests that digital radiogrammetry shows a significant correlation to the standard method DXA. Practicable, non-invasive DXR-technology may be a possible adjunct to give information about the development of the individual BMD and risk of fracture in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease.",

Kauffmann, P.-J. Meeder; Heidelberg/DE (gerd_noeldge@med.uni-heidelberg.de) Purpose: To evaluate long-term results (up to 3 years) for pain relief and stabilization of traumatic and osteoporotic fractures treated with CPC and PMMA by kyphoplasty. Methods and Material: Between June 2002 and September 2005, 355 patients ranging from 18 to 89 years (mean: 64.8 yrs) were treated. Results: CPC (Calcibon) was used in 103 and PMMA in 252 patients. 3.7 -9.9 ml of bone cement was used in 585 vertebral bodies. 92 fresh fractures (osteoporosis /trauma) and 8 unstable fractures (internal fixation prior to kyphoplasty) were treated. Good functional results (EVOS) of the treated segments with pain relief were achieved in nearly 93% 48 hours after the procedure and could be maintained in about 70% for 12 months and in 48% after 36 months under permanent accompanying medical antiosteoporotic therapy. Vertebral augmentation of the fracture could be achieved between 1 -3 mm in about 65% and in fresh traumatic fractures up to 4 mm. Recurrence of pain occurred in about 30% (12 months) and in 65% (36 months) was due to new fractures of neighbouring vertebral bodies. Cement leakage could be visualized in 18.5% without neurological symptoms. Conclusion: The Heidelberg interdisciplinary concept of more than 3 years experience seems to be very convincing for the treatment of osteoporotic and traumatic fractures with very good initial results in terms of stabilization, pain relief, and functional and clinical outcome. (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline. MR imaging was performed at least twice during the 12 months treatment and at the end. MR imaging and CT were reviewed by a senior musculoskeletal radiologist. Morphological changes of abscesses, signal intensity changes of vertebral bodies and discs were analysed and recorded. Results: Initial MR imaging showed oedema of 75 to 100% of the vertebral body in all cases. All patients improved clinically except one with cervical dislocation, who died immediately after surgery. Weight gain was almost totally achieved at 6 months and pain relief at 9 months. Biological inflammatory syndrome vanished at 3 months. On MR imaging, paravertebral abscesses disappeared respectively at 3, 6 and 12 months in 24%, 35% and 88% of the cases. Improvement of vertebral body bone marrow oedema with conversion to a fatty signal occurred in 30% of cases at 6 months and 53% at 12 months. Epidural abscesses disappeared at 9 months in 100% of cases. Conclusion: Significant imaging lesions persist at the end of treatment despite a good outcome. Therefore MR imaging should not be used to define the duration of therapy if clinical and biological evolution are favourable.",

All scans were performed on a 1.5 T Siemens Vision and were reviewed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist. The status of the C5 to T1 roots on every MR myelogram was evaluated for: intact rootlets, nerve root avulsion or injury (partial or complete), and pseudomeningocele formation. The MR imaging findings were recorded and correlated with the findings at surgical exploration for each root level. Results: Altogether 35 roots evaluated had surgical correlation. For detection of root avulsion injury, the overall sensitivity and specificity was 100% and 71% respectively, with positive and negative predictive values of 84% and 100%. For complete avulsions, the sensitivity and specificity was 88% and 71% respectively. Twelve of 28 (43%) proven root avulsions had no associated pseudomeningocele on MR myelography. In this study, all cases with pseudomeningoceles detected by 3D MR myelography, had root avulsions found at surgery. Conclusion: Our experience shows that 3D-CISS MR myelography is accurate for detecting root avulsions in adult traumatic BPI. The ability of this technique to demonstrate root avulsions in the absence of pseudomeningoceles significantly improves the accuracy of MR imaging in detecting pre-ganglionic injuries.",

Methods and Materials: Health Optimum, approved and co-funded by the European Community, began in May 2004 and will end in January 2006. It involves Spain-Aragona (oncology, haematology, radiology, dialysis and laboratory), Denmark-County of Funen (cardiology and endocrinology) and Italy-Veneto region as coordinator (12 healthcare structures for neurosurgical counselling, POCT-laboratory and regional EHR), with other technological and organisational partners. Neurosurgical tele-counselling wants to satisfy the need to give fast and formalized answers for urgent cases of cranial and vertebro-medullary trauma, linking central neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists to peripheral ER, neurology and intensive-care. The form management system is based on XML-CDAv2 and HL7 standard; digital signature follows law and rules; CT images are in DICOM format. To share telemedicine documents we choose the IHE XDS profile (Cross Enterprise Document Sharing). To manage security we use IHE ATNA profile (Audit Trail Node Authentication) and XUA profile (Cross Enterprise User Authentication). Results: Physicians have reorganized workflow using a telemedicine approach, and they have defined a standard clinical data set. This demonstrates that the avoidance of unnecessary transfer of patients and documents, and the use of EHR speed up diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Conclusion: Telemedicine allows reorganization and optimization of processes and resources, with clinical and technological standardization. National and international rules and law, medico-legal liabilities, security and privacy must be defined and respected. Purpose: Increasingly, radiology studies are distributed on compact discs (CDs) to referring physicians for review; CDs are cheaper and a potentially better option than producing X-ray film, however the software viewing interfaces used differ considerably. Therefore, we analyzed the most common image viewing software programs' functionality and ease of use.",

However, the management of PACS complex technology may cause additional strain to the hospital personnel. Application Service Provisioning (ASP) may be a solution to this issue, by means of the total or partial outsourcing of PACS functions. At our Institution we evaluated the feasibility of using ASP for managing the PACS archive. Methods and Materials: Four high-volume DICOM modalities were configured to send diagnostic exams to a cache server (Centricity Archive, GEMS) that forwarded them to a remote GEMS PACS by using a broadband wide area network. In order to evaluate the performance in different clinical and networking situations we monitored the system when up to 14 reporting workstations were concurrently used and by setting the network speed at 2 Mbps, 4 Mbps, 6 Mbps, 10 Mbps, and 100 Mbps. Results: Our assessment was done on the basis of objective measurement and of subjective evaluation collected by means of detailed questionnaires completed by radiology residents. We found that with a network speed of 6 Mbps the number of concurrent reporting sessions ceased to have an impact on the delay in retrieving exams from the remote ASP archive. Conclusion: Our experience suggests that the PACS archive can be managed with ASP. We found that no significant impact is perceived on the radiological workflow, provided that a guaranteed bandwidth of 6 Mbps is available. C D E F B A G",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of such a system in a large radiology department. Methods and Materials: Since 1999 we have used Medora from Innomed, Germany, as our RIS. In December 2001 we decided to introduce PACS Centricity from GE Medical Systems, USA, into our department. In March 2004 we introduced a second smaller system for backup and upgrade purposes in the original PACS. This smaller PACS consists of an EMC CX200 computer system equipped with 1.2 TB storage capacity in RAID technology. Based on the mini-PACS, reports can be generated and web-distribution of images and reports is possible. Results: We already used this system for two migration steps to upgrade the normal PACS system. We also used it in one system failure with a downtime of 3 hours. The mini-PACS proved to be fully functional and allowed the radiology department to examine patients, generate reports and distribute the images and reports in the same way as with the normal PACS system. Conclusion: Running the redundant mini-PACS in a large scale environment proved to be feasible and became useful in case of errors or upgrades within the normal PACS system.

Methods and Materials: In a retrospective PACS/RIS database analysis, report turnaround times (RTT) were calculated for 3 comparable 0.5 year time periods: 1. 01-06/2003 (tape-based dictation with transcription), 2. 01-06/2004 (0.5 year experience with speech recognition system [SRS]), 3. 01-06/2005 (1.5 year experience with SRS). Only remote (RSR) and online (OSR) speech recognition with transcriptionist and self-correction respectively were used in period 2 and 3. Cumulative RA (ratio of available reports vs. total number of examinations) within 2/6/12h after examination completion was calculated for period 1/2/3 respectively including all modalities. For period 3, cumulative short-term RA was differentiated into reports available 10/30/60 minutes after completion of conventional radiography (CR), computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) examinations. Results: 33155/45136/60209 datasets were analyzed for time period 1/2/3. Including all modalities, the number of reports available in less than 24h was 3796/ 13125/36031 respectively.

Methods and Materials: Reggio Emilia regional hospital installed PACS as the final step towards a completely digital clinical environment, completing the HIS/ EMR and 1200 web/terminals for patient information access. Financial benefits throughout the hospital were assessed upfront and measured every 4 months after the system's deployment. Key indicators (radiology exam turn-around-time (TAT), number of radiology procedures performed, inpatients length of stay before and after the PACS implementation, etc). were analysed and values were statistically tested to assess workflow and productivity improvements. All raw data used for the analysis was extracted from the hospital HIS and finance systems. Results: The hospital went \"filmless,\" with the exception of analogue mammography in 28 weeks and within its original budget. Overall radiology department productivity increased by 15%, TAT improved by more than 65%. Timelier patient care resulted in decreased lengths of stay. Neurology alone experienced an 11% improvement in average patient stay. Annual financial upsides have exceeded \u20ac1.5 millions/year and PACS is being extended to 5 smaller county hospitals with a common clinical data repository that will be shared with the entire region next year. Conclusion: A well-planned PACS deployment simplifies imaging workflow and improves patient care throughout the hospital while delivering substantial financial benefits. Staff buy-in was key in this process and on-going training and process monitoring are a must. Purpose: In acute abdominal pain, plain abdominal radiographs are often obtained to identify bowel obstruction and free intra-abdominal gas. The purpose of this study was to compare low-dose computed tomography (CT) with plain abdominal radiographs in this setting, using the same radiation dose. The radiation risk for the patient is thus the same with both methods. Methods and Materials: Fifty-eight patients were imaged with both methods. The effective dose for plain abdominal imaging was calculated at 1 mSv with Monte Carlo simulation. Low-dose CT was performed at 120 kV and 20 mAs/ slice, giving the same effective dose. All cases were reviewed independently by three radiologists. A gold standard was obtained by reviewing medical records, laboratory data and further radiological imaging.",

Methods and Materials: 40 patients (aged from 25 to 46) with ovarian endometriosis already known (by MR imaging or laparoscopy) and symptoms suggesting colorectal endometriosis (pelvic pain, dyspareunia, tenesmus) were evaluated. The colon was distended with methylcellulose and water (50%) before the contrast enhanced MSCT (16 rows, collimation thickness 0.625 mm, reconstruction 1.25 mm, pitch 1,375, 120 KV, 330 mAs; smart mAs; 1.5 cc per Kg of patient weight of iodinated c.m. (Iodixanol 320 mg I/100 ml) at a flow/rate of 3 cc/s, with a delay time of 40s after the arterial peak). Within 20 days after the radiological examination, independently from the findings of MSCTe, all women underwent laparoscopy. Results: Out of 40 women evaluated, 3 were found to have a normal colon on MSCT: These findings were confirmed at surgery. In 37 cases the MSCTe detected the site of endometriosis and the colorectal wall involvement depth; the deeper nodules infiltrated the serosa in 13 cases, the muscularis in 17, the submucosa in 7. In one patient localisation in the last ileal loop was identified. One patient refused surgery. In 8 cases the CT detected some lymphoadenopathy near the colon. Results were compared with endoscopic data. MR imaging was performed after oral administration of a superparamagnetic contrast-agent, with colon air insufflation, using T2-weighted and T1-weighted sequences, before and after intravenous gadolinium injection on axial and coronal planes. MR images were evaluated by two radiologists blind of endoscopic results. The following parameters were assessed and graded (0-3); extent of lesions, bowel wall thickness, T1 wall gadolinium-enhancement, T2 wall signal and T2 signal outside of the wall. MR imaging score of UC activity ranged between 0-15. In particular; 0-1 non active, 2-4 moderately active, 5-10 active and 11-15 severe active pancolitis. Spearman nonparametric correlation was used for statistical analysis. To establish the efficacy of ultrasound of the abdomen as a diagnostic test in Typhoid Fever.",

Abdominal Ultrasound was performed within three days of the onset of fever in 80 cases suspected to be having Typhoid fever. Subsequently all 80 cases were found to be Widal positive. Subsequent follow-up scans were performed at five days, ten days and fifteen days. Results: The US findings were as follows: splenomegaly (n-80,100%); Bowel wall thickening (n-69, 86.25%); mesenteric lymphadenopathy (n-55.68.75%); hepatomegaly with normal parenchymal echotexture (n-22.27.5%); thickened gall bladder (n-53.66.25%); biliary sludge (n-8.10%); positive US Murphy's sign (n-14.17.5%); pericholecystic edema with increased vascularity (n-8 ,10%); mucosal ulceration in the wall of the gall bladder (n-1. Purpose: Quantitative perfusion techniques are advocated for assessing tumour perfusion, in particular to assess the effects of vascular modulating therapy.

Visualization of the cartilage in the adventitia, that produced no reflexions, was possible in all 124 sections. Taking into account the magnification factor in OCT images due to shrinkage of the tissue by fixation, there was no significant difference in detection of the different layers between the two methods. Conclusion: Intraluminal OCT allows a nearly microscope-like resolution of the different bronchial wall layers in vitro. Therefore, utilization of this method in patients appears very promising.",

Methods and Materials: Eight anesthetized and ventilated healthy pigs underwent MDCT (1 mm, 120 kV, 300 mA) with prospective respiratory gating. Two non-contact gating devices were used: (1) CCD camera in all animals and (2) laser sensor in five pigs. The output signal of both gating devices was connected to the scanner instead of the ECG gating unit. Under free-breathing conditions the image acquisition was set to maximum inspiration and expiration. The quality of images and MPRs was analyzed in axial, coronal and sagittal orientation for sharpness of bronchi, diaphragm, lung fissures, parenchyma and pericardial structures using a 4-point-score (1 -excellent to 4 -severe artifacts). Results: Prospective respiratory gating worked perfectly well for inspiration and expiration in all animals when using the CCD camera, and a little less convincingly with the laser sensor: 100 % for inspiratory, but only 60% for expiratory scans. All acquired images showed excellent sharpness (CCD camera vs. laser sensor) for bronchi (1.3 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 1.6 \u00b1 0.7), lung fissures (1.0 vs. 1.1 \u00b1 0.3), parenchyma (1.0 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.4 \u00b1 0.6) and diaphragm (1.5 \u00b1 0.8 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.9). The pericardial lung structures often showed minor to major cardiac motion artifacts (1.9 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 2.3 \u00b1 0.5). Conclusion: Free-breathing volumetric CT of the lung using prospective noncontact respiratory gating is feasible with high image quality. The CCD camera provided better results and slightly higher image quality than the laser sensor device. ",

The aim of this study is to simplify these scoring systems without compromizing their reliability, by selecting representative variables. Methods and Materials: Forty-two consecutive patients with CF (mean age: 12 years) underwent a baseline and a follow-up chest HRCT (mean interval: 31 months). Three radiologists deciding by consensus, evaluated 84 HRCTs, employing 5 scoring systems (Bhalla, Hellbich, Santamaria, Brody, Oikonomou)each one with 7 to 11 variables -resulting in 5 baseline and 5 follow-up \"scores\" for each patient. Subsequently four variables were selected (severity and extent of bronchiectasis, severity of thickening, air-trapping) from each scoring system to form 5 new shorter \"subscores\". Each \"subscore\" was correlated with the corresponding complete score, using Pearson correlation, and the baseline scoressubscores were compared with the follow-up ones. Results: There was excellent correlation between each score and its corresponding subscore (0.922<r< 0.0979, p < 0.0001). Strong correlation was found amongst the 5 scoring systems (0.925<r< 0.0995, p < 0.0001) and the 5 subscores (0.828<r< 0.0993, p < 0.0001). Comparing the baseline scores or subscores with the corresponding follow-up ones, significant worsening was observed (0.001<p < 0.0001), in agreement with patients' clinical deterioration. Purpose: The existence and recruitment of collateral vessels within the coronary circulation is one of the factors determining the clinical relevance and developments of symptoms in coronary atherosclerosis. The purpose of our study was to prospectively evaluate diagnostic accuracy of multi detector row CT coronary angiography for the detection of collateral coronary circulation. Methods: Out of a population of 283 patients submitted to multi detector row CT between November 2004 and August 2005, 21 patients with complete occlusion of at least one main vascular segment (anterior descending, circumflex and right coronary artery) were included in this study. The patients were 13 men and 8 women, mean age 63 years (age range 44-78). Selective coronary angiography was performed in all patients within 4 days from multi detector row CT evaluation. Images were evaluated for the presence of significant re-filling of vessels distal to the occluded segment. The type of collateral circulation (ipsilateral vs controlateral) and vessels involved in the collateral filling was also recorded.",

Conclusion: Using MDCT, it is possible to get information on collateral circulation that are critical in the decision making regarding the performing of coronary angioplasty. The high-resolution kernel offered significantly better average lumen visualization (57% \u00b1 10%) and more realistic lumen attenuation (222 HU \u00b1 66 HU) at the expense of increased noise (15.3 HU \u00b1 3.7 HU) compared to the soft and medium-soft CTA protocol (p < 0.001 for all). Stents with a lumen visibility of more than 66% were: Arthos pico, Driver, Flex, Nexus2, S7, Tenax complete, Vision (all 67%), Symbiot, Teneo (70%), Radius (73%). Only ten stents showed a lumen visibility of less than 50%. Discussion: Stent lumen visibility largely varies depending on the stent type. Even with the improved spatial resolution of 64-slice CT, a stent optimized kernel remains beneficial for stent visualization when compared to the standard medium soft CTA protocol. Using 64-slice CT and high resolution kernel the majority of stent products show a lumen visibility of more than 50% of the stent diameter.",

Within the range of physiological heart rates diagnostic accuracy is rather restricted by spatial than by temporal resolution. Purpose: A new generation of high-resolution 64-slice Computed Tomography (64SCT) is now available. We compared the diagnostic accuracy incorporating 64SCT for the feasibility of assessing the lumen of coronary artery stents. Restenosis remains a major limitation of coronary catheter-based stent-placement. Therefore, a reliable non-invasive diagnostic method for the evaluation of stented coronary arteries would be highly desirable. Methods: 25 consecutive patients after coronary artery stent placement underwent both 64SCT of the coronary arteries and quantitative X-ray coronary angiography (QCA). For coronary CT angiography, a 64SCT system (SOMATOM Sensation 64, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) was employed, using the following parameters: spatial resolution, 0.4x0.4x0.4 mm; temporal resolution, 83-165 ms; contrast agent, 80 cc; flow rate, 5 cc/s; retrospective ECGgating. The MSCT-scans were analyzed for image quality and for signs of significant in-stent stenoses and pre-and post-stent stenoses. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 64SCT in the detection or exclusion of significant stenoses were evaluated. Results: 43 of 44 (98%) evaluated stents were of diagnostic image quality.

We used an ex-vivo phantom model with a realistic CT density pattern, artificial stenoses, and dynamic movement mimicking the cardiac cycle to examine the ability of 64-slice MDCT to detect in-stent stenoses in coronary stents. Methods: Four different stents (Libert\u00e9 and Lunar ROX, Boston Scientific; Driver, Medtronic; Vision, Guidant) were examined using the dynamic cardiac phantom model. The stents were placed on a polymer tube with a diameter of 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 mm. Different degrees of stenosis (0%; 30%; 50%; 75%) were created inside the tube. Results: All stents lead to artificial reduction of attenuation, the least degree of which was found in the Liber t\u00e9 (11.3 \u00b1 10.2 HU) and the Vision stent (17.6 \u00b1 17.9 HU; p = 0.25). A significantly higher reduction of attenuation was found in the Lunar ROX (53.5 \u00b1 24.9 HU) and the Driver stent (36.2 \u00b1 7.1 HU; p < 0.05). In a reconstruction interval thought to represent the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle, it was possible to differentiate high-grade stenoses (> 70%) in all stents. In the Libert\u00e9 stent high-graded stenoses were correctly diagnosed in 100% of all cases (Driver: 83%; Vision: 66%; Lunar Rox: 33%). Purpose: To evaluate the ability of 64 MDCT for the detection of significant restenosis in the follow-up of drug eluting coronary stent (DES). Methods and Materials: 51 patients (32m, age range 42-75 yrs) who previously underwent coronary percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent placement (112 stents) were evaluated. After 9 months all patients were studied with MDCTA one week prior to selective coronary angiography (SCA), in order to evaluate stent patency. ECG-gated MDCT of coronary artery was performed before and after iv administration of contrast agent with the following acquisition parameters: 64x0.6 mm slice collimation with a slice thickness 0.6 mm, 120 kV, 700 mAs. Images were analyzed by two radiologists on a dedicated workstation using a real time interaction approach. Stent patency was evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by measuring the density value proximally, inside and distally to the stent. MDCT results were compared with SCA, considered the gold standard. Results: 3 patients (5 stents) were not evaluated because of heart rate (HR) artefacts due to abnormalities of HR during the administration of iodine contrast. 107 stents were patent at SCA. MDCTA was able to detect in-stent re-stenosis in 13/16 cases by the first observer and in 15/16 cases by the second observer (overall sensitivity 87%). At MDCT 86/91 stents were judged patent by the first observer and 89/91 by the second observer with an overall specificity of 96%. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy in assessment of coronary artery bypass grafts using 64-slice computed tomography technology. Methods: CT coronary angiography was performed for 96 bypasses in 31 patients with suspected coronary artery disease using a Siemens Sensation 64slice CT-scanner and compared with invasive coronary angiography. ECG-gated cardiac CT was performed at a mean heart rate of 63.3 \u00b1 7.3 beats per minute (range 29 to 164). Patients with an irregular or fast heart rate despite \u00df-blocker administration were not excluded from the study. Results: All bypass grafts and 94% of the distal bypass anastomoses could be visualized by CT, non-evaluable distal arterial anastomoses was either due to clip material or calcification artifacts. 42 bypass graft occlusions and 3 significant stenoses were detected by CT and confirmed by invasive coronary angiography. Two venous grafts were missed and one arterial graft was not evaluable with invasive coronary angiography, but both were clearly depicted by MSCT. One false negative and two false positive CT-findings resulted in a sensitivity of 97.8%, a specificity of 89.3%, a positive predictive value of 90% and a negative predictive value of 97.7%. Conclusion: State-of-the-art MSCT coronary angiography allows detailed evaluation of venous and arterial grafts with high diagnostic image quality even in patients with higher heart rates. CT reveals complex graft anatomy readily and reliably. Calcification, poor opacification and clip material artefacts can still hamper the evaluation of distal arterial anastomoses despite improved spatial and temporal resolution. MDCT and conventional coronary angiography within 15 days after bypass surgery to assess the graft patency (9 venous grafts and 27 arterial grafts). One of the arterial grafts and two of the venous grafts were excluded because of failure in catheter engagement during conventional CAG. The graft status was evaluated according to the presence of significant stenosis (including obstruction). CT findings were compared with CAG. Results: In 32 grafts, there was no significant stenosis in both CAG and MDCT.",

CT coronary angiography is a promising alternative diagnostic modality in evaluating the patency of coronary bypass graft. Purpose: To compare US lymphography efficacy of microbubble formulations of varying diameter and composition using a normal dog model and to assess the effect of tumor replacement on nodal contrast uptake in a swine melanoma model. C D E F B A G Methods: Regional lymph nodes of 6 normal dogs were imaged using power Doppler US following subcutaneous injection of one of three hard-shelled bubbles (POINT Biomedical Corporation, mean particle size = 0.75, 0.91 and 1.33 \u00b5m) and one lipid-shell microbubble formulation (Definity\u00cb, perflutren, mean particle size = 1.8 \u00b5m) into the distal front or hindlimb. Regional nodes were imaged 15, 30 and 45 minutes post-injection. Sixteen swine with cutaneous melanomas were imaged in a similar manner following SQ injection of perflutren suspension around each primary lesion. Lymphscintigraphy studies were performed on all dogs and pigs prior to US imaging. Results: Contrast enhancement was evident at a minimum of one time-point in 95% (1.8 \u00b5m diam), 85% (1.33 \u00b5m diam), 75% (0.75 \u00b5m diam) and 70% (0.91 \u00b5m diam) of normal canine nodes and occurred within 15 minutes in most instances. Enhancement involved 5-100% of cross-sectional area in all perflutren-enhanced nodes. Regional nodes contrast enhanced in all pigs with excellent correlation with lymphoscintigraphy even in nodes predominantly replaced by tumor. Conclusion: Microbubbles of varying mean diameter and shell composition are efficacious for sentinel node localization with contrast enhancement being more consistent when using larger particles. Furthermore, sentinel node detection using this approach compares favorably to current localization techniques even when significant tumor replacement has occurred.

CEUS examination using SonoVue (Bracco) was performed for each patient at D-1 before treatment, at D+1, D+7 and D+90. Using a 14 Mhz probe, the tumor size was measured and the contrast enhancement was evaluated both visually and from raw data using the CHI-Q software (Toshiba). The results were compared with clinical response at 3 months backward. Results: At this time, 72 CEUS were performed on 23 target lesions. One patient was lost for follow-up, one had no visible lesion, one tumor did not exhibit any contrast uptake and for 6 patients data at D+90 are not yet available. The median follow-up was 6 months (min 1; max 18). Regarding target lesions, the response rate was complete in 28.6% (n = 4), partial in 64.3% (n = 9) and progression occurred in 7% (n = 1). At D+1, 56% of target lesions showed an improvement of contrast uptake may due to inflammatory reaction. At D+7, a decrease of more than 10% in tumor contrast uptake was observed in 69% (n = 9) of the responders. ",

Changes in blood chemistry and hematologic parameters were monitored before, 24h, 48h, 72h, and 7 days post application. Urine samples were evaluated pre and 7 days post application. Before and 7 days post contrast media application, a 99mTc-MAG3 renal scintigraphy was performed. The animals were sacrificed and kidneys were removed for examination by light microscopy one week after contrast media administration. Results: Differences in enhancement of vascular structures and parenchymal organs was statistically significant between 1 mL/kg BW compared with2 and 3 mL/kg BW. No serious adverse event occurred, and no clinically relevant changes in hematologic results, blood chemistry or urine analysis were detected during the observation period. Markers for glomerular filtration (creatinine, cystatin C, Beta2-microglobulin, creatinine clearence) and tubular function (Alpha1-microglobulin) were unaffected in all groups. No morphologic changes of the renal parenchyma was found in histology. Conclusion: Contrast enhanced CT with use of gadobutrol resulted in an excellent vascular and parenchymal enhancement.

Conclusion: Infusion of GRGDSP via the hepatic artery combined with TACE noticeably inhibits the growth of hepatic carcinoma and its intrahepatic metastasis in rats. Purpose: Intraarterial injection of yttrium 90 microspheres is used in the treatment of otherwise non responding hepatic metastases from various tumors. This article presents an analysis of the incidence of liver toxicities associated with selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT). Methods and Materials: 34 patients with extensive hepatic metastases qualified for SIRT. Liver toxicities were coded with use of standard oncology criteria (Southwest Oncology Group Criteria). Laboratory (total bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase) and clinical parameters (ascites, encephalopathy, liver failure, hemobilia) were recorded and compared with pre-treatment levels. The SWOG criteria grades liver toxicity from 0 (no toxicity) to 5 (death) with a clinical significance of a toxicity grade \u2265 3. Descriptive statistical methods were applied to determine the incidence of liver toxicities after SIRT. Results: 22 patients (65%) experienced 33 liver toxicities. At 3 month follow-up 17 grade 0 and 16 grade 1 toxicities were observed. No toxicity grade \u2265 3 was recorded. At 6 month follow-up 6 grade 0, 15 grade 1, 4 grade 2 and 1 grade 3 toxicities were noted. The most frequent toxicity was increased aminotransferase levels, followed by alkaline phosphatase levels and bilirubin levels. Eight of the 33 toxicities resolved on follow-up, 5 became worse. The grade 3 toxicity was attributed to tumor progression. Major side effects were seen in 10% (versus 2% in Group 2); median hospital stay was 26 days in the original group (versus 5 days for Group 2). The median number of treatments was 2 in both groups. Twice as many group 2 cases (37%) were identified by routine surveillance. Adjunctive percutaneous ethanol injections (PEI) were given to 10 patients in Group 1, while 9 in Group 2 had radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Median survival in patients with good liver function improved from 8 months (Group 1) to 21.5 months (Group 2). Conclusion: Despite an increase in the incidence of HCC there has been an improvement in survival and complication rates, probably as a result of earlier detection and better case selection. Other factors may include lead-time bias, evolving changes in the TACE procedure and the impact of RFA. Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles administered by local administration over the channelled balloon catheter at preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty in restenotic iliac arteries of New Zealand white rabbits. Methods and Materials: Eight male New Zealand White rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet and received denudation of both common iliac arteries with a 3 mm balloon catheter to induce an arterial denudation. Four weeks after stenosis induction, local application of paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles was performed randomly on one common iliac artery. As a control saline was injected into the contralateral side under the same conditions. The channelled balloon catheter allows simultaneous balloon dilation (8 atm) of the stenosis and local application of a drug solution (2 atm). Four weeks after local drug delivery the animals were killed, the vessels were excised and computerized morphometric measurements were performed. Results: In none of the animals acute complications e.g. dissection, vessel thrombosis or perforation were seen. Application of paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles resulted in a statistically significant reduction of neointimal area compared to the control group of 50%. The neointimal area was 0.80 \u00b1 0.19 mm 2 using nanoparticles compared to 1.58 \u00b1 0.6 mm 2 in the control group. Conclusion: Local drug delivery of paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles using the channelled balloon catheter could reduce neointimal hyperplasia in restenotic rabbit iliac arteries under the predominant conditions.",

Ell 2 ; 1 Nottingham/UK, 2 London/UK, 3 Cambridge/UK (saidsuha@aol.com) Purpose: In order for patients to give their informed consent they should fully understand the benefits and risks of the procedure involved. A survey was performed to explore patients' perceptions of benefits and risks of peripheral angioplasty. Methods and Materials: Over 8 months, 206 patients undergoing peripheral angioplasty were surveyed. 30 patients formed a pilot study leaving 176 patients (123 male, 53 female) average age 69.6. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. One group was given a recognised \"Risk-Assessment-Chart\", the other group answered without this tool. Patients were questioned regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure immediately pre and post-angioplasty. Patients were asked to express their likelihood of benefit and complication in terms of a percentage (definite benefit being 100%). Whether the patient had received information or had undergone angioplasty prior was noted. Statistical differences were calculated using students-t-test. Results: 158 (90%) patients thought that they would have at least a 75% (3 in 4 chance) of benefiting from angioplasty. 39% thought they would definitely (100%) benefit. 85 (48%) patients thought the test would be painful, 59 (34%) patients thought there would be no radiation exposure, 28 (16%) patients realised there was a chance of uncontrolled bleeding and 143 (81%) patients thought the test was easier than they had originally thought. The use of the \"risk-assessmenttool\" significantly altered patient's perceptions (t-test-p = 0.040). Conclusion: Most patients undergoing angioplasty were optimistic about the benefits, but were unaware of the risks. The risk assessment tool would appear to be useful for the consent process.",

            "text": "Purpose: In the United Kingdom the majority of interventional cases are performed without an anaesthetist so making the interventional radiologist responsible for pain control and sedation as well as performing the procedure. The aim of this audit was to assess the adequacy of pain control in interventional radiology. Method: Over a 6 month period, pain control was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale. Both the pre-procedure and the highest intra-operative pain scores were recorded for a wide variety of procedures. The type of anxiolytic/analgesic administered were also recorded. Statistical analysis was performed with the Minitab computer package. Results: Eighty patients took part in the audit. Analysis shows that 46 (57.5%) of these patients had insufficient intra-operative pain control. Particularly, there was a significant increase in pain levels (p < 0.05) experienced intra-operatively, compared to the pre-procedure levels in angiography, angioplasty, Hickman line insertion, gastrostomies, biliary stenting and varicocele embolization. Furthermore, pain control was shown to be insufficient (p < 0.05) in Hickman line insertions, gastrostomies and biliary stenting. An anaesthetist was not involved in any of the cases and pre-medication was never given. Conclusion: Pain control is poorly managed in the majority of interventional cases, particularly Hickman line insertions, gastrostomies and biliary stenting. There is therefore considerable scope to improve patient analgesia perhaps by improving the type and dose of drug administration including the use of pre-medication and ideally if resources allow the presence of anaesthetic colleagues. Background: PTA of severely stenotic arteries is hampered by high restenosis rate. The effects of PTA on vascular wall as well as the anti-restenotic properties of endovascular brachytherapy (EVBT) remain unclear. We aimed to elucidate the vascular effect of PTA and PTA+EVBT in vivo by serial MR imaging. Methods: Twenty symptomatic patients with severe stenosis of the femoropopliteal artery were randomly assigned to PTA (n = 10) or PTA+EVBT (n = 10, 14 Gy by \u03b3-source) and imaged by high-resolution MR imaging before and 24 hours, 3 months and 2 years after intervention. An independent observer blinded to the procedure analyzed the MR imaging data. Results: At 24 hours, MR imaging revealed that lumen area (+86% and +67%) and total vessel area (+47% and +34%) similarly increased in the PTA and PTA+EVBT group. All patients showed severe splitting of the atherosclerotic plaque. At 3 months, MR imaging revealed a significant difference in lumen area change between the PTA and PTA+EVBT group (+40% and +106%, respectively; p = 0.026) and in the total vessel area (+14% and +39%, respectively; p = 0.018). At 24 months, signs of restenosis and inward remodeling were also present in patients treated with PTA+EVBT. PTA induced plaque disruption persisted at 3 months in 50% and at 2 years in 10% in PTA+EVBT patients only. Conclusion: PTA induces deep disruption of the atherosclerotic plaques and extensive remodeling process of the arterial wall. Luminal loss after PTA is partially due to inward vessel remodeling. Brachytherapy initially prevents restenosis, induces outward remodeling of the vessel and delays the process of restenosis. Purpose: To prospectively evaluate feasibility and safety of day-case interventional angiography in a self-contained radiological nurse-administered unit. Methods and Materials: Data was recorded prospectively over an eight-year period (1996 to 2004) . Radiology Specialist Nurses (RGN), in a pre-angiography evaluation clinic, assessed patient suitability for day-case angiography based on a protocol. Immediately prior to the procedure patients were reassessed and an interventional radiologist performed all procedures. The RGNs were responsible for patient care before, during and after angiography and for follow-up post-procedure. The data were summarised into either diagnostic or interventional (balloon dilatation/stent insertion/embolization) cases. Complications (minor or major) were divided into immediate or delayed ( were treated with PTA (Group A) whereas the last 28 patients (32 lesions) underwent \"cutting\" balloon angioplasty (Cutting-Balloon Ultra; IVT/Boston Scientific, USA; 3.5-5-mm diameter/10-15-mm length) (Group B). Baseline patient demographic data, pre-and post-procedural patient clinical data and procedural results of Group A and B were recorded. Follow-up consisted of clinical assessment and color duplex ultrasonography (CDU) 1, 3 and every three months after the procedure.",

In two treated lesions of Group A (2/29, 6.9%) a stent was implanted because of a dissection, whereas no patient of Group B required placement of a stent because of recoil, dissection, or arterial tears. In Group A (PTA) primary and secondary patency rates were 85.2% and 93% at 6-months, 73.8% and 77.9% at 12-months, respectively. In Group B (CBA) primary and secondary patency rates were 90% and 96.8% at 6-months, 80.5% and 87.7% at 12-months, respectively. Conclusion: CBA seems to be a valuable tool in the endovascular treatment of short femoro-popliteal stenotic lesions allowing an increased patency and better middle-term results as compared to conventional PTA. Purpose: Comparison of routine and low-dose CTU protocols regarding diagnosis of upper urinary tract (UUT) pathologies. Methods and Material: During a 1.5-year period, 92 patients with diseases suspected to affect the UUT underwent contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen, including a portovenous/nephrographic and a delayed excretory phase. CTU was obtained with 4x2.5 mm collimation after administration of i.v. saline. In group 1, CTU was performed with a standard dose protocol (n = 42, 120 kV, average 175.6 mAs/slice) and in group 2 with a low dose examination protocol (n = 50, 120 kV, 29 mAs/slice). Pathologies of the UUTs were corroborated by a combination of portovenous/nephrographic scans and clinical information. CTU scans were reviewed by two independent readers (R1, R2) blinded to corroborating data. UUT pathology (dilatation, compression, intraluminal lesions) was diagnosed using a 5-point confidence scale: pathology definitely/probably absent (1.2), undecided (3), probably/definitely present (4.5). Statistics were performed using ROC-analysis and Chi-Square testing. Results: Sensitivity and specifity for UUT dilatation was equal in routine and lowdose CTU (group 1, sensitivity 92.9%, specificity 99.7%; group 2, sensitivity 96.2%, specificity 99.4%; sensitivity, chi-square = 0.01, p = 0.92; specificity, chisquare = 0.062, p = 0.8). For UUT compression, no significant differences between the groups were found (group 1, sensitivity 96.4%, specificity 98.8%; group 2 sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 99.0%; sensitivity, chi-square = 0.013, p = 0.91; specificity, chi-square = 0.23, p = 0.6).

Purpose: To intra-individually evaluate the possibility of reducing X-ray exposure during multi slice CT urography (MSCTU) with consideration of image quality using a porcine model.

Examinations were performed with a gradual reduction of the tube current time product at 120 kV (200, 125, . Three blinded observers independently evaluated the image data for anatomical detail, subjective image quality and image noise using a five point scale. Overall image quality was compared to radiation dose. Diagnostic reliability was tested using the intraclass-correlation-coefficient (ICC). Stratified comparisons of mean scores were calculated using Friedman and Wilcoxon-tests. Results: Adequate image quality for detailed visibility of the upper urinary tract was obtained by dropping the tube current time product to 70 eff.mAs at 120 kV. Image noise did not impair image quality to a relevant degree using these parameters. Mean score for image quality did not significantly advance with the use of higher currents (p > 0.05). A further reduction of the current time products below 70 mAs leads to a significant impairment of image quality (p < 0.05). There was a high agreement between the 3 observers (ICC = 0.95).",

To maintain a sufficient image quality, a current time product reduction to 70 mAs at 120 kV proved to be feasible offering an advantageous dosage reduction. Systematic clinical studies are required for the assessment of the diagnostic impact of such protocols. Purpose: To evaluate the image quality of two-phase MDCTU protocol for evaluation of the urinary system. Methods and Materials: 110 patients with haematuria, flank pain and or suspected urinary tract abnormalities were examined on a 16-slice CT-scanner (Somatom Sensation 16, Siemens). MDCTU protocol consisted of two phases: Unenhanced and triple-bolus iv contrast injection. 1) patients were given 800 ml of water 20 min before the study and unenhanced (low-dose) scan of the full abdomen was acquired; 2) 30 ml 2 ml/s of IV contrast (Visipaque TM 320 mg I/ml, Amersham) was injected as a first bolus, 7 min. later a second bolus of 50 ml 1.5 ml/s and after 20 seconds the third bolus of 65 ml 3 ml/s injected and the full abdomen scanned. Coronal 5 mm MPR reconstructions were generated as standard for both scans and in selected cases oblique MPR or VR. Results: Examination revealed urolithiasis (n = 24), hydronephrosis (n = 9), renal mass (n = 36), TCC (n = 2), accessory renal arteries (n = 7). High quality parenchymal enhancement was achieved in 94 (85.4%) patients. Streak artefacts were seen only in 4 (3.6%) cases caused by dense opacification of the calyces. Opacification of the collecting system and ureters were scored on a 5grade scale (1=not filled, 3=half filled, 5=all filled). Median score for upper urinary tract filling was 4 and 3 for lower segments of the ureters. In 2 cases MR followed MDCTU, but was not problem solving. Conclusion: Two-phase MDCTU with triple-bolus single scan IV contrast injection is a simple protocol acquiring native, arterial, nephrographic and excretory phases in two series. It provides satisfactory imaging scores, reduces radiation dose and radiological workload. Purpose: MR-pyelography is a technique to evaluate the renal collecting systems, performed after drug induced distention of the urinary tract. Method and Materials: 10 normal volunteers and 271 patients with renal diseases underwent drug induced MR-pyelography using 0.5 and 1.5 T superconductive magnets. The examination was performed with a 3D non-breath holding fat-suppressed TSE-sequence (TR:3000 ms; TE:700 ms; N.Ex.:4; ETL:128; acquisition time:3 min) in a coronal plane. These acquisitions were post-processed with a MIP algorithm. To obtain maximum filling of the collecting system, diuresis was pharmacologically induced by administering 250 ml of saline solution i.v. together with 20 mg of furosemide. One MR acquisition was performed 10 minutes after diuresis induction. 5 normal volunteers and 230 patients had undergone an IVU and ascending pyelography was performed in 15 cases. Results: We always obtained excellent anatomical evaluation of the renal collecting systems with drug induced MR-pyelography that was considered comparable to that obtained with an IVU. It was always possible to study the renal collecting system malformations. Renal calculi larger than 2 mm were always identified by analysis of the 3D coronal scans. Drug-induced MR-pyelography is particularly important for the detection of ureteric stones: In 23 cases with obstructive uropathy the site of the obstruction was determined and using conventional MR images, abdominal plain radiographs and urinary cytology, we were always able to determine the cause. Conclusion: Drug induced MR-pyelography allowed a morphological study of obstructed and non obstructed renal collecting systems and is suggested for patients with contraindications for i.v. administration of contrast agents; in nonfunctioning kidneys it is considered the best diagnostic imaging modality to perform after US. Relation between cerebral blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity and severity of leukoaraiosis F. Todua, D. Gachechiladze, M. Beraia; Tbilisi/GE Purpose: Leukoaraiosis (LA) is a frequent finding among the elderly and in patients with cerebrovascular disease. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and severity of LA. Methods and Materials: 114 patients (mean age 63.6 \u00b1 12y) underwent brain MR imaging, MR-angiography and color Doppler of extra-intracranial vessels, and routine neurological examinations. Patients with prior stroke and high-grade carotid stenosis were excluded from study. Total CBF was determined by adding volume flow rates in both the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. CVR was evaluated by means of TCD Diamox 1 g test. The severity of LA was rated by semiquantitative rating scale by adding scores for periventricular and subcortical areas.",

TCD showed increase of pulsatile index (PI) -1.02 \u00b1 0.22 and impaired CVR (+38.6% to Diamox test). Conclusion: Our data gives us the possibility to conclude that LA is not associated with ICA atherosclerosis severity. There is a significant negative relationship between total CBF and severity of LA. Due to increased vasomotor resistance in brain circulation and decreased vasoreactivity the slowed blood flow may play an important role in the development of LA.",

Tlag maps allowed rapid identification of the areas with varying degrees of hypoperfusion and correlated better than T maps with the F abnormalities (P < 0.01). V2 maps demonstrated abnormalities within the ischemic lesions. Conclusion: Our proposed DP model can reliably depict the hypoperfused brain lesions in acute ischemic stroke. Purpose: To determine the accuracy of CT-perfusion (CTP) and angio-CT (CTA), and correlate results with the clinical evaluation during emergency admission to predict tissue outcome. Methods and Materials: Noncontrast-CT (NCCT), CTP and CTA were obtained from 36 patients (mean age 64 years) with non-hemorrhagic hyperacute stroke and within 24 hours after beginning the episode (between 1 hour and 24 hours). The regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (MTT) maps were calculated to discriminate between infarcted, non infarcted and penumbra areas. Head and neck CTA was performed from the origin of the aortic arch to the Circle of Willis. CTA was reviewed with MIP, MPR and vessel analysis program.

Statistical analysis was performed by using the weighted kappa index (KI) with its 95% confidence interval (CI ) with first-ever acute ischaemic stroke underwent diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) and SPET within the first 48 hours and at day 8 after onset of stroke. CCD was considered to be present when SPET interhemispheric asymmetry index (AI) was > 5% in cerebellum. ADCvalues of bilateral cerebellar hemispheres were obtained from each patient and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers (67 \u00b1 6 years). Results: Within first 48 hours, the bilateral cerebellar ADC-values did not significantly differ from volunteers or between the ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar hemispheres (p = 0.867). However, on day 8, the ADC-value in the contralateral cerebellum was significantly higher than on the ipsilateral side (71 \u00b1 5\u00d710 -5 mm 2 / s vs. 69 \u00b1 4\u00d710 -5 mm 2 /s, p = 0.037), being also significantly higher than the averaged (right/left) ADC-value of volunteers (67 \u00b1 4\u00d710 -5 mm 2 /s, p = 0.013). No such difference was found on the ipsilateral side. CCD in SPET was present in 11 (50%) patients at acute stage, and in 14 (64%) patients on day 8. The difference in ADC between two sides significantly correlated with the AI in SPET within 48 hours (r = 0.611, p = 0.003) and on day 8 (r = 0.617, p = 0.002). Purpose: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an alternative method to endarterectomy in the revascularization of carotid artery stenosis. The long term efficacy of CAS is still debated.

Results: Perfusion CT demonstrated a very good accuracy in assessing brain death diagnosis, as a complimentary tool of the angiographic study performed with CT. Angiography demonstrated non-filling of intracranial arteries at the entry of the skull in 6 studies. Perfusion CT confirmed an arrest of cerebral blood flow in both carotid and posterior circulation, and persistent flow in external carotid artery territories. In 4 patients reduced but persistent cerebral blood flow was demonstrated, and in three of them a new CT angio and perfusion study was performed several hours later that confirmed then a complete absence of blood flow. Conclusion: Perfusion CT is a very good technique to study brain death because it is rapid and easy to interpret.

MR imaging was performed at 1.5 T acquiring morphological (T2-weighted sequence) and dynamic (3DFSPGR sequence before and after intravenous administration of Gadolinium chelates) studies. MR imaging morphofunctional findings were criteria described by Fischer in 1999 (shape, margins, contrast material kinetic, early contrast uptake [ECU] and signal/intensity curve morphology) evaluated as single criterion and as scoring system. Core-biopsy was performed for determination of histopathological characteristics: histological type, nuclear grade, estrogen and progesteron receptors (ER, PgR), Ki-67 and cerbB2 expression. Cut off for positivity was 20% for Ki67, 10% for ER and PgR and 3+ for cerbB2. Results: MR imaging identified 68 single node breast cancers (57DCI, 11LCI). Fischer's scoring system resulted 2 in 1 case, 3 in 1, 4 in 10, 5 in 11, 6 in 16, 7 in 12 and 8 in 17. ER, PgR, Ki67 and cerbB2 were positive in 38, 30, 40 and 15 lesions, respectively. Significant association was found between higher Fischer's scoring system and cerbB2 negative status (p = 0.002). No significant correlation between MR imaging single criteria and histopathological characteristics were found. Conclusion: Our study shows that combining MR imaging morphofunctional findings may identify breast cancer with different biological characteristics. In particular a significant correlation was found between Fischer's scoring system and expression of cerbB2 which is a marker of chemoresponsiveness and prognosis. Combination of fast initial wash in followed by a wash out was most common in G3: 12.9%; G2: 8.9%, G1: 2.1%; Gx: 5%. Mean curve peaks were: 172% (G1); 121% (G2); 133% (G3) and 98%(Gx). Conclusion: Despite still existing technical problems CAD offers for the first time a reliable, automated analysis of percentage distribution of enhancing types within a suspicious breast lesion. A discrimination of the grading seems, however not yet possible using the dynamic enhancement distribution offered by the CADsystem. ",

Purpose: To study the diagnostic value of multi-slice CT angiography for imaging of the spinal cord feeding arteries in patients with complex thoracic aortic pathologies undergoing endovascular aortic repair (EVAR). The impact of proximal posterior intercostal artery occlusion for the visualization of the spinal blood supply was evaluated. Method and Materials: Eighteen patients (5 women, mean age 60 years) with thoracic aortic type B dissection or aneurysm underwent two CTA examinations (pre-and post-EVAR, 120 kV, 120-150 mAs, 1 mm collimation, 16-slice CT scanner). Contrast agent (400 mgI/ml) was administered at a flow rate of 5 ml/s. Pulse rate and neurological status were documented. Qualitative analysis was performed by two experienced radiologists counting the posterior intercostal arteries, their rami dorsales and the Adamkiewicz artery (AKA). Density measurements included the ascending and descending aorta. Results: Contrary to expectations visualization of the posterior intercostal arteries and rami dorsales could be visualized post-EVAR due to retrograde perfusion. On average 10/11 posterior intercostal arteries, 8/9 rami dorsales were retrogradly perfused post-EVAR within the stented aortic segment (mean length 237 mm). Additionally, 9/10 AKA were visualized. ROI analysis in the thoracic aorta confirmed high mean HU values of 445 HU pre-and 385 HU post-EVAR. High pulse rates and partially thrombosed lumen in type B dissection and aortic aneurysm limited the visualization of the AKA in some patients. Neurological events were not observed in any patient. Conclusion: Multi-slice CT angiography is capable of visualizing even small spinal cord feeding arteries. High contrast imaging showed patent post-EVAR spinal vessels due to retrograde perfusion. After contrast application, arterial phase was focused on the suspected aneurysm. Delayed arterial phase was again extended from the aortic arch to the femoral arteries, whenever the pre-contrast phase demonstrated an unexpected aortic dilatation on the opposite side of diaphragm. According to the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery guidelines, both suspected and unexpected aortic dilatations were classified as ectasia, or aneurysm with diameter below or above cut-off for surgical intervention. Results: Overall, 45 unexpected aortic dilatations were detected (21/45 ectasia, 15/45 aneurysm below cut-off, 9/45 aneurysm above cut-off); unexpected dilatations of thoracic aorta were observed in 28.3% of patients with suspected AAA, unexpected dilatations of abdominal aorta in 25.6% of patients with suspect AAT. Nineteen unexpected AAT (8/19 above cut-off) and 5 unexpected AAA (1/5 above cut-off) were observed: consequently in 9/163 (5.5%) cases the unexpected AA had the potential to change surgical planning.

Purpose: Dynamic stages of carpal instability are manifest only during wrist movement (dyskinematics). The aim of this study was to evaluate kinematography for detecting the radiographically occult stages of carpal instability. Methods and Materials: Twenty-four patients suffering from tenderness, click and/or snap phenomena and grip weakness were examined with kinematography using pulsed fluoroscopy (15 pulses/s). The kinematographic movies were stored on the PACS. Fifteen patients underwent arthroscopy, and in 9 patients surgical treatment was performed. Results: Standard radiograms were inconspicuous in all cases. Nineteen pathological movement patterns were found: 12 scapholunate dissociations (SLD), 2 lunotriquetral dissociations (LTD) and 5 midcarpal instabilities (MCI), 2 of these bilaterally. In the remaining 5 cases, no abnormal movement patterns were seen. There was a close correlation of kinematography to arthroscopic and surgical findings: 11/12 of the SLD and 2/2 of the LTD were confirmed, whereas in 1 case the SL ligament was assessed in arthroscopy to be only incompletely torn. One partial tear of the LT ligament was detected in the 5 patients with normal kinematograms. No information about the ligamentous state was available in the 5 patients with MCI patterns. Conclusion: Aside from physical examination manoeuvres, kinematography is the method of choice for detecting dynamic subcategories of carpal instability non-invasively. Purpose: In dynamic stages of carpal instability, there is a normal arrangement of the wrist at rest, although the intrinsic SL or LT ligaments are completely ruptured. The aim of this study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced MR imaging when dynamic carpal instability is suspected. Methods and Materials: Forty-five patients suspicious of having dynamic patterns of SL or LT dissociation were examined with contrast-enhanced MR imaging (0.2 mmol/kg) using axial T2*-w GRE, coronal fat-saturated PD-w FSE, plain and contrast-enhanced coronal T1-w SE, contrast-enhanced sagittal T1-w SE. All patients underwent arthroscopy. Results: Focal enhancement areas were found at the SL ligament in 25 patients, with the dorsal and volar segments involved in 16 patients and only one segment involved in 9 patients. Arthroscopy revealed 24 complete tears of the SL ligament, but could not confirm 6 lesions (sensitivity 79%, specificity 71%, PPV 76%, NPV 75%, accuracy 76%). In 12 patients, enhancement patterns were seen at the LT ligament, either dorsovolarly (7 cases) or volarly (5 cases). Arthroscopy revealed 14 tears of the LT ligament, and did not confirm 4 lesions (sensitivity 57%, specificity 87%, PPV 67%, NPV 82%, accuracy 78%). Statistics for MR imaging evaluation were significantly better in the acute/subacute rupture stage compared to long-standing instability patterns. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows moderately good non-invasive visualization of dynamic SL and LT by enhancing fibrovascular reparation tissue at the rupture site. This mechanism is less significant in chronic instability stages when carpal malarticulation has induced diffuse synovitis. Purpose: To evaluate wrist functioning, the analysis of dynamic 3D movement of the carpal bones in the wrist joint is crucial. Video fluoroscopy and animated 3D imaging of the wrist joint will not reveal abrupt changes as seen often with dynamic joint pathology. We created a system for 4-Dimensional rotational X-ray (4D-RX); using a 3D-RX system to image an object that is forced into a cyclic motion to obtain a series of time resolved 3D reconstructions. The image quality of our setup is investigated by imaging a post mortem wrist.",

We anticipate that dynamic imaging 4D-RX of the wrist and other joints for diagnostic purposes may be of great help for assessing functional disorders. Purpose: The rupture of the retinaculum of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon is an acute injury, more common because of lift and two hand technique, in professional tennis players. We study the value of US and MR imaging for the diagnosis and follow-up. Methods and Materials: Twenty-one professional tennis players were investigated by US and MR imaging after an acute injury of the wrist during a matchplay with suspicion of a lesion of the ECU tendon or its retinaculum. All patients had a dynamic assessment with pronosupination imaging. Imaging follow-up was performed over 2 to 3 months. Results: The most common injury combines a medial detachment of the ECU retinaculum and an avulsion pouch along the medial aspect of the ulnar head (n = 17), sometimes extending volarly to the pronotor teres muscle (n = 5). The radial avulsion is less common (n = 4), with a risk of interposition of the retinaculum beneath the tendon and lack of healing.

Methods and Materials: At 1.5 T, 34 wrists in 34 patients with previous CTS release were evaluated by two observers for median nerve (signal, morphology and enhancement), for flexor retinacular regrowth, for fibrosis, for volar nerve migration and tunnel release measure, and for compressive abnormalities. The population is constituted of 11 controlled patients with normal electromyography (EMG), and 23 with electric abnormalities. There were 27 female and 7 male patients, mean age 55.7 years. Mean time between surgery and MR imaging was 29.9 months, and 3.8 months between EMG and MR imaging. Results: Retinacular section was seen in 12/23 with and 5/11 without recurrent CTS (p > 0.05). High T2 signal of the median nerve was seen in 20/21 with, and 7/11 without recurrent CTS (p = 0.036), enhancement was seen in 10/23 with, and 1/11 without recurrent CTS (p = 0.06). Mean ratio was 2.40 with and 1.89 without recurrent CTS (p = 0.018). Compressive abnormalities were present in 7/ 23 patients with, and in 5/11 without recurrent CTS (p > 0.05). Fibrosis was seen in 14/23 with, and 2/11 without recurrent CTS (p = 0.029). Conclusion: Fibrosis, proximal flattening and high signal of the median nerve are significant findings in recurrent CTS with electric abnormalities compared to a controlled population.",

The ultrasound findings were recorded and it was noted whether the US made a difference to the decision in further management. The findings were compared with the final histological diagnosis for those patients who went to surgery. Results: A total of 31 patients are included in the study. The majority (24 patients, 77%) of these were referred to US with a single proposed diagnosis. Of these cases US confirmed the diagnosis in 15 patients (63%) but in the remaining 9 patients (37%) other diagnoses were made. Of the remaining 7 patients, 6 were referred with more than one clinical diagnosis and a single patient had no provisional clinical diagnosis. US agreed with one of the possible differentials in one third, and excluded several of the possibilities in patients who had previously undergone complex hand surgery in another third. In the final third of patients within this subgroup the clinical and US diagnoses were at variance.

With power Doppler, one finger joint per patient representing the strongest hypervascularization before steroid therapy was determined. Dynamic examination with PI-HI of the selected joint was carried out before and after 7 days of middle-high dosed steroid therapy. Vascularization was quantified by calculating the area underlying time-intensity curves [dB] . The changes of the signal intensities before and after therapy were correlated with clinical examinations (DAS-score). Results: All patients showed a statistically significant reduction of PI-HI signals after steroid therapy (p < 0.05). The baseline and follow-up median values of the area underlying time-intensity curves were 8.56 \u00b1 1.28 and 7.65 \u00b1 0.66 respectively. The median values of the DAS decreased significantly from 4.9 \u00b1 0.86 to 3.6 \u00b1 1.0 (p < 0.01) 7 days after the steroid therapy. Conclusion: PI-HI enables the detection of synovial perfusion alterations after steroid therapy, and therefore may be an additional useful tool in the evaluation of active inflammation in RA and in the assessment of the therapeutic response. Purpose: To assess the PIP alterations in rheumatoid arthritis of the finger using a high-resolution microscopy coil at 3 Tesla. Methods and Materials: High-resolution 3 Tesla MR imaging was performed in 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using a microimaging gradient insert with gradients up to 200 mT/m. Coronal STIR (TR/TE 1800/14.6, TI 170 ms, 4 averages, FOV 70x35 mm, matrix 256x96, slice thickness 2 mm), axial T1w (TR/TE 538/15.3 ms, 10 averages, FOV 30x30 mm, matrix 256x192, slice thickness 1 mm), and contrast enhanced, fat-suppressed coronal and axial T1w sequences (TR/ TE 808/15.4, 4 averages, FOV 70x35 mm, matrix 512x148, slice thickness 2 mm) were performed. The images were evaluated according to modified EULAR-OMERACT criteria. Results: Synovial swelling and enhancement, bone marrow edema, erosions, and the involvement of collateral ligaments, tendons and tendon sheaths were clearly visualized. Interestingly, the most common findings were not only synovial swelling (15/15) and synovial contrast enhancement (14/15), but also thickening and enhancement of the collateral ligaments (14/15). In all patients with bone marrow edema (9 /15), the insertion zone of the collateral ligaments was involved. The erosions which were seen in 9/15 patients were exclusively located in the insertion zone of the collateral ligaments in 3/9 patients, partly in 5/9 patients, and distant to this zone in only 1/9 patient. C D E F B A G Conclusion: High-resolution 3 Tesla MR imaging of PIPs in rheumatoid arthritis allows detailed information about more anatomic structures involved than has been described previously. The collateral ligaments and the bone of the insertion zone of the collateral ligaments are commonly involved. Purpose: To evaluate therapeutic response of percutaneous radio-frequency thermal ablation (RFTA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by SonoVue-enhanced pulse-inversion ultrasonography (CEUS) in comparison with multislice computed tomography (MSCT). Methods and Materials: 280 patients with 337 nodules (mean size 3.2 cm) diagnosed as HCC by biopsy and treated with RFTA were evaluated by CEUS and contrast-enhanced multiphase MSCT one month and three months after treatment respectively. On MSCT or CEUS we considered: a) complete ablation-when there was no enhancing portion within or at the margin of the ablation zone during the hepatic arterial phase; b) residual unablated tumor-an irregular peripheral-enhancing focus in the ablation zone after one month; c) local tumor progressionthe presence of growing enhancing tumors at the margin after three months but with no evidence of residual tumor in the previous control. Results: CEUS and MSCT revealed residual tumor in 67 (19.8%) and 72 (21.3%) nodules respectively, local tumor progression in 18 (5.3 %) and 20 (5.9 %) respectively and complete response in 252 (74.8%) and 255 (75.7%) respectively. Local tumor progression was confirmed by US-guided biopsies of the areas of growing enhancing tumors in all the 18 nodules assessed by CEUS. Conclusion: SonoVue-CEUS can be considered a reliable alternative technique to contrast-enhanced multiphase MSCT to assess therapeutic response after RFTA of HCC.",

We sought to determine whether hypodense tumor halos seen on CT were associated with the wound response gene expression program in HCC. Methods and Materials: 29 HCCs were analyzed across 29 CT scans for the presence or absence of hypodense tumor halos by 2 radiologists in consensus. Tumor halo scores for each tumor were then evaluated for enrichment of the wound-response gene expression program against matched microarray gene expression measurements across 3960 clones for the same 29 HCCs using supervised bioinformatic analyses. The strength of the enrichment for the wound response gene expression program was then determined and statistical significance evaluated. Results: Hypodense halos were present in 12/29 HCCs and absent in 17/29. Hypodense tumor halos were strongly associated with regulation of the woundresponse gene expression program (p < 0.05). Further, HCC with absent halos were associated with up-regulation of the wound-response gene expression program whereas presence of halos correlated with down-regulation. Additional analysis also demonstrated that absence of hypodense tumor halos was also correlated with regulation of a p53-associated HCC gene expression program. Conclusion: Hypodense tumor halos may represent an imaging surrogate for a \"wound-response\" tumor transcriptional program in HCC and may also incorporate elements of a p53 gene expression program. Purpose: To compare three-phase helical CT findings of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers of Korean patients, and to find out the difference of CT findings between noncirrhotic livers of Asian and non-Asian patients. Methods and Materials: During a 5-year period, 191 patients (165 men and 26 women, mean age; 52 years) who had three-phase helical CT were collected among 527 patients with surgically proven HCC. At pathology, 89 patients had cirrhotic liver (88 HBV infection, 1 HCV infection) and 102 patients had noncirrhotic liver (68 HBV infection, 5 HCV infection, 4 unknown chronic hepatitis, 25 normal liver). All CT images were analyzed retrospectively for various morphologic and enhancement patterns of tumor, tumor thrombosis and intrahepatic metastasis, and were correlated with pathologic findings. Results: More frequent morphologic patterns in noncirrhotic livers were ill-defined margins (p=.001), fibrosis (p <.001), necrosis (p <.001), and hemorrhage (p=.201). More frequently found patterns were capsule (p <.001), fatty metamorphosis (p=.127), and mosaic pattern (p=.118) in cirrhotic livers. For enhancement pattern, arterial enhancement and delayed washout were more frequently seen in non-cirrhotic liver without statistical difference. Intrahepatic metastasis and tumor thrombosis were more frequently found in non-cirrhotic liver (p > .05). Conclusion: Some morphologic findings of HCC in cirrhotic liver were found differently in non-cirrhotic livers. Reviewing the literature, our results of patients with non-cirrhotic livers were sufficiently similar to those of non-Asian patients. Therefore, we suggest that morphologic appearances of HCC are not dependent on the racial differences but on the presence of cirrhotic change. ",

The correct diagnosis of the detected lesions was accomplished in 74% with CT and in 94% with MR imaging. Conclusion: MR imaging with Gd-EOB-DTPA markedly improves detection and classification of focal liver lesions compared to triphasic CT. Enhanced examination included the dynamic study (arterial, portal and equilibrium phases) and the delayed study performed 20 minutes after contrast injection. Three radiologists independently interpreted the images for detection of HCCs, according to a four point confidence scale. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic method and the sensitivity of each imaging technique was compared.",

We tested the hypothesis that we can differentiate benign (BUBO) from malignant (MUBO) lesions based on super paramagnetic iron oxides (SPIO) uptake. CC failed in assessment of 246/408 potentially visible colonic segments. Stop Point on CC examination was predominantly in the sigmoid. Additional lesions identified in proximal colon in 19 % of patients, include3 primary carcinoma, 12 polyps in 8 patients, 2 lipomas. In one patient with incomplete colonoscopy at sigmoid a mesenterial liposarcoma was found. The main causes of incomplete CC was; redundant colon, tortuous colon loops and occlusive mass. Level of tolerance was rated good as well as patient compliance and patient preparation. Mean duration time of CTC was 9 minutes. Conclusion: CTC is feasible and effective technique in evaluating entire colorectal segments of the colon not visualized during colonoscopy. CTC has an undeniable role in elderly and frail patients in whom conventional colonoscopy is difficult to be fully performed. Purpose: To prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of MSCTC without cathartic preparation with that of colonoscopy for the detection of colorectal polyps in asymptomatic average-risk patients. Methods and Materials: 180 asymptomatic patients referred to undergo screening colonoscopy were recruited. For fecal tagging, an oral iodinated contrast agent (diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium) was administered beginning 48 hours prior to CT. No cathartic preparation was used prior to CT. All CT examinations were acquired using a MSCT scanner (Somatom Plus 4 Volume Zoom, Siemens) using collimation, 4 x 2.5 mm; section thickness, 3.0 mm; effective mAs, 10; and kVp, 140. Colonoscopy with segmental unblinding was performed 3-7 days after CT as reference standard. Three radiologists, unaware of colonoscopic findings, analyzed CT colonographic images using a dedicated software (Vit-rea, Vital Images). Sensitivity was calculated on both a per-polyp and a per-patient basis. In the latter, specificity was also calculated. Interobserver agreement was calculated using the k statistic. Results: Colonoscopy detected two carcinomas and 76 polyps in 42 patients; the remaining 138 patients showed no abnormality. CT colonography yielded an average per-polyp sensitivity of 48.6% (92% for polyps \u2265 8 mm). Average perpatient sensitivity and specificity were equal to 92.8% and 94.2%, respectively. Interobserver agreement was high on a per-polyp basis, and high to excellent on a per-patient basis.",

We evaluated the percentage of the unseen surface after forward and backward fly-through and performance of a computerized tool that automatically displays unseen areas to the reader. Methods and Materials: 40 data sets with different patient positions (20 prone, 20 supine) were randomly selected from a database and investigated on a CTC workstation (syngo Colonography, Siemens). The percentage of unseen surface was noted after one single flight from rectum to cecum and after an additional flight from rectum to cecum. Direct navigation to unseen areas was performed in all cases. Results: After one single fly-through from rectum to cecum, only 71.7-88.2% (mean, 81.3%) of the colonic surface had been visualized. A 2 nd flight increased these values to 91.4-98.8% (mean, 96.2%). The \"unseen areas\" tool implemented in the CTC software sorted unseen areas according to their size and displayed them to the reader. Conclusion: 3D reading with 2D for problem solving leads to an incomplete view on the colon surface even if bidirectional fly-through is performed. A tool which measures the percentage of colon surface that has been seen by the radiologist and automatically displays unseen areas prevents perception errors and may cut reading time.",

            "text": "Purpose: To investigate the accuracy of automated and manual CT polyp measurement using a colectomy phantom. Methods and Materials: A colectomy specimen from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis containing 27 polyps was insufflated, submerged, and scanned using a MDCT. A histopathologist measured the maximum dimension of all polyps in the opened specimen. Digital photographs and line drawings were produced to document exact polyp location. Two observers (novice and expert) independently estimated polyp diameter using three methods: software calipers 2D ('manual 2D'), software calipers 3D ('manual 3D') and automated polyp measurement software (automatic) [Medicolon 1.3, Medicsight plc]. The software requires the placement of 2 seed points in the polyp vicinity prior to automated segmentation and measurement. Data was analyzed using a paired t-test and Bland-Altman limits of agreement. Results: 6 polyps (all flat and \u2264 6 mm) could not be extracted by the software and were excluded, leaving 21 polyps (4-15 mm) for analysis. Automated polyp measurement was not significantly different from true histological size for either reader. However both observers significantly underestimated polyp size using manual 2D (mean difference [md] -1.3 mm, sd 1.3, p = 0.001, and md -1.6 mm, sd 1.2, p < 0.001) and using manual 3D for the expert only (md -0.6 mm, sd 1.4, p = 0.04). Bland Altman limits of 95% limits of agreement were similar for all three methods (automated -3 mm to 3.5 mm, manual 2D -3.8 mm to 1 mm, manual 3D (-3.2 mm to 2 mm). Conclusion: Automated polyp measurement is technically feasible, does not require reader expertise, and is potentially more accurate than manual measurement. Purpose: To evaluate the role of CT colonography (CTC) in the follow-up of asymptomatic patients that underwent polypectomy. Methods and Materials: Forty patients that underwent a previous polypectomy (mean follow-up at 1 year), were studied with CTC at low dose, with no contrast and a standard preparation (no feacal tagging); no muscle relaxants were used. Examination was performed in supine and prone decubitus. Patients were asked to undergo colonoscopy after CTC. Results: CTC found 34 polyps in 17 patients, that were all submitted to colonoscopy; in the remaining 23 patients (negative for CTC findings), only 9 underwent colonoscopy that confirmed CTC results (no FP or FN results). The per polyps sensitivity was 71% for those with diameter < 6 mm (6 FN) and 92% for larger polyps (1 FN). The per polyps specificity was 65% for those with diameter < 6 mm (7 FP) and 91% for larger polyps (2 FP). Conclusion: CTC represents a valid alternative to colonoscopy in the follow-up of asymptomatic patients with previous polypectomy. Purpose: The risk of malignant transformation of an adenomatous polyp is related directly to its diameter but conventional estimates of diameter made from CT may vary due to measurement error. We investigated whether automated segmentation and diameter assessment was feasible for CT colonography. Methods: Two experienced observers independently measured the maximum diameter of fifty polyps (colonoscopic reference size range 5-12 mm) from colonography data sets using conventionally placed software calipers and a variety of 2D window settings (colon, abdominal, bone, lung CT), and also 3D perspective rendering. Polyps were re-measured subsequently using in-house automated polypsegmentation software. Agreement between observers and with the colonoscopic reference were determined using Bland-Altman, Wilcoxen, and Mann-Whitney-U analyses.",

When compared to colonoscopy; the largest mean size difference obtained by both observers occurred using the 3D display (1.3, 2.5 mm). There was also significant difference between observers and reference size when using the 2D abdominal and 3D displays (P =.03, p <.001). Subset analysis of tagged cases revealed that one observer overestimated diameter for untagged cases measured using 3D (median difference 3 mm versus 2 mm, p = 0.01).

Methods and Materials: 21 patients with colonic polyps and 20 patients without colon pathologies underwent preparationless CT colonography and optic colonoscopy within a week. The patients had no food restrictions or colonic cleansing in the days before the CT examination, only 6 times 20 ml of ionated radiologic contrast material (not containing meglumin) was administered orally 48 hours prior to the examination. Native supine low-dose 2.5 mm collimated scans were obtained on a 4 row scanner. The data were evaluated using an academic software (ColVis) equipped with electronic cleansing and CAD. The results generated by the CAD and that of a radiologist were compared. Results: 4/41 patients had diarrhea due to the preparation.

T1 values were serially measured prior and 3, 15 and 30 min after each intramyocardial injection. Results: Injection of SHU555 A caused a decrease of the T1 value of the infarcted myocardium (778 \u00b1 63 ms before, and 588 \u00b1 54 ms 3 h after injection). The contrast between the infarct and remote myocardium was sufficient for delineation of the infarct on real-time images (0.43 \u00b1 0.02). In all animals, the catheter could be directed into the border region of the infarct. In each case, two injections were performed at different locations. T1 values at the injection sites decreased (240 \u00b1 25 ms) and slowly increased (468 \u00b1 37 ms 30 min after intramyocardial injection). Conclusion: Percutaneous, MR-guided intramyocardial injection of a gadodiamide containing solution into the border of infarcted myocardium is feasible after the ischemically injured region is delineated following i.v. injection of SHU555 A. Due to the strong decrease of T1 values at the injection sites repeated injections into the same region can be avoided. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare energy metabolism in noninfarcted and infarcted myocardium using 31P-MR-Spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate these changes with the outcome of the revascularization. Methods: 30 patients with subacute anterior myocardial infarction (MI) underwent MRS and 31P-spectra were obtained from non-infarcted/septal as well as infarcted/anterior myocardium (voxel size 25 ml each) by means of 3D-CSI. Phospocreatin/adenosine triphosphate (PCr/ATP) ratios were determined using \"AM-ARES\". Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness was evaluated by cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To assess myocardial viability, MR imaging was repeated 6 months after revascularization. 15 age matched volunteers served as control.",

Methods and Materials: Thirty-three CAD patients (mean EF 29%) underwent CE-MRI before CABG surgery. LE scans were acquired after 0.2 mmol/kg Gd-DTPA using an inversion-recovery turboFLASH sequence (TR, 8 ms; TE, 4 ms; FA, 25\u00b0; TI, 200-260 ms). Myocardial scar extent was evaluated using a LE score 1-4 (score 1, no LE; 2, LE < 50% of wall thickness; 3, LE > 50%; 4, transmural LE) for each vessel territory (RCA, LAD, LCX). Intraoperative flow as determined by Doppler sonography in grafts supplying vessel territories with a score 1 or 2 (group A) was compared to flow in grafts supplying vessel territories with a score \u2265 3 (group B) which are not expected to improve function after revascularization. Results: Of the 99 vessel territories, 89 yielded score 1 or 2 (group A), 10 score \u2265 3 (group B). In group A, 68 of 89, and in group B, 9 of 10 territories were grafted using left intrathoracic artery (LITA) or venous graft. Mean LITA graft flow was 54 \u00b1 6 in group A and 28 \u00b1 11 cc/min in group B (p=.04). Mean vein graft flow was 74 \u00b1 6 and 42 \u00b1 8 cc/min in groups A and B, respectively (p=.05). Conclusion: Graft flow to vessel territories with no or little scar tissue is higher than flow to territories with > 50% scar tissue. Since sufficient flow is a prerequisite for graft patency, the prognosis of those grafts may be better.

Results: The coefficients of variation for intra-, inter-observer and inter-study reproducibility were 3.9%, 5.5%, 4.7% respectively. In healthy subjects the percentage of deviation (%D) of the slices from the global heart T2* mean was not statistically significant. The %D of the segments from the global heart T2* mean ranged from -20 to 18. Significant differences were observed only among the segments with higher %D (5/66 cases). In TM patients, the epimyocardial iron concentration was significantly higher in the slices and in 10/12 segments. Three groups of patients were identified: 15% with homogeneous myocardial iron overload (MIO); 47% with no MIO; 38% with a heterogeneous MIO (T2* segments < 20 ms and T2* segments > 20 ms). Serum ferritin levels, liver iron concentrations and urinary iron excretions were significant different among groups. Conclusion: Our data did not account for rejecting certain slices or segments.

First of all we fixed the patient or respectively the phantom with a patient-fix-kit on the CT table, positioned a patient frame with optical and CT markers above and the setup was scanned with CT. All data were transferred to the navigation system inside the scanner room. The target approach was defined and the trajectory was adjusted to the surface of the corresponding CT marker. The needle holder was orientated towards the trajectory. Finally a coaxial biopsy needle was pushed towards the planned target.

To outline its advantages: significant reduction in patient symptomatology, potential reduction of long term morbidity, shortened hospital stay. Methods and Materials: Twelve patients presenting with acute IFV/SFV thrombosis diagnosed on Doppler Ultrasound were referred for treatment with the Bacchus Trellis Device. Symptoms were present for an average of 3.5 days prior to diagnosis. Prospective color Doppler ultrasonographic follow-up is on-going. Results: Subjective impression of reduction of thrombus load varied from 75-100% (6 patients 100%, 3 patients 75%, 3 patients 60%). Radiological resolution of obstruction, reduction in pain within 24hrs and measurable reduction in leg swelling within 72hrs, was seen in all. Based on retrospective hospital data, mean hospital stay reduced from 7 to 2 days. No symptomatic recurrence was noted at 3-month. Conclusion: Standard DVT anti-coagulation regimes merely prevent further clot propagation and diminish risk of pulmonary embolus. Catheter directed thrombolysis is well established for IFV DVT particularly with phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD), but is time consuming, usually requires ICU admission and involves the risk of systemic passage of thrombolytic agents. The Bacchus Trellis device has the major advantage of completion of treatment in a single sitting, without the need for indwelling venous sheaths, ICU stay, repeat blood testing, systemic anticoagulation or thrombolytic administration. We show the feasibility of major clot clearance with no significant risks. Although the cost may not be inconsiderable, much quicker discharge from hospital is a major advantage.",

Methods and Materials: 16 patients with a total of 19 cysts were treated with a soft method instead of classic alcoholization. Cysts ranged between 11 cm and 19 cm in diameter. After US-guided percutaneous puncture 50% of the fluid was extracted from the cyst, and a solution of minocycline hydrocloride (1 mg/ml of native volume of the cyst) was introduced and left in the cavity (single-shot). 2 patients had polycystic liver disease (5 cysts). Follow-up was performed at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment. Results: At 6 months treatment was successful in 17/19 cysts (89.4%). In 2/ 16 pts (10.6%) a re-treatment was needed, with a total success rate of 100% at 12 months. Multiple shots technique through a small catheter was used in 1 of the recurred cases (brown, corpuscolated fluid at diagnosis). No complications were noted. No recurrences were noted at 2 years in 10 patients. Conclusion: This method is superior to alcoholization: The procedure is more rapid and less expensive (catheter set is not required). The discomfort for the patient is minimal, the procedure is easier for the operator and results are better, without risks in case of extravasation into the peritoneal cavity or into the biliary tree.

The arterial closure device is capable of preventing bleeding during insertion, led to a stable puncture site throughout several hours and prevented complications like haemorrhage or subcutaneous haematoma after extraction of the catheter. Conclusion: Invasive ABP measurement with the miniature pressure sensor is feasible. Further studies are needed for further miniaturization of the system, subcutaneous implantation of the telemetric unit, wireless data transfer and longterm results. Results: Biopsy was successful in 29 patients. One was rejected because the lesion was too close to pectoralis muscle. 9 biopsies revealed malignant lesions (31%): 6 invasive carcinomas and 3 Ductal carcinoma in situ. One revealed fibrous changes with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). 19 biopsies were benign. Of the malignant lesions, 5 presented as an enhancing mass, one as ductal enhancement and 3 as multinodular enhancement with segmental distribution. The LCIS lesion presented as a mass and benign lesions presented as: 6 enhancing masses, 4 ductal enhancements, 3 multinodular enhancements with segmental distribution, 2 linear enhancements and 1 multinodular enhancement. The positive predictive value upon the shape of enhancement is: 45% for masses, 50% for multinodular with segmental distribution, 20% for ductal enhancement. Linear, focal or multinodular regional enhancements were benign in our study. Conclusion: MR guided vacuum assisted biopsy is a useful tool in management of incidental enhancing lesions with negative second look ultrasound. It revealed 31% malignant lesions among 29 suspicious enhancements (categories 4-5).",

The proper management of non-palpable thyroid nodules has been debated over recent years. The purpose of our study was to compare the biopsy results of two groups of infracentimetric nodules according to sonographic criteria. Methods and Materials: Ultrasonography of 491 patients showed 584 infracentimetric thyroid nodules. Nodules were classified as positive or negative for sonographic features that suggest malignancy. These included: an irregular margin, microcalcifications, lymphanedopathy and marked hypoechogenicity. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed on 317 positive and 272 negative nodules. Results: Of 317 nodules that were classified as positive, 9 were malignant. Of 272 nodules that classified as negative, 4 were malignant. Sensitivity, specifity, and accuracy were calculated. Conclusion: Although we selected two groups according to the sonographic findings, we found a low prevalence of malignancy in both study groups. This raises the question; do we need to biopsy infracentimetric nodules? Studies are needed correlating pathological results with ultrasound appearance in order to identify nodules with a higher risk of malignancy. Purpose: To evaluate MSCT-guided biopsy of focal liver lesions and to determine the rate of diagnostic biopsies using 16G semi-automated core biopsy systems compared to 18G systems. Method and Materials: From July 2001 to April 2005, 163 patients underwent MSCT-guided biopsy of the liver. Indication was based on the detection of a focal liver lesion on a preceding CT or MR imaging. In most cases a 16G automated core biopsy system was used (n = 121), partially in coaxial technique using a 15G guidance needle (n = 68), partially without guidance (n = 53). An 18G core biopsy system was used in 42 patients, under coaxial guidance in 27 cases. Results: Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for MSCT-guided biopsy were 93.3%, 100% and 94.5% respectively. Sensitivity and accuracy values were higher for 16G biopsy compared to 18G biopsy: 97.2% vs. 78.6% and 97.5% vs. 85.7% respectively. A definitive histological diagnosis was obtained in 90.0% including 94.0% in the 16G group and 75.8% in the 18G group. Using Chi-square-test all these differences between 16G and 18G proved to be highly significant (p < 0.01). Median biopsy duration was 27 minutes. There was only one major complication: expansive subcapsular bleeding. Conclusion: MSCT-guided core biopsy provides fast and accurate diagnosis of focal liver lesions. The statistically significant higher rate of diagnostic results justifies the use of biopsy systems with larger core diameter (i.e. 16G).",

Results: Twenty-five patients had thoracic masses (two posterior mediastinal, one anterior mediastinal, two pleural, one chest wall, nineteen parenchymal). The lesion diameters ranged from 3-7 cm with average diameter of 5.3 cm and number of passes ranged from 2-4 with average of 2.9 passes per patient. Histopathological diagnosis of biopsy specimen was achieved in 92% (n = 23), in 4% (one case) histology was inconclusive and the sample was insufficient in one case (the biopsy was repeated). Flexible fibro-optic bronchoscopy was done in 19 cases. It showed a central mass in 37% (n = 7) and extrinsic compression in 10% (n = 2), could not be completed in 21% (n = 4) and was negative in 32% (n = 6). Cytological examination following bronchoalveolar lavage was positive in 32% (n = 6) and negative in 47% (n = 9). No samples could be obtained in 21% (n = 4). Pleural effusion was found in 10 cases. Cytological examination of the pleural effusion was positive for malignant cells in 40% (n = 4) and negative in 60 % (n = 6). There were no major complications or fatalities but minor complications occurred in 8% (n = 2): mild hemoptysis in one patient and a small pneumothorax in another (neither required further intervention).

For evaluation of the accuracy a phantom consisting of a base plate and 20 rods with various lengths with glass spheres at the top of every rod was used. Helical CT scans of the phantom with the reference frame with different slice thickness (1.25 mm, 2.5 mm and 5.0 mm) were obtained and the dataset was sent to the navigation system. Results: 300 punctures were performed. CT-scans were obtained and the distance from the needle tip to the previously planned target point was measured. The distance was defined as normal deviation from the achieved position to the planned target. The accuracy of all 300 punctures was 1.2 \u00b1 0.67 mm. The mean accuracy for 1.25 mm scans was 1.0 \u00b1 0.6 mm (n = 100), for 2.5 mm scans 1.1 \u00b1 0.6 mm (n = 100) and for 5.0 mm slice thickness 1.5 \u00b1 0.8 mm (n = 100). The deviation in the needle direction as evaluated in a separate study was 0.31 \u00b1 0.18 mm in 90 punctures. Conclusion: The presented device seems to be an ideal tool for various percutaneous CT-guided interventional procedures including biopsies, local tumor therapy, vertebroplasty etc. Purpose: Experiment to assess accuracy of a novel CT-navigation system for biopsy procedures in a phantom. Methods: The navigation system (CAPPA) consists of an optical tracking system (Polaris), device holder, a reference frame with CT-detectable markers as well as reflective markers visible for the optical tracking and user interface connected to the CT scanner. The frame is placed over the target area prior to CT-scan. The acquired CT volume data set is transferred to the user-interface for navigation planning. To measure the technical accuracy a calibrated 10G needle was placed with its tip exactly on 60 different targets of an individual acrylic phantom. The offsets calculated by the navigation system were noted. To evaluate the accuracy of the needle-positioning of the navigation system 6 radiopaque targets (d=2 mm) located in different positions in the phantom were punctured with a 7.5G needle (l=11 cm); control CT scans (Sensation 16) were made to verify needle tip positions. This procedure was repeated 10 times with a total of 60 punctures. The deviation from the needle tip position to the target in the CT scans was analyzed.",

Nominal logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds of post-disinfection bacterial growth based on group, gender, coincidental disease, biopsy site and specific factors (skin fold, hairy skin). Results: Controlling for the other factors, there was no significant difference in post-disinfection growth between the gel and saline groups (p = 0.10).

Results: The navigation system enabled accurate placement of the needles within the brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen and muscle tissue. The ACN-III needles allowed for sampling (\"biopsy\") of tissue cores with a mean width of 1.7 mm (range 1.2-2 mm) and a maximal length of 20 mm at all locations. The obtained tissue specimens were of sufficient size and adequate quality for histological analysis. Conclusion: Post-mortem navigated \"biopsy\" can reliably provide tissue samples from different locations of the body. The tissue cores sampled using ACN-III needles seem to be adequate for microscopic tissue analysis. The minimally invasive navigated tissue sampling might significantly improve the information from post-mortem imaging alone in cases that, for whatever reason, are not amenable to autopsy. Purpose: To assess the value of 64-MDCT cystography and virtual cystoscopy in the detection of bladder neoplasms smaller than 10 mm. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients referred for hematuria, or follow-ups after tumor resection, underwent examination of the pelvis on a 64-MDCT (Sensation 64, Siemens, Germany) with the following protocol: 50 mAs, 120 KV, thickness 1 mm, collimation 0.6, recon increment 0.6, kernel B30 smooth. Using a Foley catheter the bladder was completely emptied of urine and distended with approximately 350-400 cc of room air. Subjects were examined in supine and prone position. In patients with lesions larger than 1 cm, an additional scan was performed in the prone position after contrast injection. Datasets were downloaded to a dedicated workstation (Vitrea 3.7 Vital Images, Plymouth, USA) for image analysis. CT results were compared with those of conventional cystoscopy performed 1 week later. Results: Virtual cystoscopy showed 27 lesions, whilst conventional cystoscopy correctly visualized 28. Twenty-three lesions were in the range of interest (1-10 mm). A 3 mm lesion situated on the bladder dome, in a patient with poor bladder distension, was missed. Overall CT sensitivity for lesion detection was 91% with a specificity of 100%. Conclusion: Virtual cystoscopy is a non-invasive and accurate technique for the detection of bladder lesions smaller than 1 cm. The attenuation gradient between air and bladder wall allows a reduction of tube current, lowering patient exposure. Conventional cystoscopy is still required for biopsy and lesion removal. Results: In comparison with other sequences, FLAIR-sequence was more sensitive in the detection of bladder neoplasms. This sequence demonstrates the hyperintense signal of bladder neoplasms from the filled bladder lumen with no signal. The sensitivity in the identification of bladder neoplasms was 100% with FLAIR sequences, 89.6% with TSE T2-weighted sequences and 86.2% with SE T1-weighted sequences. That was due to the higher signal to lesion ratio of the FLAIR sequences in comparison with the others. In fact on FLAIR-sequences the mean value of contrast to lesion ratio of bladder neoplasm was 33.1 while on SE T1-weighted sequences and TSE T2-weighted sequences was respectively 15.2 and 29.2. FLAIR-sequences allowed the detection of small papillomas (less than 2 mm). TSE T2-weighted sequences were more sensitive than other sequences in the study of bladder wall infiltration. Conclusion: FLAIR-sequences were more sensitive than others in the detection of bladder neoplasms, thanks to their higher contrast to lesion ratio and can be very helpful in the visualization of small papillomas, especially when multifocal.",

Methods and Materials: Study received institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Six patients (age range, 24 -35 years, 5 female and 1 male) with VUR detected on fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) were recruited into the study. One patient was excluded when MR imaging revealed an intra-uterine pregnancy. These yielded 10 kidney ureter units (five were normal, and 5 had VUR detected on VCUG). MR cystography was performed using a 1.5 T MR scanner. Patients were catheterized and gadolinium enhanced saline was infused into the bladder. A gadolinium detection pulse sequence technique was used to allow real time visualization of the ureters as a means to detect VUR. When the contrast was seen refluxing into the ureter, a three-dimensional (3D) MR gradient echo sequence was triggered. The result was compared to VCUG. Results: Findings at MR cystography and VCUG were concordant in 8 (Four normal; 4 with VUR) of the 10 kidney ureter units (80%). There was discordance between the two techniques in the remaining 2 kidney ureter units; one had VUR detected on MR cystography only and the other on VCUG alone. There was also good concordance for the extent of hydronephrosis. Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of voiding MR cystourethrography in visualization of the male urethra. Methods and Materials: 10 volunteers and 86 patients underwent voiding MR cystourethrography. The MR examination was performed with a 1.5 Tesla superconductive magnet. The urinary bladder was filled with paramagnetic contrast agent by administering 20 mg furosemide followed by \u00be of the normal dose of a paramagnetic contrast agent. When the bladder was full, the patient was asked to urinate. An urisheath was placed on the penis in order to collect urine. During micturition T1-weighted spoiled 3D-GE acquisitions in the sagittal plane were performed (TR: 12 ms; TE: 2.7 ms; flip-angle: 40\u00b0; slice thickness: 2 mm; acquisition time: 12 s). Two consecutive acquisitions were performed and the 3D images were post processed with a MIP algorithm. In 10 patients we also performed urethral virtual endoscopy using VR-technique. Results: 10 patients were unable to perform the MR examination. In other cases we obtained homogeneous opacification of the bladder lumen and perfect evaluation of the male urethra. The visualization of the urethra with MIP reconstructed images was considered comparable to conventional cystourethrography. We detected 24 cases of bladder neck obstruction, 36 cases of urethral strictures, 2 urethral papillomatosis and 4 cases of benign prostatic hypertrophy. The site, length and the number of urethral strictures were accurately determined. The analysis of 3D sagittal scans and urethral virtual endoscopy allowed a better evaluation of the morphology of the urethral strictures compared with conventional cystourethrography. Conclusion: Voiding MR cystourethrography can replace standard retrograde and micturating cystourethrograms. This novel technique avoids both radiation exposure to the gonads and urinary catheterisation. Purpose: To evaluate the role of dynamic MR imaging in pelvic floor disorders, in comparison with conventional defecography. As it is impossible to reproduce a real defecation in a supine position in a MR unit, we propose a dynamic MR technique performed without defecation, by distending the rectum with air. Methods and Materials: Fifty-five patients with evidence of posterior pelvic floor disorders underwent conventional defecography and dynamic MR imaging in a supine position. After rectal air insufflation, the Foley catheter was the bench mark of the ano-rectal junction. T2-weighted HASTE sequences were acquired at rest, contraction and straining in axial and sagittal planes. A dynamic study was performed using a modified T2-weighted HASTE sequence (1image/second) in rest, squeeze and straining phases. Conventional defecography was considered the gold-standard. We adopted the same standard reference lines and angles of conventional defecography, as well as modified values specific for MR imaging, obtained from a control group (16 normal volunteers). MRI images were analyzed by two radiologists blind of the results of conventional defecography. Results: MR vs defecography identified 26/28 rectoceles (86%), 23/28 (82%) ano-rectal junction descents, 5/9 invaginations (56%), 6/6 dyskinetic pubo-rectalis syndrome; 4 enteroceles, 9 uterine descents, 10 cystoceles, undetected or underestimated at conventional defecography. Conclusion: MR imaging of the pelvic floor is a rapid and well tolerated examination. In comparison with defecography, it was valuable in the diagnosis of functional and pathological pelvic floor disorders, with a tendency to underestimate invaginations. On the other hand it provided additional information on the sphincters, levator ani, puborectalis muscles, uterine prolapses, cystoceles and enteroceles, underestimated at conventional defecography. Purpose: To evaluate the magnetic resonance spectroscopy patterns of testes in prepubertal and postpubertal males. Methods and Material: Fourteen patients who were referred to the urology department with various symptoms and signs were included in the study group. The conventional MR imaging sequences of all revealed normal findings. 22 MRS of testes were obtained from the remaining 12 patients. There were 6 adults (age: 19-35 years, mean age: 26 years) and 6 pediatric patients (age: 9-14 years, mean age: 12 year). Lipid and choline peaks were measured and choline/lipid ratios were calculated. Mann Whitney-U test was used for statistical analysis. Results: After all MR imaging and spectroscopy findings were obtained, they were evaluated by two radiologists. Two peaks were prominent and diagnostic: choline (3.21 ppm) and free lipid peak (1-1.5 ppm). There were statistically significant differences between adult and pediatric age groups (p < 0.001). Choline/ lipid ratios were ranging between 0.47-4.20 (Mean: 1.64) in adults and between 0.06-0.94 (Mean: 0.32) in the pediatric age group. Blood testosterone levels were evaluated in both study groups. Conclusion: Choline/lipid ratios were high in adults and low in the pediatric age group. This statistically significant difference represents the increasing amount of spermatogenesis in adults. We recommend using choline/lipid ratio for the evaluation of unilateral testicular spermatogenesis. To our knowledge, there was no relevant study in the literature dealing with the normal MR spectroscopy pattern of testes. This article will provide the preliminary findings and be the initiator of MRS studies of testes with various pathologies. Purpose: There is limited data available in the monitoring of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) after stereotactic radiosurgery (STRS) due to the need for repeated catheter angiography. Using a combination of static and dynamic MR angiographic sequences we have studied the rate of AVM obliteration at 12 months and correlated this with baseline AVM characteristics. Methods and Materials: Forty patients (41 AVMs) consented to a dedicated 1.5 T MR protocol 12 months after receiving STRS for a brain AVM. CE-SLINKY (static) and MR-DSA (dynamic) were performed. Nidal volumes were calculated using CE-SLINKY data in patients with a persisting arteriovenous shunt. The rate of change of nidus volume was computed by statistical methods using the planning angiographic data and the MR angiographic data. The AVM factors including 1) maximum linear dimension, 2) nidal volume, 3) AVM location, 4) nidal morphology, 5) venous drainage, 6) \"high-flow angiographic change\" and 7) prior embolization were used in the statistical analysis to determine their role in nidus obliteration. Results: Complete nidal obliteration was found in 9 patients, 26 showed greater than 50% nidal reduction and 6 had less than 50%. Without Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, only AVM venous drainage (p = 0.018) and AVM location (p = 0.032) were significantly correlated with rate of obliteration (Fisher's Exact Test). Purpose: To determine the relationship between functional MR imaging cortical organization and DTI white matter architecture in patients with AVMs; to predict functional network reorganization and to improve preoperative planning. Methods and Materials: BOLD functional MR imaging and DTI data were obtained in 7 patients (14-60y; 4M, 3 F) presenting with AVMs. Functional sensorimotor, language and visual systems were tested. A cross-correlation analysis of the fMRI data was used, with a p < 0.01. Supraselective WADA testing was performed in 5 patients for functional assessments. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and direction sensitive colour-coded FA maps were used to study white matter tracts. Results: Four of the seven patients showed functional MR imaging activation patterns within language, sensori-motor or visual cortex that were consistent with cortical reorganization. Altered architecture of white matter tracts was demonstrated in each of these four patients. Cortical reorganization was supported, though not proven, by WADA testing. In one case clear white matter tract abnormalities were identified without altered cortical organization, while two patients showed no cortical reorganization or altered white matter architecture. Conclusion: There is high association between cortical reorganization detected with functional MR imaging and altered architecture of white matter tracts detected with DTI in AVMs, with impact on preoperative planning.",

            "text": "Purpose: To evaluate venous drainage patterns of cavernous sinus dural arteriovenous fistula (CSDAVF) with an intracranial lesion seen on MR imaging. Methods and Materials: DSA and MR imaging findings of 18 patients (4 males and 14 females, age range 38-77 years, mean age 63.8 years) with angiographically proven CSDAVF were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the relationship between retrograde leptomeningeal venous drainage (RLVD) and abnormal signal intensity of the brain parenchyma on axial T1-weighted images before and after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA and T2-weighted fast spin-echo images (T2WI). Results: RLVD was identified on DSA in 10 of 18 patients (55.6%), including drainage into the superficial middle cerebral vein (n = 5), uncal vein (n = 3), petrosal vein (n = 3), lateral mesencephalic vein (n = 1) and anterior pontomesencephalic vein (n = 2). In 4 of 18 patients (22.2%), T2WI revealed abnormal hyperintense lesions in the region with RLVD. Of these 4 patients, one presented with putaminal hemorrhage, while the other three presented with hyperintensity of the pons or the middle cerebellar peduncle on T2WI, reflecting venous congestion, and 2 presented with enhancing lesions of the pons on the contrast study. All of these 4 patients showed concentration of venous outflow from cavernous sinus into RLVD and other venous drainage routes were obliterated. The patients without abnormal signal intensity of the brain parenchyma on MR imaging had other patent venous drainage routes in addition to RLVD. Conclusion: Brain parenchymal hyperintensity on T2WI or the contrast enhancement in CSDAVF is a crucial finding that indicates concentration of venous drainage into RLVD, causing venous congestion or parenchymal hemorrhage. bined standard of reference, two neuroradiologists assessed the MDCTA data sets using thin-slice multiplanar reformats, thin-slab MIP and volume rendering techniques. They rated in consensus whether simple endovascular coil placement was considered possible (i.e. without assisting techniques such as remodelling or stenting), based on the morphology of the aneurysm neck and on the presence of vessels originating from the aneurysm. The ratings were compared to the actual therapy results in each aneurysm. Results: Out of 84 aneurysms diagnosed per standard of reference, 72 were considered as potentially ruptured and amenable to acute treatment. 49 aneurysms were successfully coiled without stenting, 5 required additional stenting, 9 were primarily clipped, 5 were clipped after unsuccessful coiling attempts, 4 received no further therapy after unsuccessful coiling attempts. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of MDCTA for successful coil embolization is 94%, 92%, 96% and 88%. Conclusion: 16-row MDCTA with advanced postprocessing techniques is highly sensitive in the identification of intracranial aneurysms that can be successfully treated by endovascular coil embolization. Purpose: Although aneurysmal recanalization after coil embolization is a wellknown phenomenon, information on the enlargement of embolized aneurysms is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fate of embolized aneurysms with a focus on the incidence and risk factors of aneurysmal growth after coil embolization. Methods: A total of 529 patients harboring 591 intracranial aneurysms were treated by endovascular coil embolization from 1992 to 2004. We reviewed 586 angiographic studies of 214 cases who underwent follow-up angiographic studies. Radiological and clinical data were reviewed to identify the risk factors for enlargement of aneurysms after embolization. Results: Thirty-four cases showed enlargement of embolized aneurysms, and all of them showed major recanalization as well. Aneurysms showing minor recanalization revealed no increase in their sizes on the follow-up angiographic studies. The incidence of aneurysmal growth was 81% among cases with major aneurysmal recanalization, 35% among cases with any aneurysmal recanalization, and 8.5% among cases in which follow-up imaging studies were performed. The location of aneurysm at the terminal bifurcation was an important risk factor for aneurysm enlargement at the time of major recanalization. All bifurcation aneurysms except one showed enlargement in the presence of major recanalization. Older age and presence of a secondary pouch were found to be related to no growth of recanalized aneurysms. Conclusion: Aneurysm enlargement after coil embolization is common in the presence of major recanalization. Our data suggest that bifurcation aneurysms have a higher risk of enlargement after coil embolization when they are recanalized.",

Five patients harboring 7 aneurysms were surgically treated on an elective basis while 49 patients acutely presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nine patients (9 aneurysms) had a posterior circulation aneurysm while the remaining harbored anterior circulation aneurysms. Blood flow velocities of the parent, adjacent vessels and aneurysmal sac were measured by using a Consorma shapable micro-Doppler flow probe (Cook Vascular, Inc., Leechburg, PA, USA). Results: In 11 aneurysms (15.9%) there was decreased or absent flow in the parent vessel or on one of the adjacent vessels after clipping. The clip was repositioned and in 9 of those the blood flow in the previously compromised vessel was restored. In the remaining 2 cases repositioning of the clip could not improve the MDU findings. Interestingly, in 9 aneurysms (13%), MDU demonstrated flow through the aneurysmal dome although the aneurysmal neck appeared to be totally obliterated. After repositioning of the applied clip in 7 cases or application of a booster clip in 2 cases, the obtained MDU showed no blood flow. Conclusion: MDU seems to be a non-invasive, reliable alternative methodology to intra-operative angiography. This inexpensive method might lend itself to the C D E F B A G routine usage of aneurysm clipping for confirming patency of the parent and adjacent vessels, as well as complete obliteration of the aneurysm.",

            "text": "Purpose: The origin of the bleeding in perimesencephalic hemorrhage (PMH) is still unknown but clinical and radiological characteristics suggest a venous source. If PMH is of venous origin, less elevation of the intra-cranial pressure and less perfusion deficits will occur than in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH Purpose: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is an important cause of death and disability after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We studied the additional prognostic value of brain perfusion to three established predictors (age, clinical condition on admission and amount of subarachnoid blood) for the development of DCI. Methods and Materials: 69 patients scanned with perfusion CT within 72 hours after SAH were included. For each patient we determined cerebral blood flow (CBF) ratios of prespecified opposite regions of interest and the three established predictors. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the CBF ratio and the three established predictors by means of multivariate analysis (Cox regression). The additional prognostic value of CBF ratios was assessed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of two models: One with and one without addition of the CBF ratio to the three established predictors. Purpose: To test the diagnostic value of an increased ipsilateral vascular maps as MR imaging (D-MRI) sign of breast cancer. Subjects and Methods: 204 consecutive D-MRI exams using a 1.5 T equipment entered the analysis. Seventy-two exams were excluded due to unilateral imaging or previous treatment. For the remaining 132, maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of the first subtracted images of a T1-weighted 3D GE sequence (coronal 1-mm 128 par titions; TR/TE=11/4.8 ms; FA=25\u00b0; FOV=384 mm; matrix=384x192 mm; 1-mm 3 voxel; 0.1 mmol/kg Gd-DOTA; 120-s time resolution; 1 pre-and 4 post contrast phases) were reviewed. A one-side increased vasculature was reported when two or more vessels (of 30 mm or greater in length and 2 mm or greater in maximal transverse diameter) was found per breast. Gold standard was pathological examination or at least negative 1-year follow-up (for negative exams). Results: Excluding two bilateral cancers (with symmetrical vascular maps), a one-side increased breast vascular maps was found in 46 exams: 39 malignancies of 22.9 \u00b1 12.9 mm in diameter and 7 benignancies ( Purpose: To prospectively and intra-individually compare equivalent 0.1 mmol/ kg doses of Gd-BOPTA and Gd-DTPA for accuracy of detection and characterization of breast lesions on contrast-enhanced MR mammography (MRM). Methods and Materials: Twenty-six consecutive women with a suspected breast tumor on mammography and sonography underwent two identical MRM examinations at 1.5 T separated by 48-72h. A T1w 3D gradient-echo sequence was used and images were acquired pre and several minutes after injection of either Gd-DTPA or Gd-BOPTA at an identical flow rate of 2 ml/s. Separate and combined assessment of non-enhanced, enhanced and subtracted images was performed blindly by two readers in consensus. The accuracy for lesion detection was determined against final diagnosis, based on findings from conventional mammography, sonography and surgery. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and overall accuracy for malignant lesion identification was determined against histology. Purpose: The capability to quantify biological activity of atherosclerosis using MR imaging holds great promise for non-invasive risk-stratification based on plaque composition. Macrophages are known to play a central role in atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Gadolinium-containing immunomicelles (micelles linked to a specific antibody targeting macrophages) and micelles have been shown to improve in-vitro and ex-vivo assessment of macrophages using MR imaging. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether immunomicelles improve invivo imaging of atherosclerotic plaque in Apolipoprotein-E-Knockout (ApoE-KO) mice using MR imaging. Methods and Materials: Gadolinium-containing micelles were synthesized. Immunomicelles were made using a biotin-avidin-bridge to bind micelles to a specific antibody targeted to macrophage-scavenger-receptor (MSR). Immunomicelles, micelles and standard (Gd-DTPA/Gd-DOTA) paramagnetic contrast-agents were tested in ApoE-KO-mice. Mice were imaged at baseline with a 9.4T MR system using a high-spatial-resolution sequence. The mice were then imaged at inter vals following a tail injection of micelles (n = 6), immunomicelles (n = 7), or standard contrast agent (n = 4). Results: Using micelles the ratio of signal-intensity in the aortic wall post and pre-contrast, normalized to muscle, was an average of 1.4 \u00b1 0.3 (40%enhance- Results: Histological analysis revealed low grade histological necrosis/thrombosis (non-responder) in 5 out of 9 animals, while 4 animals showed a good treatment response. Responders as defined by histology showed a significant decrease in \u2206R2* compared to the control group (\u2206R2* control group: 0.0175 \u00b1 0.0021 msec -1 versus responder: 0.0039 \u00b1 0.0018 msec -1 ; p < 0.01). However for non-responders the \u2206R2* remained unchanged (\u2206R2* control group: 0.0175 \u00b1 0.0021 msec -1 versus non-responder: 0.0167 \u00b1 0.0029 msec -1 ; p > 0.5). Moreover the VVF of the non-responders was significantly higher compared to the responders (nonresponder: 0.0167 \u00b1 0.0029 msec -1 versus responder: 0.0039 \u00b1 0.0018 msec -1 ; p < 0.02). Conclusion: Parametric MR imaging allows a non-invasive, early assessment of anti-angiogenic treatment efficacy using a thrombogenic vascular targeting agent. This imaging paradigm requires further evaluation for other anti-angiogenic treatment modalities. Purpose: To depict differences in leukocyte migration to arthritic joints with optical imaging, before and after anti-inflammatory therapy. Methods and Materials: An immune-mediated monoarthritis was induced in the right knee of 12 Sprague Dawley rats. Six rats were investigated before therapy, six rats were investigated after seven days of systemic cortisone therapy. Legs were shaved prior to imaging. Optical images of both knees were acquired before, at 5 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours after injection of DiD-labelled leukocytes. Images were evaluated by calculating signal intensity ratios between the arthritic (A) and contralateral normal (N) knee. A/N-ratios were tested for significant differences between baseline values and values after cell injection using a paired t-test and between the untreated and cortisone-treated group using an unpaired t-test. Imaging data was compared with fluorescence microscopy. Results: Optical images before leukocyte injection showed a minor, but significantly increased autofluorescence of arthritic knees compared to normal knees. At 4 h and 24 h after intravenous injection of DiD-labeled leukocytes, the fluorescence increased significantly in the arthritic knees (p < 0.05), but not in the normal knees. Arthritic-to-normal knee ratios were significantly higher before treatment than after cortisone treatment (p < 0.05). Fluorescence microscopy confirmed an accumulation of DiD-labelled leukocytes in arthritic knees, but not normal knees. The arthritic knees contained a higher quantity of fluorescent leukocytes before than after cortisone treatment.",

This leukocyte accumulation is significantly reduced after anti-inflammatory therapy. The highest stem cell fractions were always found in liver, spleen and kidney.

However, in both tumor models fixation reduced the amount of progenitor cells in tumors by a factor of > 10. While 20 \u00b1 9% were still positive for AC133 in HaCaT-ras-tumors, no positive cells were found in HaCaT-A5-tumors. 24 \u00b1 19%/24 \u00b1 3% (HaCaT-ras/HaCaT-A5) of the progenitor cells were positive for smooth muscle actin.

Conclusion: Accumulation of human stem cells in both tumor models does not seem to underlay active migration, however, adhesion may be receptor mediated. The results further indicate that the progenitor cells predominantly differentiate to smooth muscle cells or myofibroblasts and only to a lesser degree to endothelial cells.

Conclusion: Macrophages were successfully labelled by a bimodal contrast agent. The different relaxivities obtained for pure magnetosomes and labelled macrophages may be caused by shielding effects of the surrounding cytoplasm or a conglomeration of the nanoparticles inside the cells.

Purpose: To evaluate the efficiencies of three recent ultrasound technologies, compound (CI), tissue harmonic (tHI), speckle reduction imaging (SRI) and their combinations (CI+tHI and CI+tHI+SRI) compared to the conventional B-mode imaging, in the evaluation of solid breast masses. Methods and Material: 126 solid breast masses (mean size 14 mm) with BI-RADS 3-to-6 categories were evaluated. Cine views obtained with single and combined technologies for each lesion was recorded. SRI function was used at the maximum level. Static images were obtained from the same planes of cine views for each lesion. Images were reviewed and graded by three observers for delineation of lesion boundaries, clarity of internal texture, and conspicuity of posterior echo pattern, edge-shadowing and peripheral echogenic halo. Friedman's test was used for multiple statistical comparisons between the techniques. Results: In the evaluation of lesion boundaries and peripheral halo, tHI+CI+SRI was the most valuable method, followed by SRI, tHI+CI, tHI, CI, and B-mode (p < 0.001). In the evaluation of internal texture, CI was the most sensitive method followed by tHI, while SRI, single or combined, was the least valuable one (p < 0.001). In the evaluation of posterior echo pattern and edge shadowing, SRI was the most, and tHI+CI+SRI was the second most useful method (p < 0.001). Conclusion: SRI, CI, and tHI have significant advantages over B-mode imaging in the evaluation of solid breast masses. SRI is useful in delineating lesion boundaries, peripheral halo, posterior echo and edge shadowing. CI and tHI are useful in clarifying internal texture.",

Purpose: To determine how accurately freehand elasticity images and measurements correlate to the pathological appearances and dimensions of breast cancers. An earlier study suggested that it is more accurate than conventional greyscale ultrasound for demonstrating breast tumour extent. Reported series show reoperation rates of as high as 50% when wide local excision is based on conventional breast imaging techniques. Methods: Freehand elasticity images (using real time elasticity software implemented on a Siemens Elegra ultrasound scanner) were obtained at regular intervals through the tumour the day before surgery. The skin of the breast was marked to allow orientation sutures to be placed on the tumour specimen as it was excised. Histology sections were made in the same plane as the imaging planes at right angles to the greatest diameters of the greyscale tumour appearance. The edges of the specimen were examined to ensure tumour margin extent was accurately measured. The skin marking at imaging, and specimen marking at surgery, allowed ultrasound and specimen image correlation. Methods and Materials: 102 cases of infiltrating breast cancer have been reviewed, involving pre-surgical axillary echographical evaluation and subsequent pathological verification following lymph-adenectomy (gold standard). The echographical study was performed with Mode B echography, high-frequency sound (7.5-10 Mhz), and was considered \"positive\" or \"negative\", according to the presence/absence of pathological findings in the nodes.

            "text": "14:00 Purpose: To describe US and MR imaging findings in patients with peroneal intraneural ganglia. Methods and Materials: 17 consecutive patients with dysfunction of the common peroneal nerve were evaluated with 12-5 MHz and 17-5 MHz US and 1.5 T MR imaging. All patients had abnormal nerve conduction studies. Results: In all but 1 patient, US and MR imaging identified ganglia of variable size and shape in relation to the superior tibiofibular joint. US and MR imaging divided these cysts into extraneural ganglia (n = 9/16), which developed outside the nerve, and intraneural ganglia (n = 7/16) developing within the nerve. Intraneural ganglia had a stereotypical appearance: US found the bulk of the ganglion on the anterolateral aspect of the superior tibiofibular joint, located remotely from the position of the peroneal nerve. The ganglion was invariably associated with a dilated articular branch. This branch appeared as a long tubular process coursing along the posterolateral aspect of the fibula to join the bulk of the ganglion with the nerve. It was markedly enlarged and assumed a cystic appearance without detectable fascicles. More proximally, the fascicles of the deep and common peroneal nerve were displaced eccentrically by the cyst growing within the epineurium. The overall size of the ganglion and the entity of nerve deficit varied with time. Two intraneural ganglia regressed at 6-months follow-up. Conclusion: In the evaluation of peroneal neuropathy caused by superior tibiofibular joint ganglia, US and MR imaging provide unique information on the intraneural location of the cyst and the status of the involved nerve. Purpose: To determine the outcome of bone marrow edema (BME) and subchondral lesions of the knee after treatment with either the prostacyclin analogue Iloprost or Tramadol in a double-blind, randomized MR imaging study. Methods and Materials: Thirty-one patients with painful BME of the knee caused by early-stage osteonecrosis, osteoarthritis, bone bruise or stress were included, and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Coronal STIR images of the affected knees were acquired. After the initial MR examinations, patients were randomized either to Iloprost (n = 16, group 1) or Tramadol (n = 15, group 2). The treatment duration was 4 weeks. Follow-up MR images were obtained after 3 months and again after 1 year. For baseline and follow-up examinations, the mean volume and signal contrast of the BME were quantified using a computer-assisted method. The presence of subchondral lesions immediately adjacent to the subchondral bone was also assessed. Results: In affected bones, mean BME volume regression at the 3-month follow-up indicated a better treatment effect for Iloprost (Iloprost: -47.1%; Tramadol: -38.6%). Mean BME signal contrast regression was also higher in group 1 (Iloprost: -42.8%; Tramadol: -38.5%). Subchondral lesions in the Iloprost group decreased from 11 at baseline to 1 at final follow-up, while in the Tramadol group, subchondral lesions only decreased from 5 at baseline to 3 at final follow-up. Classification and regression tree analysis demonstrated an increase of the retraction index of 1% in 40% of lesions at \u2264 24 months, of 7% in 32% of lesions at 24-40 months, of 52% in 17% of lesions at 40-60 months and of 17% in 11% of lesions at > 60 months (F =51.9, p =.0001).",

Low-frequency (65 Hz) mechanical waves were transmitted into the liver by a transducer placed at the back of the patients. A motion-sensitized spin echo sequence, phase-locked to the mechanical excitation was used. The phase maps were processed to obtain elasticity and viscosity maps.

Purpose: To assess the measurement variability in lung nodule volume that is associated with the image plane. Methods and Materials: 121 non-calcified pulmonary nodules (\u2264 30 mm) from 44 consecutive patients were included. CT scans were acquired using a 16-detector row CT scanner with 16 \u00d7 0.75-mm collimation. Two sets of overlapping images were reconstructed by two section thicknesses (1-, and 3-mm) at 0.2-mm reconstruction intervals. From these highly overlapping data sets, at each section thickness, we sub-sampled and prepared multiple contiguous, non-overlapping image sets by shifting the z-position of the images. For the non-overlapping data set of 1-mm section thickness, the starting point in z-axis was either 0 or 0.6 mm. Likewise, for the non-overlapping data set of 3-mm section thickness, the starting point in z-axis was either 0 or 1.6 mm. Thus, in each set, a nodule is centered at a different image plane. A commercially available software package (Vitrea 2; Vital Images) was used for the volume measurements. The volume measured from two different image planes along the z-axis was compared for two section thicknesses respectively with a paired t-test. Results: Due to failure of measurements in some pairs, 82 pairs of 1-mm section thickness and 71 pairs of 3-mm section thickness were compared. There were no statistically significant differences between two different image planes along the z-axis for both 1-mm and 3-mm section thickness (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Measurement variability by different image planes along the z-axis was not a significant factor in volumetric measurement of lung nodules.",

Subsequently, target lesions (most significant lesions identified before and after chemotherapy) were evaluated with a CAD system to establish volumetric measurements. Observers' unidimensional and CAD volumetric measurements were analyzed for comparison. Results: 24 nodules (DT:5-18 mm in the first study and 4-20 mm in the follow-up study) were included in this study. Observers agreed in the assessment of therapy response in 21 nodules:8 were considered increased in dimensions and 13 were judged stable. Observers and CAD measurements disagreed in three nodules; two considered as stable by the radiologists and increased by CAD; one considered increased by the radiologists and stable by CAD. In judging patients response, radiologists disagreed in two cases. CAD and observers did not agree in one patient. Purpose: To assess the effect of 3D lossy image compression on computer aided detection. Methods and Material: 120 cases were selected from MDCT chest scans acquired with collimation of 1.25 mm, and collected from different sites. The database was composed of 66 low-dose cases and 109 cases with a high-frequency reconstruction kernel. Two expert radiologists established that 37 cases had no actionable nodules and the remaining 83 cases contained 169 nodules. The mean nodule size was 5.8 mm \u00b1 3.0 [SD] (3.8 -35 mm). All cases were compressed using the 3D SPIHT algorithm to 24:1, 48:1, 96:1 levels. A study of the effect of compression on sensitivity was performed at different operating points (2.5, 5, 10 FP/case) using McNemar's test. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the impact of compression level, nodule and scanner characteristics on CAD sensitivity. Results: Compared to no compression, there was no significant degradation in sensitivity found at any of the proposed compression levels and operating points. However, between compression levels there was marginal association with sensitivity. Specifically, 24:1 level was significantly better than 96:1 at all operating points, and occasionally better than no compression at 10 FP/case. Based on multivariable analysis, nodule location was found to be a significant predictor with a lower sensitivity associated with pleural nodules. Nodule size, dose, reconstruction filter, and contrast medium were not significant predictors. Conclusion: CAD detection performance of solid lung nodules was found to be robust across all compression levels up to 96:1. CTs were acquired with a 16-row MDCT using 1 mm slice thickness. Three radiologists independently reviewed in a random order on a workstation 3 types of images: axial 1-mm images, axial 6-mm MIP, CAD system's detections (Lung-Care, Siemens). An independent experienced chest radiologist decided for each detection method which nodules were true positive nodules. Results: 287 nodules of 711 (40.4%) nodules \u2265 1 mm were identified as true positive. The detection rates of the three independent observers with 1-mm axial images were 64/287 (22.3%), 86 (30%), and 136 (47.3%). When MIP images were added to 1-mm images, these rates were 123/287 (42.9%), 140 (48.8%), and 205 (71.4%) (p < 0.0001). When CAD was added to 1-mm images, these rates were 145/287 (50.5%), 154/287 (53.7%), and 190/287 (66.2%) (p < 0.0001). CAD detected 298 opacities; 107 of them were true positive nodules (detection rate: 107/287; 37.3%). CAD showed 6.82 false positive per CT scan. 31 nodules were detected by CAD only; they were smaller than other nodules (2.24 \u00b1 0.9 vs 3.14 \u00b1 1.7, p < 10-4). Conclusion: MIP and CAD reduced the number of overlooked nodules on 1-mm images. The additional nodules detected by these 2 techniques were different.",

Additionally, ischemia was detected in 18% that could be referred for further diagnostic studies including CT angiography or catheterization. Purpose: The aim of this prospective study was the optimization of a gradientecho (GRE) MR tagging sequence at 3.0 T. Methods: 17 consecutive healthy subjects (mean age 43.2 yrs) and 3 patients were scanned at a 1.5 T and a 3 T whole body scanner (Siemens). A prospectively triggered GRE sequence was used. Sequence parameters were as follows: TR 5.2 ms, TE 3.7 ms, matrix 192, field of view 350x350 mm, temporal resolution 46 ms. Sequence parameters like flip angle (8-16\u00b0), tag size (4-8 mm) and slice thickness (4-8 mm) were varied systematically at both field strengths. For each parameter, the signal-to-noise (SNR), contrast-to-noise (CNR) and relative contrast myocardium-to-tag (RCMT) were evaluated individually. Results: While the conspicuity of the tags is greatly reduced in the diastolic phase at 1.5 T, tags are clearly visible in the myocardium in all phases at 3 T. Based on initial results, a slice thickness of 6 mm and a tag thickness of 8 mm were found to be suitable. At 1.5 T, the optimal flip angle was found to be 12 deg while that at 3 T was found to be 8 deg based on overall image quality, SNR and tag conspicuity (RCMT). Blood SNR was significantly higher at 3 T despite the lower flip angle. Conclusion: Myocardial tagging at 3 T has shown a superior image quality in comparison to 1.5 T due to a higher baseline SNR and an improved CNR as well as RCMT. As a consequence of suppressed fading of the tags, the accessibility to the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle becomes possible. Purpose: Myocardial MR-perfusion imaging (MPI) is increasingly gaining attention for the assessment of hemodynamically relevant coronary stenoses. Shortcomings of MPI at 1.5 T are limited SNR and image contrast. The aim of our study was to intraindividually compare MPI at 3.0 T and 1.5 T.",

Contrast dynamic was analyzed visually and quantitatively applying least square fit of the signal-time curve. SNR measurements were performed in precontrast and contrast enhanced myocardium. Image quality was rated by two independent observers (score 0-3). Results: The image score was significantly higher at 3.0 T (2.0 \u00b1 0.3/2.4 \u00b1 0.3 p < 0.05).

Because of the high rate of necrotic and inflammatory damage to the biliary system, hepatic artery embolization for induction of hepatic regeneration is not considered suitable for human application. Methods and Materials: 24 consecutive patients (men 15, women 9, mean age 73 years) between September 1999-January 2005 underwent arterial examination and embolization, for acute upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding due to gastro-duodenal ulcers, following endoscopic treatment failure. In 16 cases, selective embolization of the thin arterial pancreatico-duodenal branch, that was supplying the ulcer was feasible with coils and/or histoacryl (glue). For the 8 others patients, the \"sandwich\" technique was systematically performed with coils in the gastroduodenal artery, especially in the absence of contrast medium extravasation. The coaxial technique was mainly used (17/24) with a 3 F microcatheter. Results: In this group (24), no major complications related to the procedure were observed. Immediate, durable and permanent haemostasis was achieved in 22 patients, without a second catheterisation during the following days; only 2 patients were operated on with success after rebleeding. On the other hand, regardless of their clinical conditions at the endovascular intervention, several variables did impact on the primary success, including multiorgan system failure (6/24), with a pejorative outcome during the first three months. Conclusion: Angiographic selective embolization with a microcatheter may be an effective way to stop massive life threatening bleeding from gastro-duodenal ulcers, especially in the case of debilated non operable patients. For the mid and long term outcome (3 months-6 years), the patient's survival is directly dependent on their initial clinical condition, at the embolization procedure. At the end of the follow-up period, the size of thyroid gland had decreased by one third to one half of its original volume, but 4 patients continued to require antithyroid drugs. Histologic analysis of thyroid tissue from 6 patients who had embolization followed by surgery showed occlusion of both the superior and/or inferior thyroid arteries plus most of their branches. Consequently, embolization of the majority of the thyroid glands was achieved, and evidence of chemical inflammation, necrosis and fibrosis were observed in embolized thyroid tissue. Conclusion: TAE is an effective, minimally invasive and safe method for the treatment of Graves' disease patients who cannot, or choose not to, accept current therapies. There were 5 males and 17 females, ranging in age from 12 to 62 years (mean 38.9 years). Eight patients presented with bleeding and 4 with loin pain. The remaining 10 patients were asymptomatic at presentation but were treated either for having tumours that were large (more than 4 cm diameter) or increasing in size. The mean largest diameter of the tumours was 10 cm (range 2.5 to 24.4 cm).

Methods and Materials: Twenty-two patients underwent 1H-MRSI at 3 T (Siemens TRIO) before radical prostatectomy. After acquiring conventional T2-weighted MR images, a PRESS sequence with optimized 180\u00b0 pulses and 2 dual-band frequency selective excitation pulses to suppress water and lipids was applied. Up to 8 outer volume saturation slabs were used. Voxel size was 7x7x7 mm 3 . In consensus, a radiologist and MR spectroscopist reviewed whole-mount section histopathology on which tumours were outlined. Blinded to metabolite spectra, healthy peripheral zone (PZ), periurethral (U), central gland (CG) tissue and tumor voxels were selected by matching the T2-weighted images with histopathology. Purpose: To evaluate a dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) sequence with low temporal resolution (and thus good spatial resolution and slice coverage) for the detection and localization of prostate cancer foci. Methods and Materials: 46 patients underwent prostate MR imaging before rad-ical prostatectomy. In addition to axial, sagittal and coronal T2-weighted sequences, an axial DCE sequence (14 slices, 30 seconds) was repeated 3 times after injection of gadolinium (20 cc at 2 cc/s). For image analysis, the prostate was divided into 20 segments. DCE images were assessed only visually, all early enhancing lesions being considered malignant in the peripheral zone. In the central gland, only early enhancing lesions with a homogeneous appearance and or invading the peripheral zone were considered malignant. Three independent readers, blinded to clinical data and patients names, evaluated T2 and DCE images separately. They had to specify cancer involvement within each segment and to record tumor nodule number and location. Results were compared with wholemount step-sections of the surgical specimens. Results: Of the 920 segments examined histologically, 227 were invaded (25%). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of segments involvement were respectively, depending on the readers, 0.13-0.23 and 0.93-0.98 for T2 images and 0.46-0.56 and 0.94-0.99 for DCE images. Forty-nine malignant nodules (> 0.3 cc) were present at histology: 49-60% were detected and correctly located on T2 sequence with 19-50 false positive; 77-81% were detected and correctly located on DCE-MR imaging with 19-45 false positive. Conclusion: DCE-MR imaging allows better detection and localization of prostate cancer foci than T2-weighted MR imaging, even if a low-temporal resolution is used.",

Gradl, L. Pallwein, D. zur Nedden, F. Frauscher; Innsbruck/AT (johann.gradl@uibk.ac.at) Purpose: Transrectal gray scale ultrasound guided biopsy is the standard method for diagnosing prostate cancer (PC). Improved cancer detection with ultrasound contrast agents is related to a better detection of tumor vascularity. We evaluated the impact of a combined approach of contrast enhanced, color Doppler targeted biopsy (CECD) and systematic biopsy (SB) for the PC detection rate in men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) 4.0 to 10 ng/ml. Methods and Materials: We examined 380 screening volunteers with a total PSA of 4.0 to 10 ng/ml (percent free PSA less than 18). CECD was always performed before SB. Another investigator blinded to the contrast enhanced findings performed 10 SBs. The cancer detection rate for the CECD, SB and combined approaches was assessed. Results: PC was detected in 143 of 380 patients (37.6%, mean total PSA 6.2 ng/ ml). The PC detection rate for CECD and for SB was 27.4% and 27.6%, respectively. The overall cancer detection rate with the 2 methods combined was 37.6%. For targeted biopsy cores the detection rate was significantly better than for SB cores (32.6% vs 17.9%, p < 0.01). CECD in a patient with cancer was 3.1 times more likely to detect PC than SB. Conclusion: CECD allows for the detection of lesions that cannot be found on gray scale ultrasound or SB. CECD allows for the assessment of neovascularity associated with PC. However, the combined use of CECD and SB allows for maximal detection of PC with a detection rate of 37.6% in our patients with a PSA of 4 to 10 ng/ml.",

Kim; Seoul/KR (yuntj@radiol.snu.ac.kr) Purpose: To determine the relationship between pain and prostate volume during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Methods and Materials: Between March 2004 and September 2004, the total prostate volume, peripheral zone volume, and transition zone volume of 71 patients, who had prostate biopsies, were retrospectively analysed. Pain was assessed with a visual analogue scale, during periprostatic nerve block (VAS 1), during the biopsy procedure (VAS 2) and 20 minutes afterwards (VAS 3). Associations between prostate volume and pain during transrectal prostate biopsy were retrospectively evaluated using linear regression models. Results: Total prostate volume was positively associated with VAS 2 (p = 0.0220) and VAS 3 (p = 0.0012). Peripheral zone volume was also positively associated with VAS 2 (p = 0.0231) and VAS 3 (p = 0.0001). However no significant association could be demonstrated between total prostate volume or peripheral zone volume and VAS 1. There was not any significant relationship between transition zone volume and VAS values. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of finding lymph node metastases outside of the normal (= limited) surgical dissection area, using Ferumoxtran-10 enhanced MR imaging, in patients with prostate cancer. This is in order to select which patients are best suited for an 'extended' lymphadenectomy or CT-guided biopsy. Methods and Material: 300 consecutive patients with biopsy proven prostate cancer (PSA > 10, or Gleason > 6 or DRE stage T3) were enrolled in this study. T1-weighted TSE and T2*-weighted GRE MR images of the pelvis were obtained, 24 hours after Ferumoxtran-10 administration. Positive nodes on MR examinations were called inside, or outside the normal surgical area. Based on MR imaging results, a lymph node dissection, a MRL guided minimal extended lymph node dissection, or CT-guided lymph node biopsy was performed. Results: Forty-nine (16%) patients had malignant nodes on histological examination. In 21 patients (43 %), malignant nodes were found exclusively outside the limited surgical area. In 3 (6%) patients malignant nodes were found both inside the limited dissection field and outside this area. In the remaining 25 (51%) patients malignant nodes were found in the area inside the limited dissection field. The feasibility of quantitative T2* measurement has been demonstrated in the fetal brain. Although there are some differences between SO 2 values determined by MR imaging and blood samples, there is reasonable correlation between these two methods. Therefore MR imaging has potential to non-invasively assess oxygen saturation and consequent fetal risk.",

The fetal brain during this period is undergoing early developmental changes, especially in terms of gyration and sulcation. The authors want to assess the benefit of fetal MR imaging for detection of migration and gyration anomalies of fetuses up to 24 WG. Methods and Material: 48 CNS examinations of fetuses up to 24 WG were performed on a 1.5 T scanner. Heavily T2W images of the brain were acquired in three orthogonal planes and at least in two planes for the spine. T1W images were routinely used for the brain and spine in one plane. We acquired all images without fetal or maternal sedation. MR imaging results were compared to autopsy or postnatal imaging, clinical follow-up and the US study. Results: We found 8 (16.7%) cases of migration and gyration anomalies: 3 complete callosal agenesis, 1 callosal dysgenesis, 1 schizencephaly, 2 complex migration anomaly and 1 parenchymal atrophy. US found mostly indirect changes such ventriculomegaly, dilation of subarachnoid space or thin cortex. We found 25 (52.1%) other anomalies (ventriculomegaly, posterior fossa anomalies, spinal dysrhaphisms etc), 15 (31.3%) examinations were normal. Autopsy/follow-up confirmed the MR diagnosis in 87.5%. Conclusion: Despite the presence of only early developmental changes in the examined brain, fetal MR imaging before 24 WG is capable of detecting CNS migration and gyration anomalies and provides valuable diagnostic information compared to US.",

Results: Ferumoxtran IP was resorbed from the peritoneum before 11 hours, and detected in plasma between 0 to 75 hours (concentration peak at 8 h, 660 mg/ l). A significant (P < 0.05) decrease of liver, spleen and bone marrow signal was observed from 2 hours (liver, spleen) and 4 hours (bone marrow) after IP and beyond that.

Purpose: To determine the feasibility of multimodality imaging in paediatric patients suffering from neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and Ewing sarcoma. Methods and Materials: In the last three years 16 paediatric patients underwent multimodality imaging in our institution. Among them 4 patients with neuroblastoma (aged 9 months to 2 years) were imaged 8 times, 2 patients with hepatoblastoma (1 and 4 years) 3 times, and 2 patients with Ewing sarcoma (11 and 14 years) 3 times for staging and restaging. Overall 7 superimpositions of CT and SPECT, 4 of CT and PET, 2 of MR and SPECT and 2 of MR and PET were performed on a TREON StealthStation\u00ae Navigation System (Medtronic, USA). Up to 4 years of age, all datasets were obtained one by one in one session during general anaesthesia. Movement was additionally inhibited using a Bluebag\u00ae vacuum mattress (Medical Intelligence, Germany). Results: Superimposition of datasets was successful in all examinations (n = 15). Follow-up and restaging after therapy was possible in measuring tumour extent and functional activity of tumour tissue. Conclusion: Multimodality imaging is possible even in young patients using general anaesthesia and immobilization devices. Tumour extent and function can be determined in one dataset leading to appropriate adjustment following surgical, chemo or radiation therapy. 14) and MRI (n = 11) examinations were performed in six pediatric patients with histopathologically proven PTLD in the initial staging and during the course of therapy with an anti-CD20 chimeric antibody (Rituximab). One (n = 3), two (n = 2) or three (n = 1) follow-up studies were performed in all patients. Images were retrospectively correlated on a lesion by lesion basis. Results: In five patients PTLD occurred 12 (\u00b1 7) months after transplantation of the heart and lungs (n = 1) or the kidney (n = 4). In one patient PTLD was diagnosed 84 months after transplantation of the heart (n = 1). PTLD showed organ involvement of the lung (n = 2), the liver (n = 1), the kidneys (n = 2), the digestive tract (n = 2), the lymphatic nodes (n = 6) and the skeletal system (n = 1). All sites of organ involvement as demonstrated by CT or MRI showed markedly increased tracer uptake in FDG-PET in the initial staging. During therapy, FDG-PET was able to demonstrate response early whereas in CT and MRI the lesions showed only delayed changes. Conclusion: [ 18 F]-FDG-PET (/CT) aids with the accurate initial staging of pediatric patients suffering from PTLD. It allows response to therapy to be demonstrated earlier than CT or MR imaging. Purpose: Although Hodgkin's disease (HD) in children has an event free survival (EFS) of about 95%, the rate of secondary malignancies is about 25% after 30 years. Radiation therapy seems to be the most important risk factor. Therefore the GPOH-HD 2002 study group attempts to reduce the indication for radiation therapy. Methods: Until now only the patients with complete remission on CT/MRI after chemotherapy get no radiation therapy. This strategy had no influence on the EFS. The next study generation is intended to further reduce the indication for radiation therapy using FDG-PET for response evaluation. In our study in 41 patients with early stage HD CT/MRI was paralleled by FDG-PET in initial staging and in the follow-up. Results: 7 of the 41 patients were in CR based on PET and CT/MRI criteria, one patient with CT/MRI-based CR had still a positive PET result. In 17 patients PET was completely negative after chemotherapy whereas residual masses were found by CT/MRI. In 2 cases PET was not able to be evaluated in its entirety. In summary, using a PET-based strategy, 27/41 patients (66%) with early stage HD would not have to be irradiated in the future in contrast to 9/41 patients (21%) according to the current strategy. Conclusion: By using FDG-PET-based stratification in addition to the established CT/MRI, the number of non-irradiated patients will increase dramatically. We estimate that about 60 -70% of all patients with early stage HD will no longer receive radiation therapy without reduction of EFS rates.",

Kim; Pusan/KR (kschoo0618@medimail.co.kr) Purpose: To investigate clinical usefulness of composite volume rendered images in the evaluation of the relationship between cardiovascular structure and airways in children with complex congenital heart disease. Methods and Materials: 4-slice or 16-slice MSCT scanning was performed consecutively in 77 children (age range 5 days to 5 years, mean age: 6.4 months) with congenital heart disease and respiratory symptoms, chest radiograph abnormality or abnormal course of the pulmonary artery on echocardiography. MSCT C D E F B A G scanning was performed during breathing and after sedation with chloral hydrate in all patients. Contrast medium was administered through a pedal or arm venous route in all patients. The CT volume data was transferred to commercially available software (voxelplus2, Seoul, Korea). The VR technique was use to reconstruct the cardiovascular structures and airways, and then both volume-rendered images were composed using the software. Results: Stenoses were seen in the trachea in 1 patient and in bronchuses in 14 patients (19%). Their causes were abnormal course of the pulmonary artery in 2 patients, circumflex retro-esophageal aortic arch in 2, pulmonary artery dilation in 1, anterior displacement of the descending aorta or posterior displacement of the ascending aorta following operation in 5, posterior displacement of the pulmonary artery in 4, and sub-pulmonary sling in 1 patient. Other patients with complex congenital heart disease did not have significant airway stenoses. Conclusion: Composition of both volume-rendered images with MSCT can provide more exact airway images in relationship to surrounding cardiovascular structures and can thus offer optimal management strategies in treating congenital heart disease.

We evaluated this purely rawdata-based synchronization signal as an alternative to the ECG-signal for phase-correlated image reconstruction using a 64-slice CT scanner (Sensation 64, Siemens, Forchheim). For evaluation data of 90 consecutive patients were used scanned with 2\u202232*0.6 mm collimation, 0.33 s rotation time and concurrent ECG recording. As a quality measure the correlation of the ECG with the kymogram was used for validation. Additionally, visual assessment of the kymogram-based and the ECG-based reconstructed images was performed by a double-blind comparative rating. Results: In 70 out of 90 patients a high correlation between the kymogram and the ECG was observed with a mean difference of the detected heart rate below 4 bpm. In 6 out of 90 patients a strong improvement in image quality was achieved by using a kymogram-based reconstruction. This was due to bad ECG recordings. Conclusion: Synchronization signals on the basis of a kymogram correlated well with the ECG for most patients and improved image quality in some cases.

The used approach splits the data into contributions of different kinds of Radon-planes. In particular, we combined different gating-functions with different kinds of Radonplane contributions.

The reconstructed images were analyzed regarding image quality and artifacts. Conclusion: An exact filtered back-projection algorithm can be combined with a cardiac gating approach. Thus the method is a good candidate for future systems with a large area detector. Purpose: When metal implants present, low signal-to-noise ratio is caused in projection and the noises are with high energy. Conventional methods reduced the noises by smoothing or interpolating the affected region in the projection, which inevitably cause errors and blur reconstruction. This study provides a new technique to amend the wavelet coefficients of the projection by developing a shrink algorithm based on statistical evaluation to isolate the noises from the projection. Methods and Materials: Two dimensional phase shift wavelet decomposition is adapted to decompose the projection into several components. The energy of each component in the affected region is compared with that in the rest part of the projection, and a shrink algorithm is derived to reduce the correspondence of the noises in the projection according to statistical evaluation. A repaired broken bone of a leg of pork is scanned with a stainless steel plate and screws to demonstrate the method. Results: A pig's leg with a lead nail inside the bone was scanned with the parameters of 140.0 kV and 40 mA. FBP with interpolation causes low frequent disturbance, normal wavelet method cannot reduce streaking completely.

Effective doses were measured for each protocol with thermoluminescent dosimeters inserted in an anthropomorphic phantom and compared with the same values computed by the ImPaCT CT patient dosimetry calculator software and corrected by a factor taking in account the number of slices (16 to 64). The differences were always below 20%. The effective doses range from 1.5 mSv (head) to 12.4 mSv (abdomen). The dose reduction algorithm of the scanner was assessed comparing the effective dose measured in a phantom to the dose computed on 46 patients. The reduction factors range from 5% to 32%, depending on the protocol and patient size. The possibility of a further dose reduction was investigated measuring spatial resolution, contrast and noise as a function of CT-DIw.

Methods and Materials: 3D datasets of low contrast objects and patients were acquired with a dynamic digital 40x30 cm FD angiography system (Axiom Artis dTA, Siemens) with rotation speeds of 60\u00b0/sec and 30 frames/sec image frequency. The detector matrix of the FD is 2480x1920 with 154 \u00b5m pixel size. The projection data were reconstructed with a CT cone beam algorithm by summing of 2 contiguous detector lines and columns (binning). A spatial resolution of 0.3 mm at the detector level and 0.2 mm at the object level was obtained with up to 1000 reconstructed slices from one 220\u00b0 rotation. Results: With detector entrance doses of 0.36 \u00b5Gy and 1.2 \u00b5Gy we obtained doses at the 16 cm CTDI phantom of approx. 13 mGy and 43 mGy which are below the diagnostic reference values for CT head examinations. At the 16 cm CATPHAN phantom objects with 10 mm diameter at 5 mm slice thickness with \u2264 5 HU are visible. Cerebral structures with liquor spaces and dilated bile ducts were visualized for the first time in head and abdominal examinations without contrast and with high image quality. Conclusion: The significant higher image quality of a dynamic FD in comparison to an image intensifier enables for the first time 3D acquisitions with excellent low contrast resolution in clinically acceptable acquisitions times without exceeding the CT dose reference values.",

Methods and Materials: 15 patients with suspected coronary artery disease underwent retrospectively ECG-gated CT-CA (Sensation 16, Siemens, Germany) and conventional coronary angiography (CAG) with retrospectively ECG-gated ICUS (Intelligate, CURAD, The Netherlands). A dedicated software (QCT, CURAD, The Netherlands) was used to extract the CT-CA dataset for the evaluation of the coronary arteries. The CT-CA dataset and ICUS dataset were loaded into a software platform for quantification purposes. Then, a target vessel region was identified for both CT-CA and ICUS. An operator performed all QCT quantification and another one all ICUS quantification. The parameters analysed were: target vessel length, lumen volume, vessel volume, plaque volume. The difference between the measurements were tested with a paired t-test and a p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Overall 15 coronary vessels were studied (12 left anterior descending, 2 left circumflex and 1 right coronary artery). The mean target vessel length was 24.7 \u00b1 12.9 and 25.7 \u00b1 14.4, the mean lumen volume was 242.7 \u00b1 121.5 and 255.6 \u00b1 157.3, the mean vessel volume was 428.7 \u00b1 212.7 and 476.1 \u00b1 292.8, the mean plaque volume was 189.4 \u00b1 94.6 and 220.5 \u00b1 149.9, for ICUS and QCT, respectively (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences when the repeated QCT measurements were compared. Conclusion: Quantitative parameters can be extracted from CT-CA dataset. The new software allows to obtain quantitative assessment of coronary artery parameters without significant differences with ICUS. Purpose: Beam hardening is regarded as one of the key factors causing artefact and impeding a properly post-operation evaluation using computed tomography (CT), especially when a metal implant presents. This research provides an algorithm to approximate beam hardening in the projection of CT to deal with the illposted problems, amend the projection, and obtain a clearer reconstruction.",

A group of curves are selected for beam hardening adjustment and the parameters are identified using neural networks under the supervised by consistency test, to obtain an optimal beam hardening approximation and computational efficiency. The projection is amended according to the beam hardening approximation prior to reconstruction. This method is demonstrated by an experimental scanning. Results: A repaired broken bone of a leg of pork is selected as the scanning object with a stainless steel plate and scews, with the parameters of 140.0 kV and 40 mA, using a GE CT scanner. In the original reconstruction, serious artefact was caused. Using the method in this research, the information lost in the original reconstruction was recovered and the reconstruction was significantly clearer. Conclusion: Beam hardening approximation is transferred into parameters identification, which is performed automatically using neural networks under the supervision of consistency test. The amended projection provides clearer reconstruction where the lost information caused by beam hardening is successfully recovered.

Purpose: Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new imaging modality providing micro-structural information of atherosclerotic plaques with a resolution of 10-20 \u00b5m. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), current reference standard in vivo, has limited resolution of 150-300 \u00b5m. Purpose of the present study was to compare OCT, histopathology and IVUS in differentiating atherosclerotic plaques and quantifying vascular dimensions in crural arteries ex vivo. Methods and Materials: 50 atherosclerotic segments were derived from 5 amputated lower limbs. Different plaque types (fibrous, lipid-rich, calcified) were assigned by 2 examiners and sensitivity, specificity as well as intra-and interobserver agreement were calculated. Quantitative measurements comprised luminal area (LA) and vessel wall area (VA). Results: 50/50 segments were available for comparison. Sensitivity and specificity for OCT criteria were 81% and 89% for fibrous plaques, 100% and 93% for lipid-rich plaques, and 80% to 89% for calcified plaques (overall agreement 83%).

Methods and Materials: Bilateral hindlimb ischemia was invoked by surgical excision of the femoral artery. On day 20, after quiescence of endogenous angiogenesis 5,000 IU of Thrombin or 10 \u00b5g of VEGF or 10 \u00b5g of bFGF was intramuscularly injected in the medial thigh of one ischemic hindlimb per rabbit (n = 4-5 in each group), while the contralateral limbs were injected with equal volumes of normal saline and served as the control groups. On day 40, functional CT (fCT) at the level of the saphenous artery below-the-knee and intraarterial DSA followed by computerized quantitative analysis of the depicted vasculature were performed. Results: fCT studies calculated significantly increased peak enhancement values and shorter time-to-peak periods in all groups of agents as compared to control hindlimbs. Quantitative DSA detected a significantly increased total area of large collaterals only in the Thrombin group (p < 0.05). Histopathology of the adductor muscle in the medial thigh documented a significantly increased arteriogenic outcome in the thrombin group (p < 0.05) and only a mild non-significant elevation of small tunica-covered vessels in the bFGF and VEGF groups. Conclusion: Thrombin augments arteriogenesis and ischemic tissue reperfusion and seems to outperform bFGF and VEGF in establishing new vessel conduits with a developed tunica media in the ischemic rabbit model. Results: MR imaging sharply demonstrated the superficial temporal arteries allowing for an evaluation of their lumen and vessel wall. 31 of the 64 patients were finally diagnosed as having giant cell arteritis. Scoring of the mural inflammation with MR resulted in a sensitivity of 80.6 % and a specificity of 97.0 % as compared to a sensitivity of 77.8 % and specificity of 100 % based on histology. The mean wall thickness increased significantly from 0.39 (+-0.18) mm to 0.74 (+-0.32) mm (p < 0.001) and the lumen diameter decreased significantly from 0.84 (+-0.29) mm to 0.65 (+-0.38) mm (p < 0.05) for the patients with giant cell arteritis. Conclusion: Contrast enhanced high resolution MR imaging is feasible for noninvasive assessment of mural inflammation in giant cell arteritis and assisting in the diagnosis of the disease, the selection of a biopsy site, and long-term monitoring of therapeutic intervention.

Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of water-excitation trueFISP in cartilage abnormalities of the knee. Methods and Materials: 29 patients (30 knees, 13 men and 17 women) with a mean age of 56 years (range 18-86 years) were prospectively evaluated with a preoperative MR examination including a sagittal 3D trueFISP sequence and a standardized evaluation of cartilage surfaces during surgery. The mean time interval between MR imaging and surgery was 1 day (range 0-9 days). During arthroscopy the medial and lateral femoral condyles and tibial plateaux, the femoral groove and the patella were separately evaluated using a modified Outerbridge score. The MR images were evaluated separately and blinded by two readers on two separate occasions, using the same score. Results: If the cutoff between normal and abnormal was set between grades 1 and 2, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 54%-64%, 76%-92% and 70%-73% respectively. For a cutoff between grades 2 and 3, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 53%-64%, 91%-95% and 80%-83% respectively.

To assess the reproducibility, 3 consecutive data sets of each volunteer were acquired for both sequences, the knee joints being repositioned. Cartilage was delineated by a segmentation routine.

Results: Patellar cartilage volume and thickness calculated from the trueFISP images were smaller than from the FLASH images (p > 0.05). Reproducibility of cartilage volume and thickness showed slightly lower values for the trueFISP sequence, the inter-individual variability was comparable. Conclusion: In healthy volunteers, patellar cartilage volume and thickness from 3D-trueFISP images were smaller than from the 3D-FLASH data. The lower values resulting from the trueFISP sequence might be attributable to high SNR/ CNR of synovial fluid that might lead to underestimation of cartilage.

A bilayer matrix consisting of collagen I/III (Chondro-Gide\u00ae, Geistlich Biomaterials, Switzerland) was dissected and fixed with fibrin glue. MR-imaging was conducted using a 1.5 T device (Siemens, Germany). Twenty-seven pulse sequences were varied with regard to their main properties (T1-and T2-weighted spin-echo or gradient echo), mode of volumetric data acquisition (2D, 3D), image matrix, slice thickness (1.3-2 mm) and the choice of fat saturation techniques. Signal intensities were measured in the subchondral layer, collagen matrix, adjacent cartilage and fluid. Contrast-ratios were computed. Results: Contrast-ratios of the matrix vs. adjacent fluid/subchondral layer were calculated with values 0.05-0.88 \u00b1 0.04 and 0.03-0.99 \u00b1 0.05 respectively. While highest contrast was achieved using PD-weighted TSE-sequences with low echotime, high image matrix and thin sections without fat saturation, T1-weighted IRsequences yielded an intermediate contrast-ratio with optimal depiction of the defect depth. Five sequences were unable to differentiate between subchondral layer and matrix. Conclusion: Appropriate MR imaging parameter selection is crucial for optimized visualization of the matrix and has the potential to provide information about matrix integrity and success of cartilage repair. Purpose: To assess the diagnostic effectiveness of multidetector spiral CT arthrography (MDSCTA) in detecting cartilage abnormalities in the gleno-humeral joint. Methods and Materials: MDSCTA images obtained in 22 consecutive patients (mean age 50 years, range 23-74 years, 12 female and 10 male) were evaluated for glenohumeral cartilage lesions. Two musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the arthroscopy report independently analysed the humeral head and glenoid cartilage (9 areas for each surface). The sensitivity and specificity of MDSCTA for grade 2 (substance loss < 50 % of cartilage thickness) or higher, and grade 3 or higher cartilage lesion (substance loss > 50 % of cartilage thickness), the Spearman correlation coefficient between MDSCTA and arthroscopic grading, and K statistics for assessing intra-and interobserver reproducibility were determined. Results: Sensitivities and specificities of MDSCTA ranged between 90 and 95 % for the detection of grade 2 or higher cartilage lesions and ranged between 80 and 98 % for the detection of grade 3 or higher lesions. There was moderate to substantial agreement between grading at arthroscopic examination and grading at MDSCTA (Spearman correlation coefficients from 0.532 to 0.651). Interobserver agreement was substantial for detecting grade 2 or higher, and almost perfect for detecting grade 3 or higher cartilage lesions (K of 0.618 and 0.876). Intraobserver agreement was almost perfect for detecting grade 2 or higher and grade 3 or higher lesions (K of 0.845 and 0.851). Conclusion: MDSCTA is an accurate tool for the study of the articular cartilage surface in the shoulder joint. , and 18 patients post local regional chemotherapy (TACE).

Purpose: To assess the value of triggering abdominal and torso CT scanning based on liver parenchyma enhancement in patients with potential hypodense liver lesions. Methods and Materials: 58 oncological patients underwent CT torso on 16-row and 64-row multidetector (MDCT) scanners. 21 patients were scanned with a fixed 60 second delay for the abdomen, while in 37 patients the abdominal scan was initiated when liver parenchyma enhancement reached 50 HU. In each patient attenuation values from liver, portal and hepatic veins were obtained from both the non-contrast and contrast-enhanced scans, as for 37 hypodense, presumed metastatic, liver lesions. Results: Mean delay for scanning in the triggered group was 56.9 seconds (range 43-70). Mean post contrast liver attenuation was 127.6 \u00b1 21.3 HU (range 93.2-155.3) in the triggered and 101.7 \u00b1 24 HU (range 63.6-132.8) in the non-triggered group.

The mean portal and hepatic vein enhancement was 31.5 HU and 30 HU greater in the triggered group (p = 0.0026 and p = 0.017, respectively). The mean value of hypodense lesions enhancement was 8.7 HU greater in the triggered group (p = 0.3; not significant) with a higher conspicuity (normal liver/lesion HU) in the triggered group (mean ratio 3.8) than in the non-triggered group (mean ratio 2.8), with a significant difference (p = 0.0346). Conclusion: Liver triggering is a simple technique which produces consistent and optimal liver parenchymal and vascular enhancement in oncological patients independent of their cardiovascular status while increasing the conspicuity of hypodense liver metastases.

Methods and Materials: 15 patients with a total of 24 hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma underwent 16-row MDCT before and after 150 ml IV contrast agent administration in the arterial, venous, and 5 minutes delayed phase. Following surgery within 5 days the metastases in surgical specimens were digitally photographed and measured on magnified images. Results: The mean metastasis size was 3.4 cm as measured on the specimens. Four lesions were not identified on CT. Mean size of metastases was 3.2 cm in the unenhanced, arterial, and venous phase and 3.3 cm in the delayed phase. Mean difference in size measurement between CT phase and specimen was 28%, 20%, 17%, and 22% for the unenhanced, arterial, venous, and delayed phase, respectively. Conclusion: Neither unenhanced nor contrast-enhanced CT are very accurate to measure the size of liver metastases in comparison to the surgical specimen. CT measurement obtained in the venous phase were most accurate. Due to the high variability in size measurements between different CT phases progression or regression of metastatic disease should only be judged by comparing metastatic lesions in the same CT phase and using the same windowing. Purpose: To evaluate diagnostic impact of different section thicknesses using 64-slice CT to detect hepatic colorectal metastases. Methods and Materials: 43 patients with known colorectal metastases were examined with a 64-slice scanner (Sensation 64, Siemens). CT parameters were: collimation 0.6 x 64 mm, mAs, 250, and kVp, 120. All patients received non-ionic contrast medium (400 mgI/mL; Iomeron 400, Bracco) at a rate of 5 mL/sec. A triple-phase protocol was acquired with hepatic arterial (delay time determined with bolus tracking technique), portal-venous (60 sec), and delayed (180 sec) phases. CT datasets were reconstructed with four different section thicknesses-0.6, 1, 3, and 5 mm. Each dataset was interpreted separately by three observers in four reading sessions. Sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (A (z)) were calculated. Results: Mean sensitivity and PPV were 79% and 77% on 0.6-mm images, 78% and 77% on 1-mm images, 74% and 78% on 3-mm images, and 72% and 80% on 5-mm images, respectively. No significant difference in sensitivity and PPV among images was detected. Mean A (z) values were 0.79, 0.78, 0.77, and 0.75 for 0.6, 1, 3, and 5 mm images, respectively (no significant difference). With regard to small (\u2264 1 cm) metastases, mean sensitivities of 0.6 (72%), 1 (71%), and 3 mm (71%) images were statistically significantly superior to that of 5 mm (62%) images (p < 0.05). Conclusion: When using 64-slice CT, a section thickness \u2264 3 mm should be chosen to maximize detection of small (\u2264 1 cm) hepatic colorectal metastases.",

Images were analysed quantitatively (lesion-liver contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR], liver-spleen CNR and liver signal-to-noise ratio [SNR]) and qualitatively (detectability of hepatic structures and lesions, presence of artefacts). Results: Highest liver SNR was found using T1-GRE sequences. Best liver-spleen CNR was obtained with T2-TSE-FS and with both HASTE-sequences, best lesion-liver CNR with T2-TSE-FS. There was no significant difference between BHSE and NSE in lesion-liver CNR. Comparing T2 weighted BHSE with the corresponding NSE, BHSE showed a better liver-spleen CNR and liver SNR. However, in the qualitative analysis T2-TSE PACE displayed better lesion clarity especially for small liver lesions, probably due to a higher acquisition matrix. Qualitative comparison of all sequences showed an advantage of HASTE, followed by the T1-GRE sequences. Conclusion: Although no significant quantitative difference in lesion-liver CNR was found, qualitatively the HASTE, the T1-GRE and the T2-PACE sequences showed the best results. Particularly in detection of lesions smaller than 1 cm, T2-PACE can be advantageous. Thus, for clinical practice, BHSE should be preferred due to reduced acquisition time and inferior artefact susceptibility. NSE may be helpful examinating respiratory insufficient patients who cannot sustain sufficiently breathing. Purpose: To describe the utility of diffusion weighted MR imaging in patients undergoing loco-regional treatment of liver tumours. Methods and Materials: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) was performed before and after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) (n = 22) or radio-frequency ablation (RFA) (n = 18) for hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 28) and metastatic lesions of liver (n = 12). DWI was performed with single shot echo planar sequence and unidirectional gradient sequences with two b values (200, 500) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps generated. The lesion to liver signal intensity ratio and ADC values were calculated. Routine T2-W and T1-W sequences were also obtained. One month follow-up DWI were also performed for 6 lesions. Results: All hepatic tumours were hyperintense to liver on DWI before TACE and RFA (lesion: liver = 2.2 \u00b1 0.43). Post TACE and RFA, the lesions demonstrated a general decrease in signal intensity (1.5 \u00b1 0.32) on DWI. RFA lesions were either hypointense with a variable hyperintense rim or mixed-intensity. The post-TACE and RFA lesions demonstrated higher mean ADC values (190 \u00b1 30; 155 \u00b1 25) as compared to the tumours prior to treatment (160 \u00b1 20; 120 \u00b1 22) (p < 0.02). The ADC values increased after 1-month follow-up suggestive of further necrotic changes. In three patients recurrence was noted which appeared hyperintense to the treated lesion with low ADC. Conclusion: There is a trend for ADC of the liver lesions to increase following loco-regional treatment signifying necrotic changes. DWI with ADC maps may be useful for monitoring response to treatment and detect recurrence.

            "text": "A respiration device operated moving heart phantom was used on a 64-detector MDCT and a 100 ms EBT unit. The heart rate (HR) was varied between 50 and 100 bpm. End diastole and end systole ventricular volume of the heart phantom were determined by two independent readers using CardIQ (GE) with data of both modalities, from which ejection fraction was derived as EF=(EDV-ESV)/EDV. Stroke volume (SV=EDV-ESV) of the heart was determined with a gas-flow analyzer and EDV was calibrated by filling the phantom with water. Results: An EDV = 258 \u00b1 1 ml was obtained from the water calibration. From the gas-flow analysis, a decrease of SV=76 ml at 50 bpm to 60 ml at 100 bpm was obtained, corresponding to a decrease of EF from 30%-23% (\u2206=7%). From the MDCT-data a decrease in EF was obtained from 20%-15% (\u2206=5%) at 50 and 100 bpm, respectively. From the EBT-data a decrease in EF was obtained from 23%-17% (\u2206=6%) at 50 and 100 bpm, respectively. The average underestimation of EF using CardIQ with MDCT-data yields 39 \u00b1 9% and with EBT-data 27 \u00b1 5%. Conclusion: EBT is more sensitive than MDCT for decrease in EF with increase of HR. Determination of ventricular volume in the heart phantom, as derived from MDCT and EBT, shows a significant underestimation at HR between 50 and 100 bpm, for EF between 23-30%. EBT more accurately determines the absolute ventricular volume as compared to MDCT. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess left ventricular (LV) volumetric and functional parameters by using 64-slice Computed Tomography (CT) compared with cardiac-Magnetic Resonance (MR). Methods and Materials: Thirty-four patients (30 male; mean age 59.6 \u00b1 10.4 years) with a previous acute coronary syndrome and scheduled for left ventricular function assessment with MR were retrospectively enrolled to perform within 48h a 64-slice CT (Sensation 64, Siemens, Germany) by using the standard protocol for coronary angiography. Only patients in sinus rhythm, spontaneous HR < 75 bpm, and able to breath-hold for 15 sec, were included. Patients with contra-indications to intravenous iodinated contrast material were excluded. A dedicate semi-automated software (Argus, Siemens, Germany) was used to assess end-diastolic, end-systolic LV volumes (LVEDV, LVESV) LV stroke volume, and ejection fraction (LVSV, LVEF) by using LV short axis images. The results were compared with those of cardiac MR using a standard protocol. Purpose: To quantify and compare global left ventricular (LV) perfusion and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with chronic heart failure and healthy control group by measuring coronary sinus flow with velocity-encoded cine (VEC) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Methods and Materials: MR measurements were performed in 20 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure due to coronary artery disease and in the control group (n = 11). Global LV perfusion was quantified by measuring coronary sinus flow in an oblique imaging plane perpendicular to the coronary sinus with non-breath hold VEC MR imaging. LV mass was measured by means of cine imaging that encompassed the heart. CFR was measured at rest and after infusion of dipyridamole. Results: At rest, LV perfusion was not significantly different in patients with chronic heart failure and control group (0.85 \u00b1 0.3 ml/min/gr vs 0.83 \u00b1 0.26 ml/min/gr, p < 0.001). After administration of dipyridamole, LV perfusion and CFR were significantly decreased in patients with chronic heart failure compared with that of the control group (LV perfusion 1.19 \u00b1 0.4 vs 2.39 \u00b1 0.69; p < 0.001, and CFR 1.45 \u00b1 0.32 vs 3.00 \u00b1 0.99; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Combined cine and VEC MR imaging revealed that patients with chronic heart failure have normal LV perfusion at rest but severely depressed LV perfusion after vasodilatation. Impaired CFR may contribute to progressive decline in LV function in patients with chronic heart failure. ",

The end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed and compared to MR measurements based on continuous short axis images. Results: Mean heart rate was 56 \u00b1 5 bpm during the MDCT and 73 \u00b1 9 bpm during the MR imaging examination (p < 0.05 . LAV strongly correlated with oxygen consumption (VO2 peak p = 0.024, r= -0.47, VO2 AT p = 0.045, r= -0.42, VO2%N relative to age and sex p = 0.008, r= -0.54) and pathologic hyperventilation parameter VE-VCO 2 slope (p = 0.038, v=0.43). No other of LV function parameters correlated with CPET results. Conclusion: MDCT of the heart together with CPET allow early diagnosis and risk stratification in patients with type A and B (AHA)heart failure. Volume of left atrium strongly correlates with parameters of diastolic and systolic left heart function. Patients with LAV > 120 ml are especially endangered by heart failure. LA volume is an accurate and precise morphological parameter of physiological pathologies in patients with low exercise tolerance. LA volume can be considered as an independent non-invasive imaging marker of heart failure in patients with atypical chest pain and low exercise tolerance. Purpose: Conduction delay in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) may result in reduced LV performance due to an asynchronous contraction pattern. In these patients cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) by biventricular pacing can be beneficial. Several approaches by echocardiography and MR imaging are used to identify these patients. In the present study we evaluated the ability of Cine-MR imaging to assess mechanical inter-and intraventricular asynchrony. Methods and Materials: 28 patients with reduced LV function (16 patients with, and 12 patients without LBBB \u2265 120 ms) were imaged at 1.5 Tesla. A sharedphases trueFISP sequence using parallel imaging enabling a reconstructed temporal resolution of 6.3 ms was used. Electromechanical delay (EMD) was defined as the interval between R-wave and the peak of systolic shortening. EMD was assessed for the septal and lateral LV-and lateral RV-wall. Inter-and intraventricular delay was calculated as the difference in EMD between these regions. Patterns of contraction in patients with and without LBBB were compared. Interand intraventricular delay was correlated with QRS width. Results: In patients with LBBB, inter-and intraventricular delay (130.6 \u00b1 17.3 ms and 322 \u00b1 66.4 ms, resp) was longer than in patients without LBBB (18.8 \u00b1 12.4 ms (p < 0.0001) and 51.1 \u00b1 84.3 ms (p < 0.0001), resp). Correlation of inter-and intraventricular delay with QRS width was only moderate (r = 0.47; p < 0.0001 and r = 0.67; p < 0.0001, resp). Conclusion: Cine-MR imaging identifies mechanical inter-and intraventricular asynchrony in patients with LBBB and may be a valuable tool for the identification of patients eligible for CRT. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of head and neck tumor perfusion CT measurements using a two-compartment distributed-parameter (DP) physiologic model. Methods and Materials: 26 patients with extracranial head and neck neoplasms and metastatic nodes underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans obtained from a 16-detector row multislice CT scanner. After normalization of the area under the arterial curve to the concentration curve at a vein voxel, perfusion parametric maps that corresponded to blood flow (F), fractional intravascular (V1) and extracellular extravascular blood volume (V2), transit time in vascular compartment (T), first pass extraction ratio (E) and permeability-surface area product (PS) were generated. A time delay or time lag parameter (Tlag) was introduced so as to denote the time difference between the initial rise of the arterial and tissue density curves. Results: After optimization of resolution and speed, low-inherent noise parametric maps provided adequate anatomical and functional information of the slice that was scanned in vivo. The average values of F, V1, V2, E, and PS were significantly higher in primary tumors and metastatic nodes than in adjacent normal muscle structures. The mean values of T and Tlag were significantly reduced in the neoplasms than in normal tissue. The V1 and V2 maps showed wide interand intratumoral variability. F, V1, Tlag, E, and PS maps provided the best tumor delineation. Conclusion: Perfusion CT parameters obtained from a DP physiologic tracer kinetic model can be used to differentiate extracranial head and neck neoplasms and metastatic lymph nodes from adjacent normal tissue.",

Therefore, cervical metastases of an unknown primary may be assessed with either of these imaging modalities. However, detection rates of CT were substantially lower. Thus, inclusion of functional data for assessment of cervical CUP patients must be recommended. PET/CT. PET/CT was evaluated by a nuclear medicine physician and a radiologist in consensus, PET+CT was evaluated by a different team and the CT was evaluated by two radiologists. The readers were aware of the clinical background. Histopathological results served as the standard of reference for all lesions found in all patients. The accuracy of TNM staging was assessed and compared with the reference standard. Differences between the staging procedures were tested for statistical significance by McNemar's test. Results: Overall TNM-staging proved more accurate (p < 0.05) with combined PET/CT compared to PET+CT and CT alone. This result was based on a more accurate assessment of the T-stage with PET/CT (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was detected for N-and M-staging. Tumors were overstaged with combined PET/CT in 1, with PET+CT in 6, and with CT alone in 4 cases, whereas PET/CT understaged 8, PET+CT 10, and CT alone 15 tumors. Conclusion: Combined PET/CT proved to be significantly more accurate in assessing the overall TNM-stage than the compared modalities. These results are based on a higher accuracy concerning the T-stage. Since these findings are initial results, larger patient cohorts are needed to define role of PET/CT in this patient population.",

Patients were divided into 5 groups according to underlying disease. Questionnaires regarding the Oswestry disability score (ODS) and a visual pain scale (VPS) were evaluated 6 months after treatment. Results: At 6 months follow-up, improvement in ODS was statistically significant, in particular in patients with disc protrusion (mean value before and after treatment 46% and 31% respectively, Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test p < 0.0001). Improvement in VPS was also statistically significant (mean value before and after treatment 8.5 and 5.4 respectively, Wilcoxon Test p < 0.0001). Patients with only one affected segment showed a significantly better outcome compared to patients with multilevel disease, and patients under 50 years had more benefit from treatment. Conclusion: Disc nucleolysis by ozone injection is an effective, minimally invasive treatment in patients with chronic low back pain who fail to respond to noninvasive means, especially if they have single level disease, disc protrusion, and are under 50 years of age. . There was one minor complication consisting of L5 root irritation after RFA plus vertebroplasty of a sarcoma metastasis, which subsided without treatment after 8 weeks. There was one major complication involving intraspinal cement leakage during tumour vertebroplasty, causing T5 root compression and requiring laminectomy for cement removal. The overall rate of major complications requiring treatment was 0.99%. Conclusion: Vertebro-and kyphoplasty can be safely performed under MSCTfluoroscopy guidance alone. The rate of major complications is very low. We saw a high rate of small asymptomatic cement leakages which would likely be overlooked on conventional fluoroscopy (CF). This raises the question of whether CF is indeed the standard of guidance. Further studies comparing CF and MSCTfluoroscopy are therefore required. There was no statistically significant advantage for kyphoplasty concerning cement leakage and technical success, leaving the increased costs without an obvious benefit. Purpose: To assess the efficacy, accuracy and safety of foraminal and direct intracanalar epidural steroid injections under CT guidance for sciaticas and cruralgias. The long term analysis of the clinical results is reported and discussed. Methods and Materials: Five-hundred patients were treated for sciatica and/or cruralgia due to a disk herniation, without sensory-motor deficit, resisting conventional medical treatment of 3-4 weeks duration, between January 2000 and November 2004. The patient is in the prone position; the incriminated level (disk herniation) is first controlled with a lateral scout-view (CT). After local anesthesia, the extremity of a thin needle (22G) is positioned under CT guidance as follows: in the proximal part of the foramen in the case of lateral herniations (cruralgias,1/4 of the patients series) and directly in the lumbar canal, through the ligamentum flavum, in a strict epidural location, near the root. A contrast CT control verifies the epidural diffusion space (even with a foraminal approach) before the corticoid infiltration (Cortivazol 7.5 mg).",

Purpose: To evaluate the therapeutic benefit and morphologic changes after CTguided intradiscal and intraforaminal ozone-oxygen injection combined with an intraforaminal drug application. Methods and Materials: 69 patients with lumbar radiculopathy were treated with a combined intradiscal and intraforaminal injection of ozone-ozygen, Betamethasone-21-dihydrogenphosphate, Betamethasone-21-acetate and Bupivacainehydrochloride under CT-guidance. During a period of 3 months the effects of the therapy on lumbar radiculopathy were evaluated. Volumetric examination (MR imaging-volumetry) of disc herniation was accomplished, changes on lumbar radiculopathy were examined with a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale. Results: At 7 days after injection 15 patients (21.7%) showed a complete relief of pain, in 12 patients (17.4%) we had a reduction of pain of 1 point, in 10 patients (14.5%) a reduction of 2 points, in 8 patients (11.6%) a reduction of 3 points and in 20 patients (29%) a reduction of \u2265 4 points. In 4 patients (5.8%) no significant change in lumbar radiculopathy was demonstrated. Three months after intervention the follow-up revealed in 17 patients (24.6%) a complete relief of pain, a strong relief (reduction of > 4 points) in 23 patients (33.3%), in 22 patients (31.9%) a mild relief (reduction of 1-3 points) and in 7 patients (10.1%) no relief of pain was demonstrated. Volumetric examination showed a reduction of disc herniation, an average of 13.4% after three months. Conclusion: CT-guided combined intradiscal and intraforaminal injection of ozoneozygen represents a therapeutic alternative for lumbar radiculopathy with promising results. Its ease of execution permits the successful outpatient treatment of lumbar sciatic pain.",

Websites were evaluated by 20 criteria, which are divided into 4 groups describing the main formal qualities of website: Presentation, navigation, functions and credibility. Results: Overall average score was 59.8 points from 100 available (min. 38.0, max. 76.5). Regarding the groups of criteria, presentation contributed to the average score with 20%, navigation 21%, function 23% and credibility 36%. Average results for particular types of resources were: portals 65.4, databases of cases 63.8, online books 59.5 and one-man-sites 47.7 points. Conclusion: Hypothesis of the presence of measurable quality differences among tested websites was confirmed. Surprisingly the average credibility of websites was relatively high (making up more than one third of the average score). Difficulty in creating websites and keeping them up-to-date is evident -the best score was achieved by websites which are provided by professional teams, as opposed to one-man-sites and websites provided by small groups.

The mobile operations will enable delivery of tests to regions of greatest need but require high bandwidth networks and sophisticated software applications to distribute large data volumes, interpret results and integrate with existing hospital systems. To accomplish this, a comprehensive, digital, web-based patient information system has been installed to manage patient care. The technology allows on-line scheduling, exam requisition, patient tracking and off site sub-specialist opinion in realtime. We describe the predominate factors that affected the implementation, acceptance, technical parameters to attain optimal system functionality and present results from a formal evaluation on user satisfaction. Purpose: Assessment of skeletal development is frequently performed in paediatric radiology. The most commonly applied clinical method is the atlas matching method which compares a hand radiograph with a film-based hand atlas. A computer assisted bone age assessment method has been developed. It matches automatically a patient image with the digital hand atlas. Methods and Materials: Four components are integrated in order to obtain a computer aided diagnosis system. First, a set of standard images has been selected from 500 clinical cases. A comparison of each image with hand patterns, included in an atlas of radiologically approved standard, has pointed the closest match in each age group. Then, the application software extracts radiological features describing the size, shape, and density of epiphyses and metaphyses, as well as parameters describing the stage of epiphyseal fusion. Next, standard images in diagnostic and compressed resolution along with their extracted features are organized into a hand e-atlas. At the radiological image analysis stage features are extracted and compared with the e-atlas to find the closest match. Finally, a graphical user interface has been designed.

Conclusion: The CAD system offers a fast and objective tool able to assist radiologists in performing the bone age assessment. In case of failure, a manual eatlas-based assessment is available. Purpose: Determination of skeletal development in children is important. The most used evaluation method is to study left hand X-ray based on the standards depicted by Greulich & Pyle (G&P). The aim of our study was to compare the accuracy of a new sonographically based method with the standard method. Methods and Materials: 160 consecutively evaluated children and adolescents (77m, 83f) who received a X-ray of the left hand were evaluated. Ultrasound examination of the same hand was performed on the same day using the Bon-Age\u2122 system (Sunlight Medical Ltd., Israel). This system evaluates the relationship between the velocity of the wave and growth using gender and ethnicity based algorithms. Three investigators (U1-U3) analysed the X-ray and assigned bone age based on the G&P atlas. Results: In 152 patients BonAge\u2122 measurement was successfully. The correlation between the three investigators using the G&P method was between 0.977 and 0.980; correlation between BonAge\u2122 and the investigators (U1-3) was 0.902 and 0.920. The paired t-test showed no significant differences between BonAge\u2122 and the investigators and also for the comparison between U1 and U2.

Lesions were benign, proven by histopathology. Thickness of cartilage was measured perpendicular to cap surface. MR imaging was correlated to histopathological measurements. Statistical analysis was done using 97.5% confidence intervals for mean of differences between MR imaging and histopathology. Results: Histologically determined cap thicknesses ranged from 2 -4 mm (mean 3 mm). BalFFE measurements (n = 9) could be compared to histology with mean of differences 0.9 mm (CI -0.7 mm through 2.5 mm). Mean of differences between first echo of 3D-GE and histology (n = 14) was -0.11 mm (CI -1.1 mm through 0.9 mm), between second echo and histology (n = 14) it was -0.3 mm (CI -1.2 mm through 0.7 mm). All confidence intervals included zero (0 mm) indicating an excellent correlation to histology. , were enrolled in the study. The MR imaging protocol consisted of: sagittal T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (2019/90) scans, sagittal and coronal, plain and contrast-enhanced, fat-suppressed, T1-weighted spinecho (425/15) scans and gradient-echo (65/14/20\u00b0) scans with incremental mouth opening. A grading score was used for the evaluation of the condyle (1=normal, 2=bifidity, 3=absence of the anterior half of the condyle), articular eminence (AE) (1=normal, 2=shallow), articular disc (AD) (1 = \"bow-tie\" shape, 2 = abnormal), acute pannus (1=normal, 2= pannus), intraarticular fluid (1=normal, 2=fluid) and the range of condylar motion (RCM) (1=90\u00ba, 2=75\u00ba, 3=45\u00ba, 4=0\u00b0). Results: 70 joints were examined. Higher grades were more frequent in systemic arthritis (condyle3=55%, AE2=60%, AD2=65%, RCM4=5%) than in oligoarthritis (condyle3=17.9%, AE2=0%, AD2=0%, RCM4=0%) and polyarthritis (condyle3=27.3%, AE2=13.6%, AD2=18.2% RCM4=0%) (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between systemic arthritis, oligoarthritis and polyarthritis in the frequency of pannus (25%, 52.4%, 45.5% respectively) and intraarticular fluid (14.3%, 10.7%, 13.6% respectively). Patients with abnormal condyles had longer disease duration (11.8 \u00b1 5.1 years) than patients with normal condyles (5.5 \u00b1 6.12 years) (p < 0.001).

Results: None of the baseline X-ray images showed pathological changes. MR imaging revealed typical ON bone marrow lesions in 3/5 children. Additional to the sites with bone pain, MR imaging revealed other ON locations. All of the lesions had bone edema and contrast enhancement.

The present study investigates the development of these MR imaging signal characteristics in fetal adipose tissues. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] ] were imaged on a 1.5 T magnet using T2-, T1-weighted and steady-state free-precession (SSFSE) sequences. Signal intensities of adipose tissues on different sequences were assessed with respect to topographical regions. Results: T1-weighted hyperintensity of fetal adipose tissues was not evident until the beginning of the 23 rd GW when the buccal fat pad was the first to display it. By 25 GW moderate hyperintensity appeared in the ischio-rectal fossa and face, the retropatellar fat pad and the deep extensions of buccal fat pad could be recognized. By 27 GW subcutaneous tissues showed hyperintense signals, followed by popliteal (28 GW), intraorbital (30 GW) and perirenal fat (32 GW). SSFSE sequences showed marked hypointensity of buccal fat between 25-32 GW. From GW 32 onwards, chemical shift artefacts delineated subcutaneous fat from dermis and underlying structures. Conclusion: Fetal adipose tissues gain their T1-weighted hyperintense signal properties in a regular temporary sequence depending on their composition and topography. Though abundant, perirenal fat displays no T1-weighted hyperintensity until 32 GW, since it is made of brown adipose fat in the fetus which has different signal properties. These findings may have a bearing on the prenatal MR imaging detection of (intracranial) lipomas, and assessment of fetal macrosomia or intrauterine growth restriction. SSFSE sequences may be an alternative in detecting lipoma. Purpose: To study the tonotopic organization of plasticity effects in the auditory cortex (AC) of unilateral tinnitus patients when stimulated with their experienced tinnitus frequency or another frequency by means of fMRI. Methods and Materials: Fifteen Patients were scanned on a 3 T MR imaging scanner. A T2*w EPI silent gap sequence (TR = 5s) was used during the stimulation paradigm. The stimulation paradigm consisted of a blocked design of 18 epochs in which white noise filtered through a narrow (freq \u00b1 500 Hz) or wide bandpass (freq \u00b1 1000 Hz) and tones were presented 3 times binaurally each. The stimuli were either the tinnitus frequency experienced by the patients e.g. 8000 Hz (TF-session) or a different frequency e.g. 1000 Hz (OF-session). Data were analyzed using SPM99 software and activation patterns were visualized. Quantitative analysis consisted of calculating an activation ratio of activated voxels in the AC and assessing differences between the left and the right side with a paired samples t-test. Results: Significant fMR signal change was found bilaterally in the AC in both sessions. Signal change was symmetrical in patients when exposed to the OFsession. When exposed to the TF-session, a decrease of signal change (plasticity effect) was visualized in the contralateral AC. Comparing the activation ratio in the left and right AC showed a significant difference during the TF-session, but not during the OF-session. Conclusion: By means of 3 T fMRI we were able to demonstrate tonotopic plasticity effects in unilaterally affected continuous tinnitus patients. Acknowledge Purpose: During a face matching task healthy subjects selectively activate cortical areas along the ventral visual stream, whereas patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) show activation along the ventral and the dorsal visual stream. We studied the morphological substrate of this differential activation of visual areas during face matching.",

Methods and Materials: Data were obtained from 9 healthy subjects. Functional images were acquired with a 1.5 Tesla machine. The stimulation protocol lasted 5 min and consisted of 60 sec rest, 30 sec stimulation, 90 sec rest, 30 sec stimulation, and 90 sec rest. Gustatory stimulation was applied by placing a small cotton pad soaked in a 1M NaCl solution (the salty stimulus), distilled water (the neutral stimulus) or 10% sucrose (the sweet stimulus) on the side of either hemitongue. Data was analyzed with BrainVoyager and SPM2 software. Results: Salty stimulation of the left hemitongue evoked bilateral activation of area GI in all subjects, more pronounced in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Salty stimulation of the right hemitongue also evoked bilateral activation of area GI in all subjects, but without appreciable side differences. Sucrose stimulation evoked cortical activation in both hemispheres in areas similar to those activated by the salty stimulus. Neutral stimulation activated more posterior and more dorsal cortical regions likely corresponding to the tactile cortical representation of the tongue in the first somatic sensory area. Conclusion: These findings show that the organization of taste afferents in man differs from the organization described in non-human primates, and are in agreement with previous neuropsychological studies performed in control subjects and callosotomized patients.",

Methods and Materials: fMRI was performed in 22 female volunteers measured twice (mid-luteal and menstrual phase). Subjects viewed erotic film excerpts alternating with emotionally neutral excerpts in a standard block-design. Arousal to erotic stimuli were evaluated using standard rating scales after scanning. Results: Two-sample t-Test with uncorrected p < 0.001 values for a priori determined ROIs involved in processing of erotic stimuli revealed differences between both scanning times: Comparing women in mid-luteal phase and during their menses, superior activation was revealed for women in mid-luteal phase in the anterior cingulate, left insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. However, only the superior activation in the orbitofrontal cortex and left insula was maintained using the sexual arousal as a covariate.

MADRS, YMRS, MDQ, and CGI ratings were compared with functional MR imaging results. The control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers. The Stroop test was implemented as the fMRI stimulus. Final and initial fMRI brain activations were 'subtracted' and used for group analysis. Two sample T-test analysis as well as ANOVA analysis were used to compare means and variations of activations. Results: Patients improved significantly in nearly all clinical ratings. The common fMRI findings in the patient group were improvement in dorsolateral prefrontal (T=5.5, p-value < 0.001) and dorsal cingulate gyrus (T=6.4, p-value< 0.001) activations. Signal increased both at cluster-level and voxel-level analyses, however remission and positive cognitive response were also correlated with some reductions in global activation (subcortical, temporal and rear frontal areas). There was statistically significant correlation between the values of activation in regions of interest and clinical rating tests (p-value < 0.001).

The assessment of image quality continues to be of paramount importance as part of the routine testing of equipment performance and images produced with test objects are commonly used for this purpose.

Older pre-1950's mammographic films by virtue of several factors result in higher film fog, lower toe contrast and higher film granularity. These include halide composition, grain morphology and distribution of grain diameter and volume. Modern mammographic films do not have the same response to film aging as older films systems. Purpose: To determine the optimal exposure factors for different types of CR and DR digital mammography system. Methods and Materials: Mean glandular dose (MGD) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured using PMMA phantoms simulating breasts 20-90 mm thick, with a 0.2 mm thick square of aluminium for contrast. For each thickness, a range of mAs, kV and target/filter combinations were used, for various DR and CR systems. The optimal exposure factors for each thickness were determined as those giving a target CNR for minimum MGD. Results: Aiming for a target CNR resulted in the selection of different exposure factors from those which give constant detector dose. The use of higher energy spectra generally resulted in the lowest patient dose, but with a higher detector dose to compensate for lower contrast. For smaller breast thicknesses (21 or 32 mm), the optimal beam quality was usually 25 or 28 kV and Mo/Mo target/filter combination. For thicker breasts a target/filter combination such as Rh/Rh or W/ Rh were usually optimal, leading to a dose saving of about 30% compared to 28 kV Mo/Mo. Systems with a relatively large amount of structure noise were optimal using lower energy spectra. Conclusion: A simple method of optimizing digital mammography systems is described, and results indicate that current systems aiming for a fixed detector dose are not optimal. Maintaining a target level of CNR usually results in the selection of higher energy spectra (Rh/Rh or W/Rh) for breast thicknesses above 45 mm.",

One of the inherent benefits of this approach is the ability to optimise image acquisition and image display independently. CR/DR and FS have inherently different imaging characteristics and therefore images should not be acquired using the same exposure factors. Insufficient attention however, has been directed in the scientific literature, at optimisation studies in diagnostic radiography using CR and DR systems. Methods and Materials: Phantoms to simulate various body parts were constructed. CDRAD contrast detail and Huttner resolution phantoms were placed in the middle of a patient phantom to simulate realistic clinical conditions. Starting points for each X-ray examination series were the kVp/mAs, filtration and SID values which had previously been used with the FS technique. Entrance doses to the phantoms were also measured. For each X-ray examination type, an image quality factor (IQF) was obtained. Each image series consisted of; the original FS image, and subsequent images acquired using CR/DR technology with exposure parameters/filtration/SID settings changed. Image optimization was achieved by determining the IQF as a function of entrance dose. Results: Dose reduction factors of between 1.3 and 4 have been found between the FS and CR/DR technology over a range of X-ray examination types. Conclusion: It is clear from our findings that, with CR/DR technology, there is potential for significant reduction in patient entrance dose with no negative impact on image quality.",

The load is however significantly reduced by applying smaller filters in sequence and exploiting similarities of the filters, i.e. using filter networks. Original and restored images acquired at 80 mAs and 160 mAs as well as original images with 320 mAs, were shown to 4 radiologists who assessed the subjective degree of noise and overall image quality. Results: A significant improvement of the noise score by the restoration was seen at 80 mAs (the mean score increased from 2.5 to 3.3) but not at 160 mAs (from 3.6 to 3.8).

Both dose quantities, entrance surface dose (ESD) and dose area product (DAP) were used. Results: The method established by the National Radiation Protection Board (UK) for setting DRLs was found to produce extra uncertainty in the procedure and was not easy to apply to Finnish practise. Patient doses correlated exponentially (R 2 = 0.86 -0.99) with both the projection thickness, which is measured directly from the patient, and the estimated cylindrical diameter (ECD) of the patient. Conclusion: For the specification of the size of patient, a projection thickness is more practical than the calculated ECD. Reference levels for paediatric radiological examinations could be given as a function of patient projection thickness, presented as a linear curve on half logarithmic scale. Purpose: To prospectively assess diagnostic accuracy of non contrast renal magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using a navigator gated free breathing 3D SSFP sequence, compared to contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA. Methods and Materials: Thirty hypertensive patients (mean age 57 years) with suspected renal artery stenosis underwent navigator-gated 3D SSFP MRA during free breathing (acquired voxel 0.9x1.2x2.0 mm) at 1.5 T, followed by a high resolution (acquired voxel 1.1x1.3x2.5 mm), breath-hold CE-MRA (0.15 mmol/ kg Gd-BOPTA) using parallel imaging technique. Renal artery stenosis was graded on a 5 point scale. Maximal visible vessel length was measured for both techniques. Consensus reading of CE-MRA and DSA (n = 8) were used as standard of reference. Two blinded, independent observers evaluated non-contrast SSFP versus CE-MRA. Results: Eleven stenoses of renal arteries > 50% were diagnosed. Sensitivity of non-contrast SSFP MRA for detection of significant renal artery stenosis (> 50%) was 100% for both observers (CI 0.82-1.15 and 0.82-1.18). Specificity was 90% (CI 0.85-0.95) for reader 1 and 95 % (CI 0.91-1.0) for reader 2, and accuracy was 92% (CI 0.88-0.97) and 96% (CI 0.92-1.01), respectively. Maximal visible renal artery length was significantly greater in CE-MRA (66.7 \u00b1 24.5 mm) compared to SSFP MRA (51.6 \u00b1 21.9 mm) (p < 0.001).",

The check points of CE-MRA were compared with DSA and surgery. Statistical analysis of CE-MRA based on either DSA or surgery was performed. Results: Based on surgery, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CE-MRA to depict \"early branching of renal artery\" were 50%, 98% and 95% (p < 0.05, k=0.54). The score for \"accessory renal artery\" was 80%, 96% and 95% (p < 0.001, k=0.70), respectively. The depiction of \"accessory renal vein\" using CE-MRA was statistically insignificant. Based on DSA, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CE-MRA to depict \"early branching of renal artery\" were 79%, 100% and 98% (p < 0.001, k=0.87). The depiction of \"accessory renal artery\" showed 97%, 100% and 99% (p < 0.001, k=0.98), respectively. The depiction of \"accessory renal vein\" was also statistically significant (100%, 99% and 99%, p < 0.05, k=0.49). In evaluation of renal arterial stenosis, Spearman' rho (r s ) between CE-MRA and DSA was 0.95 (p < 0.001). Purpose: Purpose of this study was the evaluation of a high-resolution MRA of the kidneys at 3.0 T in healthy volunteers and patients with suspected renal artery stenosis (RAS). Methods and Materials: 20 healthy volunteers and 12 consecutive patients suspected of having RAS (mean age 47.3 years) were scanned with a 3D-GRE Flashsequence (TR/TE 2.9/1.2 ms, flip 23\u00b0, matrix 576, voxel size 0.6x0.9x1.2 mm\u00b3, GRAPPA 2, acquisition time 22 sec). Using a phased-array surface coil on a 3.0 T whole body scanner (Siemens) a high-resolution MRA was implemented after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg BW gadodiamide. Images were assessed subjectively based on visibility and delineation of vessel wall and image quality (0-3 points). Quantitative evaluation was done by measuring the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Results: Our technique was able to visualize renal arteries (RA) in all subjects (100%) with mean visibility score of 2.3 \u00b1 0.3. RA were identified up to the second order branches in all subjects. In 4/12 patients a haemodynamic relevant narrowing of the RA was found and proven by conventional angiogram. No motion degradation of the RA manifest by blurring and reduction of arterial signal intensity (SI) were found. No significant difference concerning mean CNR and SNR were found (CNR abdominal aorta 45.4 \u00b1 19.2, right RA 44.3 \u00b1 16.9, left RA 44.4 \u00b1 17.1). Conclusion: Using parallel imaging techniques renal artery MRA at 3.0 T is feasible and initial results are promising. Signal gain at 3.0 T imaging is an important factor to further increase spatial resolution and improves the visualization of small vessel segments. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the influence of the acquisition technique and field strength on the variability of semiquantitative renal perfusion parameters. Methods and Materials: 8 healthy volunteers were examined at 1.5 T (Siemens AVANTO) using a 2D-SR-turboFLASH sequence (voxel size 2.3x2.1x8 mm\u00b3, temporal resolution 1s/4 slices) for the assessment of renal perfusion after the bolus administration of 7 ml 0.5-molar Gd-chelates. At 3.0 T (Siemens TRIO), another 8 healthy volunteers were examined using the above 2D-SR-turboFLASH after the bolus administration of 7 ml 0.5-molar Gd-chelates. Another 8 healthy volunteers were examined at 3.0 T using TREAT (voxel size 1.7x1.2x5 mm\u00b3, temporal resolution 1.4s/3D data set) after bolus administration of 6 ml of 0.5-molar Gdchelates. Postprocessing based on a gamma-variate fit, yielded the renal functional parameters mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP), maximal upslope (MUS) and maximal signal intensity (MSI).",

Methods and Materials: High resolution MR imaging of the aorta was performed on 15 WHHL (ages 27.2 \u00b1 5.9 months) and 6 NZW rabbits (control, 22.7 \u00b1 3.2 months) before and 24-120h after USPIO administration (DDM 43/34,Schering) in a 3 T scanner (Philips Intera) using an 8-channel head coil. 3 groups with dosages of 1.0, 0.25 and 0.1 Fe/kg were used (each 5 WHHL/2 NZW). T2*w3D GRE (TR/TE=30/2.7-11.0 ms, FA20\u00b0, res.0.35\u00d70.35\u00d73 mm) and 3D MRA (TR/ TE 5.6/2.1 ms, FA25\u00b0, res.0.7\u00d70.7\u00d70.7 mm, USPIO/Gd-DTPA-enhanced) were used to investigate areas of signal intensity (SI) reduction within the aortic wall demonstrating the uptake of USPIO. MR Images were matched with histology (HE, Prussian blue, RAM11). Results: Areas of SI reduction within the aortic wall were detected after injection of 1.0 mmol/kg (4/5 animals) correlated with USPIO uptake in inflammatory plaques (double-immunostaining). No significant SI reduction was detected after injection of 0.25 and 0.1 mmol/kg in WHHL animals with negligible USPIO uptake by macrophages despite the high burden of atherosclerotic plaques. NZW animals showed no aortic SI changes corresponding to the absence of plaques. Increasing TE (2.7-11.0 ms) decreased the detection threshold for aortic susceptibility artefacts, but increased artificial image distortion from outside the aorta (USPIO-uptake in bone marrow, lymph nodes). Conclusion: Contrast enhanced MR imaging techniques at 3 T using experimental dosages of USPIO (1.0 mmol/kg) allow identification of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. The absence of aortic SI reduction after lower dose USPIO administration does not correspond to an absence of plaque formation ((0.25),0.1 mmol/kg).",

Purpose: To implement and evaluate an MR protocol for comprehensive diabetes imaging on a 1.5 and 3.0 T whole body scanner using iPAT. Methods and Materials: 30 patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes (> 10 years) were examined on a 1.5 T (12 pts) or 3.0 T (18 pts) whole body MR system (Magnetom Avanto/Trio, Siemens Medical Solutions). Imaging of the brain with T2-w-, diffusion weighted and FLAIR-images was performed. Cardiac function was assessed with a single breath-hold multi-slice real time trueFISP technique (TSENSE factor 2-4). For DCE imaging, segmented trueFISP PSIR images were performed. 3D-Gd-MR-Angiography of the carotids, abdominal aorta (iPAT factor 3), thighs, calves and pedal arteries (iPAT factor 2) was obtained. Images of the feet were acquired. Correlation with a group of 200 healthy adults who received whole body MR imaging for cardiovascular screening was performed. Results and Discussion: Vascular pathologies were substantially more often found in diabetics than in healthy controls. Carotid artery stenosis was observed in 21% (6% of healthy adults). Renal artery stenosis was seen in 11 % of diabetics (controls 0.25%). Stenoses of peripheral arteries were seen in 47% -58% (healthy controls 14%). In four diabetes patients (21%) silent myocardial infarctions were detected (control group 1%). Chronic ischemic brain lesions were more often found in diabetics. Osteomyelitis was detected in 1 patient, neuropathic foot found in 3 patients. Conclusion: Whole body MR imaging is a highly promising method for comprehensive disease specific imaging in diabetes since typical pathologies can be identified and treated earlier. Purpose: To estimate the dose savings which could result from removing the anti-scatter grid in full-field digital mammography, without degrading image quality, as a preliminary step for a clinical experiment. Methods and Materials: Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) provided by 100 mm square aluminium foils, 0.1 and 0.2 mm thick, positioned on a PMMA phantom, was measured for PMMA thickness in the range 20-70 mm using a clinical digital mammography unit. For each thickness, one image was acquired in automatic mode with the grid present and the Average Glandular Dose determined; then six images were acquired without grid in manual mode, retaining the same technique factors and varying the mAs. A flat-fielding correction was applied to the grid-less images to correct the non-uniformity of the scattered radiation. For each thickness, the mAs number providing the same CNR as with the grid was computed. Using a distribution of PMMA-equivalent breast thickness measured previously, the average dose to the population was computed in both standard and grid-less cases. Results: For phantom thickness between 20 and 40 mm, the mAs were reduced by 30% to 15%, and by less than 10% between 40 and 50 mm. The breakeven occurred around 60 mm. The dose to the population at constant CNR would be reduced by 6%. Conclusion: Dose reduction achievable by removing the anti-scatter grid at constant CNR is small for most of the phantom thickness range; the resulting dose reduction to population does not justify a clinical application. Purpose: Tomosynthesis, through the reduction of structure noise caused by overlying breast tissue, may improve mammographic sensitivity and specificity. In particular, tomosynthesis provides improved contrast and conspicuity of masses. We have studied the visibility of low contrast objects using tomosynthesis images acquired at reduced radiation doses compared to full field digital mammography (FFDM). Methods and Materials: Mass visibility as a function of radiation dose was studied using phantoms. The mammography contrast detail (CD-MAM) and other phantoms were imaged in the presence of complex backgrounds and breast tissue. FFDM of the objects was performed at conventional doses and tomosynthesis images were taken at varying doses ranging down to 45% of the FFDM exposures. Contrast detail and object visibility performance for the FFDM and tomosynthesis images were compared. The prototype tomosynthesis system used an amorphous-selenium image receptor, and the FFDM system was the commercially available Hologic Selenia. Both image receptors have an imaging area of 24 x 29 cm, and a native resolution of 70 microns. Results: Object detection for the tomosynthesis images at 45% dose was statistically superior to the equivalent detection task for the FFDM images at 100% dose. Tomosynthesis detection performance was increasingly superior as dose increased to match the FFDM dose. Conclusion: Tomosynthesis is superior to 2-D mammography in the detection of low contrast objects in the presence of structure noise, even at lower dose. Optimal mammography performance may indicate the use of tomosynthesis. These results are being used to design our clinical trials.",

Methods and Materials: The research tomosynthesis system is based on a fullfield digital mammography system (NovationDR, Siemens) modified for a wide angular range for tomosynthetic image acquisition. The large-area a-Se detector enables fast readout and can be switched between 2-D and tomosynthesis mode. Images of a mammographic random phantom (RMI 152 A) were acquired in both 2-D and tomosynthesis mode. The phantom structures simulate masses, calcification, and fibres. From the measured projection data slice images were reconstructed with filtered backprojection. The slice images were assessed and compared to the 2-D images in a observer study with five observers. For the used X-ray spectra, the dose was estimated with Dance's method. The MTF, NNPS and DQE were determined as a function of spatial frequency and detector exposure. The measurements were performed using the available W/Al anode/filter combination at various tube voltages with PMMA or Aluminium added in the X-ray beam. Results: The system was found to have a relatively constant DQE > 0.60 at zero spatial frequency for detector exposures ranging from 15 to 150 \u00b5Gy with a halfvalue layer in the 0.70-1.1 mm Al range. The 10% MTF was 10 mm -1 in the scanning direction and 12 mm -1 in the slit direction measured 60 mm from the chest wall edge and 45 mm above the breast support table, which resulted in a lower DQE in the scanning than the slit direction for spatial frequencies above zero. Conclusion: The system has a wide dynamic range (15 -150 \u00b5Gy) in which the DQE at zero spatial frequency is above 0.60. ",

Methods and Materials: BI-RADS category 4 A is used for findings requiring biopsy, but with a low suspicion of malignancy. A CAC scheme was used to retrospectively analyze 76 cases forwarded for stereotactic biopsy (6 masses, 70 clusters), which were prospectively assigned BI-RADS Category 4 A. Of these cases, 5 masses and 64 clusters proved to be benign at pathology. The CAC scheme automatically extracted from the digitized mammograms, quantitative features that characterize the lesions. Based on these features, the system used a classification scheme to score the lesions by their likelihood of malignancy, and stratified the lesions according to their score into low, intermediate and high levels of suspicion. Results: For the 7 malignant cases included in the study, the computer assigned a high level of suspicion to all lesions and of the 69 (5 masses, 64 clusters) benign cases the computer assigned a low level of suspicion to 17 cases (3 masses, 14 clusters). The CAD analysis, thus, correctly classified all malignant cases, yielding a sensitivity of 100%. The computerized analysis could correctly classify 17 benign cases, improving the specificity for BI-RADS Category 4 A lesions by 24.6%. Conclusion: In a case series consisting predominantly of clusters of microcalcifications, the use of computerized classification could have correctly characterized all the malignant lesions assigned BI-RADS Category 4 A, and could possibly eliminate 24.6% of unnecessary biopsies.",

Test-collection included (officially given number to all participating radiologists) 20-27 malignancies, at least one bilateral cancer and a few benign lesions but no BI-RADs3 cases.

Two reviewers reached consensus. After 4 months the cuff retraction from the osseous attachment site to the proximal tendon margin was measured. Whenever tendon delamination resulted in different degrees of bursal or articular retraction, the more retracted margin was measured. MR images were acquired at 1.5 T using a dedicated shoulder coil and routine protocol. IRB approval was obtained. Results: Anteroposterior length of RCT ranged from 2.0-5.0 cm (mean = 2.8 cm), and retraction of tendon margin ranged from 3.0-5.5 cm (mean = 3.2 cm). The anteroposterior length of tear showed a statistically significant positive association with tendon retraction (P <.0001). There were 49 tendons without cuff delamination and 10 tendons with surgically confirmed delamination. Comparing the ratio of RCT length to retraction, tendons without delamination (1.2:1) showed significantly less retraction (P=.04) than tendons with delamination (1:1.1). Conclusion: Anteroposterior length and tendon retraction in full-thickness RCTs correlate closely approximating a 1:1 relationship. An anteroposterior length less than the greatest amount of tendon retraction (ratio less than 1:1) indicates possible cuff delamination of the supraspinatus tendon. Cuff delamination is important to recognize because it is associated with poorer surgical outcome. .

Results: Arthroscopy revealed 146 B1 lesions (37 superior, 90 anterior, 19 posterior) and 78 B2 lesions (31 superior, 11 anterior, 36 posterior).

Methods and Materials: Forty consecutive CT arthrograms of the shoulder were performed were randomly assigned to either 25% (n = 10), 50% (n = 10), 75% (n = 10), or 100% (n = 10) iodinated contrast. CT arthrograms were assessed quantitatively (CT number ratio of intraarticular fluid to pectoralis major muscle) and qualitatively (visual grading scale of 1-5 for overall image quality, image contrast, degree of joint distension, and beam hardening artifacts). Results: The CT number ratio (mean \u00b1 SD) of intraarticular fluid to pectoralis major muscle was 18.9 \u00b1 3.2 for 25% iodinated contrast, 28.6 \u00b1 2.2 for 50% iodinated contrast, 37.9 \u00b1 6.1 for 75% iodinated contrast, and 41.0 \u00b1 5.7 for 100% iodinated contrast.

ABER images allowed the visualisation of unstretched tendon floating inside the articulation. Conclusion: ABER CT arthrography allows a better detection and depiction of horizontal partial tears. CT arthrography with ABER and neutral position is easily realized without loss of time during the same examination. Results: Seven patients demonstrated labral tears on MR imaging and this was confirmed surgically in all cases. Thirty-seven patients (97%) had labral-chondral transitional zone lesions on MR imaging compared with 38 surgically confirmed cases. The site of labral-chondral transitional zone pathology at arthroscopy was as follows: 50% anterosuperior, 36% anterosuperior/superolateral, 11% superolateral and 3% superolateral/posterosuperior.

Conclusion: MR imaging demonstrates an elongated labrum, focal intra-substance signal change and irregularity and fissuring of the margins in patients with acetabular dysplasia. Abnormality is also identified at the labral chondral transitional zone where fissuring, focal clefts, chondral deficiency and subchondral cyst formation may be apparent.

For two reviewers, the Az values in lesion detection and characterization of PACE-TSE were superior to those of RT-TSE, but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). Mean SNR for liver and CNR for hepatic lesions were highest on PACE-HASTE than those of other sequences.

Methods and Materials: PET/CT scans of 154 consecutive patients, 138 patients with malignancy and 16 patients with vasculitis or infection were evaluated retrospectively. PET/CT was performed with a high resolution LSO detector and 16-row CT. The CT protocol varied depending on the specific clinical question and was multi-phasic in 101 patients and single-phasic in 53 patients. PET/CT studies were analyzed by different categories to determine the value of contrastenhanced CT on the PET/CT interpretation. The results were validated either by histopathology or clinico-radiological follow-up. The clinical impact of contrastenhanced PET/CT was evaluated with respect to changes in patient management. Results: Diagnostic CT was of additional value in 93/154 patients altering the PET/CT interpretation, in the remaining 51 patient no additional benefit was derived from the diagnostic CT. 10 patients were excluded due to inconclusive diagnosis in both methods. The greatest benefit of diagnostic CT was found in the following categories: improved localization of pathologic FDG uptake; improved local tumor staging; and detection of additional relevant findings. PET/CT interpretation was altered in 25% of patients in each of these groups. The benefit of diagnostic CT was influenced by the tumor type and changed clinical management in 35% of these patients. Conclusion: Diagnostic CT as part of the combined PET/CT examination provides additional value in specific clinical conditions with resultant change of therapy in a substantial proportion of patients.",

Thirty two benign lesions were diagnosed by a consensus panel of the all-clinical and imaging data, and at least 6 months follow-up. Two radiologists independently reviewed the dynamic MR imaging set and the double contrast set, respectively. In both sets, sensitivity and accuracy of detection and characterization were compared by alternative ROC analysis. Results: Overall detection accuracy (A z ) of double contrast set (0.902 for reader 1, 0.870 for reader 2) was better than that of dynamic set (0.836 for reader 1, 0.828 for reader 2) (P <.05 for reader 1).

Purpose: To identify the benefit of FDG PET-CT over FDG PET with diagnostic CT in staging thoracic oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. Methods and Materials: Following ethical approval, 43 consecutive patients (15 male, 6 female; mean 68 years) with proven oesophageal cancer were examined prospectively with PET-CT (Discovery ST, GE Healthcare Technologies). Following IV injection (4.5 MBq/kg FDG), scan acquisition (5 minutes emission scan/ bed position) was commenced 1 hour post injection; iterative reconstruction was performed to view images. All studies were read in consensus by two radiologists with PET experience. Initially the PET alone was read with the diagnostic CT; then the combined PET-CT was read; overall stage was noted at each instance. Comparison was made with the original clinical stage and any change in management was subsequently recorded. Results: There were 34 adenocarcinoma, 11 squamous carcinoma; 29 thoracic oesophagus, and 14 gastro-oesophageal junction. In 12 (23%) patients PET-CT changed stage from M0 to M1; in 5 this was due to unexpected nodal involvement (M1a) and in 7 due to distant metastases (M1b-liver (4), lung (2), bone (1)). In 4 M1 disease was shown only on PET-CT; this included 1 M1a, and 3 M1b disease (liver (2), bone (1)). In 2 further patients PET-CT showed a asymptomatic colorectal cancer, subsequently confirmed histologically. Thus PET-CT specifically influenced management in 5 cases (12%).",

The percentage of images per patient demonstrating optimal distension (grade 1) was calculated. Four patients with linitus plastica were excluded for the purposes of statistical analysis. Results: Milk achieved the greatest percentage of images with grade 1 distension (74%) compared with water (38%) and carbex/prone (41%) P < 0.04. Conclusion: Milk provides optimal reproducible distension as a negative contrast agent, is palatable to patients and delivers cost benefits when compared to barium or calogen preparations. Methods and Materials: 148 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven PGC underwent MDCT scan prior to gastrectomy. We evaluated the CT images separately for the site, size, depth, lymph node and enhancement characteristic of each case. Each post-surgical stomach specimen was axially sectioned and comparison was made to determine the correlation between the CT findings and the pathological examination of each tumor bearing slice. Results: MDCT correctly predicted 72 of the 94 tumors with obliteration of the fat plane between the gastric tumor and an adjacent organ or invasion of an adjacent organ. MDCT correctly identified 65/76 patients with GBA invasion and 31/ 40 patients with metastatic lymph node greater than 1 cm in GBA. Patients with PGC of the posterior wall (case group, n = 90) showed significant CT features of GBA invasion as compared to the patients with PGC of the anterior wall (control group, n = 58); increased tumor infiltration into subphrenic fat, marked gastrophrenic ligament invasion, and greater lymph nodes along the GBA or subphrenic retroperitoneal space (p < 0.05).

Results: With both imaging methods, wall thickness and infiltration was larger in aggressive lymphoma than in indolent lymphoma, but differences were not significant. In aggressive lymphoma, thickness of diseased wall was 0.8-12 cm with CT but only 0.3-1.3 cm with EUS. In indolent lymphoma the wall thickness was 0.7-1.3 cm with CT and 0.3-0.9 cm with EUS. The mean scores for wall invasion were 2.9 and 2.4 for aggressive lymphoma, measured with CT and EUS, respectively, and 1.5 and 0.8 for indolent lymphoma. For wall invasion, EUS and CT showed a high correlation (r s = 0.8, p < .05) although the criteria used differed. For wall thickness no linear correlation was found (r = 0.1). Conclusion: Although aggressive lymphoma tends to cause higher wall thickness and more advanced infiltration, no clear distinction can be made based on morphology provided by EUS or CT. Both methods showed a high correlation in assessment of wall infiltration but did not find a correlation in wall thickness.",

There was no influence of separate breath-holds on the ADC measurement (p > 0.05) of both water and tumors. Separate breath-holds with multi-NEX technique could reduce the AS-SET-related artifacts (p < 0.01) and achieve higher CNR (Se1: 12.16 \u00b1 3.75, Se3: 17.65 \u00b1 7.59, p < 0.01). The mean ADC of gastric cancer was 1.17 mm 2 /s\u00d710 -3 \u00b1 0.22. Conclusion: High quality ASSET-DWI imaging of gastric cancer can be achieved through the combination of separate breath-holds and multi-NEX technique. The diffusion-weighted MR imaging may provide functional parameters for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. patients, 33 male and 20 female, mean age 65.3, were evaluated with conventional endoscopy with biopsies, EUS and MDC. We considered only patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. All the CT examinations were performed after the oral administration of 700/900 ml of water for gastric wall distension; each examination was performed with triphasic technique (basal, arterial and portal phase). The images were post-processed using Multi-Planar Reformatting (MPR). The lesion morphology and thickness, the degree of gastric wall infiltration, locoregional lymph nodes and systemic metastases were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the EUS findings. All the patients enrolled in the study underwent surgery; then the preoperative EUS and MDCT staging was evaluated against the pathology findings. Results: Gastric cancer was confirmed in all patients. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the evaluation of T stage for EUS and three-dimensional MDCT were 86%, 87%, 90% and 85%, 77.5% and 92.8% respectively. For the evaluation of N factor for EUS and three-dimensional MDCT were respectively, 77%, 67.6%, 80% and 72.8%, 57% and 88%. Conclusion: Although EUS seem to have a better overall accuracy than MDCT in the evaluation of T1 and T3 tumors, three-dimensional MDCT still presents higher specifity and remains the cross sectional imaging technique of choice in the preoperative evaluation of gastric cancer.",

Assessment of right and left ventricular function was achievable in 124 patients (93%, 95% CI: 88%-97%). In the remaining 9 patients, an imprecise segmentation of right and left ventricular cavities was considered as a limiting factor for calculation of end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volumes.

            "text": "The study group consisted of 13 CTPA studies with a mean number of 4 thrombi (range 1-10). Datasets were selected to demonstrate a variety of thrombus load, considerable breathing artifacts (n = 2), sub-optimal contrast (n = 1) and additional parenchymal disease (n = 6). One experienced radiologist was asked to annotate all thrombi. The most proximal location of the thrombus defined its anatomic classification (main, lobar, segmental or sub-segmental), the thrombus size defined its conspicuity (obvious, medium or subtle). Results: Without CAD, the radiologist annotated 37 emboli located in the main (n = 7), lobar (n = 6), segmental (n = 14) and sub-segmental arteries (n = 10). With CAD, 12 additional thrombi were detected (increment of 32%), located in segmental (n = 2/16, 12%) and sub-segmental arteries (n = 10/20, 50%). Thrombi additionally detected by CAD were classified as being of subtle conspicuity (9/ 12, 75%) or medium conspicuity (3/12, 25%). Per dataset the CAD system showed on average 8.7 false positive calls (median = 7). Conclusion: Compared to the radiologist, the prototype CAD system found additional emboli in segmental and sub-segmental arteries. These preliminary results suggest that CAD may become a helpful tool for diagnosing low grade acute pulmonary embolism in peripheral arteries. Purpose: To evaluate the performance of a prototype CAD-tool using artificial intelligence for the detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) and the benefit for radiologists. Methods and Materials: 40 MDCT datasets using 100 kVp, 100 mAs effective per slice and 1 mm thick axial reformats in a low frequency reconstruction kernel were evaluated. 80 cc iodinated contrast agent was injected with a 5 cc/sec flow rate. Primarily, 6 community level radiologists marked any PE using dedicated lung evaluation software for visualization with consecutive processing with the PE-CAD-prototype. An expert panel consisting of two dedicated chest radiologists had to confirm any PE marked by the readers and/or the CAD-prototype and to mark any additional PE primarily missed by both, creating the reference standard. Purpose: The aim of this study was to find out whether late enhancement (LE) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a marker of myocardial fibrosis is a good parameter to establish a success of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with Fabry disease. Methods and Materials: 17 patients (13 men/4 women; age 41 \u00b1 8) with genetically proven Fabry disease received ERT (agalsidase \u00df) and were followed for 12 months. At baseline and after a year all 17 patients underwent cardiac MR imaging and additionally colour Doppler myocardial imaging to confirm an improvement of the regional function under ERT. Results: 8/17 (47%) patients showed LE at baseline (1.3 \u00b1 1.1% of left ventricular (LV) mass). The regional function was reduced in segments with LE. The LV mass of patients without LE at baseline was higher than in patients with LE (160 \u00b1 23 g vs. 211 \u00b1 58 g; p = 0.046). The LV mass at the follow-up after a year of ERT only decreased in patients without LE (145 \u00b1 27 g; p = 0.008). An improvement of the regional function was limited o segments without LE. The share of LE did not decrease under ERT. Conclusion: Patients without LE showed a decreased LV mass and an improvement of the regional function, as a sign for the benefit of ERT. LE cannot be reduced by 12 months of ERT as well as the regional function in segments with LE did not recover. Purpose: Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is rare X-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Cardiac involvement represents one of the severest aspects of this disease. Our aim was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of lateenhancement (LE) in the myocardium of these patients and to correlate LE presence with histological features. Methods and Materials: 10 AFD patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) on a 1.5-T system (Philips). CMR included the acquisition of delayed images 10-15 minutes after gadolinium injection, with 3D-T1w-TFE sequence, adjusting inversion time to null normal myocardium. LE was expressed as percentage of left ventricle (LV) myocardium. All patients underwent LV endomyocardial biopsy with automated morphometric quantification (Nikon) of fibrosis on section stained with Masson's trichrome. Results: 7 patients (70%) showed the presence of LE areas ranging from 1 to 17.5% (mean 6.5 \u00b1 5.8%) of LV myocardium. The fibrosis measured on histological samples ranged between 4 and 18% (mean 9.1 \u00b1 4.8%). LE percentage at CMR was strongly related to the percentage of fibrosis calculated at histology (R=0.93; P < 0.0005). LE areas were located in the medium-basal segments of lateral LV wall in all patients. Only two patients with severe LV hypertrophy showed additional LE areas in apical segments. Conclusion: LE located in the medium-basal lateral wall of LV might be considered as a specific sign of cardiac involvement in AFD patients. The strong relation between LE extension and histological fibrosis quantification suggests that LE percentage could represent an important non-invasive marker of the severity of cardiac involvement in Fabry disease.",

Methods and Materials: 18 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis underwent an initial and 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up MR imaging under therapy with corticoids. Short axis views covering the entire heart and 4-chamber views were done with T2-w images using a breath hold turbo inversion recovery sequence. Additionally delayed enhancement imaging was done with a 3d turbo flash sequence using an optimized TI-time of 210 ms in the short and long axis. Dynamic left ventricular analysis was done with contiguous short axis views covering both ventricles using a True-FISP cine sequence. Additionally 3-and 4-chamber views were performed. MR imaging findings were categorized into stable (\u00b1 50 cardiac infiltration volume), worsening (> 50 % more infiltration volume) or improving situations (> 50 % less cardiac infiltration volume). Results: 4 patients showed an improving situation with 3 patients presented a complete clearing of patchy granulomatous infiltrations with no areas of late enhancement while in 9 patients the MR imaging showed a stable situation with persistence of cardiac infiltrations in the same extension as in the initial imaging. Worsening situations of cardiac involvement was seen in 5 patients who all died due to therapy refractory ventricular tachyarrhythmias within 2 years. Conclusion: Cardiac MR imaging offers a rapid and non-invasive screening method with high spatial resolution for the detection of myocardial involvement and fibrosis occurring in cardiac sarcoidosis and is a useful method in follow-up under treatment. Results: Adequate image quality could be achieved in all but one patient. MR imaging analysis revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 3), residual myocarditis (n = 2), myocardial infarction (n = 2), dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 1), right ventricular dilatation (n = 1) and focal dyskinesia (n = 1). Delayed enhancement with spotted, streaky, subepicardial or transmural distribution could be found in 3 of our 12 patients. A reduction of the ejection fraction could be detected in 4 patients resulting in a mean shortening fraction of 45% and hypo-to akinetic areas in up to 3 patients. Only two patients showed no pathologic abnormalities. Conclusion: Although no specific MR pattern was found in our study cohort, MR allowed characterizing the underlying cardiac pathologies in 82% of HIV patients with elevated BNP levels. Purpose: For the diagnosis of Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) four main criteria have been proposed, both in echocardiography and more recently in cardiac MR imaging. In this study we specifically evaluated the \"non-compacted to compacted myocardium\" ratio (NC/C) in distinguishing LVNC from other cardiomyopathies. Methods and Materials: Nine patients with suspected LVNC were enrolled. We performed the following MR imaging sequences (Siemens Symphony 1.5 T): 1) TSE T1 black blood and cine TrueFISP sequences for morphological and functional analysis in both ventricles; 2) a perfusion study with first pass sequence during gadolinium injection (0.05 mmol/kg) on short axis at the basis, medium and apical level of the left ventricle; 3) delayed enhancement at10 minutes was evaluated on short axis, two chambers long axis and four chambers long axis to detect myocardial fibrosis.",

The NC/C ratio measured during diastolic phase was > 2.3 in all the cases, but in 3 patients this value was not confirmed from the measurement obtained in the systolic phase. Systolic function of left ventricle was reduced in 5 patients. First pass study revealed delayed perfusion both in the non compacted area and the compacted one. Only in one case myocardiac fibrosis was detected. Conclusion: In our experience the NC/C ratio may be not a sufficient index in the differential diagnosis of LVNC. Other MR imaging criteria should be prospectively evaluated. Results: In 45 patients a primary neoplasm of parotid gland could be histologically verified. Seven types of parotid gland tumor were histologically discriminated. Pleomorphic adenomas (2.14 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec \u00b1 0.11 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec) (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) and Warthin tumors (0.85 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec \u00b1 0.1 x 10 -3 mm 2 / sec) showed significantly different ADC values in comparison to all other evaluated tumors (p < 0.001), and also between each other (p < 0.001). ADC values presented by lipomas were statistically significant compared to all other entities (p < 0.001 to 0.015). Among primary malignant parotid gland tumors no statistically significant ADC values could be observed (p = 0.18 to 1). Conclusion: Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging seems to be a valuable tool for differentiating benign from malignant primary parotid gland tumors. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of using diffusion-weighted (DW) echoplanar imaging (EPI) for measuring different functional conditions of the parotid gland and to compare different field strengths. Methods and Materials: Parotid glands of 27 healthy volunteers were examined with a DW EPI sequence at 1.5 T and 3 T before and after oral stimulation with commercially available lemon-juice. The b-factors used were 0, 500, and 1,000 sec/mm 2 . Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were evaluated with a manually placed region of interest (ROI) including the entire parotid gland. For comparison of the results, Student's t-test was used, based on the mean of the volunteer median values. To compare both field strengths, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated. Results: DW EPI MR imaging successfully visualized the parotid glands of all volunteers. Using 1.5 T, the mean ADC prior to stimulation was 1.12 x 10 -3 mm 2 / sec \u00b1 0.08 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec, whereas after stimulation with lemon juice, the ADC increased to 1.18 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec \u00b1 0.09 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec. For 3 T, the ADC prior to stimulation was 1.14 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec \u00b1 0.04 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec, with an increase to 1.17 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec \u00b1 0.05 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec after stimulation. For both field strengths, the increase in ADC after stimulation was significant (P < 0.001). High correlations between both field strengths were found prior and post stimulation (r = 0.955, and 0.936 respectively).",

Purpose: To assess influence of partial neuromuscular blockade on the upper airway system using realtime TrueFISP MR imaging and volumetry of the upper airways. Methods and Materials: 10 healthy volunteers were studied before, during (trainof-four [TOF]-ratio: 0.5 and 0.8) and after (TOF-ratio: 1.0 and 15 minutes later) rocuronium induced partial neuromuscular transmission failure which did not evoke dyspnea or oxygen desaturation. Imaging was performed on a 1.5 T scanner using a head/neck surface-coil for signal reception. Functional exploration of the upper airway system was performed using sagittal real-time TrueFISP sequences (temporal resolution 250 ms). Datasets were acquired at rest and forced inspiration before, during and twice after relaxation. Minimal distance from back of tongue to posterior wall of pharyngeal space was evaluated. Additionally, sequential T1w images were collected in transverse orientation from the top of the hard palate to the vocal cords for the volumetric airway measurements. Results: During partial neuromuscular blockade, upper airways partially collapsed at end-inspiration. Measurements of minimal distances during forced inspiration showed a mean reduction from 20 mm before relaxation to 14 mm during maximal relaxation. Comparing pre-relaxation datasets to TOF-ratio 0.5 datasets, mean inspiratory volumes correspondingly decreased to 78 \u00b1 11 % of baseline (p < 0.01). Complete recovery was not found until 10 minutes after termination of relaxation. Purpose: To examine prospectively the clinical effects of renal artery stenting (RAS) in patients with global renal artery stenosis and chronic renal insufficiency. Methods and Materials: A successful RAS was performed in 30 patients with chronic renal impairment (serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl) and global atherosclerotic obstruction (bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral stenosis in a presence of a solitary or single functional kidney). To assess a significant change of RF, we managed to compare the slopes of the regression lines derived from the reciprocal of creatinine versus time, plotted before and after stent deployment. We also evaluated changes in renal length and interlobar resistive index. Median follow-up was 24 months (range 9-52).",

Methods and Materials: Forty-one lung recipients underwent balloon dilation and/or stent placement for bronchial strictures between January 1997 and January 2005. Clinical assessment, pulmonary function testing and bronchoscopic evaluation were obtained before and after each procedure. Clinical and bronchoscopic follow-up ranged from 1 to 87 months (mean 17 months, median 11 months). Results: Of the forty-one patients treated, twenty-four were alive on the last follow-up (58%). All patients had primary balloon dilatation; endobronchial stent placement was done if balloon dilation had failed to re-expand the bronchus during the procedure or at a later time. The average number of procedures per patient was 2.8 (median 2). During a procedure an average of 1.75 lesions were treated (median 1). Twenty-three patients (56%) received a stent because of failure of balloon dilatation. Among those, the mean number of stents per patient was 1 (median 1). Primary patency (after the first procedure) was noted in thirteen patients (32%). Secondary patency (after the last procedure) was noted in thirty-eight patients (93%). There was significant improvement in clinical and mean pulmonary function testing after each procedure, with an amelioration of 8% of the VEMS (P < 0.00003). Purpose: To study the long-term therapeutic efficacy of temporary partially-covered metal stent insertion by follow-up in achalasia.",

The placement and removal of stents were successful in 100 % of cases. Immediately after placing the stent, we performed an esophageal contrast examination, which confirmed good stricture patency. The mean follow-up time was 12-120 months. Results: Technical and clinical success was achieved in 98 and 94%; 97 and 92%; 98 and 94 % of cases respectively for, oesophageal, gastrojejunal and large bowel strictures. Better results occurred when dedicated stents with specific features for each anatomical site were used. The overall complication rate was 21% including, occlusion (12%), migration (3%), jaundice (1.2%), perforation (0.3%), stent rupture (0.3%) and others. The mean follow-up time for patients with neoplastic strictures was 4.5 months. Conclusion: Stenting of the alimentary tract has a high procedural and clinical success rate. In inoperable patients it provides a prompt reduction or disappearance of symptoms, good quality of life and survival improvement. It can be considered a safe and effective procedure and represents a less expensive treatment compared to palliative surgery which is affected by a higher mortality and morbidity rate. Purpose: To evaluate whether the motor impairment seen in ALS patients can be attributed to vascular and/or neuronal defects in the brain using BOLD fMRI. Methods and Materials: 33 ALS patients and 21 age-and sex-matched controls underwent fMRI examination using a 3 T MR imaging scanner. In the first session, a motor task was performed with the right hand to assess the activation pattern in the brain when executing voluntary movements. In the second session, an alternating hyperventilation -breath-hold task was performed to assess the vascular reactivity in the brain without interference of task-induced activations. Data was analyzed using SPM2 and activation patterns of both tasks were visualized. Additionally, a ROI analysis of different areas was performed on the images of both sessions. Results: In the motor task both groups showed activation of areas typical for voluntary movement. In ALS patients, there was a recruitment of both motor and extramotor areas. The ROI analysis showed significant increase of percentage signal change of motor areas (except M1) in ALS patients. Vascular reactivity seemed to be impaired in ALS patients in the motor cortex and frontal cortex, whereas there was no difference in vascular reactivity in the visual cortex. Purpose: Parkinson's disease is diagnosed in more than 1/200 worldwide; however 20-25% of these are estimated to be misdiagnosed. As the average population age is increasing, the need for accurate diagnosis and treatment is highlighted. We retrospectively reviewed the radiological features, and in correlation with clinical background, determined the clinical and radiological utility of DaTSCAN's in diagnosis and management of 40 diverse patients with atypical presentation's, suspicious for Parkinson's. Purpose: The differential diagnosis between typical idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and the striatonigral variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) is often difficult because of the presence of signs and symptoms common to both forms of Parkinsonism, particularly at symptom onset. To find the correct diagnosis early in the course of the disorders is, however, of major importance with respect to prognostic aspects and therapeutic strategies. This study investigated striatal, midbrain and cerebellar findings in MSA-P and PD patients in comparison with normal controls with three dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D MR imaging) based volumetry, together with DTI quantification in the nigrostriatal projection to increase the differential diagnostic accuracy between both disease entities. Methods and Materials: 11 patients with MSA-P within 5 years from symptom onset, and 12 patients with PD of similar duration were studied by 3D based MR imaging volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using a GE excite II MR machine. 10 age-matched healthy controls were also studied. Direct measurement of the striatum, midbrain and cerebrellum were made and data were normalized by 3D brain volumetry. The fractional anisotropy (FA) values of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging in ROI of the extrapyramidal system including globus pallidus, putamen, head of caudate and substantia nigra, were compared among the groups using one-way ANOVA. Results: MSA-P differed significantly from PD patients in terms of decreased putaminal and cerebellar volume. The FA significantly decreased in substantia nigra and globus pallidus in both MSA-P and PD groups, compared with control, and the decrease was more prominent in MSA-P patients than in PD patients (Table 1) . MR imaging volumetry of the midbrain region did not contribute to the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA-P.",

            "text": "The extent and spatial distribution of morphological changes in the striatum and cerebellum permit the differentiation of MSA-P from PD. Assuming that the loss of FA parallels the neuronal change in the brain, the results indicate that neuronal loss in nigrostriatal projection is more severe in MSA-P patients than idiopathic Parkinson's disease in the early stage. Close comparison of striatal and cerebellar volume in addition to FA in the nigrostriatal projection may contribute to the early differential diagnosis of MSA-P and Idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Purpose: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a recently recognized entity, characterized by specific neurological deficits, a characteristic imaging pattern, and usually a benign course. Primarily related to hypertensive conditions, many other etiologies, notably neurotoxic agents, have been associated with PRES. The aim of this study was to determine differences in the MR features of PRES based on the underlying etiology. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients with clinical and imaging findings consistent with PRES were included. All exams were performed on a 1.5 T superconducting system (Gyroscan NT-Intera, Philips). Based on their underlying etiology, we classified the patients into 2 groups: one with exposure to neurotoxic substances such as immunosuppressants (n = 6) or chemotherapeutic agents (n = 3), and the other with hypertension-related conditions (n = 6), including 4 patients with eclampsia. Results: In all but one patient, FLAIR imaging revealed hyperintense lesions in the subcortical white matter of the parieto-occipital regions bilaterally, partially in an asymmetrical distribution (n = 7). All patients with hypertension-related PRES had additional lesions in the basal ganglia (n = 9), whereas this region was not affected in the other patients. Brainstem involvement was seen only in the neurotoxic group (n = 3). There was no predominance of involvement of the corpus callosum (n = 2) and the cerebellum (n = 4) in either group. In one patient with eclampsia, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed high signal lesions with a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), indicating progression to infarction. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that there are differences in the MR appearance of hypertension-related and drug-induced PRES, possibly reflecting differences in underlying pathophysiology.

Methods and Materials: Thirteen AD patients and thirteen age-and educationmatched normal controls were tested in two visual search tasks (one was a conjunction task, where feature binding is required, the other was a subset task, where group stimuli are needed without feature binding) using fMRI techniques. Data analysis was performed by Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM 99). Voxel-by-voxel t statistics were used to compare activated brain areas between patients and controls. Results: Our findings suggest that both search tasks are controlled by partially overlapping cerebral networks, including parietal, frontal and occipito-temporal cortical regions. The AD patient group showed less activation in both parietal lobes and the left frontal regions, while increased activation was found in the right frontal lobes and the right occipito-temporal cortical regions with the conjunction task. In the subset task, decreased activation in AD patients was seen in the left parietal lobe and bilateral frontal lobes, while increased activation was seen in both medial temporal lobes. In addition, for the comparison between tasks, the difference is very small for AD patients. Control group showed a higher amplitude in the right prefrontal region, temporal cortical regions and parietal lobe. Conclusion: AD patients have a particular impairment in both search tasks. We suggest attention deficits in AD patients may be attributed to both binding problem and grouping inefficiency.",

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic potential of 3DUS based virtual cystoscopy in infants and children, presenting our initial and preliminary experiences. Methods and Materials: 10 patients (age: 1 to 14 years) who presented with bladder pathology on conventional 2DUS (Sequoia 512, Acuson/Siemens, Mountain View, USA) underwent a subsequent 3DUS study with reconstruction of a \"virtual cystoscopy\" from the 3DUS data set using gradient light shaded surface rendering (Voluson Expert Pro, Kretztechnik/GE, Zipf Austria). The results were then evaluated for artifacts and diagnostic resolution and compared to routine transurethral cystoscopy findings. Results: 3DUS acquisition with sufficient image quality for virtual cystoscopy was feasible in all patients without sedation. Patient diagnoses included intravesical polyps or ureteroceles, ureter ostium pathology, bladder wall trabeculation and bladder diverticula. In all patients the virtual cystoscopy images and findings matched the result from transurethral cystoscopy; however, a significant change in diagnosis of the initial 2DUS report was achieved only in 1 patient, though 3DUS conspicuity was higher and presentation of the findings was more convincing using 3DUS based virtual cystoscopy display. Conclusion: 3DUS based virtual of the urinary bladder is feasible in children. It offers a great visualization tool that matched transurethral cystoscopy findings in all patients and has the potential to reduce diagnostic cystoscopies in those pediatric patients who do not need biopsy or endoscopic therapy.",

Results: In all 5 patients US managed to guide the transrectal catheter into the sigmoid or descending left colon for effective and gentle instillation of the enema. With repeated enema instillation up to 40 mls, all 5 meconium plugs were dissolved and obstruction was relieved, even in a child that later demonstrated a distal small bowel stenosis and on the initial US was thought to show an unused microcolon. No complications were observed during and after these procedures. Conclusion: US guided reduction of meconium plugs appears to be a safe and effective method that reduces radiation to these preterm babies and can easily be performed at the patient's bed side in the NICU. Purpose: Evaluation of a flat-panel X-ray detector, based on amorphous selenium with respect to skeletal radiography. Conventional images were compared with digital radiographs using identical and reduced radiation doses. Methods and Materials: 84 consecutive patients were studied prospectively using conventional screen-film radiography (detector dose 2.5 microGy). Digital images were taken from the same patients with detector doses of 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 and 0.3125 microGy, respectively, using a flat panel detector with implemented Ptone/EVP image processing software. The active-matrix detector had a pixel size of 35 x 43 cm, a matrix of 2.5 x 3K, and a pixel size of 139microm. All hard copies were presented in a random order to five independent observers, who rated image quality according to subjective and objective quality criteria. Results were assessed for significance. Results: A statistically significant preference for digital over conventional images was revealed for all quality criteria, expect for over-exposure (detector dose 2.5 microGy). Digital images with a dose reduction of 25% showed a statistically significant supremacy compared to screen-film technique. The screen-film radiography was significantly inferior to flat-panel detector-technique at 50% dose reduction regarding bone cortex and trabecula, contrast and overall impression. Conclusion: Due to its high detective quantum efficiency and dynamic range compared with traditional screen-film systems, a dose reduction of up to 50% and more is possible by using a flat panel detector with implemented P-tone/EVP image processing software without loss of image quality.",

This is becoming increasingly important as, via role extension, radiographers especially in the U.K., are increasingly performing, under written schemes of work, that were previously designated medical tasks e.g. intravenous injection of contrast agents. Consequently there is a need for radiographers to receive further education regarding these agents, and it is incumbent on them to understand the possible deleterious effects of these drugs. Methods and Materials: An extensive literature review was performed to establish key facts re contrast agent induced nephrotoxicity (CIN); i.e. incidence, pathogenesis, cost implication, protocols to reduce CIN, as this information would be valuable to injecting radiographers. Results: The reduction of CIN via the identification of patients at high risk, consideration of the dose and osmolality of contrast agent injected, water and sodium intake regimens peri-procedurally, the role of pharmacological agents and the use of alternative modalities will be evaluated. as defined by the local phase.

Purpose: Dear-Mama is a project funded by EU FP5 programme for a period of 4 years to develop digital imaging X-ray machine, for general radiology and mammography, that reduces the dose, and increases the image contrast. Methods and Materials: Based on direct capture of X-ray photons with room temperature solid-state pixel detectors coupled to photon counting readout electronics, Medipix2 chip, via bump bonding. Medipix2 chip is a matrix of 256x256 pixels (55 microns pixel size). The effective area of one Medipix2 assembly is 14.08x14.08 mm. Medipix2 assemblies are mounted on small PCBs, later mounted on large PCB that we call the \"Motherboard\". Two different high voltage power supplies and two different X-ray tubes will be used accordingly for each type of clinical evaluation. The clinical trials will be carried out for mammography at UDI-AT (Barcelona), chest radiology at H\u00f4pital d'Efant Armand Trousseau (Paris), and osteoporosis at radiology department of Vienna medical school. Results: Allows discrimination of signal after amplification and pulse shaping, from the intrinsic detector noise with the electronics. This leads to superb signal to noise and a high contrast image. This implies that with little X-ray dose one can achieve a very good image with practically zero electronic noise. One frame is captured and displayed in less than 10 seconds and then sent to the PACS. The total active area of the sensor is 18x24 cm. Conclusion: In the presentation we will discuss the overall performance of the X-ray machine and the outlook for an industrialization plan.",

PET/CT data was acquired using oral and intravenous contrast agents. PET/CT data sets were read by an experienced radiologist and a nuclear physician in consensus, and histopathology from conventional colonoscopy as well as surgical histopathology served as the standard of reference. Results: Integration of CT-colonography into whole-body PET/CT staging proved feasible and was performed without technical errors in all patients. PET/CTcolonography revealed 18/19 colonic lesions detected by conventional colonoscopy, only one flat lesion was missed. Additionally, 6 extracolonic tumor sites were detected with the integrated PET/CT exam. Based on the imaging findings 11 patients were treated surgically, whereas three received chemotherapy. For the surgically treated patients PET/CT revealed correct T-stage in 8/11 patients and a correct N-stage in 9 patients. Conclusion: Whole-body PET/CT with integrated CT-colonography is feasible and provides accurate results for TNM staging in patients with colorectal cancer.

Prior to the CT scan, the intramuscular medication and 1 mL of air was administered into the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks using a standard 23 gauge, 30 mm needle. The CT scans were analyzed by 2 independent radiologists establishing the location of the air bubble. Body mass index (BMI), gender preponderance, distance to injection site, and thickness of subcutaneous fat and muscle were also calculated. Results: Only 12 (25%) received an intramuscular injection. There was not a linear relationship with BMI. However, most of the patients who received subcutaneous injections were female, had an average fat thickness of more than 2 cm and an average muscle thickness of less than 3 cm. In contrast, those who received an intramuscular injection were all male, had an average fat thickness of less than 2 cm and an average muscle thickness of more than 3 cm. Conclusion: 75% of patients did not actually receive an intramuscular dose in the gluteal region. The efficacy of intramuscular injections is related to gender as well as subcutaneous fat and muscle thickness. The results of this study may have an impact on the administration of intramuscular injections. Purpose: To evaluate the pennation angles of lower limb muscles (vastus lateralis and medial head of gastrocnemius) in trained track and field athletes with HR-US to investigate whether the arrangement of muscle fascicles is related to different muscle activities (aerobic vs. anaerobic). Methods and Materials: Thirty-six track and field athletes trained in anaerobic (100-meters runners) and aerobic (marathon runners) muscle activities were evaluated at the end of their training session. In each subject, HR-US evaluation of the vastus lateralis (VL) and the medial head of the gastrocnemius (MHG) was performed on both limbs by means of a high-resolution broadband linear array transducer (12-5 MHz). Muscle pennation angles were calculated on scanning planes oriented along the long axis of the muscle. Results: Athletes performing anaerobic training showed greater fascicle angles (VL, mean 23\u00b0; MHG, mean 24\u00b0) than the aerobic trained ones (VL, mean 16\u00b0; MHG, mean 18\u00b0).

An MCS/SCS > 1 mm and a TFO < 0 mm are indicative for syndesmotic injury. Dual TSE images in three orthogonal planes and an additional oblique plane were acquired with a 1.5 T magnet. The syndesmotic ligaments were classified as normal, thickened, possibly or definitely ruptured.

The agreement score (\u03ba) concerning the presence of syndesmotic injury between the X-ray and MR imaging was determined. Results: With Lauge-Hansen, syndesmotic injury could be assessed in all patients. Using Weber resp AO-M\u00fcller in 30% resp 9% of patients syndesmotic injury could not be assessed either because the fracture could not be classified and/or the measurements were normal.

The examination protocol included the intravenous short-infusion of 100 ml of a biliary contrast agent. CT cholangiography data was acquired with a slice thickness of 1 mm. Data sets were evaluated quantitatively by measurement of the biliary opacification, and qualitatively on the basis of a scale ranging from 1 (non-diagnostic) to 4 (excellent). The opacification was correlated with the post-operative serum bilirubin level. Results: CeMDCT-CA provided diagnostic delineation of the biliary tree in all 15 donors and seven of 11 recipients; in four recipients the degree of biliary opacification was rated non-diagnostic. The biliary opacification was generally higher in the donor collective. Four donors and three recipients presented a moderate focal biliary constriction without elevation of laboratory values indicating biliary obstruction. Six patients presented with postoperative fluid collections suggestive of perihepatic biloma, however no biliary fistula could be visualized.

After acquisition of axial T1w and T2w sequences, conventional MRC was performed through a respiratory-triggered, thin-slab (2 mm), heavily T2w FSE sequence and a breathhold, thick-slab (10/50 mm), single-shot T2w sequence in the coronal plane. In each patient coronal T1w fat-suppressed breath-hold 3D gradient-echo imaging (FAME) was also obtained 30-40 minutes after mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP, Teslascan\u00ae) intravenous administration. All source images and 3D MIP and volume rendered reconstructions were reviewed in conference by two observers that were asked to determine presence and site of biliary tract complications. Imaging results were correlated with direct cholangiography (n = 21), surgery (n = 4) and/or follow-up (n = 5). Results: In 5 patients no biliary tract abnormality was identified. The remaining 25 subjects were affected by ischemic-type biliary lesions (n = 6), non-anastomotic strictures (n = 6), anastomotic strictures (n = 8), inflammatory ampullary stenosis (n = 2), intrahepatic biloma (n = 1) and stones (n = 11). Mn-DPDP-enhanced MRC tended to out-perform conventional T2w MRC in delineating 3 slight anastomotic stenoses and 8 out of 12 strictures involving the biliary tree of the graft. Additionally, it allowed the correct diagnosis of an intrahepatic biloma. ",

In-vitro MR imaging protocol included T1-w GRE, RARE, HASTE, and 3D TSE T2-w sequences on a 1.5 T and a 3 T MR system. Within each magnet class, the maximum clip distance was noted where susceptibility artifacts obscured the fluid-filled tube. Susceptibility artifact size was also calculated for each sequence within each magnet class. In-vivo analysis included 21 patients with a history of cholecystectomy who underwent MRC at 3 T. Presence of susceptibility artifacts was noted for each sequence. MRC image quality was also graded with specific emphasis on whether image quality was impaired by susceptibility artifacts. Results: In-vitro, mean area of susceptibility artifacts was 104 mm 2 on the 3 T MR system and 75 mm 2 on the 1.5 T MR system. While surgical clips within a 2 mm range impaired visualization of the fluid-filled tube on 1.5 T imaging, this range increased to 4 mm on 3 T MR imaging. In-vivo, MRC image quality was impaired by susceptibility artifacts in three of 21 cases by obscuring adjacent biliary ductal branches. Conclusion: Susceptibility artifacts from surgical clips are larger with ultra-high field 3 T MR imaging than on standard 1.5 T MR imaging. Adjacent biliary ductal branches will be obscured by these susceptibility artifacts in selected cases. Purpose: To evaluate subjects affected by esophageal motility disorders using Dynamic TURBO-FLASH sequence during positive oral contrast agent administration and to compare MR findings with videofluoroscopy and manometry results. Methods and Materials: Thirty patients who previously underwent videofluoroscopy and manometry for suspected esophageal motility disorders were studied using a 1.5 T magnet (Magnetom Vision: Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with phased-array coil. Imaging protocol was based on the employment of Dynamic TURBO-FLASH sequence on sagittal and axial planes to achieve motility evaluation (TR 416 mS; TE 1.2 mS; Flip Angle 8\u00b0; Thickness 20 mm; FoV 350; Matrix 90x128; N. acquisition 45; TA=25 sec; Position: prone) during oral administration of positive contrast agent (yoghurt + Gd-DTPA 0.5 M, 1:100 boluses).

Conclusion: MR fluoroscopy approach represents a promising radiation-free modality in the evaluation of esophageal motility disorders. Exists elevate agreement between MR imaging findings and standard modality findings. pudding with/without paramagnetic contrast medium. Thirty serial images were obtained using four real-time trueFISP (AcqT/slice 0.6 s) and three cine turbo-FLASH (AcqT/slice 0.2 s) sequences with varying parameters (field-of-view, matrix, slice thickness, etc) to assess the best spatial and temporal resolution. Functional and anatomical information obtained with the different acquisitions and the clarity of swallowing-related motion were evaluated. Additionally, signalto-noise ratios (SNRs) were measured in each used sequence. Results: Among turboFLASH sequences, the 5 mm acquisition showed the best compromise between SNR and spatial resolution, whereas 8 mm sequence revealed to be the optimal trueFISP acquisition. Considering the most performing trueFISP and turboFLASH sequences, the last provided the best temporal and contrast resolution, with a sufficient spatial resolution during motion. Conclusion: High-speed kinetic MR imaging is a very promising tool for evaluating deglutition. Real-time trueFISP is well suited for this purpose, providing good image contrast and sufficient temporal and spatial resolution, but turboFLASH acquisition currently provides the best anatomical and functional information for the evaluation of the swallowing process. Purpose: The application of radiopaque markers with conventional abdominal overview and nuclear medical procedures are easy methods assessing colonic transit time, but both methods repeatedly expose patients to radiation providing only insufficient transit characterisation. Therefore, the aim was to develop an assessment for the determination of colonic transit time using functional cine MR imaging.",

Purpose: To evaluate the position, configuration, dimensions of the thoracic duct with fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences and MR lymphography (MRL) and the clinical significance. Methods and Materials: MRL by heavily T2-weighted techniques and fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences was performed in 139 patients. Forty-two patients were excluded because of poor reconstructional images. On T2-weighted images, the position of thoracic duct with reference to the vertebrae was defined, and the coronal and sagittal MIP reconstructional images were obtained for measurement of the dimension. The differences of the parameters in the groups including a control group, portal hypertension group and choledochal obstruction group were compared. Results: The cisterna chyli was shown in 91.37% of patients on fat-suppressed T2-weighted images. Most were located at the vertebral level between L1 and L2 in 80.31%, and in the midline of the vertebrae in 75.59%. On the MIP images, the thoracic duct was shown in 69.78%, and the most common configuration of the cisterna chyli was tubular or saccular. The mean longitudinal, anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the cisterna chyli were 26.04 (\u00b1 10.45)mm, 5.08 (\u00b1 2.08)mm, and 5.02 (\u00b1 2.13)mm respectively. The anteroposterior and transverse diameters of the thoracic duct were 3.08 (\u00b1 0.44)mm and 3.58 (\u00b1 0.13)mm in control group. There was a significant difference of the transverse diameter of the thoracic duct between control and disease groups (F=5.638, P=0.005). Conclusion: Noncontrast-enhanced MR techniques may be used to detect the thoracic duct, and portal hypertension may influence its dimension. Purpose: To test the feasibility of in-vivo T1 measurements of the entire lung parenchyma, to quantify T1 measured in the entire lung, and to determine the effect of inspiration and expiration on the measured T1 values. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers underwent MR imaging investigation of the lung using a 1.5 T scanner. Image acquisition was based on a SNAPSHOT-FLASH sequence. The acquired series of images were used for calculation of T1 relaxation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis. For each volunteer image acquisition was performed both in inspiration and expiration. Results: The average of the mean T1 values was in inspiration 1199 \u00b1 117 ms and in expiration 1333 \u00b1 167 ms. T1 values were higher in expiration than in inspiration in all 10 volunteers. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.005). In inspiration, the difference between the average dorsal T1 value and the average ventral T1 value was 81 ms with higher ventral values. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.022). In expiration, the difference between the average dorsal T1 value and the average ventral T1 value was 33 ms, with higher dorsal values. This difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study documents the feasibility of T1 measurements of the entire lung parenchyma. These measurements resulted in significantly lower T1 values in inspiration, and in significant differences between inspiratory T1 values from the ventral and the dorsal parts of the lung. Our findings underline the need for a close monitoring of the inspirational status during MR examinations of the thorax, notably when T1 measurements of the lung are performed.",

Schreiber; Mainz/DE Purpose: The actual strategy to improve SNR in 19 F-MRI is a high number of averages using gases with short T1 such as SF 6 (1.65 ms), necessitating short echo times and high bandwidths. The aim was to improve SNR through lowering receiver bandwidths using C 2 F 6 (T1 5x SF 6 ). Methods and Materials: 3 pigs were ventilated with 70% C 2 F 6 (or SF 6 ) and 30% O 2 . FLASH projection was done during and after gas wash-in. Dynamic imaging with 1 frame per breath every 5s (TA=2s) and static imaging after completion of the wash-in (TA=10s) at three different bandwidths 200, 488, 700 Hz/pixel during an inspiratory hold was done. Furthermore, triples of 1, 3 and 100 acquisitions were taken after wash-in at 488 Hz/pixel, exclusively. Results: C 2 F 6 was clearly superior to SF 6 at all tested bandwidths. The SNR for C 2 F 6 was maximal at 200 Hz/pixel (488 Hz/pixel for SF 6 ). For the first time, subsecond 19 F-MRI of the lung proved feasible using C 2 F 6 at 488 Hz/pixel. A peak SNR of 11 was observed for a scan time of 780 ms. Conclusion: MR imaging of C 2 F 6 yielded good image quality in healthy pig lungs.",

Purpose: To test the feasibility and accuracy of 64-slice CT coronary angiography (gantry rotation time 330 msec) in patients with acute coronary syndromes, with invasive coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) as reference standard. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients with unstable angina (UA) or suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) underwent CT coronary angiography within 24 hours prior to cardiac catheterization. IVUS studies were conducted in 16 patients. Subjects in sinus heart rhythm were included, provided they were able to hold their breath for 12-14s. Patients with heart/renal failure or allergy to contrast agent were excluded. Beta-blockers were administered to patients with heart rates above 65 beats per minute (bpm). Results: 11/25 patients presented with UA and 14/25 with AMI. Beta-blockers were administered to 15 patients. Average heart rate dropped from 67 to 58 bpm. All subjects were correctly identified as normal (n = 1), single-vessel (n = 8) or multi-vessel (n = 16) disease patients. Five/25 patients were overdiagnosed with 3-vessel instead of 2-vessel disease. In the analysis of lesion characteristics performed blinded of the clinical context and IVUS results, the culprit lesion could be defined in all patients with 1-vessel disease (n = 8), in 6 patients with 2-vessel disease (n = 8) and in 5 patients with 3-vessel disease (n = 8).",

All patients were examined using 64-detector row computed tomography angiography (CTA). All Patients with stenoses or uncertain lesions at CTA (n = 61) underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA). On a coronary segmental level, the presence of high-grade (\u2265 50% diameter) stenoses was compared. Results: In a total of 915 segments, CTA detected 62 significant stenoses. Thirty-four significant stenoses were confirmed by ICA, whereas 28 stenoses could not be confirmed by ICA. 22 of those 18 lesions showed stenoses < 50% at ICA whereas 6 segments were angiographically normal. Accordingly, on a coronary segmental basis, 28 false positive and 0 false negative findings resulted in a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 96.8%, a positive predictive value of 54.8%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. The diagnostic accuracy was 96.9%. Conclusion: Sixty-four-detector row computed tomography reliably detects significant coronary stenoses in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and appears helpful in the selection of patients who need to undergo ICA. However, grading of stenoses is still challenging and stenoses are frequently overestimated by 64-detector row computed tomography.",

Two experienced observers analyzed all MDCT-scans for signs of CAD (degree of stenosis = 0%; < 50%; < 70%; < 99%; 100%). Diagnostic accuracy compared to cardiac catheter was determined on a per-segment, per-vessel and per-patient basis.

In 7.8% of segments, image quality was compromised either by misregistration (15.6%), motion artefacts (31.2%) or small vessel size (53.1%). The correlation coefficients for the detection and grading of stenosis were r = 0.65 on a per-segment, r = 0.83 on a per-vessel and r = 0.88 on a per-patient basis.

Conclusion: Using a frequency adapted delay algorithm with the choice of an endsystolic reconstruction window provided diagnostically valuable images in patients with AF. Purpose: To evaluate the influence of ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), heart rate, and cardiac output (CO) on coronary artery opacification with 64-slice computed tomography (CT). Methods and Materials: 60 patients (22 women, 38 men; mean age 61.9 \u00b1 10.5 years) underwent retrospectively electrocardiography-gated 64-slice CT coronary angiography. Ten data sets were reconstructed in 10% steps of the R-R interval for quantification of left ventricular EF, SV, and CO using software capable of semi-automated contour detection. Attenuation values were measured and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated in the proximal right coronary artery (RCA) and left main artery (LMA). CNR was defined as difference of mean attenuation in the vessel from the mean attenuation in perivascular tissue divided by image noise in the ascending aorta. Results: Mean EF during scanning was 61.5 \u00b1 12.4%, SV was 63.2 \u00b1 15.6 ml, heart rate was 62.5 \u00b1 11.8 bpm, and CO was 3.88 \u00b1 1.06L/min.

Automated anatomic tube current modulation was used for each case. mAs, CTDI vol and DLP values were recorded and the effective dose calculated. Based on the selected nominal tube current, CTDI vol , DLP and effective dose, which would have been delivered without tube current modulation, were also calculated. Two radiologists independently rated image quality on a 5-point scale. Image noise was objectively assessed. Findings at CT were clinically correlated with cardiac ultrasound, angiography or surgery. Results: 38 CT scans were evaluated. Mean diagnostic quality was rated at 3.7 (range 3-4.4), with mean image noise of 9.1 HU STD (range 3.3-15.9). Compared to scanning without tube current modulation, mAs, CTDI vol , DLP and mean effective dose values were significantly (p < 0.01) reduced by 57.8% (54.1/ 128 mAs), 57.1% (2.5/5.9 mGy), 55.4% (70.1/156.9 mGy*cm) and 59.9% (2.38/ 5.9mSv), respectively.

Image quality between 120 kVp, 100 kVp and 80 kVp scans was not significantly different. CT diagnoses correlated well with clinical findings. Conclusion: Automated tube current modulation combined with low tube voltage settings significantly reduce radiation exposure and are generally recommended in pediatric cardiovascular 64-slice CT.

Purpose: To evaluate the utility of a new diagnostic radiographic technique for morphologic and functional evaluation in the lacrimal outflow system of patients with suspected nasolacrimal duct obstructions. Methods and Materials: Dacryocystography (DCG) was performed by gentle manual injection of nonionic water-soluble contrast media (Ultravist 300, Schering, Berlin, Germany) through a micro catheter inserted into the inferior cannaliculus. Imaging included digital flat-detector DCG (2 frames/sec) in frontal and lateral view (Alura Xper FD 20 flat detector System, Philips, The Netherlands). Additionally, 3D rotation scan was performed using C-arm roll movement at 55 degrees/ sec acquiring 120 images. Images were analyzed using functional and morphological criteria based on 3D surfaced shaded and multiplanar reconstructed 2D images. Additional radiation exposures were measured and analyzed. Results: In two cases no tear duct obstruction was found. In ten cases a stenosis and in four cases occlusion was found. Soft tissue swelling within the nasolacrimal duct was the most common cause of obstruction. In three cases additional dacryocele, respectively nasal pathology was depicted. The radiation dose applied was lower compared to conventional post-DCG computer tomography, providing comparable diagnostic information. Conclusion: 3D-rotation-flat-detector dacryocystography provides detailed imaging of the soft tissue lacrimal outflow system and surrounding bony structures within one diagnostic tour. This new technique combines morphologic and functional diagnostic information that improves planning of surgical interventional procedures. ",

            "text": "Purpose: Multislice-CT based intraoperative navigation is a well established method in ENT surgery. However, currently the best possible navigation precision (0.7-1 mm) is limited compared with small structures of the lateral skull base. The resolution of the underlying CT dataset could be one significant influential factor; therefore we tested whether high resolution imaging provided by flat-panel based Volume-CT translates to higher navigation precision. Methods and Materials: An acrylic glass phantom with a rigidly attached reference star providing 40 navigation markers in the form of inverted cones was C D E F B A G designed. It was scanned in a state of the art MSCT (GE Lightspeed 16) and an experimental fpVCT (GE). MSCT scanning (~350 \u00b5m feature size in plane, 5 00 \u00b5m in z) and fpVCT scanning (~ 200 \u00b5m feature size, isotropic) were optimized for high resolution. The navigation system VectorVision2 (BrainLAB) was used. Six cones were used for registration, seven for measuring the average target registration error (TRE) (5 reiterations). Furthermore, a stereotactic, minimally invasive cochleostomy was tried on four excised temporal bones that were scanned in fpVCT. Results: Average TRE using fpVCT was 0.46 (SD 0.22), significantly lower (p < 0.1, two-sided t-test) than using MSCT: 0.82 mm (SD 0.35). Stereotactic cochleostomy was successful in all four temporal bones. Conclusion: High resolution fpVCT imaging improves intraoperative navigation accuracy. As shown here in ex-vivo experiments, this could be highly beneficial for skull base surgery, where precise image guided interventions such as cochleostomy or stereotactic drilling biopsies could become possible.",

Methods and Materials: Sixteen patients who underwent resection of cholesteatoma were included in the study. In each case, CT examination of the temporal bone was performed in the following protocol: slice thickness 0.6 mm, overlap 0.3 mm, FOV 9.8 mm, matrix 512 x 512, reconstruction kernel -soft tissue, 80 kV, 160 mAs. Examination was performed before and after intravenous injection of iodinated non-ionic contrast medium: 60 ml, flow rate 1.5 ml/s, post-contrast delay 70 s. During post processing, the density of middle ear masses was measured in Hounsfield units (HU) with the use of specially designed color-coded maps. An experienced radiologist evaluated images searching for post-contrast enhancement. Imaging findings were correlated with surgical findings. Results: Based on computer created maps coding HU in colours, it was possible to observe non-homogenous enhancement of a middle ear mass in twelve cases, which were proven to be granulation tissue at surgery. In four cases the middle ear mass showed no significant post-contrast enhancement; these were proven to be cholesteatomas. Conclusion: Evaluation and comparison of pre-and post-contrast CT images can confirm residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in patients who underwent middle ear surgery by showing non-contrast enhancement. In cases with granulation tissue, delayed post-contrast enhancement of more than 15 HU is typical. This will help in non-invasive differentiation between post-inflammatory and cholesteatoma lesions.",

Main/DE, 2 Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7070, NC/US (m.mack@em.uni-frankfurt.de) Purpose: To assess the feasibility and accuracy of predicting electrode insertion depth necessary in cochlear implantations (CI) for electric acoustic stimulation by means of pre-operative MSCT. Methods and Materials: 8 fresh human temporal bones were examined with MSCT with a 0.5 mm collimation (increment 0.2 mm). The basal cochlear structures were reconstructed and measured using a 3D-program (vessel view, Siemens). Standard cochlear implantations with a free fitting array were performed. A special technique, which allows sectioning of undecalcified bones was used. After embedding, all bones underwent conventional X-ray analysis with further insertion measurements. Pre-implantation HRCT data was compared to X-ray and histology. Results: Pre-implantation MSCT reconstruction was feasible and easy-to-use in every bone. Linear reconstruction revealed all relevant anatomical details of the cochlea and adjacent structures. Using the described linear reconstruction method, an average basal cochlear length for the first 360\u00b0 of 20.3 mm (range 18.8 to 22.0 mm) was measured. For the 8 specimens, values for the implanted length until the 360\u00b0 point ranged from 19.2 to 21.9 mm with an average of 20.3 mm. Pre-implantation CT-based measurements correlated very well with post-implantation X-ray data. Comparing the results of the pre-, and post-implantation meas-urements, a mean failure of 0.3 \u00b1 0.28 mm in predicting the correct length of the basal turn of the cochlea was observed. The maximum failure was 0.7 mm. Conclusion: MSCT allows the good prediction of the cochlea lengths before CI. This is especially useful when aiming for hearing preservation, where insertion depths of 360\u00b0 are necessary.",

Volume rendering (VR) was employed for postprocessing of CTA data. The detectability of the different ECA branches in CTA and DSA was evaluated by two examiners. Results: No statistically significant differences between CTA and DSA were found for identifying branches relevant for microsurgery. DSA was superior to CTA if more peripheral ECA branches were included. All patent parent vessels of the transplants could be visualized with CTA. Conclusion: CTA proved to be a promising non-invasive alternative to DSA in vascular mapping for planning microvascular reconstruction of the mandible. ",

Purpose: Endovascular stent grafting has a proven role in treating diseases of the thoracic aorta. The mortality and morbidity associated with the procedure is far lower than open surgery. However many patients are unsuitable for treatment due to the absence of an adequate proximal or distal landing zone. We perform extra anatomic bypass grafting of the arch or mesenteric vessels to facilitate stenting in such cases. Methods and Materials: Thirteen patients were treated with bypass prior to thoracic stent grafting. Aortic pathologies included aneurysms affecting the arch and descending aorta, aneurysmal type B dissections, thoraco-abdominal aneurysm and one aneurysm of an aberrant right subclavian artery. Patients underwent a combination of grafting from the ascending aorta, carotid-carotid artery bypass, carotid-subclavian artery bypass and mesenteric artery bypass. Four patients were treated with Medtronic Talent stents, one patient with a Gore TAG stent and eight patients with the new Medtronic Valiant stent graft. Results: Initial technical success was achieved in all patients. One procedure was complicated by rupture of the iliac artery. One patient died in the perioperative period giving a 30 day mortality of 7.7%. There were two small endoleaks (15%) on the immediate post operative CT. However there were no endoleaks present at three months (0%). At a mean follow-up of eight months there have been no further deaths, ruptures or complications related to the bypass grafts. Conclusion: Extra anatomic bypass is a valid and safe technique to expand the proportion of patients suitable for endovascular stenting of the thoracic aorta. ",

Systemic and intrasac pressures were recorded before and after the embolization. CT scans were performed at 24 hours, 30 days and 1 year after the procedure: Both the presence of leaks and the changes in sac diameter were evaluated. Technical success was identified by feasibility of the procedure and clinical success with no evidence of leaks at follow-up. Results: Transcaval puncture was feasible in 10/12 procedures (technical success 83%). The mean systemic pressure was 150/86 mmHg (range 117/69-176/ 100). The mean intrasac pressure before embolization was 79 mmHg (range 140-40). After embolization, the mean intrasac pressure was 10 mmHg (range 5-39) in 10 patients, while in one it increased.

Methods and Materials: Twenty patients with kidney transplants were included in the study. The median delay between transplantation and ASL was 19 days. Reasons for MR imaging evaluation were anuria, unsatisfactory improvement in serum creatine or rise of serum creatine. MR imaging was performed on a Siemens-Symphony 1.5 Tesla scanner using the body coil for transmission and a surface coil array for reception. For ASL, a single slice FAIR method with a True-FISP imaging acquisition was used. Perfusion was measured on a coronal view of the kidney in free breathing conditions. Imaging protocol included an MRA sequence (FLASH 3D) with contrast injection (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) and a morphological sequence (VIBE). Results: Perfusion was fully evaluated by ASL in all patients. The pelvic position of kidney transplants did not cause reduced motion artefact. Renal cortex blood flow was found to correlate with serum creatine (R=0.80). No correlation between perfusion and transplant artery stenosis was found. Perfusion maps were unrelated to enhancement of the renal parenchyma. Conclusion: Our results suggest that physiological mechanisms could be highlighted by ASL: 1) renal cortex perfusion and glomerular function are related, 2) renalcortex perfusion could be maintained for a long time despite significant renal artery stenosis and 3) renal enhancement does not reflect perfusion.",

The following diffusion parameters were calculated: Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC tot ) from all b-values, a diffusion coefficient (D) and the perfusion fraction F p . Cortex and medulla were analyzed separately. Serum creatinine concentration was obtained from each subject. Seven of the 15 patients with transplanted kidneys underwent a repeat study using the identical protocol to determine reproducibility. Results: In transplanted kidneys almost identical values were obtained in the cortex and medulla for ADC tot , D, and for F p . In contrast, in native kidneys ADC tot , D and F p were significantly higher in cortex than in medulla (p < 0.0001, p < 0.002 and p < 0.01, respectively). The reproducibility study showed a very low CV w (coefficient of variation within subjects) in cortex and medulla especially for ADC tot and D of less than 3.2%. Diffusion and perfusion indices correlated with serum creatinine concentrations. Conclusion: DW-MRI in patients with transplanted kidneys is feasible with highly reproducible results and is able to detect differences in diffusion-based corticomedullary differentiation as compared to native kidneys.

In addition the degree of DRPV was compared to the nuclear grade and histological subtypes of RCC by using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results: DRPV were seen in 90 (70.9%) patients. Hematogenous metastases of RCC to other organs were found in 15 (12%) patients. Metastases were found in the lung (n = 9), liver (n = 3), brain (n = 1), vertebra (n = 1) and pleura (n = 1). Of the 15 patients with metastases, 14 patients showed a variable degree of DRPV. DRPV were identified only in patients with an exophytic mass larger than 2 cm in diameter and patients with renal vein thrombosis. Renal vein thrombosis was present in 6 patients. There was a weak correlation between the degree of DRPV and mean tumor size and degree of contour bulging (P <.05). Conclusion: Tumor size and exophytic growth of renal cell carcinoma were related to the development of DRPV. Hematogenous metastasis of RCC to other organs was high in patients with DRPV.",

            "text": "High resolution ASL perfusion imaging of the kidneys at 3 Tesla A. Boss, P. Martirosian, C.D. Claussen, H.-P. Schlemmer, F. Schick; T\u00fcbingen/DE (andreas.boss@med.uni-tuebingen.de) Purpose: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) provides a non-invasive modality for quantitative perfusion measurements. The feasibility of high resolution ASL imaging of the kidneys was tested and proven at 3 Tesla using a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) true fast imaging in steady precession (TrueFISP) technique. Methods and Materials: An ASL sequence with FAIR spin-preparation and True-FISP signal detection strategy was adapted for high-resolution perfusion imag- ing of the kidneys in a 3 Tesla whole-body scanner. Quantitative perfusion maps were acquired in six healthy volunteers and two patients. To avoid banding artefacts, which are prominent at 3 Tesla, a TrueFISP frequency scout was implemented. Perfusion maps with an in-plane resolution of 1.5 mm were recorded in transverse and coronal planes. For fast mapping of the whole kidney, an in-plane resolution of 2 mm was applied. Results: High-resolution perfusion images with excellent image quality could be obtained during a measuring time of 10 minutes in all subjects. The whole kidney could be mapped with diagnostic image quality in less than 10 minutes. For all slices, a frequency offset of less than 100 Hz provided the kidneys free of True-FISP artifacts. Perfusion values of the renal cortex ranged from 250 up to 400 ml/ 100 g/min (mean cortical perfusion right kidney 316 \u00b1 43, left 336 \u00b1 40). Conclusion: Perfusion images of the kidney could be obtained with excellent image quality by means of a 3 Tesla MR setting within a clinically applicable measuring time offering an alternative to conventional perfusion imaging with potentially nephrotoxic contrast media. Purpose: There is sparse data on the MR appearance of the normal development of the structures of the fetal posterior fossa, and how prenatal MR imaging data compares to US investigations at the same gestational age (GA). In this study we present preliminary MR imaging data and compare that to published, GA matched ultrasound (US) data. Methods and Materials: Image sets originally obtained by using (T2 weighted) single-shot fast spin-echo, (EXPRESS) of 91 normal fetuses between GA's of 40 and 20 weeks were retrospectively analysed using proprietary measuring software. Measurements were taken of the trans-cerebellar diameter (TCD) the crainiocaudal (CCD), anteroposterior (AP), midline sagittal surface area (CSA) dimensions of the cerebellar vermis, the AP diameter of the fourth ventricle (AP4), anterior and posterior axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the midline sagittal surface area of an area defined as the 'bony posterior fossa' (PF). Results: We present data from 63 normal fetuses. We have shown that there is significant correlation between MR imaging and US measurements of fetal PF structures and that there is a constant discrepancy between vermis CCD and AP diameters as measured by MR imaging. Conclusion: An in vivo MR template of normal fetal cerebellar (posterior fossa) development is essential for conclusive and accurate interpretation of the foetal brain, to this end our data underlines previous work by Griffiths, Whitby and other groups corroborating previously published MR depictions of the developing cerebellum and posterior fossa and is consistent with published US data of similar age matched measurements.",

Methods and Materials: A T2*-weighted single-shot gradient-echo sequence (TE 30 ms) was used to measure BOLD SI changes in the fetal sheep brain during hypoxia. 9 pregnant ewes were examined in a 3 T scanner (Intera, Philips Medical Systems). Measurements were performed during a control period with normal oxygen saturation, then during hypoxia and recovery induced by reduction and subsequent increase of oxygen in the ventilated gas mixture. Regions of interest were placed in the fetal cerebrum to measure SI. The changes in the relaxation rate (Delta_R2*) were estimated for each plateau by ln[(SI (t)/SI control )/ TE]. Fetuses were chronically instrumented with a probe in the left hemisphere to continuously measure the local pO 2 . The difference of the control and hypoxic/ recovery pO 2 values was calculated (Delta_pO 2 ). Linear regression analysis was used and a correlation coefficient (r) was calculated to indicate the correlation between Delta_R2* and Delta_pO 2 . Results: BOLD measurements were obtained during control (n = 15), hypoxia (n = 22) and recovery (n = 12). Mean values of relative SI% (SI (t)/SI control ) and pO 2 were reduced from 100% and 14 mmHg pO 2 [95% confidence interval 10-17] to 81% SI% [76-86] and 3 mmHg [2-4] and increased to 99% [93-105] and 15 mmHg [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] during recovery. Delta_R2* and Delta_pO 2 were correlated significantly (r = 0.64; p = 0.00005). Conclusion: BOLD SI changes reflect changes of local brain pO 2 . R2* measurements in the brain correlate with local brain pO 2 values. Therefore R2* provides information about fetal brain tissue oxygenation. Purpose: It has been respectively shown that MR spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can depict abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).",

Preand post-interventional two-view mammograms were analyzed by two radiologists, independently. The position of the markers were assessed. In case of a dislocation, defined as a clip migration > 5 mm from the target, the distance and direction of dislocation was recorded. The dislocation was scored on a threepoint scale [1=no dislocation (\u2264 5 mm); 2=minor dislocation (6-20 mm); 3=major dislocation (> 20 mm)]. Results: Post-interventional mammograms revealed clip displacement in 43/200 (21.5%) cases. Clip displacement was seen significantly more often in calcifications (39/43; 90.7%) than in masses (4/43; 9.3%; p < 0.05). Displacement was seen significantly more often in conventional localizing clips (30/100; 30%) than in gelatin pledget/metallic clips (13/100; 13%; p0.05). Major dislocation was seen significantly more often using conventional clips only (7% vs. 0%; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Following 11 g VABB clip displacement more than 20 mm was seen significantly more often using conventional localization clips in comparison to the gelatine pledget/metallic clips. Conventional localization clips should no longer be used following stereotactic 11 g VABB. Purpose: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of galactography-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) and its feasibility as potential therapeutic procedure for intraductal lesions of the breast. Methods and Materials: 16 patients (mean age 58.2 years) with nipple discharge and galactographically verified intraductal lesions, were included in this prospective trial. Galactography-guided stereotactic 11-gauge VAB was performed in 16 lesions followed by open biopsy. VAB and surgical histology were correlated. Results: After VAB, histopathologic findings revealed ductal cancer in situ in five (31.3%) cases, invasive ductal cancer in three (18.7%), atypical in two (12.5%), and a benign result in six (37.5%) lesions. In ten cases (62.5%) histopathology after open biopsy confirmed the previous established diagnosis. Five (31.3%) carcinomas were missed or underestimated at VAB, showing one DCIS, two atypical papillomas and two benign results at VAB. One (6.2%) atypical ductal hyperplasia was underestimated as papilloma at VAB. At surgery tumor remnants were found in all cases. In all patients nipple discharge ceased after open surgery (follow-up at least 18 months). Conclusion: Our results suggest that galactography-guided VAB is a feasible method to evaluate intraductal lesions presenting with nipple discharge. As underestimation or false negative results occurred in six of 16 patients (37.5%) and complete removal cannot be assured due to the nature of lesions, 11-gauge VAB cannot be recommended as alternative to open biopsy.",

Methods and Materials: 14 patients underwent vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB) because of BIRADS-IV and -V lesions, exclusively detected on prior MR exams. 14 lesions with a diameter between 6 and 36 mm underwent biopsy using a computer-navigated target system including a dedicated workstation (Dy-naCAD \u00ae ). Sequences for intervention consisted of a T1W FS-markersequence and CE-dynamic sequences using a dedicated breast coil. 20-24 specimen were taken of each lesion and underwent histological evaluation. Immediately after biopsy a MR-compatible clip with bioabsorbable attachment was placed via a coaxial needle into the biopsy site. Histologically proven malignant lesions underwent surgery guided by the clip within 2 weeks. Results: VABB could be performed in all lesions well tolerated by all patients (100%). 8/14 lesions (57%) were malignant (6 invasive carcinomas, 2 DCIS) which could be surgically confirmed. 6/14 lesions were benign (43%). Placement of a clip into the biopsy hole was possible in all cases. Surgery confirmed the presence of the clip within or adjacent to the tumor in all surgically proven malignant lesions. No clip displacement occurred. Mean duration of the procedure was 50 minutes. Conclusion: Computer-navigated MR-guided breast biopsy with DynaCAD\u00ae is a robust and highly accurate and feasible method for histological evaluation and localization of breast lesions which are neither detectable with mammography nor with sonography. Purpose: Vacuum assisted breast biopsy (VABB) under MR imaging guidance is increasingly used for the histological verification of MR imaging-detected breast lesions that lack a correlation at mammography and ultrasound. The aim of this study was to compare three commercially available VABB devices for their yield of breast tissue. Methods and Materials: Three VABB devices [Mammotome (Ethicon USA), Vacora (Bard, USA), and ATEC (Suros Surgical System, USA)] were included in this study. Each device was used to obtain 50 specimens from fresh turkey breasts. Turkey breasts were immobilized using a stereotactic device (Noras, Germany) and positioned on the table of a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imager (Vision, Siemens, Germany) 60 cm from the gantry. Obtained specimens were measured for weight, length and fragmentation. Results: Biopsy could be successfully performed with each of the devices inside the MR imaging suite. The ATEC device (mean sample length 25.5 mm, mean sample weight 188.6) performed best, followed by the Vacora (mean sample length 18 mm, mean sample weight 155.1) and the Mammotome (mean sample length 19.8 mm, mean sample weight 77.6). Differences in mean sample weight were statistically significant (p < 0.05). 15 samples obtained with the ATEC device yielded a total of 3004.8 mg of breast tissue. To retrieve the same amount of breast tissue, 21 passes were necessary with the Vacora, and 39 passes with the Mammotome. Conclusion: Biopsies inside the MR imaging suite could be successfully performed with each of the devices. The ATEC device performed significantly better than the Vacora and the Mammotome.

            "text": "To study the effect of needle aspiration of breast abscesses as alternative to percutaneous pig-tail drainage or surgical incision. Methods and Materials: Ultrasonography (US) was performed on 63 patients with suspected breast abscesses. Patients with phlegmonous mastitis were treated with antibiotics only. US-guided needle aspiration was performed with a 14-18 G needle, if an abscess was diagnosed. The patients were scheduled for shortterm follow-up and the procedure was repeated in case of relapse. Patients with progression or no therapeutic response were referred for surgical treatment. Results: 9 of the 63 patients were excluded because of complex etiological factors. US showed phlegmonous mastitis in 4 patients. Of the remaining 50 patients having an abscess formation, 43 were successfully treated with needle aspiration and antibiotics (median abscess diameter 26 mm, range 7-105 mm). 24 abscesses had a diameter of more than 25 mm, of which only five had to undergo surgical drainage. Mean number of aspirations for each patient was 1.6 (range 1-5). Median number of days from first aspiration until treatment was considered successfully finished, was 13 days (range 4 to 70 days). Seven patients had to be referred for surgical incision. Treatment success was not influenced by abscess size or duration of symptoms before therapy. Conclusion: US-guided abscess aspiration in combination with antibiotics as a minimally invasive procedure is an alternative to percutaneous pig-tail drainage and surgical incision, even in patients with larger abscess formations. Purpose: To evaluate the mechanisms responsible for recurrence after varicose vein surgery with color duplex imaging (CDI). Methods and Materials: One hundred and thirteen limbs (93 patients, female: 69, mean age: 48 years), were preoperatively examined using CDI in order to detect the presence and the extent of venous reflux and to design the appropriate surgical procedure. All limbs were followed-up clinically and ultrasonographically one month and 5-years after surgery. Results: Forty-two sources of reflux were identified among 28 (25%) of the 113 operated limbs that had presented with recurrence during the follow-up period. The one-month postoperative examination revealed the preservation of 1) an incompetent greater saphenous vein (GSV) distal remnant in 6 limbs that were subjected to a limited stripping (6/42, 14.3%) and 2) a saphenous stump with incompetent tributaries in 2 limbs (2/42, 4.8%).",

Methods and Materials: Over a five-month period, 200 patients with suspected DVT, had a Wells pre-test clinical probability score calculated. Exclusionary testing was performed for \"low\" and \"moderate risk\" groups with d-dimer and venometer. Positive results were clarified by Doppler. Patients were tracked through the pathway, and for subsequent events over a three-month period. Results: 57 had DVT (28.5%). 3 of 41 (7%) \"low risk\" patients, 18 of 86 (21%) \"moderate risk\" patients, and 36 of 73 (49%) of the \"high-risk\" group had DVT. 31 (15.5%) patients were discharged following exclusionary testing. Negative predictive value of venometer and d-dimer were 94% and 96% respectively, but PPV was poor at 38% and 25% respectively. One patient re-presented following a Purpose: Early detection and proper management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after major orthopedic surgery is very important to the prognosis. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the ability of indirect multidetector row CT venography (CTV) in detecting DVT after hip or knee arthroplasty in comparison with Doppler sonography. Methods and Materials: Sixty-two patients had undergone hip (n = 28), knee (n = 32) or both (n = 2) arthroplasty. For the detection of DVT, CTV and Doppler sonography was performed 8 -40 days after the operation. CTV (collimation 16 x 1.5 mm, table feed 24 mm) from diaphragm to feet was done. Doppler sonography was performed within 30 days (average 2 days) following CTV. In the detection of DVT, the ability of CTV was evaluated in comparison with Doppler sonography. CAM-180 dual-detector gamma camera. Qualitative assessment using visual grading (SLS) was performed. Quantitative parameters assessed were percentage ilio-inguinal node tracer uptake at 120 min, and tracer clearance from injection sites. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the data. Results: Lymphoedema was established in 14 oedematous extremities (primary = 9, secondary = 5) and excluded in 7 oedematous extremities for other reasons (Prader-Willi syndrome = 2, venous insufficiency = 2, surgery = 1, lipoedema = 2). Lymphatic function of 5 non-oedematous extremities was also analysed. Early lymphatic filling was observed in 7, and dermal flow in 4 extremities. For SLS, sensitivity = 71%, specificity = 40%, PPV = 83.3%, NPV = 25%; and for tracer clearance from injection site, sensitivity = 55.5%, specificity = 80%, PPV = 90.9%, NPV = 33.3% were calculated. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that visual grading of lymphoscintigrams may be standardised using summed lymphatic score and combined with a measure of tracer clearance from injection sites for establishing the diagnosis of lower extremity lymphoedema.",

Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of high-resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography with intracutaneous injection of gadodiamide in patients with primary and secondary lymphedema. Methods and Materials: 15 patients with lymphedema of the lower extremities underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography. Gadodiamide was injected into the dorsal aspect of both feet. First, the extent and distribution of the lymphedema was evaluated using a heavily T2-weighted 3D-TSE sequence. For high-resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography a 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence (VIBE) was used. Results: No complications were observed during or after the examination. In all patients the lymphedema demonstrated an epifascial distribution. In 14 patients, lymphatic vessels extending from the injection site were reliably detected 15 minutes after injection. After 5 minutes, concomitant venous enhancement was detected in all patients. In 13 patients, the lymphatic vessels in the upper leg could be seen. In 14 patients, the inguinal lymph nodes with external iliac lymphatic pathways were reliably depicted at 35 minutes. The external iliac lymph nodes were observed merely in 6 patients. Collateral vessels with dermal back-flow were seen in 12 patients. A lymphocutaneous fistula and a lymphocele with the afferent lymphatic vessel were detected in one patient. Conclusion: High-resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography is feasible in non-invasively visualizing the lymphatic vessels and accompanying complications in patients with primary and secondary lymphedema. The method is not aimed at the depiction of lymph node morphology, but provides complementary information about the lymphatic vessels when lymph nodes are examined with super-paramagnetic iron oxide particles.",

Methods and Materials: 88 patients with suspected arterial dissection of the neck vessels were included in this prospective trial. All patients were examined using B scan, CCD sonography and PD. After documentation of the diagnoses, the patients were additionally examined by B flow ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was used as reference standard in all cases. Results: Dissections of the carotid artery (n = 19) and of the vertebral artery (n = 35) were found in 44 patients. B-flow imaging identified 52 of 54 arterial dissections that were confirmed by MRA. The sensitivity of ultrasound examination using B scan, CCD and PD in detecting all dissections was 95.9% and 99.1% with additional B flow examination. Sensitivity using B flow increased from 98.3% to 100% for carotid dissections and from 93.3% to 94.3% for vertebral artery dissections. The reduced effect of the ultrasound probe angle facilitated imaging of fissures, membranes and low flow phenomena and improved the identification of low-reflection wall structures. Contrast-enhanced MRA in conjunction with axial T1 and T2 weighted sequences enabled the best visualization of intramural hematomas. Conclusion: B-flow imaging can significantly increase the sensitivity of ultrasound examination for dissections of the neck vessels. It also improves the visualization of flow within the true and false lumen, of hypoechoic thrombi and of intramural hematoma.B-079 11:42Comparison of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and magnetic resonance-and conventional angiography in the assessment of apparent carotid occlusion on ultrasound C.J.

Primary objectives were number and size of bone metastases as well as the feasibility of radiofrequency ablation in nude rats. Methods and Materials: Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (10 6 tumor cells) was implanted into the femur of 10 nude rats. Weekly CT-and MR imagingscans were performed to document number and size of bone metastases. Radiofrequency ablation (22 g bipolar and impedance-controlled RF-applicator, 2-4 Watt, 3 min application time) was carried out. One week after RFA, the animals were sacrificed and macroscopic and histological examination followed. Results: All animals developed local bone metastases. RFA was performed without complications. Imaging showed a complete ablation of the bone tumor in all rats. Histological findings confirmed a circular necrosis with extensive destruction of tumor cells leaving a necrotic cavity. Conclusion: RFA in human breast cancer cell line in nude rats is a feasible and useful possibility to evaluate and test different RF-procedures.

Ponomarev; New York, NY/US (riedlc@mskcc.org)    Purpose: To verify enhanced hypoxia driven gene expression after hepatic artery ligation by use of genetic imaging reporter systems. Methods and Materials: RH7777 Morris hepatoma cells were transduced with a constitutively expressed \"beacon\" reporter gene (monomeric red fluorescent protein/Renilla luciferase double fusion) and a \"sensor\" reporter gene (HSV1-tk/green fluorescent protein/Firefly luciferase triple fusion) which was under the control of a HIF-1-inducible hypoxia responsive element (HRE). Cells were sorted for red fluorescence and hypoxia induced green fluorescence by flow cytometry. In sorted cells luciferase activity was assessed in vitro with and without 12h hypoxia treatment (pO 2 =2%). Isolated Morris hepatoma tumors were established in livers of Buffalo rats and the effect of hepatic artery clamping on vascularization and oxygen levels in liver tumors and normal liver tissue was assessed by in vivo Hoechst staining as well as with continuous in situ real time oxygen measurements using the Oxylite probe. Results: Bioluminescence assays after hypoxia treatment showed upregulation of the HRE driven Firefly luciferase and no positive effect on the expression of the constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase. In vivo experiments revealed complete cessation of tumor perfusion and severe hypoxia in liver tumors during hepatic artery clamping. Conclusion: These preliminary results show that hypoxia driven gene expression can be detected with imaging reporter genes and suggest that in transduced liver tumors upregulation of such genes after hepatic artery clamping could be imaged in vivo.B-34011:51 Twofold labelled macrophages and their characterization in MR imaging A.

Lackner 1 ; 1 Cologne/DE, 2 Eindhoven/NL (cbangard@gmx.de) Purpose: To perform kinematic studies of the knee with high spatial resolution images on an open high field MR system. Methods and Materials: The knees of ten volunteers were examined on an open high field MR scanner (Panorama 1.0 T, Philips Medical Systems, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). High spatial resolution T2-w and PD-w TSE sequences were generated in seven different positions between full extension and approximately 90 degrees flexion of the knee. During the whole extent of flexion and extension, all knees could be placed in the isocenter of the magnet because of the wide open patient aperture. All assessed images were analyzed by two experienced radiologists for different clinically relevant anatomical structures (cruciate ligaments, menisci, cartilage, collateral ligaments, position of patella and femoral condyles). Results: The high spatial resolution images showed comparable SNRs with that of cylindrical 1.5 T scanners in all different positions of the knees. The excellent image quality allowed a precise delineation of the anatomical structures with visualization of the movement of the cruciate ligaments, the slide of the femoral condyles and the patella. Depending on the position of the knee, the contact of the cartilage of the femoral condyles related to the menisci and the tibial plateau could be shown. Conclusion: Kinematic studies on an open high field MR scanner allow a precise assessment of clinically relevant anatomical structures of the knee. High spatial resolution images in combination with kinematic studies could be helpful for the diagnosis of various diseases of the knee, especially transient patellar dislocation.",

Methods and Materials: Two MDCT chest examinations, one normal and one pathological (emphysema) were acquired at 16 x 1.25 mm with a 0.6 mm reconstruction interval. 89 computer-generated nodules with known volumes (31.7-896.7 mm3) and mirroring characteristics of solid nodules typically found in chest CT examinations were inserted at random solitary, juxtavascular or sub-pleural locations in the datasets. CT scans were compressed using the 3D SPIHT compression method to 24:1, 48:1, 96:1 levels. A repeated measure ANOVA model was fit to evaluate the impact of compression level and nodule characteristics on CAD volume estimates. Results: Mean nodule volume measurement error was +3.4 % \u00b1 7.6 % [SD] in uncompressed datasets, and +0.5 % \u00b1 9.1 % [SD] at level 96:1. No significant difference in volume measurement error for any of the compression levels was identified. Even though compression did not predict the size of the volumetric errors, 96:1 level did yield statistically significantly smaller volumes on average (average volume loss 4.1 mm3) than the other amounts of compression. Nodule location was found to be a significant predictor of volume measurement error with larger percent errors on average for juxtavascular (+7.1 %) and sub-pleural nodules (+1.6%). Nodule size and presence of emphysema were not identified as significant predictors of volume measurement error. Conclusion: CAD volume estimates of computer-generated nodules in lossy compressed data showed no significant difference up to 96:1 when compared with known volumes in reference database.B-375 14:36Computer aided detection (CAD) of solid lung nodules in lossy compressed MDCT chest examinations P.

Korobko; Kiev/UA (SCRDC@svitonline.com) Purpose: We propose a quantitative description of metabolic and T2-alteration of relaxation time for prostate tissue differential diagnosis prostate carcinoma (PC) and benign hyperplasia (BHP). Methods and Materials: Two groups of patients were examined by 1.5 T Magnetom Vision System (SIEMENS). The 1 st group (PG) included 53 patients (34-76y), the 2 nd group (VG) consisted of 15 healthy volunteers (30-48y). To build the metabolic map the 1 H spectra are recorded with 2DCSI:TR/TE = 1500/60 ms. In T 2 measurements the 1 H spectra are recorded in the central zone (CZ) and in the peripheral zone (PZ) of prostate with SVSSTEAM: TR/TE = 1500/60, 80, 100, 140, 180 ms. Results: From 1 H MR spectra the peak areas of main metabolite signals: citrate (Cit, 2.6 ppm), creatine (Cr, 3.0 ppm) and choline (Cho, 3.2 ppm) and the mean peak height ratios of R = Cit/(Cr+Cho) were obtained. R values R > 1.12 are indicative for PC, R > 2.30 for BHP, R > 4.14 for normal regions of prostate tissue. In the VG the mean values of T2 for water (Wat), and for Cit, Cr, and Cho are the following:T 2 CZ ( Wat)=(71.3+-0.56)ms, T 2 CZ ( Cit)=(170.2+-0.23)ms, T 2 CZ ( Cr)= (134.5+-0.3)ms, and T 2 CZ ( Cho)=(254.13+-0.81)ms; T 2 PZ ( Wat)=(123.5+=(323.7+-0.2)ms. In the PG the values of T 2 ( from 56.4 to 93.2 ms) are indicative for water signal in PC, and (from 98.7 to 117.4 ms) for BHP. Conclusion: Metabolic and T2-relaxation time mapping can be helpful for diagnosis and characterization of clinically localized PC and also to estimate the efficiency of therapy.

Bonomo 1 ; 1 Roma/IT, 2 Chieti/IT, 3 San Giovanni Rotondo/IT (nicola.magarelli@rm.unicatt.it)    Purpose: To evaluate the MR signal modifications induced by one cycle of hyaluronic acid therapy in young adult patients positive for intermediate grade chondromalacia patellae. Methods and Materials: Sixteen consecutive patients within the age range of 18-35 years old with mono or bilateral anterior gonalgia but without trauma and diagnosed as having early-intermediate grade chondromalacia patellae (grade I-II-III according to the Outerbridge-Insall classification) were enrolled. All MR examinations were performed with the same instrument, a 1.5 Tesla (Philips-INTERA) and a dedicated coil (150 mm FOV phased array (SYN-flex-M)). Images were acquired on the axial oblique plane perpendicular to the patella using a turbospin-echo proton density (TSE-PD)SPIR. Each patient underwent one cycle of treatment with hyaluronic acid which consisted of five weekly intra-articular injections of 20 mg/2 ml. MR examinations were performed prior to initiating treatment, immediately after completion of the treatment cycle, three and six months post-treatment. Modification of the lesion was assessed by placing a region-ofinterest (ROI) of 2-3 mm2 within the lesion. Variations were assessed using ANOVA analysis. Results: Fifteen of the sixteen patients (5 men and 11 women; 4 with grade I and 12 with grades II-III) treated reported a remission of pain and return to normal activity. Initial results indicate that in intermediate grade (II-III) lesions the signal intensity increased immediately after and decrease three-six months after treatment. Significant modifications were not observed in patients with closed chondromalacia.

Methods and Materials: 36 candidates for liver surgery had PET/CT with a biphasic contrast-enhanced CT-protocol and SPIO-MRI. 31 patients finally had surgery. Prospective blinded interpretation of SPIO-MRI, PET/CT, CT-part and PET-part of the PET/CT-study was performed. Liver-lesions and suspected extrahepatic tumor were registered. For LM surgical findings including intraoperative ultrasound and histology were the gold standard. Results: 71 LM were identified at surgery. Lesion-sensitivity for detection of LM was 54 %, 66 %, 82 % and 89 % for PET, PET/CT, SPIO-MRI and CT respectively. CT alone was significantly (p < 0.05; McNemar-test) more sensitive than PET and PET/CT. Particularly LM < 1 cm were PET-negative. Four patients had chemotherapy within one month prior to PET/CT; with these patients excluded sensitivity was 61 %, 75 %, 84 % and 86 % for PET, PET/CT, SPIO-MRI and CT respectively. Twelve patients had extra-hepatic disease. PET/CT and CT were positive in ten and seven of these patients respectively. In three patients CT was false-positive for extra-hepatic tumor and PET/CT in one patient. Conclusion: CT alone and SPIO-MRI has higher sensitivity than PET and PET/ CT in detection of individual LM especially for smaller LM.

Methods and Materials: The study group included 168 patients with 292 liver lesions confirmed by histology (n = 138) or follow-up (n = 154). Lesions were divided into: benign lesions treated conservatively (group-A:120 lesions), malignant tumors and benign lesions treated surgically (group-B:172 lesions). MR imaging (1.5-T) consisted of sequences: T2-double-echo-TSE, T2-STIR, T1-GRE and dynamic study. The first part of differentiation protocol-quantitative analysis, based on lesions T2-relaxation times calculated from T2-double-echo TSE sequence, was performed in order to discriminate non-solid (n = 88) from solid tumors (n = 204). Subsequently, all tumors defined as solid underwent qualitative evaluation (based on visual assessment of lesions SI), in order to discriminate benign lesions (FNH, focal fatty infiltration) from other solid tumors. Remaining tumors were defined as group-B lesions. Results: Statistically significant difference between mean T2-relaxation time of solid (84.1 ms) and non-solid lesions (250.5 ms) was noted, allowing diagnosis of solid tumors with sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 93% (at the threshold of 116 ms). 202 lesions were defined as solid (196 true positive,8 false negative,6 false positive results). Qualitative analysis allowed correct characterization of all 7 focal fatty infiltrations and 21 of 24 FNH. Remaining 168 lesions were defined as group-B lesions with sensitivity and specificity of 92% (158 true positive, 14 false negative and 10 false positive diagnoses were noted).

Yu, C. Li, X. Zhang, J. Xiu, Q. Wang; Jinan/CN (ydxzjm@yahoo.com.cn) Purpose: To investigate the clinical significance of the diffusion-weighted imaging of focal malignant hepatic lesions with 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance. Methods and Materials: Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was obtained in a total of 47 cases with focal malignant hepatic lesions including: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocellular carcinoma (CCC) and secondary tumors of liver proved pathologically. The characteristics of the DWI and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of these diseases were analyzed when the b value was 600s/mm 2 . Results: The lesions with hyperintensity, heterogeneity or indistinct rim were in 46, 24, or 21 cases on DWI images respectively. The ADC value of the HCC, CCC or secondary tumors of liver was (145.86 \u00b1 33.97)\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s, (185 \u00b1 53.09)\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s or (212.62 \u00b1 81.72)\u00d710 -3 mm 2 /s respectively. There was a significant difference of the ADC values between in liver tissue and in secondary tumors (t = 3.202, P=0.011), and the ADC values were higher in HCC than that in CCC or in the secondary tumors (P < 0.05).Conclusion: DWI at 3.0 Tesla MR may be used to improve the accuracy in diagnosis of malignant lesions. of oesophageal carcinoma with integrated positron emission tomography: Computed tomography (PET-CT) versus PET with diagnostic CT W.-.

Methods and Materials: 105 consecutive patients underwent an ECG-gated CT angiographic examination of the chest using (a) collimation 64x 0.6 mm; rotation time 0.33 sec; pitch 0.3; (b) 120 kV; 200 mAs; automatic milliamperage modulation. Subjective and objective image quality was evaluated on 3-mm thick scans by consensus between two radiologists. Results: Subjective image quality analysis showed that: (a) graininess was present on 8 examinations (8%), always rated as mild; (b) artefacts due to the pitch value selected in patients with a low heart rate were observed on 22 examinations (20%), with a severity significantly linked to the patient's bradycardia (p < 0.0001). Objective image quality was assessed by measuring the standard deviation of the attenuation of the pixels in a homogeneous region-of-interest within the trachea (15.91 HU) and descending aorta (22.16 HU). Among the studied population, (a) 99 scans (94%) were either completely devoid of artefacts (n = 93) or showing mild artefacts which did not alter their diagnostic value (n = 6); (b) 6 scans (6%) were degraded by artefacts, compromising the reading of the study. The mean DLP of the examinations was 274.34 mGy. cm which is lower than European reference levels for chest CT (500 -650 mGy.cm).

Methods and Materials: 2335 consecutive MSCT scans were evaluated for presence of PE. Arterial enhancement, artefacts, and ability to analyze pulmonary arteries and the heart were assessed as parameters of scan quality. Diastolic right and left ventricular short axes (RV D , LV D ) and the interventricular septal deviation (ISD) were measured in PE-positive patients and echocardiography reports reviewed. Clinical data assessment included cardio-respiratory and other co-morbidities, systemic anticoagulant therapy (ACT) and 30-day outcome. Pre-acute cor pulmonale (CP) and short-term outcome were calculated by logistic regressions and ROC analyses. Results: 90 patients with acute PE were included (36 with clinically suspected PE, 54 with incidental PE). 26 patients had cardio-respiratory co-morbidities. Four patients underwent systemic thrombolysis, 43 anticoagulation in therapeutic doses, 19 in prophylactic doses, and 24 patients no ACT. 15 of 41 patients had echocardiographic evidence of acute CP. 8 patients died within 30 days. The RV D was the best independent predictor of acute CP (p = 0.002, OddsRatio (OR)=9.16, positive-predictive-value (PPV)=0.68, negative-predictive-value (NPV)=1 at 4.49 cm cutoff) and short-term outcome (p = 0.0005, OR=2.82, PPV=0.23, NPV=0.98 at 4.75 cm cutoff). The RV D /LV D ratio had a PPV of 0.85 for CP. Conclusion: RV D and RV D /LV D ratio were suitable to identify patients with acute CP and benign short-term prognosis. Further studies should prospectively address the combined use of CT-morphological and clinical parameters for prediction of patient outcome.B-584 11:06To assess the added value of a prototype computer-aided detection (CAD) system for pulmonary embolism (PE) in contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography (CT) images C.

Striatial radiotracer uptake was assessed visually, abnormal images graded on a 1-4 scale, and correlated clinically. Results: Number/severity of symptoms and sides involved, correlated with degree of deficit at visual assessment. Of 40 atypical presentations, 12/40 suspicious for essential tremor (ET), 10/40 for drug/toxin induced Parkinson's (D/TIP), 6/40 for Parkinson-plus syndrome (PPS) and 12/40 for early PD (without classical triad).

Rogozhyn, Z. Rozhkova, I. Karaban', N. Karaban'; Kiev/UA (SCRDC@svitonline.com) Purpose: From the analysis of 1 H MRS data and their echo-time dependence we propose the quantitative indicators for the characteristics of the brain state in patients with PD. Methods and Materials: Two groups of patients are studied by 1 H MRS with 1.5 T Magnetom Vision (Siemens). The 1 st group (PG) includes 70 patients with PD (48-74y). The 2 nd group (VG) consists of 20 healthy volunteers (50-73y). Spectra are recorded in the temporoparietal cortex (TC), lentiform nucleus (LN), putamen (P) and substantia nigra (SN) with the STEAM method: TR/TE=1500/135, 155, 175, 200, 270 ms. Results: We introduce two indicators: the metabolite content A M as the peak area and the concentration C M =A M /S. We describe the metabolic state in VOI by the triad T*={A Cho , A Cr , A NAA }, where A Cho , A Cr , and A NAA are the peak areas of the signals. For each of the areas we assign three values: 1.2,3, to obtain six spectral configurations: 1* ={1.2,3}, 2* = {2.1,3}, 3* = {1.3,2}, 4* = {3.2,1}, 5* = {3.1,2}, 6* = {2.3,1}. In the VG triads 1* and 2* dominate in all VOI. In the PG the most frequent configurations in TC are 2* and 5* and in LN, P and SN are 5the both groups the shortening of T 2 M and decreasing of C NAA in the PG in LN and in SN are obtained. In the TC the T 2 M values are similar in PG and VG. Conclusion: This study gives a new insight into brain biochemistry in patients with PD.

We audited CRM involvement in rectal cancer patients and the impact of the multidisciplinary team (MDT) on implementing an MR imaging-based pre-operative treatment strategy. Method: A database of consecutive rectal cancer patients treated over 4 years in our network were analysed for MR imaging and histopathology assessment of CRM and MDT meeting treatment decisions. The CRM positive rate of those discussed at MDT versus those not discussed were compared. We re-audited the CRM positive rates one year after introducing a policy of mandatory preoperative MR imaging-based MDT discussion. MDT discussion of MR imaging and implementation of a preoperative treatment strategy results in significantly reduced positive CRM in rectal cancer patients. however, equivocal in 14 sites.

Keogan; Dublin/IE (davidtuite@yahoo.co.uk) Background: With the development of both Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of rectal cancer, the role of MR imaging in local staging has never been more important. Accurate assessment of rectal carcinoma and its relationship to the mesorectal fascia is essential for appropriate patient selection for TME. Tumours that involve the mesorectal fascia are associated with poor outcome. However, if such patients show a response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy improvements in survival are achieved. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients with rectal carcinoma were recruited into the study. All patients had either T3 disease or local lymphadenopathy within the pelvis. Patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Pre and post therapy MR imaging studies were performed. The following parameters were assessed; maximal tumour thickness, distance to circumferential resection margin, position, size, and number of lymph nodes. In addition all lymph nodes were categorized as group1; homogenous and smooth, or Group 2; irregular and/or heterogeneous. All results were correlated with the histopathological findings at the time of surgery in all cases. Tumour regression scores were calculated by assessing the amount of residual tumour as compared with the amount of radiation induced fibrosis. Results and Conclusion: MR imaging proved highly accurate in assessing nodal downstaging post neoadjuvant therapy. There was strong statistical correlation between nodal downstaging and the biological response of the tumour to therapy. MR imaging was not accurate in assessing T-stage downstaging post neoadjuvant therapy.",

Today, ultrafast multidetector CT scanners are readily available and widely utilized in the evaluation of stable patients. Our aim was to assess a justification of the portable chest radiography in stable multiple trauma patients without clinical evidence of chest injury. Methods and Materials: During 2004 109 consecutive stable multiple trauma patients, without clinical evidence of chest injury were admitted to the trauma resuscitation area of Hillel Yaffe Medical Center. Four certified radiologists (GB, BC, AB, and US) retrospectively evaluated and compared portable chest films and chest CT angiographies (CTA) of these patients. We recorded each case when the treatment policy was altered due to the results of either imaging modality. Portable chest radiography in stable multiple trauma patients with blunt mechanism of injury did not change the therapeutic policy in our patients. Based on our results we believe that a current practice of routine portable chest radiography in these patients should be reevaluated.Purpose:To quantify the T1 of lung parenchyma of patients with fibrosis and emphysema measured in the entire lung, and to determine the effect of inspiration and expiration. Methods: Twelve patients with emphysema and 14 with fibrosis underwent MR imaging Investigation of the lung using a SNAPSHOT-FLASH sequence. The acquired series of images were used for calculation of T1 relaxation times. Acquisition was performed both in inspiration and expiration. FEV1, total lung capacity, residual volume and vital capacity and blood gas tests were measured. Results: For the emphysema group, the average T1 value in inspiration was 1034 \u00b1 71 ms. The average of the mean T1 values in expiration was 991 \u00b1 63 ms. The average T1 in expiration was thus 43 ms shorter than in inspiration. This difference was statistically significant (P=0.021). For the patients with fibrosis, the average T1 value in inspiration was 996 \u00b1 103 ms. Compared to that, the average T1 value in expiration was 1282 \u00b1 170 ms. The average T1 in expiration was 286 \u00b1 152 ms longer than in inspiration. measurements of the entire lung parenchyma in patients with emphysema and fibrosis. Furthermore, expiratory measurements showed higher and reverse differences between patient groups compared to inspiratory measurements. Our findings underline the strong but nonuniform influence of the inspirational status during T1 measurements of the lung. Moreover, one unresponsive patient in the PM/MD group developed an important pulmonary fibrosis. Frequency of H-C was found in 6/8 patients with AS (50% associated with GGO), 4/8 in other PM/DM (only 25% associated with GGO). Finally, we observed more lymphadenopathy in AS and more dilation of the esophagus in overlapping than in other syndromes. Conclusion: In our experience GGO in AS is more extensive than in PM/DM, but it usually has a better response to therapy.Purpose:We examined how implementation of a new technique -aspergillus PCR in BAL specimens in immunocompromised patients influenced the dominant radiological appearance of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Methods and Materials: All consecutive immunocompromised patients that underwent BAL for pulmonary complications between 09/1998 and 12/2003 were included in the study. One attending and one resident radiologist retrospectively reviewed chest CTs performed prior to the BAL. CT studies were acquired on 2, 4 and 16-slice scanners. The review of the CT studies was performed without knowledge of clinical background. Final clinical diagnosis was determined by EORTC criteria and clinical results. Aspergillus PCR testing was introduced in our institution in November 2002. We compared the radiological picture of the disease before and after implementation of the aspergillus PCR.Clinical relevance of high resolution multislice spiral-CT of the chest after stem cell transplantation C.

Methods and Materials: In 182 patients, who were investigated in a phase III multicenter trial, 59 FNH were present (13=histopathology; 46=follow-up). MRexamination consisted of T1-and T2w-sequences prior and after bolus-injection of 0.025 mmol Gd-EOB-DTPA (Primovist\u00ae, Schering AG)/kg BW. Morphological appearance and enhancement pattern of FNH was evaluated. CNR of FNH to normal liver parenchyma was calculated. The number of correctly characterized FNH was calculated and compared to spiral-CT. Results: FNH were described as homogenous, round and well-circumscribed lesions. A central scar was identified in 45% of lesions in T1w pre-contrast, in 52% in T2w pre-contrast, and in 60% 20 minutes after injection of Gd-EOB-DTPA. MELD \u2265 15 at the time of OLT was the only significant risk factor for death (RR = 2.67, P =.0066). At the pathological study on the explanted livers, no cases of tumour progression were observed in the early stage HCC patients (n = 53), in whom the 5 year recurrence free survival rate was 75.3%. Tumour downstaging, assessed at pathology, was obtained in 11/22 (50%) patients with intermediate-advanced HCC. The 5 year recurrence free survival rates were 80.8% in the downstaged group (comparable with the early HCC patients, P=.81) and only 18.2% in the non-downstaged group (P=.0004). In fact, among 8 cases (10.5%) of HCC recurrence observed on follow-up, 7 (87.5%) occurred in the non-downstaged patients. Conclusion: TACE is able to delay tumour progression in HCC patients waiting for OLT, with high survival rates.

Zur Nedden; Innsbruck/AT (ferdinand.frauscher@uibk.ac.at) Purpose: We investigated transurethral ultrasonography guided injection of adult autologous stem cells versus transurethral endoscopic injection of collagen in treatment of urinary incontinence in a randomised trial. Methods and Materials: Between September 2002 and October 2004, 42 women and 21 men suffering from urinary stress incontinence (age: 36-84 years)were treated with transurethral ultrasonography guided injections of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts obtained from skeletal muscle biopsies. Fibroblasts were injected into the urethral submucosa, while myoblasts were implanted into the rhabdosphincter. In parallel, 7 men and 21 women (age: 31-84 years) also diagnosed with urinary stress incontinence were treated with standard transurethral endoscopic injections of collagen. Patients were randomly assigned to both groups according to capacity in the cell culture laboratory. A defined incontinence score, urodynamic parameters, quality of life and morphology and function of urethra and rhabdosphincter were evaluated pre-and postoperatively. Results: After a follow-up of 6 to 30 months incontinence was cured in 39 women and 11 men after injection of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts. Mean quality of life score (51.38 preoperatively, 104.06 postoperatively; p-value < 0.001), thickness of urethra and rhabdosphincter (2.103 mm preoperatively, 3.303 mm postoperatively; p-value < 0.001) as well as contractility of the rhabdosphincter (0.56 mm preoperatively, 1.462 mm postoperatively; p-value < 0.001) were improved postoperatively.

Romero G\u00f3mez; Valencia/ES (puchau2@hotmail.com) Purpose: 1. To illustrate the normal anatomy in MR imaging of the perineum. 2.To correlate the perianal fistula classification with MR imaging. Methods and Material: 24 patients underwent pelvic MR imaging (1.5 T) performed with phased-array coil. Images were obtained in the sagittal (T1, T1 + Gd), axial (TSE PD fat sat, high resolution TSE T2, in phase Gr T1 fat sat, T1 + Gd) and coronal (STIR and T1, T1 + Gd) planes. Results: The most frequent cause of perineal fistulae (19), was as a result of infective processes: secondary to surgery (urethral diverticulectomy, hysterectomy, colectomy, vaginal surgery) and to inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions (Crohn's disease). Only in 5 patients were fistulae caused by tumors and radiotherapy (cervix cancer). MR imaging's good contrast and spatial resolution, in conjunction with direct image acquisition in any plane, permit us to identify highsignal intensity tracts in transverse T2-weighted images and coronal STIR, whereas the enhancing sinus tract walls are demonstrated on the T1-weighted fat-sat postgadolinium images. In addition MR imaging is able to evaluate the relationship of fistulas to the levator ani muscle and soft tissue. Conclusion: MR imaging is the diagnostic imaging technique of choice in the study of, surgical planning, follow-up and post treatment evaluation for patients with perianal fistulae.Testicular microlithiasis: A prospective study. Is ultrasound follow-up necessary? L. Siddique, J. Richenberg; Brighton/UK (lisasiddique@yahoo.co.uk) Purpose: Testicular microlithiasis (TML) has been reported to have a high association with testicular cancer. Our aim in this study is to show that following up TML patients with ultrasound on a yearly basis to monitor development of Testicular Cancer is unnecessary. Methods and Materials: In Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, 2656 men were referred for scrotal ultrasound over the period January 2000 to December 2004. Of the 2656 men, 51 had TML. The 51 men were followed up by a single radiologist on a recommended yearly basis. The results were recorded as TML grade at presentation, unilateral or bilateral, any adjunct pathology found on the scan and whether there was any change on follow-up, especially whether any developed testicular cancer. C D E F Results: 51 out of 2656 men (1.92%) had TML on presentation. Their age range at presentation was 15 to 83 years (mean 41 years). The number of ultrasounds performed on each patient ranged from 1 to 8 (mean 3.33). They were followed up between 3 to 76 months (mean 33.29 months). During the time period of follow-up none developed testicular cancer.

Pabus\u00e7u; Manisa/TR (serterselim@gmail.com) Purpose: Testicular microlithiasis (TM) is a rare, usually asymptomatic disease of the testes associated with various genetic anomalies and infertility. The aims of this prospective study are to determine the true prevalence of TM in an asymptomatic population by ultrasound screening and to quantify whether there are any Doppler ultrasonographic (DU) findings specific to TM. Methods and Material: 2179 healthy male volunteers 17-42 years old, were included in the study. A screening scrotal US was performed. All men diagnosed with TM underwent a complete clinical evaluation, physical examinations, determination of tumor markers and scrotal DU. DU was performed for subjects with TM and intratesticular max velocities, min velocities and resistive indices were determined. Scrotal DU was also performed in 50 subjects without TM for a control group. Results: 53 men with TM were identified in the 2179 ultrasound scans, giving an incidence of 2.4% for TM in this asymptomatic population. There were no significant differences regarding the Doppler parameters and spectral examinations between subjects with or without testicular microlithiasis. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the prevalence of testicular microlithiasis on ultrasound screening as 2.2% in 2179 healthy men with a mean age of 24 years. Additionally our study shows there are not any effects on Doppler parameters by microlithiasis in TM.Testis magnetic resonance spectroscopy: Preliminary findingsA.K. Firat, M. Ugras, H.M. Karakas, B.

Methods and Materials: Patients scanned within 72 hours after SAH were included. Patients with aSAH were matched to patients with PMH on clinical condition on admission. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed in eight predefined regions of interest. Differences in CBF values and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. An additional analysis was performed in which patients with aSAH were also matched on amount of cisternal blood and age. Results: We included 11 patients with PMH and 24 patients with aSAH. CBF values were statistically significantly higher in patients with PMH (mean CBF: 72.7) compared to aSAH patients (mean CBF: 65.1); difference of means -7.6 (-1.2 to -14.0). For the additional analysis after matching for amount of blood and age, 11 aSAH patients were included. Again CBF values were statistically significantly higher in patients with PMH than in aSAH patients (mean CBF: 64.9); difference of means: -7.8 (-0.3 to -15.2).

Conclusion: The CBF ratio is an independent predictor for the development of DCI and can contribute to a better identification of patients at high risk for DCI.Temporomesial volume loss after subarachnoid haemorrhage: Quantification by MR imaging volumetry and correlation to neuropsychological test performance P. Bendel, T. Koivisto, T. H\u00e4nninen, M. K\u00f6n\u00f6nen, A. Kolehmainen, R. Vanninen; Kuopio/FI (paula.bendel@kuh.fi) Purpose: Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) leaves many patients with neuropsychological disturbances. Aims of this study were to assess whether: 1. SAH and the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm is followed by volume loss in temporomesial structures (hippocampus, HC, and amygdala, AM), detectable by MR volumetry and 2. The neuropsychological outcome is associated with quantitative temporomesial volume loss.Methods and Materials:MR imaging was performed on 77 patients one year after SAH. The point counting method (EasyMeasure), was used to calculate the HC and AM volumes. A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was used to evaluate the cognitive performance of the subjects. Thirty healthy individuals were imaged as MR imaging controls. Results: In SAH patients, the normalised HC volumes (23.2/21.3, right/left, p = 0.072/0.002) and normalised AM volumes (18.4/18.7, p = 0.012 /0.045) were significantly smaller than in the matched control population. The AM ipsilateral to the ruptured aneurysm was smaller in patients treated surgically (15.7) vs. endovascularly (20.3, p < 0.001). The hippocampal volumes correlated with a visual memory test and several tests of attention, flexibility of mental processing, intellectual ability and psychomotor speed. The volumes of amygdalas did not significantly correlate with neuropsychological test results. Conclusion: In spite of the seemingly good outcome in a majority of our patients, the present study clearly demonstrated neuropsychological impairments and reduced temporomesial volumes one year after SAH. The mechanism of the volume loss may be attributable to cerebral hypoperfusion caused by the initial bleeding, treatment procedure, or secondary vasospasm. A clear correlation was demonstrated between the neuropsychological defects and the reduced temporomesial volumes.Moderators: W.A. Kaiser; Jena/DE R. Sinnatamby; Cambridge/UK B-321 10:30 ! Role of computed tomography laser mammography (CTLM) in the evaluation of breast lesions A. \u00d6zdemir, I. Tun\u00e7bilek, S. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, S. G\u00fcltekin, V. Kahveci, F. Elb\u00fcken; Ankara/TR (aysozd@gazi.edu.tr) Purpose: To assess the value of CTLM in the evaluation of breast lesions, to determine the role of parenchyma type and vascular anatomy on image pattern and to evaluate the impact of bilateral scanning. Methods and Materials: CTLM scans (CTLM Scanner 1020, IMDS Inc, Fl) of 258 breasts in 191 patients were evaluated, including 26 patients with radiologically normal breasts and 165 patients with lesions diagnosed on mammography, US-Color Doppler, and MR imaging (n:179). Two assessments were made by two reviewers, first without, second with knowledge of lesion size, location and BI-RADS category. Results: Lesions (mean lesion size: 16 mm) were categorized as BI-RADS 2-3-4-5 (n:23, 89, 28, and 39); (41 malignant, 138 benign). Interobserver agreements were 95.1% and 99.5% for two CTLM assessments. CTLM findings were compared to histopathology in BI-RADS 4-5, and to follow-up in BI-RADS 3 categories. Sensitivity, specificity, ppv and npv of CTLM for the first and second assessments were 47.5%, 69.8%, 27.5%, and 84.7% and 70%, 82.5%, 49%, and 91.9%, respectively. CTLM finding wasn't in the same quadrant with lesion in 28% of true positive cases. When used as adjunct to the combined radiological modalities, CTLM decreased the specificity (81% vs. 69%) and ppv (61% vs. 50%). Parenchyma type and vascular anatomy were not correlated with the CTLM image pattern. CTLM vascular patterns were asymmetric in 76% of normal breasts. Conclusion: CTLM has currently a limited value in differential diagnosis. Image pattern does not reflect the mammographic density or vascular anatomy, and bilateral scanning isn't helpful.The value of CT-laser-mammography (CTLM) as an adjunct to mammography and ultrasound in the diagnosis of breast cancerD. Fl\u00f6ry 1 , C.C. Riedl 2 , S. Jaromi 1 , M. Fuchsjaeger 1 , C. Reiner 1 , T.H. Helbich 1 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 New York, NY/US (daniel.floery@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: To assess the value of Computed Tomography Laser Mammography (CTLM) as an adjunct to mammography (MG) and ultrasound (US) in the detection of malignant breast lesions. Methods and Materials: In a prospective study, CTLM scans (CTLM scanner Model 1020 by IMDS, Inc. FL), MG and US of 310 patients with 325 breast le-sions were obtained. Histopathological diagnosis (biopsy and/or surgery) was performed in all cases. The CTLM images were read as an adjunct to MG and US. Results: Of 325 lesions, 147 (45.2%) were malignant and 178 (54.8%) benign including 78 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 20 invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), 40 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and nine cancers of other types. CTLM achieved a sensitivity of 65.3% (96/147 true positive) and a specifity of 53.4% (95/178 true negative). Positive and negative predictive value were 53.6%, and 65.1% respectively. Sensitivity, specifity, PPV and NPV were 91.4%, 40.8%, 57.1%, and 87.3% for MG and 66.3%, 52.7%, 53.1%, and 65.0% for US. Conclusion: The present results indicate that CTLM may have potential adjunctive value to MG and US in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Purpose: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) as an adjunct to X-ray-mammography (MX), with the diagnostic accuracy of MX alone. Methods and Materials: In 4 centres (Europe and North America) 77 women with 90 MX-lesions underwent one-view CEDM additionally to MX, using specially modified digital mammography systems. Histology results were available for all lesions detected by MX (68 malignant, 22 benign). 5 radiologists interpreted the images using high resolution softcopy workstations. Confidence of presence (5point scale), probability of cancer (5-point scale) and BI-RADS score (MX images) were evaluated for each lesion. Sensitivity, specificity and ROC curve areas were estimated for each reader and overall. Results: 52/68 (76.5%) malignant lesions enhanced with contrast in CEDM while 9/22 (41%) benign lesions did not. Overall, 12.3% vs. 8.8% of malignant and 18% vs. 11.8% of benign lesions were missed by MX vs. MX+CEDM respectively. The average of sensitivity/specificity values across the readers were 0.83/0.40 for MX alone and 0.84/0.44 for MX[Unsuppor ted Character -Codename &shy;]+CEDM. Individual and overall areas under the ROC curves for MX and MX+CEDM did not differ significantly. Conclusion: CEDM resulted in fewer missed lesions than MX alone. Clinical accuracy did not differ significantly between MX and MX+CEDM. However, different inclusion criteria and examination techniques influenced the results. Further studies including standardized examination techniques and analysis of contrast kinetics are necessary to prove the clinical utility of CEDM. Contrast-enhanced digital mammography versus MR imaging: Initial clinical experience R. Schulz-Wendtland, E. Wenkel, T. Wacker, W. Bautz; Erlangen/DE (ruediger.schulz-wendtland@idr.imed.uni-erlangen.de)Purpose: To investigate the potential of using intravenous contrast material with full-field digital mammography in comparison to MR imaging in the question of multifocality/-centricity at breast cancer. Methods and Materials: 17 women (age 32-58 yrs, median 42 yrs) having abnormalities (BI-RADS 5) (diameter 9-31 mm, median 23 mm) at clinical breast examination, sonography and digital mammography (Novation; Siemens. Exposure parameters: Automatic Exposure Control). For determination of possible multifocality/-centricity, all patients received a contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM). Six sequential images (Senoscan; Fischer Imaging) (same positioning procedure but exposure parameter > 35 kV) of the affected breast were obtained after a contrast agent (Ultravist 370; Schering) was injected. Additionally MR imaging (n = 17) was performed. All suspected lesions (BI-RADS 4/5) were histologically evaluated. Results: In 13/17 patients we found in complementary breast diagnosis as well as in contrast-enhanced digital mammography and MR imaging only one lesion; in 3/17 multifocality only in CEDM and MR imaging; in 1/17 only in MR imaging (multicentric lesion).Conclusion:The results of this preliminary study suggest the possibility that contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM) potentially may be useful in the question of multifocality/-centricity at breast cancer. Further investigations are necessary.Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional power Doppler ultrasound in the characterization of tumor vascularity in solid breast massesW. Moon; Seoul/KR (moonwk@radcom.snu.ac.kr) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic value of 3D power Doppler (PD) US combined with a microbubble contrast agent in characterization of tumor vascularity in solid breast masses. Methods and Materials: Sixty consecutive patients with solid breast masses (mean size, 1.2 cm) visualized by gray-scale US, were evaluated with 2D and 3D PDUS before and after injection of the contrast agent SHU 508 A. Compared to unenhanced 2D PDUS, contrast-enhanced 3D PDUS was useful to demonstrate and characterize tumor vascularity in solid breast masses. Microbubble contrast harmonic ultrasound for differentiating breast tumors: First results M. Jung 1 , R. Kubale 2 , K.-P. Jungius 3 , J. Tacke 1 ; 1 Passau/DE, 2 Pirmasens/DE, 3 Brig/CH (reinhard@kubale.net)Purpose: To investigate whether fibroadenomas and carcinoma can be differentiated by injection of a new contrast agent (Optison). Methods and Materials: 50 patients with 53 impalpable breast tumors (20 fibroadenomas, 33 carcinomas-diameter 4-15 mm) were examined by contrast enhanced ultrasound. Three of the cases had two carcinomas in the same breast. Histological confirmation was obtained in all cases. Ultrasound was performed using a multifrequency linear probe (9-14 MHz). B-mode and tissue harmonic imaging (THI) and power Doppler imaging without and with intravenous contrast administration were employed. Contrast behavior in the tumor was observed for over 20 min. Results: In plain ultrasound, marginal, penetrating or central vessels were found in 24 of 53 lesions (18 carcinomas, 6 fibroadenomas). After contrast size and number of detectable vessels increased. Both in benign (17/20) and malignant tumors (30/33) marginal and/or intratumoral vessels were identified in the early phase. In the late phase a diffuse contrast accumulation was observed in 30 of 33 malignant tumors. No accumulation occurred in benign tumors. For the carcinoma, the sensitivity was 93 % and the specificity 100% in the late phase compared with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 25% the early phase, when all findings were combined.Conclusion: The use of Optison as contrast agent allows the detection of tumor enhancement for up to 20 min. Whereas a differentiation between fibroadenomas and carcinomas is difficult in the early phase, contrast agent is only taken up by carcinomas in the late phase. Benign and malignant breast lesions: Efficacy of real time contrastenhanced US vs magnetic resonance P. Ricci, E. Pagliara, L. Ballesio, V. Cantisani, L. Coletta, R. Passariello; Rome/IT (paolo.ricci@uniroma1.it) Purpose: To assess the efficacy of low mechanical index (MI) real time gray scale contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) in the differentiation of breast lesions in comparison to Magnetic Resonance (MRI). Methods and Material: 100 lesions, previously detected at mammography or conventional US, have been evaluated by means of CEUS and MR imaging. Contrast-enhanced examinations have been performed with a dedicated equipment (Esatune, Esaote, Genoa, Italy), before and after injection of 4.8 mL of SonoVue (Bracco, Milan, Italy). MR imaging has been performed with a 1.5 T equipment (Siemens Vision Plus, Erlangen, Germany) with bilateral dedicated superficial C D E F coil, on T2w STIR and 3D Flash T1w before and 1.2,3.4,5 minutes after the administration of mdc (Gd-DTPA, 1.5 ml/Kg). Wash-in and wash-out curves have been assessed for both procedures. A specific US quantification software (Qontrast, Bracco, Milan, Italy), based on pixel by pixel signal intensity over time, has been used to obtain CEUS-perfusion maps for each lesion. Results: 48 invasive ductal carcinomas, 38 fibroadenomas, 8 fibrocystic dysplasias, 2 mucinous carcinoma, 2 invasive ducto-lobular carcinoma, and 2 phylloides were diagnosed. Contrast-enhanced US patterns correlated well with those provided by MR imaging. According to the different contrast enhancement patterns and the resulting perfusion maps, all the malignant lesions and 42 out 48 benign lesions were correctly diagnosed, with 89.5 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced US seems to be a reliable method to differentiate breast lesions, since it provides typical enhancement patterns. Contrast US perfusion curves well correlate with MR imaging wash in-wash out curves. Methods and Material: 26 cases (one patient had bilateral breast cancer with bilateral axillary lymph nodes enlarged) with locally advanced breast cancer and with clinical palpable axillary lymph nodes underwent dynamic MDCT (Lightspeed 16 slice, GE: 1 scan per second for 100 at the same table position, after 40 ml i.v. contrast injection at 3.5 ml/sec. Semi-automatic calculation of perfusion parameters (Blood flow: BF, blood volume: BV, mean transit time: MTT and permeability surface: PS) was performed. Results were compared with pathology and with Her-2/neu and Ki-67 levels in surgical specimen of the primary tumor. Results: Examined lymph nodes resulted negative in 8 cases and metastatic in 18. Mean values of perfusion parameters in normal and metastatic nodes were respectively: BF 76.18 + 16.09 and 161.6 \u00b1 20.89 ml/sec (p <.001), BV 5.81 \u00b1 1.28 and 9.15 \u00b1 1.54 ml (ns), MTT 6.80 \u00b1 0.79 and 5.49 \u00b1 0.94sec (ns), PS 58.32 \u00b1 33.03 and 25.96 \u00b1 3.81 ml/g/sec (ns). Ki-67 levels in breast cancer, expressing primary tumor activity, was significantly correlated (p <.001) to PS in patients with metastatic nodes. Conclusion: Perfusion CT is an effective tool for predicting the status of axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer. PS may reflect tumor activity.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate 124 I-cG250-based PET/CT scanning in the presurgical diagnosis of clear cell-type renal carcinoma in patients with operable renal masses. Methods and Materials: 15 renal tumors (diameter 1-5 cm) identified by baseline US in 7 patients (3 male and 4 female; age range 43 -78 years; mean age \u00b1 SD, 56 \u00b1 11) were evaluated by dual-phase contrast material-enhanced CT, and by PET/CT scanning performed 2-4 hours and 4-10 days after i.v. infusion of 5mCi/ 10 mg of 124 I-cG250. Dual-phase CT and PET/CT images were evaluated independently and in a blinded fashion by different panels of readers, and all renal tumors which showed malignant features at cross-sectional imaging were surgically resected. Results: Clear cell-type (n = 5) or papillary cell-type carcinomas (n = 2), angiomyolipomas (n = 5), and renal cysts (n = 3) were finally diagnosed according to imaging and surgical findings. A selective uptake of 124 I-cG250 (Standardized Uptake Value > 3) was found in 4/5 (80%) clear cell carcinomas, while all other renal masses did not show any significant uptake. The overall accuracy of 124 I-cG250-based PET/CT scanning in the diagnosis of clear cell phenotype was 93% (14/15). Conclusion: Preliminary results demonstrate that 124 I-cG250 has potential application in the noninvasive diagnosis of clear cell phenotype renal carcinomas. This could provide precise surgical planning in localized tumors by increasing the limits of kidney-sparing surgery, and avoid unnecessary surgery for patients with benign renal masses.FA difference among astrocytomas of different grade at 3.0 T DTI and correlation between FA and tumorous microarchitecture Y.

Methods and Materials: DTI was performed on 14 patients with astrocytoma confirmed histopathologically (5 grade I/II, 4 grade III, 5 grade IV) by using a 3.0 T MR scanner. Postprocessing was done with DTI specific software to gain FA images, and FA values in tumors were recorded. Microvascular density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of tumor tissue were detected by streptavidin peroxidase (S-P) immunohistochemistry. Cd34 was used to explore the MVD as a marker of endothelial cells. The positive expression of VEGF, MVD, and cell density were analysed. Pearson correlation analysis was used. Results: The mean FA value (0.1021 in grade I/II, 0.1708 in grade III, 0.2001 in grade IV) significantly differed among different grade astrocytomas. Positive correlations were observed between FA value and VEGF, MVD, cell density (r = 0.768, P < 0.01; r = 0.868, P < 0.01; r = 0.825, P < 0.01 respectively).Conclusion:The results of this study suggest that FA value in DTI can reveal the microarchitecture of gliomas and may be used as a predictor of grading astrocytomas.Differentiation of human stem cells in high and low malignant xenografts of keratinocyte derived tumorsF.M.A. Kiessling, J.

Bull; Leeds/UK (j.a.bull@leeds.ac.uk)Purpose: Due to a yearly increase on the demands of the breast ultrasound service and subsequent increase in pressure on staff and resources, certain aspects of service provision were analysed. The aim of this audit was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of undertaking bilateral breast ultrasound scans on a specific patient group. Methods and Materials: A retrospective audit of the asymptomatic breast of 100 bilateral breast ultrasound examinations on patients under 35 years was undertaken over a 6 month period. 90% were GP referrals. 10% were referred from non-consultant breast clinicians. The information collated was; patient identification number, referral source, referral reason, further recommendations/management. Results: Ultrasound abnormalities were detected in only 2 cases out of 100 sampled (2%). Case 1: Bilateral cysts. Case 2: Bilateral fibroadenomata. Both were reported as radiologically benign with no further patient management recommended. Conclusion: From the results obtained departmental protocols were amended. Patients presenting under the age of 35 with unilateral breast symptoms having unilateral breast ultrasound only. As a result the efficiency of the department has been enhanced by reducing appointment times and increasing the throughput of patients.Evaluation of solid breast masses by four sonographic technologies and their combinations: Conventional, tissue harmonic, compound and speckle reduction imaging A.

When the elastographic score 3 (central part of the mass stiffer than the peripheral normal tissue) was considered as malignant, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were respectively 90, 81, 70.5, 93.9 and 83.8%. When only masses categorized as Bi-RADS category 3 and 4 were analyzed, the sensitivity of US elastography was 90% (malignancy = scores 3-4-5) with a specificity of 72%. Conclusion: US elastography is a valuable adjunct to increase the specificity of the conventional B-mode, especially in breast masses categorized as Bi-RADS category 3 and 4 by adding new criteria for benignity and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic procedures.Elasticity imaging of 234 breast lesions shows that it could halve biopsy rates of benign lesions W.E.

Lowery 3 ; 1 London/UK, 2 Madison, WI/US, 3 Issaquah, WA/US (w.svensson@imperial.ac.uk)Purpose: To evaluate the potential of real time ultrasound elasticity imaging to alter clinical management and reduce the false positive rate associated with breast ultrasound examinations particularly in the screening situation. Earlier work has shown that elasticity imaging profiles of benign lesions are smaller while malignant lesions are larger than the grayscale appearance. C D E F Methods: Patients attending for routine breast ultrasound for focal breast abnormalities had ultrasound breast strain imaging (implemented on a Siemens Elegra ultrasound scanner) at the end of their ultrasound examination if there was a focal abnormality. The strain images were assessed and correlated with subsequent histology or follow-up. Results: 234 lesions were assessed and correlated with the subsequent diagnosis; 67 cancers, 5 intermediate lesions had an Elasticity to B-mode ratio > 0.75. 162 benign lesions (103 fibroadenomas, 21 cysts, 10 inflammatory masses, 6 intramammary lymph nodes, 6 normal breast, 2 gynaecomastia and 14 other lesions had an Elasticity to B-mode ratio < 0.75. For Cancers and intermediate lesions:-Sensitivity = 100 %, specificity = 51%, negative predictive value = 100%, positive predictive value equals 48%. Conclusion: All lesions with an elasticity to grayscale ratio of less than 0.75 were benign. If a ratio of less than 0.75 was used to determine the necessity for biopsy in the screening situation this would halve the number of biopsies of benign lesions (false positive biopsies). Increasing experience with, and improvements in, elasticity imaging may lead to a further decrease in false positive results than achieved in this study.Role of ultrasonography in detection of wide intraductal component of invasive breast cancer: A prospective studyS. Sundararajan; Tsukuba/JP (sangeethasunder@gmail.com) Purpose: Efficiency of ultrasound (US) in detection of extent and direction of intraductal component in comparison with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathological findings. Patients and Methods: In 59 patients with 60 invasive breast cancers, US features of the intraductal component were classified as (a) ductal dilatation between main tumor and satellite lesion, (b) presence of satellite lesion in the same segment (c) solid ductal dilatation radiating from the tumor. The direction of intraductal component was classified as towards nipple and towards periphery. Criteria for MR imaging are as follows: (a) a satellite lesion around the main tumor, (b) bridging enhancement between main tumor and satellite lesion. The direction of intraductal component was similar to that of US.Results: In 17 of 59 (28.8%) patients, wide intraductal component (15 or > 15 mm) towards nipple and 3 out of 60 (5%) patients, wide intraductal component towards periphery, was proved histopathologically. US and MR imaging could accurately detect wide intraductal component towards nipple in 14 and 8 patients respectively out of 17 patients. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of wide intraductal component towards nipple by US were 82.3%, 90.5% and 88.1%, respectively. Sensitivity for detection of wide intraductal component towards nipple by MR imaging was 47.0%, specificity was 72.9% and accuracy was 71.2%. When the results of both diagnostic methods namely US and MR imaging were combined, sensitivity rose to 93.7%, specificity was 72.1% and accuracy was 80.0%. Conclusion: Ultrasound findings of intraductal extension and its direction correlated well with histological intraductal extension and the direction.Ultrasound elasticity imaging is more accurate than grayscale ultrasound for assessing the extent of invasive breast cancers: Early results of pathological correlation W.E.

Conclusion: The echographical evaluation of the armpit, should be routinely in determining the state of breast cancer, especially in those Medical Centres were Sentinel Lymph Node Technology (S.L.N.B). is used. A \"positive\" axillary echography, even if not accompanied by percutaneous lymph node biopsy, could make S.L.N.B. unnecessary. Conversely, a \"negative\" echography\" would require S.L.N.B to be performed.

Bernathova, M. Duenser, G. Bodner, B. Zelger, W. Jaschke; Innsbruck/AT (maria.bernathova@uibk.ac.at) Purpose: The aim of our study was to assess the negative predictive value of axillary lymph node (LN) sonography in patients with histologically proven breast cancer that underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). Methods and Material: From January 1998 to December 2004 101 patients with histologically proven breast cancer, without any sonographic evidence for metastatic axillary LN involvement, were admitted for SNB. Sonographic criteria for normal or reactive LN were the longitudinal transverse axis ratio less then 2, presence of a normal central echogenic hilum with colour Doppler sonographic mapped hilar vessels, without vessels on the periphery of the LN or asymmetric thickened lymph node cortex. Results: Retrospectively we reviewed the final histological findings and correlated the definitive tumor nodal staging with preliminary sonographic findings. In 30 patients (30%) histology of Sentinel LN showed positive result, with size of involvement varying from 0.2 mm to 16 mm. In 9 patients (from 30) the size was less then 0.2 mm. In one patient a sentinel LN was negative, whereby in axillary level 2 LN were metastatic involved. Only 2 of 71 patients with negative sentinel LN, later developed LN metastasis in higher axillar levels. The negative predictive value of sonography was 0.70. Conclusion: Sonography of the axillary LN has a high negative predictive value for axillary LN involvement in breast cancer. The image resolution is currently the most limiting factor to detect smaller size LN metastasis.Usefulness of contrast-enhanced US in the evaluation of axillary nodes of breast cancer patients J.

Blickman; Nijmegen/NL (J.deRooy@rad.umcn.nl)Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound (US) in the detection of meniscal tears in a selected group of patients with equivocal physical examination, correlated with arthroscopic findings. Methods and Materials: 124 consecutive patients (49 female; 75 male; mean age 44.0 y) with a positive clinical anamnesis for a meniscal tear (49 lateral, 75 medial) but equivocal physical examination, underwent US of the knee. US was performed with a linear array transducer (12-5 MHz) by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist. All patients subsequently underwent arthroscopy. The findings of US and arthroscopy were compared and correlated. Results: US had a sensitivity of 91% for the medial meniscus (95% CI: 0.79-0.97) and 94% (95% CI: 0.79-0.99) for the lateral meniscus. Specificity was re-+PD value of 89 % and a -PD value of 78 % for both menisci. Five out of 7 patients with false negative results had a small tear of the deep medial posterior horn. Seven out of 10 patients with false positive results had other pathologic findings at arthroscopy, including chondropathy of the femoral condyle (5), medial meniscocapsular dehiscence (1) and ACL-tear (1). Conclusion: US seems a promising, inexpensive tool in the pre-operative evaluation of meniscal tears in a selected group of patients with equivocal physical examination.Comparison of US and MR in meniscus degeneration and tearsN. Unlu, H. Ozcan, E. Ustuner, I. Erden; Ankara/TR Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of US in the diagnosis of meniscus degeneration and tears compared to MR imaging and arthroscopy. Methods and Material: Thirty-five patients (ages 19-65) with knee pain and locking were included in the study. After MR imaging and US exams, 22 of the patients were also evaluated with arthroscopy and the results were compared. Then patients were divided into 2 groups according to their ages (\u2264 35 years and > 35 years) and studies were compared using k test. Results: US (n:15) was not as efficient as MR imaging (n:23) in detection of degeneration and the correlation between the two studies was low (k < 0.05) except in the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus where moderate correlation was present (k=0.50-0.75). For tears, the sensitivity and specificity of US were 90.9% and 63.6% and for MR, 93.3% and 100% respectively. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus was the best visualized portion of the meniscus by US while visualization of the main bodies were limited. In the young group, the sensitivity and specificity of US were 80% and 100% compared to 66.7% and 75% in the elder group. Moderate correlation was present between US-MR, and USarthroscopy while MR showed better correlation with arthroscopy. Conclusion: US is not a suitable substitute for MR imaging in the routine diagnostic evaluation of meniscus lesions. However, in selected cases such as young age group, traumatic cases and cases with a contraindication for MR imaging, US may find a role to stratify patients for further evaluation.",

            "text": "Applications of a new upright weight-bearing dedicated MR imaging unit in the evaluation of ligamentous, meniscal and osteochondral disorders of the knee: Preliminary resultsA. Barile, N. Limbucci, S. Carducci, L. Satragno, C. Masciocchi; L'Aquila/IT(antonio.barile@cc.univaq.it)    Purpose: To assess the role of a new upright weight-bearing dedicated MR imaging unit in the evaluation of knee pathology in comparison with conventional supine MR imaging. Methods and Materials: We selected 60 patients (38M, 22 F) with clinical and MR imaging evidence of knee disorders. At standard MR imaging 20 patients had signs of ACL instability (group A), 20 had meniscal lesions (group B) and 20 presented femoro-tibial osteochondral pathology (group C). We only enrolled patients with an isolated disorder. In the same session, after conventional supine MR imaging, patients underwent upright weight-bearing examination with the same dedicated MR imaging unit (G-Scan, Esaote; 0.25T; FOV 25 cm; dedicated DPA knee coil). The conventional examination comprised sagittal SE T1-w, axial SE T2-w and coronal GE T1-w sequences. The upright examination was performed with sagittal and coronal SE T1-w sequences and (in case of osteochondral disorders) coronal GE T1-weighted sequence. We evaluated the differences of knee dynamics between supine and upright imaging in the same patients. Results: In group A and B weight-bearing MR imaging was useful for evidence of instability not visible with conventional MR imaging (stump deflexion, translation of the tibia, widening of meniscal tear). In group C weight-bearing MR imaging allowed the evaluation of signs of overload (thinning of the articular rim and the cartilage). Conclusion: Our preliminary observations allow affirmation that upright weightbearing MR imaging has wide potential for the study of knee stability and dynamic modifications in case of ligamentous, meniscal and osteochondral lesions. C D E F High resolution MR imaging versus conventional MR imaging compared to arthroscopy in patients with a suspected meniscal tear C. Krestan, S. Marlovits, M. Weber, W. Matzek, H. Imhof, S. Trattnig; Vienna/AT (christian.krestan@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of high resolution compared to conventional MR imaging of the knee with arthroscopic findings in patients with a suspected meniscal tear. Methods and Material: Twenty-nine patients (15 female, 14 male) from the department of trauma surgery, with a suspected meniscal tear, were included into the study. MR imaging exams were performed on a 1.0 T MR imaging scanner (T10-NT, Philips Medical Systems, Best Netherlands) with 2 protocols: standard MR imaging using a knee coil consisting of sagittal dual T2 TSE sequence (FOV 200 mm, matrix 512x512, slice 3 mm, TR 2500 ms, TE 11 ms, voxel size 0.39 x 0.39 x 3 mm; and high resolution MR imaging with a dedicated surface coil (FOV 160 mm, matrix 512x512, TR 1200 ms, TE 10 ms, voxel size 0.31x0.31x3 mm). The menisci were independently evaluated by 2 blinded musculoskeletal radiologists on the basis of an adapted score (0=normal, 1=intrameniscal hyperintense signal, 2= discontinuity of the surface, 3= fragmentation). Athroscopy with evaluation of the menisci was performed by an experienced trauma surgeon and documented by videotaping. Results: Fifteen of the 29 patients underwent arthroscopy and all revealed a meniscal tear. The correct diagnosis of a meniscal tear was 80% for the standard MR imaging and 86.7% for the high-resolution MR imaging-exam. The kappavalue between reader 1 and 2 was 0.58 for the standard MR imaging and 0.42 for the high-resolution MR imaging protocol. Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that high resolution MR imaging of the menisci leads to an improved sensitivity for diagnosis of meniscal tears, with an acceptable interobserver agreement.Incidence of meniscal root injuries in patients withnon-displaced tibial plateau fractures J.H. Yun, J.P. Clement, M.A. Bredella, W.E. Palmer, A. Kassarjian; Boston, MA/US (jyun1@partners.org) Purpose: To analyze the incidence of meniscal root injuries in patients with nondisplaced tibial plateau fractures. Methods and Materials: MR studies performed in 2004showing non-displaced tibial plateau fractures were analyzed retrospectively. Patient information including age, sex, mechanism of injury, and surgical correlation was obtained. The presence of meniscal, ligamentous, myotendinous, and cartilaginous injuries was recorded. Attention was given to the presence of meniscal root injury defined as meniscal tear involving the central 1 cm of the posterior meniscal attachment. Results: 21 patients had medial tibial plateau fractures (MTPF), and 11 patients had lateral tibial plateau fractures (LTPF). In female patients with MTPF, 14 of 15 (93%) had medial meniscal injury (MMI), 10 (67%) of which involved the meniscal root, and 2 of 15 (13%) had lateral meniscal injury (LMI). In female patients age > 60 with MTPF, 9 of 9 (100%) had MMI, 7 (78%) of which involved the meniscal root, and 4 of these 9 (44%) had popliteus myotendinous injury. In patients with LTPF, 4 of 11 (36%) had MMI, 1 (9%) of which involved the meniscal root, and 4 of 11 (36%) had LMI. Only 1 of 17 (6%) knee radiographs of patients with MR evidence of non-displaced tibial plateau fractures showed evidence of fracture, while 10 of 17 (59%) showed degenerative changes. Conclusion: Radiographically occult medial tibial plateau fractures, particularly those in older women, have a high incidence of medial meniscal root injury and popliteus myotendinous injury.Sonographic imaging of the posterior cruciate ligament using convex transducer M.P. Dzianach 1 , A. Czwojdzinski 2 ; 1 Poznan/PL, 2 Warsaw -Otwock/PL (marcin.dzianach@sk4.am.poznan.pl) Purpose: To describe the US appearance of entire length of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) using a convex transducer. Methods and Materials: Fifty healthy individuals were examined using ultrasound with a 2-5 or 5-7 MHz convex transducer (100 knees). Thickness of the proximal and distal part of the PCL and the curvature of its bow (PCL index, PCL bowing ratio) were assessed. Echostructure of each part was analyzed. Additionally five studies of fresh amputated knee specimens were performed. Eye visible contrast agent was injected into the regions of origin and insertion of the PCL under US guidance. Then knee was dissected to expose PCL and deposition of contrast inside. Results: In sagittal popliteal view the PCL presents as a hypoechoic bow with sharp margins, mean 4.7 mm thick proximally, mean 5.3 mm distally, mean bowing ratio (PCL index) 4.5. In the distal part anisotropic effect is possible to achieve. Cadaveric studies showed the feasibility of the entire length of PCL in ultrasound evaluation. Conclusion: High resolution sonography is valuable in PCL imaging. Convex probes enable evaluation of the entire length of this ligament.Grading of anterior cruciate ligament graft injury after ligament reconstruction surgery: Diagnostic efficacy of oblique coronal MR imaging of the knee S. Moon, S. Hong, J.-Y. Choi, W. Jun, J.-A. Choi, H. Kang; Seoul/KR (unduk@radiol.snu.ac.kr)Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of additional oblique coronal MR imaging of the knee for the grading of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft after ligament reconstruction surgery. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 43 consecutive MR images of the knee in 41 patients with follow-up arthroscopy. The MR examinations included routine sequences and oblique coronal T2-weighted images, which oriented in parallel to the course of the femoral intercondylar roof. By consensus, four readers evaluated the status of the ACL graft by routine knee MR imaging and then by additional oblique coronal imaging. The severity of the ACL graft injury was graded using a 3-point system from MR images namely normal, suspiciously abnormal, and graft failure, and results were compared with arthroscopic findings. Weighted k statistics were used to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of routine knee MR imaging with and without additional oblique coronal imaging. In each evaluation, observers reported a confidence level for the grade of ACL graft injury in two image groups. Results: The weighted k scores (kws) were 0.481 by routine knee MR imaging only; with additional oblique coronal imaging, the kws increased to 0.618. The mean confidence level was significantly higher (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test) by an additional oblique coronal imaging than by routine knee MR imaging sequences. Conclusion: Additional use of oblique coronal MR imaging of the knee improves both diagnostic accuracy and confidence in the grading of ACL graft injury.US and MR imaging of peroneal intraneural ganglia: Emphasis on the articular branch M.

Pealer 3 ; 1 Palermo/IT, 2 Chicago, IL/US, 3 Pittsburgh, PA/US (gbranca@yahoo.com) Purpose: To assess the natural history of FCF in the cirrhotic liver. Methods and Materials: Two radiologists reviewed 118 CT (obtained before, at 30s and 70s after contrast injection [5 mL/sec]) in 26 patients. Number, location, attenuation and presence of trapped vessels within FCF were evaluated. Size variation was assessed with an arbitrary retraction index obtained by using a standard linear regression analysis with the mixed-effects model. The retraction index was defined as a variation of the ellipsoid volume of FCF over time. A classification and regression tree analysis performed by using the Fisher exact test, was utilized to build the most efficient classification algorithm combining retraction index and time interval. Results: Each radiologist identified 41 FCF. Twenty-eight lesions were located either in segment IV, VII or VIII. Thirty-two lesions were hypoattenuating on NC, 25 were hypoattenuating on HAP and 20 were isoattenuating on PVP. Seven were hyperattenuating on PVP. Trapped vessels were found in six lesions. The retraction index showed overall significant increase over time (r=.423, P= <.0001).",

Britton 3 ; 1 Boston/UK, 2 Hertford/UK, 3 Stoke-upon-trent/UK (mandy.holland@ulh.nhs.uk) Purpose: To establish the feasibility for autonomous sonographer practice, as the radiology lead, in a fast track symptomatic breast clinic, specifically for women under 35 years. Methods and Materials: The level of agreement between sonographer and radiologist was compared in a prospective, double blind, comparative study with inter-observer and intra-observer reliability. Trust ethical and R&D approval were obtained. Data collection was categorical, R1-normal/benign, R2-probably benign, R3-indeterminate, R4-probably malignant and R5-malignant. Comparison was made with the radiologist opinion or histology, where available. Agreement was assessed by descriptive kappa statistical analysis (SPSS). Results: 78 patients were examined from December 2004 to May 2005, age range 14-34 (median = 29) years. 47 were normal, 18 demonstrated aberrance of normal development. 13 biopsies were performed, with pathological correlation. There were 2 disagreements (1) lymphnode R2/fibroadenoma R3 and(2)incidental cyst R2/normal R1. Both of these represented disagreements of categorisation, neither influenced subsequent management. A kappa value of 0.9 was demonstrated between radiologist and sonographer, inter-observer and intra-observer, representing excellent agreement. Conclusion: A sonographer's opinion in a diagnostic breast clinic is equivalent to that of a radiologist, providing an accurate, reliable and effective clinic for patients under 35 years.The study of nosocomial infection and transmission by way of diagnostic imaging facilities in TaiwanC. Lin, Y. Huang; Taichung/TW (jslin@ctc.edu.tw) Purpose: Taiwan was impacted by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. The high percentage of nosocomial infections in Taiwan suggests that infection from hospitalized patients is a major factor in the spread of disease. The study was designed to investigate the epidemiology of nosocomial infections involving radiographic equipment.Methods and Materials:The study was in four parts. The first one was a questionnaire to investigate the cleaning behaviour in different sizes of hospital. The second part was to spray three commonly found bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, onto a radiographic table, cassette, and chest board to investigate the survival rate of each bacterium. The sampling work for the radiographic table, chest board, and cassettes from the out patient department (OPD) and accident and emergency room (A&E) were designed in the third part. The last part was to evaluate the effectiveness of three different cleaning solutions, water, 70% alcohol and 0.05% bleach to bacteria. Results: Cassettes should be labelled for intensive care units use to decrease the potential bacteria transmission rate. Bacteria could be survived between one hour and two weeks, it is recommended that radiographic equipment should be cleaned after use. No significant difference was found between 70% alcohol and 0.05% bleaches (p > 0.05). Conclusion: No evidence suggests radiographic equipment in OPD and A&E is a potential nosocomial transmission source. Despite this, cleaning should be made after each use. In light of convenience, the author recommended that 70% alcohol is useful to clean radiographic equipment surfaces.Dose reduction in skeletal radiography using a flat-panel detector on amorphous selenium: Long term results of radiation dose and image quality T.

Methods and Materials: A qualitative descriptive approach and design was chosen for the study. The method used for collection of and analysis was Critical Incident Technique (CIT). A strategic selection was performed and consisted of 14 radiographers working at hospitals in Sweden. Results: Data analysis resulted in two main categories, Professional Knowledge directly related to patients and Professional Knowledge indirectly related to patients, respectively. Knowledge directly related to patients was subdivided into four categories: to prepare, to support, to show respect and to be vigilant. Knowledge indirectly related to patients was subdivided into four categories; to plan, to assure quality, to handle the radiological image and to collaborate. In both main categories examples of behaviour of positive as well as negative for good patient care occurred. 279 critical incidents were identified. Conclusion: By the results of this study the professional skills and unique knowledge of the radiographer were elucidated, and the importance of solid health care knowledge was emphasized. The study has given insight to the radiographer's nursing role and partially into the role as a medical technician. It also emphasises and clarifies a \"tension\" between the two.Mobile, digital radiography for nursing homes' residents F. Laerum, E. Sager, S. Oswold, J.C. Hellund; Oslo/NO (frode.larum@medisin.uio.no) Purpose: To improve radiology services to nursing home residents. There are three times as many beds in nursing homes as in all Norwegian hospitals combined, each resident has in average more than three chronic diseases and 65% have dementia. Methods and Materials: A prototype combination of Sedecal X-ray equipment with Canon full-format digital detector (total weight 94 kg) was carried around to nursing homes on demand, in a Renault Kangoo car equipped with wheel-chair ramp. The digital radiographic (DR) examinations were performed in the residents' rooms, and cryptated image data either WI-FI uploaded via broad band internet, or brought by CD-ROM, to the radiology department's PACS-network for interpretation and reporting. Questionnaires without patients' identification were returned by the referring physician in 125 out of the first 195 examinations. Results: The DR image quality was assessed to be of satisfactory diagnostic quality. The questionnaires revealed that tentative diagnosis was verified in 58% and invalidated in 42 % of the cases, with consequences to therapy in 85% and nursing in 71%. Because of the residents' serious impairments, 10% had been given no alternative to DR bed-side in their nursing home. 8% had to be hospitalized after the examination, while expensive patient transportation for out-patient radiology examinations, or hospitalization, could be avoided in 90% of cases. Conclusion: After more than 400 examinations to date, DR services have proved better for the residents, less expensive for society, and of good diagnostic quality.CT scanning technique for patients who cannot raise their arms K.

Gallix, J.-M. Bruel; Montpellier/FR (radio-ste-sec@chu-montpellier.fr) Purpose: To determine the feasibility of morphological sequences and dynamic contrasted enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) to study Crohn's disease activity. Methods and Materials: 23 patients were included in this prospective study. Each patient underwent 3 different MR examinations, before treatment, 2 weeks and 6 weeks after. An amount of 57 MR was finally performed. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was administrated orally 45 minutes before performing exam. Using a 1.5 Tesla Philips Gyroscan Intera\u00ae, morphological sequences including T2 SS, BTFE, and T1 WATS after gadolinium injection, was performed in axial and coronal planes. DCE-MRI images were added to these classical sequences with multislice 3D TFE perfusion sequences (TR/TE/FA 3.3, 1.66.10. SL 5 mm, acquisition time: 180 ms. Flow rate 6 cc/s). Results: With the evolution of the MR imaging technology it's now possible to perform in the same exam morphological and DCE-MRI sequences for perfusion evaluation of the bowel wall. The role of the technician in radiology is crucial for patient information and preparation and is directly related to image quality. Filling of the small bowel by oral contrast agent is correlated to the volume of PEG absorbed by the patient. Knowledge in GI tract anatomy and Crohn disease is mandatory for the technician to be able to perform perfusion post treatment analysis. Conclusion: Abdominal MR imaging (morphological and DCE-MRI) is a feasible, reproductive, radiation less and simple technique, very useful in the evaluation and prognosis of Crohn's disease.Human imaging using small-size high temperature superconducting (HTS) tape coil in low-field MRI system Y.W. Wong, E.S. Yang; Hong Kong/HK (ywwong@eee.hku.hk) Purpose: High temperature superconductor (HTS) coil is effective in reducing receiver-coil noise, resulting in substantial SNR improvement for small-size coil/ sample and low-field system (< 1T). A single-turn 60 mm HTS tape receiver coil (8.92 MHz at 0.21T) is first demonstrated. Methods and Materials: A commercially available silver-alloy sheathed Bi ( 2-x) Pb x Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 (Ag/Bi-2223) HTS tape is adopted to fabricate our receiver coil, which possesses the advantages of lower cost and easier fabrication compared to traditional thin film. A new coil holder is designed to resist relatively large recoil force experienced by small-size HTS coil. Inductive coupling is used for frequency tuning and signal pick-up. A custom-made cryogenic system is employed to accommodate our coil in LN 2 . Images are acquired using conventional spin-echo (SE) pulse sequence (TR = 400 ms, TE = 30 ms, NEX = 2, slice thickness = 5 mm, matrix size = 256x256). Results: Images including phantom of saline solution, human hand and wrist are captured in our home-built 0.21T MR imaging system. Results show that the Qfactor of phantom-loaded (0.21T iso-centre) HTS coil at 77K (325.38) is 5 times better than that of an equivalent copper coil at room temperature (64.25). SNR improvement of about 350% is achieved with HTS at 77K (83.1) over conventional copper coil at room temperature (22.9). Previous best result at 0.21T was a gain of 256%. Conclusion: Considering Q-factor of a coil with unchanged dimension is proportional to its resonant frequency, higher SNR is expected in high-field MR imaging system. Potential applications include body parts which are too small for large surface coil.New post-processing strategies for dynamic contrast enhanced MR imaging by combining in-phase and opposed-phase data K.-H. Herrmann, A. Rauscher, W.A. Kaiser, J.R. Reichenbach; Jena/DE (Karl-Heinz.Herrmann@med.uni-jena.de)Purpose: To explore new image contrasts which result from different post-processing combinations of simultaneously acquired complex in-phase (IP) and opposedphase (OP) data in contrast enhanced (CE) dynamic MR imaging by performing simulation and phantom experiments. Methods and Materials: A simple 2-compartment model (water, fat) was analyzed for a single voxel. A phantom containing several compartments with different fractions of water/fat, was simulated and visualized. The effects of different subtractions of the complex data on contrast were investigated. Additionally, a phantom experiment was performed at 1.5 T using a T1-weighted 3D dual-echo gradient-echo sequence. (TR/TE1/TE2/FA=7 ms/2.38 ms/4.76 ms/12\u00b0). A ROI based analysis was used to verify the simulation results. Results: The theoretically expected contrast amplification due to complex data processing, compared to the conventional IP magnitude subtraction (CE minus native), was confirmed in the experiment. Different processing of the dual-echo data makes it possible to directly map the fat content. The phantom measurements verified the simulated contrast gain by a factor of 2 and the possibility of direct fat imaging. A first proof of principle of contrast gain in partially volumed lesions was successfully demonstrated with dynamic breast MR imaging. Conclusion: Acquiring IP and OP data allows new post-processing combinations, which range from generating new image contrasts to significant contrast amplifications of partially volumed lesions. This proposed method can be used for better delineation of lesion boundaries and improved detection of small lesions without relinquishing the conventional IP magnitude subtraction.Towards rapid analysis of diffusion tensor MR imaging D. Goksel, M. Ozkan; Istanbul/TR (gokseld@boun.edu.tr) Purpose: In diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI), each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. In this study, an algorithm in Matlab is developed to analyse DT images. Methods and Materials: The b factor in our study, which gives information about the direction and amplitude of the diffusion gradient, is a 1x7 matrix in form B = [B 0 , Bxx, Byy, Bzz, Bxy, Bxz, Byz]. In our sample, 10 diffusion weighted images and a null image namely the T 2 image creating a set of intensity images of size 256x256x11 is used for the analysis. The relation can be expressed generally; B (n,:) has the information of the intensity image S (:,:,n). Regarding to that and the Stejskal Tanner equation D =[Dxx, Dyy, Dzz, Dxy, Dxz, Dyz]  is calculated in the algorithm. For the validation of the algorithm a set of human cardiac diffusion MR images are used. Results: In this study, algorithm for analyzing the diffusion characteristics is developed. The eigensystem D is calculated in every pixel, apparent diffusion coefficient ADC is represented with respect to D. The other characteristic values of diffusivity namely fractional (FA) and relative (RA) anisotropy, linear (c l ), planar (c p ), and spherical (c s ) anisotropy values are calculated. Conclusion: There are still many drawbacks in the literature on the analysis of DTI especially in neurological disorders. The classification of brain white matter fiber tracking is of great importance. Developing a reliable and rapid tractography tool for the clinical use is the future study of the work in progress.Phase map based simulation of signal dephasing in gradient echo MR imagingA. Rauscher 1 , M. Barth 2 , S. Witoszynskyj 3 , J. Sedlacik 1 , J.R. Reichenbach 1 ; 1 Jena/DE, 2 Nijmegen/NL, 3 Vienna/AT (alexander.rauscher@med.uni-jena.de) Purpose: MR gradient-echo images (e.g. EPI) suffer from signal loss due to intravoxel dephasing caused by field inhomogeneities. We present a phase-image based method to simulate and to investigate intravoxel signal dephasing. Methods and Materials: High-resolution, 3D gradient-echo images were acquired at 1.5 T (TR=42 ms, TE=25 ms, alpha=25\u00b0, FoV=25.6 cm x 19.2 cm x 10.8 cm, matrix=512 x256x72). Additionally, EPI data were acquired for comparison (TR=4s, TE=50 ms, alpha=90\u00b0, FoV=25.6 cm x 25.6 cm, matrix=64x64, 45 slices, thickness = 4 mm). The 3D-phase was unwrapped and divided into large (L) voxels, each consisting of several high resolution (H) voxels (e.g. 8x8x8=512 voxels for a simulated resolution of 4x4x4 mm). Each of the H-voxels within an L-voxel was assigned a magnetization vector (M) with length 1 and precession frequency",

Bravin 1 ; 1 Grenoble/FR, 2 Jena/DE, 3 Chicago 60612, IL/US, 4 Hamburg/DE (coan@esrf.fr)Purpose: Early visualization of damage in cartilage disease is still a challenge for present clinical techniques (MR imaging, CT, and ultrasound). A new technique allowing non-invasive 3D visualization has been successfully applied in vitro on excised human joint specimens. Methods and Materials: Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) has been used for this study. DEI can provide dramatic gains in contrast over conventional radiography by utilizing X-ray refraction and scatter rejection in addition to the absorption of conventional technique. Pathological and healthy human ankles, toes, and femoral joints have been imaged in projection and computed tomographic DEI mode at high resolution (pixel size: 46 micron) and clinical compatible doses (< 10 mGy). Volume rendering and segmentation permitted to visualize cartilage from volumetric CT-scans. Images of the same samples were compared with conventional CT scanners and MR imaging, used as golden standard; histology provided the final diagnosis. Results: In conventional absorptive X-ray examination, cartilage was either invisible in the 5 examined samples, or the cartilage height was not clearly defined. The thickness of the cartilage in histology matched data extracted from DEI images. In one sample, MR imaging did not show the structural damage of cartilage; in all other cases, the cartilage damage was always underestimated. Conclusion: DEI generates images that most closely resemble the appearance of anatomical and histological tissue structures than conventional CT and MR imaging examinations. DEI can provide an unequivocal non-invasive diagnosis of the state of disease of the joint and be considered a new tool in the osteoarthritis research.Dear-mama a photon counting X-ray machine M.

Aim of this study is to verify the inter-and intra-radiograph reproducibility of DXR under consideration of conventional and digital performed radiographs. Methods and Materials: Radiographs of the non-dominant hand from two deceased males were performed according to a predefined study protocol and under constant image capturing conditions (FFD 100 cm, 6 mAs, 42 kV). BMD and MCI were measured by Pronosco-X posure System (Version 2, Sectra, Sweden). For preparing conventional radiographs a Philips Super 80 CP System were used with films of Kodak T-MAT-Plus 200 and Agfa-Curix 200. Digital print-outs were performed using a Diagnost-Philips-Optimus and Siemens-Polydoros SX 80 System. Inter-and intra-radiograph reproducibility of BMD and MCI were calculated. Results: The inter-radiograph reproducibility of BMD using conventional images under standardised conditions showed data with CV=0.49% (Agfa) and CV=0.33% (Kodak), whereas reproducibility using digital images ranged from CV=0.57% (Philips) to CV=1.18% (Siemens). The intra-radiograph reproducibility was observed to be CV=0.13% and CV=0.26% (conventional, Kodak and Agfa) versus CV=0.27% and CV= 0.05% (digital Philips and Siemens). Conclusion: DXR shows a high inter-and intra-radiograph reproducibility for conventional as well as digital images and seems to be a reliable osteogeometrical technique for evaluation of the peripheral cortical bone which approve the quantification of minor disease-related alterations of the cortical bone partition.FDG-PET scanning correlates with tissue markers of poor prognosis and predicts mortality for patients subjected to liver resection for colorectal metastases C.C. Riedl, T. Akhurst, S. Larson, S.F. Stanziale, M. Gonen, S. Tuorto, H. Hricak, Y. Fong, D.S. Klimstra; New York, NY/US (riedlc@mskcc.org)Purpose: To determine whether tumor uptake of FDG correlates with tumor cell expression of Ki67, Glut1, P53 and patient survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Methods and Materials: 90 patients with resectable metastatic colorectal cancer in the liver were subjected to FDG-PET prior to hepatectomy. At surgery, tumors were harvested and prepared for assessment by histology and immunohistochemistry. Expression of Ki67 (proliferation marker), Glut1 (glucose trans-porter) and P53 (cell cycle control protein) were assessed by pathologists blinded to the PET results and the clinical outcome. Patients were followed for three years to determine survival. Results: The 53 patients with standard uptake values (SUV) less than 7 on PET were compared to the 37 patients with SUV greater than 7. SUV correlated with Glut1 (p = 0.03), Ki67 (p = 0.026) and p53 overexpression (p = 0.02). The threeyear survival rate was 42% in patients with SUV > 7 and 74% for those with SUV< 7 (p = 0.007 by log-rank). Conclusion: In resectable colorectal metastases, the strong correlation of SUV with selected tissue biomarkers suggests a biologic link between increasing glucose metabolism, rapid proliferation, and P53 mutation. FDG-PET is a functional imaging technique that can predict prognosis in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.11C-metomidate PET of adrenocortical tumours in correlation with histopathological findingsA.

Weissleder; Boston, MA/US (marion.jantsch@gmx.at)Purpose: PET scanning is increasingly been used to stage various primary malignancies. The purpose of this study was to compare established CT size criterion, used to diagnose metastatic nodal disease, to FDG uptake within nodes in patients undergoing combined PET/CT with 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose for staging of primary malignancies. Methods and Materials: 37 patients (M:F; 10:27) with a mean age of 54 years undergoing combined PET-CT studies were included in the study. Pathological examination of the detected nodes was performed after surgical dissection or biopsy. Of the sampled nodes, 112 could be unequivocally correlated to pathology and were included in the study. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for size criteria and FDG uptake. Results: 54 of 112 nodes were benign and 58 were malignant on pathology. The mean short axis diameter of malignant nodes was 10.5 mm (5-41 mm) and for malignant nodes showing increased FDG uptake 14.1 mm (6-41 mm). Size criteria demonstrated a sensitivity of 62%, a specificity of 78% and accuracy of 69.9%. Quantitative evaluation of FDG uptake within the same nodes demonstrated a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 63% and accuracy of 70.3%. All false negative nodes on PET were less than 10 mm in short axis. Conclusion: PET is limited in detecting malignant lymph nodes smaller than 7 mm. PET imaging demonstrates a lower specificity than size criteria on CT, as non malignant conditions can also cause an increase in nodal FDG uptake. PET has a higher sensitivity than CT as PET is able to detect metastatic disease in borderline sized lymph nodes.Whole-body MR imaging vs. whole-body PET/CT in staging of newly diagnosed malignant melanoma: Initial resultsF.M. Vogt, P. Veit, R. Jablonka, J. Barkhausen, G. Antoch; Essen/DE (florian.vogt@uni-essen.de) Purpose: To assess the accuracy of whole-body MR imaging in comparison with whole-body [ 18 F]-2-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT for staging newly diagnosed malignant melanoma of the skin. Methods and Materials: 31 patients underwent whole-body MR imaging and whole-body PET/CT for staging of lymphnode (N) and distant (M) metastases after resection of the primary tumor. Evaluation was done according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging classification. MR images were evaluated by two radiologists while PET/CT images were read by one radiologist and one nuclear physician. Histology and a mean clinical follow-up of 295 days served as standards of reference. Differences between imaging procedures were tested by McNemar's test. Results: Overall NM stage was correctly determined in 21/31 patients (68%) with MR imaging and in 23/31 patients (74%) with PET/CT (p > 0.05). Assessment of N-stage revealed MR imaging to be accurate in 25/31 (81%) and PET/CT in 28/31 (90%) of the patients (p > 0.05). M stage was correctly diagnosed in 23/ 31 (74%) patients based on MR imaging in comparison with 24/31 (77%) using PET/CT (p > 0.05). Both modalities showed high specificity values of 100% for N-staging and 95% for M-staging. However, sensitivity for N-staging was 50 % using PET/CT, while MR imaging showed a lower sensitivity of 33%. For M-staging sensitivity values were even lower, PET/CT 37.5% and MR imaging 12.5%. Conclusion: A significant number of patients initially staged as N-negative and M-negative with whole-body MR imaging and PET/CT proved to have undetected regional or distant metastases. Thus, short-term follow-up examinations either by whole-body MR imaging or PET/CT seem to be mandatory.Whole-body PET/CT-colonography: Technical feasibility and first clinical experiences of a new method in colorectal cancer staging P.

Methods and Materials: 285 consecutive patients (164 males, 121 females; age range 17-84 years; 153 lung cancer, 112 lymphoma, 20 miscellaneous) referred for PET and separate recent MDCT were included. Patients were retrospectively classified into 4 categories: (I) No pathological uptake on PET; (II) uptake on PET localises lesion; (III) side-by-side evaluation is sufficient to assess localisation of lesions; (IV) side-by-side evaluation of PET and MDCT is not sufficient to assess localisation of lesions. For MDCT evaluation both benign and malignant lesions were analysed and classified. An additional category was set up for unsuspected lesions detected by PET. Results: In 58% lesion localisation was correctly assessed by either conventional PET alone (Group II: 76/208) or side-by-side evaluation of PET and MDCT (Group III: 44/208). In 42% of the patients with pathological FDG-uptake (Group IV), integrated PET-MDCT or software fusion might be beneficial. For 15% of the patients clinical relevant additional information was provided by the MDCT (disseminated small pulmonary lesions, AAA > 5 cm, thrombi, pulmonary emboli). In 7% of the patients unsuspected pathological lesions were detected by PET (majority bone metastasis). Conclusion: MDCT not only improves localisation of PET lesions, but also adds relevant clinical information. PET visualised for the radiologists unsuspected lesions. PET-MDCT images improve diagnostic imaging and a synergy of radiologists and nuclear physicians is becoming indispensable.Recurrent breast cancer: Is there an advantage in re-staging with PET/CT? P. Veit, H. Stergar, T. Beyer, E. Hauth, A. Bockisch, J. Barkhausen, G. Antoch; Essen/DE (patrick.veit@uni-essen.de) Purpose: To compare the value of combined PET/CT, PET+CT viewed side by side, CT alone and PET alone concerning the rTNM stage and influence on therapy in patients with recurrent breast cancer. Methods and Materials: 58 patients with suspicion of recurrent breast cancer underwent whole-body [18 F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT. Images of combined PET/CT, PET+CT, PET alone and CT alone were evaluated by four different reader teams and diagnostic accuracies concerning the rTNM stage and their influence on therapy were compared. Histology and a mean clinical follow-up of 456 days served as the standard of reference. Differences between the staging procedures were tested for statistical significance by McNemar's test.Results: The overall TNM tumor stage was correctly determined in 93% with PET/CT, in 90% with PET+CT, in 79% with PET and in 84% patients with CT alone. PET/CT was more accurate in rTNM staging than PET alone (p < 0.05). No significant differences were detected compared to CT (p = 0.06) or PET+CT. PET/CT changed the therapy in 2 patients compared to PET+CT, in 8 patients compared to PET (statistically significant difference, p < 0.05) and in 5 patients compared to CT (no significant difference). Conclusion: Combined PET/CT proved to be more accurate assessing the rTNM than PET alone with an impact on patient management in patients with recurrent breast cancer. There was a trend to more accurate staging compared to CT alone, though this did not prove to be of statistical significance. Thus, further studies evaluating larger patient populations are needed.18 PET/CT has influence on therapeutic strategy in pancreatic lesionsL.J. Delrue, V. Casneuf, M. Kelles, G. De Meerleer, M.

Schima 1 ; 1 Vienna/AT, 2 Linz/AT (albert.dirisamer@meduniwien.ac.at) Purpose: Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a strong prognostic indicator in several primary malignancies. An early detection is of crucial importance regarding further treatment and patient outcome. In respect to recognized limitations in detection of small lesions with CT and misinterpretation of normal physiological abdominal activity at FDG-PET, our aim was to assess if fused PET/CT offers the combined benefits of anatomical and functional imaging. Methods and Materials: 40 patients with ovarian (n = 28) and colorectal (n = 12) cancer with suspected peritoneal carcinomatosis were reviewed for the presence of peritoneal lesions on FDG-PET/CT scans (Discovery LS, GE Medical Systems). The results were compared with the histological findings. 27 patients had peritoneal metastasis while 13 patients had negative histological findings at laparotomy. Results: FDG-PET was positive in 23/27 patients with 1 false positive (sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 93%). CT was positive in 24 patients without false positive results (sensitivity, 89%, specificity, 100%). PET/CT was positive in 28 patients with 1 false positive (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 93%). Conclusion: Fused PET/CT improves the sensitivity for detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis, especially in small lesions, and offers exact anatomical information regarding surgical treatment.Are intramuscular injections into the buttocks truly intramuscular?

The aim of this cadaveric study was to assess feasibility of detecting small sensory peripheral nerves using high frequency probes. Methods and Materials: We performed ultrasound examinations on two preserved cadaveric specimens (age 75/84 years). We used a 17 MHz broad band linear array with a silicon stand off pad. Small motor and sensory peripheral nerves (accessory nerve, intercostal nerve, superficial radial nerve, digital nerves, cutaneous femoris lateralis, saphen nerve, superficial peroneal nerve, infrapatellar nerve, sural nerve) were sonographically detected and, under ultrasound guidance, a small amount of dye (0.05 ml) was injected close to each nerve and the area was marked on the skin. Following this, anatomical dissection was performed at the area where the dye was injected. Results: All small motor and sensory peripheral nerves have been correctly located by ultrasound. Conclusion: High frequency ultrasound allows visualization of small motor and sensory peripheral nerves.Ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle therapy for epicondylitis management E. LLopis, V. Higueras, P. Ferrer, P. Aparisi; Valencia/ES (ellopis@hospital-ribera.com) Purpose: Lateral epicondylitis is an overuse syndrome, caused by repeated microtrauma to the origin of the common extensor tendon, and the most frequent soft tissue abnormality affecting the elbow joint. The purpose of this study is to introduce and to evaluate the efficacy of a simple ultrasound-guided percutaneous therapy technique. Methods and Materials: Thirty-seven patients (20 men, 17 women, mean age 42 years) were treated with needle tenotomy and peritendinous steroid injection under US-guidance. All patients had previously failed conservative management, 10 patients had undergone blind steroid injections. Preprocedural diagnostic sonographic evaluation was performed and only those with hypoechoic areas or calcifications were included. After subcutaneous anesthesia, a 22G needle was inserted towards the areas that contain scar tissue (hypoechoic and calcified areas) with local anesthesia, using the needle as a tiny surgical instrument with repeated movements, ending with a peritendon steroid injection (40 mg triamcinolone). The entire procedure was performed under sonographic guidance. Two patients required repeated treatment. Results: Thirty-five patients had at least 6 months follow-up, 2 patients were lost to follow-up. Complete symptom relief was reported in 70% of patients, moderate in 19% and 5% failed, requiring surgical treatment. Side effects were: 1 local skin atrophy and 1 vasovagal reaction. No complications from bleeding or infection were observed. The average procedure time was 25 min. Conclusion: Percutaneous needle debridement with ultrasound guidance is a safe, cost-efficient procedure with high rates of therapeutic success. It is an alternative to blind steroid injections, and surgical options remain open.Collateral ligaments of the ankle: Value of multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) of 2D turbo spin-echo (TSE) imagesS.R. Duc, B. Mengiardi, C.W.A. Pfirrmann, J. Hodler, M. Zanetti; Z\u00fcrich/CH (csduc@dplanet.ch)Purpose: To assess the value of multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) of 2D turbo spin-echo (TSE) images for the evaluation of the collateral ligaments of the ankle. Methods and Materials: Coronal and axial T2-weighted TSE and MPRs of 15 asymptomatic ankles were analyzed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Overall visibility, visualization of the entire ligament on one single image, signal intensity and delineation of the ankle ligaments were determined for TSE and MPRs. Reading time for TSE and MPRs was measured. Image quality of the MPRs was graded and correlated with the reformation angle. Results: Visualization of the entire ligament on one single image was significant-ly superior with MPRs when compared to the original 2D TSE images for the tibionavicular (Reader1: p = 0.002, Reader2: p = 0.001) and calcaneofibular (Reader1: p = 0.001, Reader2: p < 0.001) ligaments. The tibionavicular ligament was considered to be better delineated on MPRs by Reader1 (p = 0.031). No statistically significant difference was found for the evaluation of the remaining ligaments and criteria. Image quality of the MPRs was considered to be identical or minimally blurred when compared to the original TSE images in 98% of all evaluated images. Grading of image quality of the MPRs did not significantly correlate with reformation angle (p > 0.05, Spearman's rho). Reading times were 237 (Reader1) and 168 seconds (Reader2) for the TSE images and 362 (Read-er1) and 249 seconds (Reader2) for the MPRs. Conclusion: MPR improves visualization of the collateral ankle ligaments within a reasonable time. The advantages are most pronounced for the tibionavicular and calcaneofibular ligaments with their oblique course.Medial collateral ligament complex of the ankle: MR appearance in asymptomatic subjects on standard ankle MR examination B.

Choi; Seoul/KR (yali75@radiol.snu.ac.kr)Purpose: To evaluate the performance of MDCT in the preoperative T-staging of gallbladder cancer. Methods and Materials: Two abdominal radiologists retrospectively reviewed axial images of two phase MDCT scans (3-mm collimation and 3-mm reconstruction) of 83 patients who had undergone surgical resection or biopsy for gallbladder cancers; and then reviewed axial and multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) images in 31 patients who had MPR images by consensus. The local spread of the disease was evaluated according to the TNM system, and the results were correlated to the pathologic findings. The statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test. Results of the consensus interpretations were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MDCT. Results: The sensitivities of the consensus interpretations of T1, T2, T3, and T4 lesions were 75%, 77.8%, 81.5%, and 100%; specificities were 98.4%, 94.6%, 80.4%, and 98.7%, respectively (P <.05). Overall accuracy was 80.7%. In the 31 patients with MPR images, the combined reading of the axial and MPR images increased diagnostic accuracy of T-staging compared with axial image only. The sensitivities of the consensus interpretations of T1, T2, T3, and T4 lesions on MPR images were 33.3%, 83.3%, 100%, and 100%; specificities were 100%, 79.6%, 89.5%, and 100%, respectively (P <.05).Conclusion:MDCT provided 80.7% accuracy in the diagnosis of the local extent of carcinomas of the gallbladder, showing acceptable sensitivity and specificity. Addition of the MPR images to axial CT data was helpful for the differentiation of T3 from T2 lesion.Homogeneous signal intensity of bile in the gallbladder: A new sign for diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis on MR imagingA.E. Mahfouz, H. Sherif; Doha/QA (mahfouzae@yahoo.com) Purpose: To evaluate difference in signal intensity of the most and least dependent bile within the gallbladder on MR imaging as sign of chronic cholecystitis. Methods and Materials: MR images of 40 patients with pathologically proven chronic cholecystitis (28 calcular and 12 non-calcular) and 50 patients with no history of gallbladder disease and normal ultrasonography were reviewed. Patients were examined by identical MR imaging protocol in supine position after fasting for four hours. The protocol included transverse T2-weighted half-Fourier (HASTE) images (TR/TE 1100 ms/87 ms), T1-weighted GRE images (TR/TE/flip angle of 170 ms/4.8 ms/70\u00ba) before and after fat saturation. The signal intensity of bile was measured at the most and least dependent parts of bile within the gallbladder. Results: Ratio between signal intensity of the most and least dependent bile was1.8 \u00b1 0.46 on fat-saturated T1-weighted images and 0.64 \u00b1 0.07 on T2-weighted images in patients with normal gall bladder versus 1.06 \u00b1 0.07 and 0.96 \u00b1 0.08 on the respective pulse sequences in patients with chronic cholecystitis. Difference between the two groups was statistically significant for both sequences (p <.001). Setting the ratio threshold of 1.15 on fat-saturated T1-weighted images, the sign is diagnostic of chronic cholecystitis with positive predictive value of 88%, negative predictive value of 94%, specificity of 93%, sensitivity of 90%, and accuracy of 91%. Conclusion: Absence of difference in signal intensity between most and least dependent parts of bile within the gallbladder may be useful diagnostic sign of chronic cholecystitis. The sign may reflect poor concentration of bile by the diseased gallbladder wall.Choledocholithiasis: Repetitive thick-slab single-shot projection magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) versus endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)S. Schmidt 1 , E. Gelsie 2 , F. Demarquay 2 , P. Schnyder 1 , P. Chevallier 2 ; 1 Lausanne/CH, 2 Nice/FR Purpose: Prospective comparison of repetitive thick-slab single-shot projection magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) with endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for the detection of choledocholithiasis. Methods and Materials: Fifty-seven consecutive patients (36 women, 21 men, mean age 61) referred for suspected choledocholithiasis underwent MRCP, followed by EUS within 46 hours. Each procedure was performed by different operators unaware of results of the other investigation. MR technique included a turbo spin-echo T2-weighted axial sequence with selective fat saturation and respiratory compensation (SPIR/TSE, TE=70 msec, TR=1600 msecs), followed by twelve coronal dynamic slices of MRCP acquired as respiratory-triggered 40 mm thickslab single shot repetitive projection imaging centered on the common bile duct, especially the sphincterian complex (SSh, TE=900 msec, TE=8000 msec). Results: Common bile duct stones were demonstrated in 18 out of 57 patients (31.6%), confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (n = 17) or intraoperative cholangiography (n = 1). Clinical follow-up served as gold standard in patients with negative results and without following invasive procedure (n = 28). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value for MRCP were 94.9%, 94.4%, 94.7%, 97.4% and 89.5%, respectively. Corresponding values of EUS were 97.4%, 94.4%, 96.5%, 97.4% and 94.4%, not significantly different from MRCP results. Conclusion: Repetitive thick-slab single-shot projection MRCP is an accurate noninvasive imaging modality for suspected choledocholithiasis and should be used increasingly to select those patients who require a subsequent therapeutic procedure, namely ERCP.Area and caliber of the bile ducts and main pancreatic duct in mature subjects using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography Y.

Kim, J. Lee, S. Kim, J. Lee; Seoul/KR Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate criteria for differentiating malignant from benign stricture in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography (MRCP), conventional T1-and T2-weighted images and gadolinium-dimeglumine (Gd-BOPTA)-enhanced three-dimensional dynamic imaging. Methods and Materials: In last three years, 37 patients (19 men and 18 women; mean age, 60.8 years) with biliary stricture in MR were identified from our radiologic and surgical database. All 18 patients with cholangiocarcinoma had pathologic proof after surgery. 19 patients with benign stricture were diagnosed by strict clinical criteria. Two radiologists analyzed MR features by consensus for location, wall thickness, length, asymmetricity, luminal irregularity, gradual or abrupt narrowing, outer margin, signal intensity at T2WI and hyperenhancement relative to liver parenchyma during portal phase at Gd-BOPTA-enhanced dynamic T1WI. MR findings relevant as predictors were identified with Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to determine the most predictable factors. Results: Malignant stricture of bile duct were significantly thicker (6.7 \u00b1 2.8 mm) (P < 0.0001) and longer (27.7 \u00b1 8.1 mm) (P = 0.003) than benign stricture. Hyper-enhancement relative to liver was more frequently seen in malignant cases (17/18, 94%) (P < 0.0001). Luminal irregularity, asymmetricity, indistinct outer margin and high signal intensity at T2WI image relative to liver were significant factors for malignant stricture (P < 0.005). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that hyper-enhancement relative to liver parenchyma and luminal irregularity were the only two variables that independently differentiated malignant from benign strictures. Conclusion: Hyper-enhancement during portal phase at Gd-BOPTA-enhanced dynamic T1-weighted image and luminal irregularity of involved bile duct strongly suggest cholangiocarcinoma.Biliary tract complications following orthotopic liver transplantation: Evaluation with mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP)-enhanced MR cholangiography (MRC) P.

Lee; Seoul/KR (jung @radiol.snu.ac.kr)Purpose: To determine the value and performance of dynamic MR imaging as a supplement to MRCP imaging for the evaluation of tumor extent of hilar cholangiocarcinoma and CBD cancer. Methods and Materials: Twenty four patients with Klatskin tumor or CBD cancer who had undergone operation were included in this study. MR studies included T1-and T2-weighted images, as well as gadolinium-enhanced dynamic images and MRCP images. Two radiologist reviewed MRCP images with source images and MRCP images with non-enhanced T1-and T2-weighted images and gadolinium-enhanced dynamic images. At the all steps, the readers evaluated longitudinal extent of the tumor according to the Bismuth-Corlette type and anatomic location and used a five-point scale to assign a confidence level to their evaluation of involving second branch of both IHD and distal CBD. At the second steps, gadolinium-enhanced dynamic images, the possibility of unresectability were additionally evaluated. Results: The accuracy of longitudinal extent of the tumor was increased at MRCP with enhanced dynamic images (87.5% for MRCP with source images, and 95.8% for MRCP with dynamic images). For the evaluation of involving second branch of both IHD and distal CBD the area under receiver operation characteristic curve was not significant difference between MRCP images interpreted with dynamic images (0.987 for reader 1, 0.926 for reader 2) and MRCP images alone (0.926 for reader1, 0.905 for reader 2).Conclusion: Use of enhanced dynamic images with MRCP images significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of MR examinations of longitudinal extent of the Klatskin tumor and CBD cancer. C D E F Value of MR imaging VIBE sequence in preoperative evaluation of hilar cholangiocarcinoma B. Song, L. Yin, Y. Wu, J. Xu; Chengdu/CN (anicesong@vip.sina.com)Purpose: To investigate the diagnostic value of a spoiled gradient-echo T1-weighted, isotropic 3D MR imaging sequence (volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination, VIBE) in the preoperative evaluation of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Methods and Materials: 27 surgically confirmed patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (11 infiltrating type and 16 nodular type) underwent preoperative MR examination of upper abdomen with a 1.5 T MR unit. Imaging sequences including FSE T2W, 2D GE T1W plain scan, 2D MRCP, Gadolinium-enhanced VIBE (TR/TE=4.2/1.8 msec, 12\u00b0 flip angle, interpolation in three directions, pixel size \u2264 2.0 mm in all dimensions) tri-phasic acquisitions (early, late arterial and portal venous phases), followed by 2D GE T1W scanning at equilibrium phase with 6 mm slice thickness. Imaging data were interpreted by 2 abdominal radiologists through consensus reading. Results: VIBE alone was correct in classifying the morphological types in 26 patients (96.3%, 11 infiltrating and 16 nodular) while combined T2W, 2D T1W plain and enhanced imaging were correct in 17 patients (63%, 7 infiltrating and 10 nodular) and MRCP alone in 14 patients (51.9%, 3 infiltrating, 11 nodular). VIBE was also statistically more accurate in depicting the location, size, extent and relationship with neighboring structures of hilar cholangiocarcinoma than other MR sequences (\u03c1 < 0.05). Conclusion: VIBE is a valuable MR imaging sequence for the preoperative assessment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma and should be included into the MR imaging protocol for such patients.Comparison of dynamic MR swallowing with esophageal manometry and 24h-pH-monitoring in dysphagic patients: First experience C. Kulinna-Cosentini, W. Schima, J. Lenglinger, G. Bischof, A. Ba-Ssalamah, E.P. Cosentini; Vienna/AT (christiane.kulinna-cosentini@meduniwien.ac.at)Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of dynamic MR swallowing of dysphagic patients compared to esophageal manometry and 24h-pH-monitoring as gold standard. Methods and Materials: 27 patients (12 m, 15 f; mean age 47 a) with dysphagia underwent MR swallowing, manometry and 24h-ph-monitoring of the esophagus. MR imaging was performed in supine position with dynamic gradient echo sequences (B-FFE) in three planes in a 1.5 T unit, using buttermilk spiked with gadolinium chelate (40:1) as oral contrast agent. At MR imaging, esophageal bolus transit, gastro-esophageal junction and the presence of reflux during Valsalva maneuver were assessed. 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH-monitoring and manometry with a pneumohydraulic low-compliance system were performed at a median 24 d interval (range 1-32 d) to MR swallowing. Manometric, ph-monitoring and MR imaging recordings were analyzed without information from the other examination. Results: All 27 patients (100%) had abnormal findings in manometry/ph-monitoring. 23 patients (85%) showed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and in 4 patients (15%) a motility disorder was detected. The accuracy of MR imaging in detecting GERD was 78% (18 of 23 patients). MR imaging detected 75% (3 of 4 patients) of motility disorders diagnosed by manometry. The overall accuracy of MR swallowing to make a correct diagnosis was 78%. Conclusion: Dynamic swallowing MR imaging is considered to be a useful complementary tool for noninvasive diagnosis of GERD or motility disorders and warrants further investigations.Swallowing study of gastroesophageal junction with dynamic MR imaging: Preliminary results in healthy volunteersC.Kulinna-Cosentini, W. Schima, E.P. Cosentini; Vienna/AT  (christiane.kulinna-cosentini@meduniwien.ac.at)    Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of dynamic MR imaging for swallowing study of gastroesophageal junction and to assess normal function in healthy volunteers. Methods and Materials: 20 healthy volunteers (mean age 34, 10f:10m) underwent MR swallowing in supine position with dynamic gradient echo sequences(B-FFE)  in three planes at 1.5 T, using a phased-array body coil. As oral contrast agent buttermilk spiked with gadolinium chelate (40:1) for bolus passage was used. We evaluated visualization of esophageal bolus transit, bolus transit time, peristalsis, identification of gastroesophageal junction and Valsalva manoeuvre to provoke potential reflux. Results: Sagittal plane was superior in evaluation of bolus transit, bolus transit time, and potential reflux. Mean esophageal transit time was 8 s. Mean length of visualized esophagus in sagittal plane was 16.2 cm. Axial and coronal view surpassed sagittal view in identification of gastro-esophageal junction. 5 volunteers showed abnormalities like gastroesophageal reflux, axial hernias or non-peristaltic contractions. Conclusion: Dynamic swallowing MR imaging is simple, rapid to perform and well tolerated. It warrants further investigations in patients with gastroesophageal reflux or motility disorders.MR fluoroscopy in the evaluation of esophageal motility disorders: A comparison with barium fluoroscopy and manometry findings V.

Methods and Materials: From March 2004 to July 2005, 20 patients (7 males and 13 females; mean age 35) affected by ALS were evaluated with digital cineradiography. The main aim of the study was the presence of dysphagic disorders with weight loss. All the examinations were performed with radio-controlled equipment provided with a digital C arm. Results: Using cineradiographic technique, it was possible to differentiate patients with disorders of the oral and/or pharyngeal swallowing phase (16/20) from those without swallowing dysfunction (4/20). In 11/16 patients a passage of contrast medium into the upper airways was observed during swallowing, while in 5/ 16 cases an aspiration of contrast medium into the lower airways was recorded. In 12 patients the grade of aspiration was decreased in patients with hyperflexion of the head. Conclusion: The dynamic swallowing study with digital technique allows a clearcut evaluation of the swallowing and to plan a suitable therapeutic approach.Transient small bowel intussusception: An incidental finding on ultrasound M.A. Mateen, S. Saleem, C. Rao, V. Gangadhar, D.N. Reddy; Hyderabad/IN (sheenasaleem@gmail.com) Purpose: To study the ultrasound findings and clinical significance of transient small bowel intussusceptions in adults and children. Methods and Materials: The US findings and clinical outcome of 108 patients of intestinal intussusception diagnosed on US between August 1995 and August 2004 were reviewed. US examinations were performed with a convex transducer of frequency 3.5 to 5 MHz, a linear transducer of frequency 7 to 12 MHz and a transvaginal transducer of frequency 5 to 7.5 MHz.In all cases the length, diameter, wall thickness and color Doppler study of the bowel segment involved in intussusception were evaluated. Subsequent follow-up scans were performed at 30 minutes, three days and two weeks. Patients were clinically followed up for six months. Results: 41 patients were diagnosed as transient small bowel intussusception. 36 intussusceptions were incidentally detected during US performed for some unrelated disease or vague abdominal symptom. Two patients had two adjacent intussusceptions. All the 36 intussusceptions showed spontaneous reduction and would have gone undetected had it not been for the US performed at that particular time. Five patients presented with signs of obstruction at the time of the initial US diagnosis; however the intussusceptions resolved without any treatment and were not detected on follow-up scans. 67 symptomatic patients required surgical intervention. Conclusion: Incidentally detected, small bowel intussusceptions without an identifiable pathological lead point, with a normal wall thickness, a length of less than 3.5 cm, normal non-dilated proximal bowel and normal vascularity on color Doppler reduce spontaneously and are of no clinical significance.Functional cine MR imaging for the assessment of the colonic transit time:A pilot study S.

Molloy; Glasgow/UK (mrianjenkins@hotmail.com)Purpose: Female faecal incontinence (FI), in many cases, is the result of external anal sphincter (EAS) injury secondary to childbirth. Assessment of the anal sphincter aims to confirm the presence of EAS defect as this may be surgically correctable, however, few studies attempt to predict EAS function by global assessment of endosonography features, in addition to visible defects. Methods and Materials: Prospective study of 100 consecutive women with FI. All underwent endosonography (EUS) and manometry studies. Symptom severity assessed using Wexner score. Multiple endosonographic features of the EAS were assessed and recorded and correlated with EAS function, [determined by Maximum Squeeze Pressure (MSP)]. Features recorded were sphincter bulk, quality, definition, thickness (single/multi-quadrantic), perineal body thickness (PBT) and defect characteristics (angle, edges, scarring, length). A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. Results: Median Wexner score was 18 (IQR 15-21). All defects were anterior. 46 had low MSP (< 100 cmH 2 0), 19 had low normal MSP (100-120).A mid-to-distal defect had a reduced MSP [median 85 (IQR 65-103)] compared mid-canal defect [119 (IQR 75-155)](p = 0.006). EAS quality: uniform echogenicity [median 125 (IQR 123-155)]; mixed echogenicity [93 (IQR 69-121)] (p = 0.006): EAS thickness was correlated with MSP with one quadrant assessment (p = 0.019), multiquadrant mean (2, 3 or 4) assessment was not significant. Definition, bulk, PBT, number of visible defects and defect angle were not significant. Conclusion: Anal endosonography can potentially be more useful when supplementary features are assessed. In addition to confirmation of the presence of a defect, endosonography potentially predicts functional status of the external sphincter.

Molloy; Glasgow/UK (mrianjenkins@hotmail.com)Purpose: Faecal incontinence (FI) is a significant problem that can affect a person's life-style. True prevalence of FI is probably underestimated owing to potential embarrassment of the affected individual. FI is believed to predominantly affect women with child-birth related trauma. However, some studies suggest that men are equally affected, particularly with advancing age. However, male FI has re-sequence was comparable to MSCT (> 90%) while sensitivity and PPV with the HASTE sequence were slightly inferior.Morphological features and clinical feasibility of thoracic duct detection with 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance D.

Friedrich, F. Weidinger, T. Postel, A. Mallouhi, M. Frick,  H. Alber, O. Pachinger, D. zur Nedden; Innsbruck/AT  (Gudrun.Feuchtner@uibk.ac.at)    Purpose: To evaluate whether different coronary plaque types as assessed with 16-multidetector computed tomography (16-MDCT) are correlated with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Methods and Materials: 63 consecutive unselected patients who underwent 16-MDCT coronary angiography (Sensation 16\u2122, Siemens) (16 x 0.75 mm, 0.42 s, TF=6.7 mm/s; 120 kV, 500 mAs; 100 ml Iodixanol (Visipaque\u2122, Amersham), flow 3-4.5 ml/s; eff.sl.1 mm, inc.0.5;retrospective ECG-gating) were retrospectively analysed. Coronary plaques were defined as type 1=calcifying (C); type 2=mixed (C > non-calcifying (N)); type 3=mixed (N > C); type 4=non-calcifying (prox. segments). All patients underwent cardiac catheterization (CAG).17 patients had intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS). ACS was defined as Troponin T elevation, ECG-abnormalities, chest pain. Results: A total of 58 patients had coronary plaques as detected with 16-MDCT (predominant plaque type 1 [n = 12]; type 2 [n = 10]; type 3 [n = 16]; type 4 [n = 14]). The presence of a non-calcifying plaque component (type 2-4)(40/63) was strongly correlated with an ACS [n = 17](p < 0.0001; Fisher's-exact-test). Mixed plaque type 3 was significantly correlated with ACS (p = 0.01). Mixed plaque type 2 (p = 1) and plaque type 4 (p = 0.09) were not related to ACS. 16-MDCT correctly classified plaque types in 15 of 17 patients when compared with ICUS. 45 of 63 pa-C D E F tients had at least one coronary stenosis > 50% on CAG (Sensitivity of 16-MDCT: 98% (43/45); specificity 90%; NPV 97%; PPV 97%). 15 of 17 patients with ACS had coronary artery disease (coronary anomaly [n = 1]; acute myocarditis [n = 1]). Conclusion: Non-calcifying coronary plaques as detected with 16-MDCT are correlated to ACS suggesting higher plaque vulnerability. 16-MDCT may have the potential to identify high-risk patients who may be treated more aggressively and in whom close clinical follow-up is mandatory.Influence of cardiac hemodynamic parameters on coronary artery opacification with 64-slice CT L.

Maraschi; Milano/IT (pibionde@tin.it)Purpose: To restore glottic competence after paralysis and soft tissue defects, endoscopic vocal fold injection or open surgery are available. Fat is the ideal implant: it is soft, easily available and biocompatible. Histological evaluation and imaging studies show contradictory results about survival rate of fat grafts. Methods and Materials: We prospectively evaluated long term survival of injected fat with CT and MR imaging.10 patients (aged 40-76 years, mean 62) with breathy dysphonia secondary to laryngeal hemiplegia(7), bilateral scarring(2), and right cordectomy (1), who underwent vocal cord lipoinjection were evaluated with CT and MR imaging, 10-28 months post-operatively. A 4-slice multirow CT and a 1.5 Tesla MR imaging unit were used. Imaging was performed without contrast, with contiguous 2.5 mm thick transaxial CT slices and spin-echo T1 and T2 weighted 1.5-4 mm thick transaxial and coronal MR imaging slices. All patients underwent clinical evaluation with maximum phonation time (MPT) measurements, GRBAS perceptual evaluations, and Voice Handicap Index (VHI) self-assessments. Results: CT/MRI showed persistence of the fat implants in all examined cases. In 6/7 cases CT and MR imaging equally well displayed the injected fat. In 1 case of bilateral injection the fat was displayed only in one vocal cord. There was good correlation between the amount of cordal fat demonstrated by CT/MRI and clinical evaluation. Conclusion: Lipoinjection proved to be a valuable technique for voice rehabilitation in glottic incompetence. Imaging studies showed that fat cells survive transplantation into the vocal muscle for up to 28 months with good correlation between clinical outcome and imaging results.Can the response to radiofrequency ablation of hepatocarcinoma be adequately measured by means of contrast-enhanced US and dynamic MR imaging?A.

Heath 2 ; 1 Garran/AU, 2 Hamilton/NZ (rathan67@hotmail.com) Purpose: To establish the accuracy of 'Simplify' D dimer assay and Hamilton score for diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Methods: 453 patients who presented to emergency department with suspected first episode of lower limb DVT were prospectively recruited from 2001 to 2003. A previously established pre test probability score (Hamilton Score), 'Simplify' D dimer and a complete, single lower limb compression ultrasound examination were performed in all patients. All patients with a negative ultrasound examination were followed up for 3 months. Results: Of the 227 patients with a negative 'Simplify' D dimer assay, 214 patients had negative ultrasound examinations and 13 patients had isolated calf DVT. Among the 226 patients with a positive D dimer assay, 74 patients had DVT and 152 patients had negative ultrasound examinations for DVT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 85.1% (95% CI 75.8 -91.8%), 58.5% (95% CI 53.4 -63.5%), 32.7% (95% CI 26.6 -38.9%) and 94.3% (95% CI 90.4 -96.9%), respectively. 165 patients had an unlikely Hamilton score and a negative D dimer assay. The negative predictive value of 'Simplify' D dimer in an unlikely Hamilton score population was 98.8% (95% CI 95.7-99.8%). Conclusion: A negative Simplify D dimer and unlikely probability Hamilton score exclude DVT and lower limb ultrasound examinations are unnecessary in these patients. 25% of cost related to DVT ultrasound imaging can be saved by applying this diagnostic strategy.Evaluation of the deep venous system after orthopedic arthroplasty with multidetector row CT: A prospective study in comparison withDoppler sonography J.

In these patients, either the etiology (32/50) or the site and localization (18/50) of the lesion was unclear. A total of 50 MR imaging examinations were performed (1 shoulder/axilla, 2 upper arms, 26 elbows including the forearm, 21 wrists including the hand). Two radiologists reviewed all MR images with regard to nerve, muscle, and other soft-tissues abnormalities. A panel of a radiologist, a hand surgeon and a neurologist reviewed all clinical records. The correlation of clinical and radiological findings, and the impact of MR imaging on therapy were assessed. Cohen's kappa and Spearman's (p) rank correlation test were calculated. Results: A total of 17 neurogenic tumors, 20 compressive nerve lesions, and 10 cases of focal or multifocal neuritis were detected. In 13 of the 18 patients (72%), MR imaging demonstrated exactly the site and location of the neuropathy. MR imaging revealed the etiology in 27 of the 32 patients (84%). Cohen's kappa was 0.73 to 1.0 and p was 0.78 to 0.94. The impact on therapy was \"major\" in 29, \"remarkable\" in 18, and \"no impact\" in 3 patients.",

A comparison of ultrasound and radiological findings is presented. Methods and Materials: Thirty-seven consecutive females (age, range) with functionality impairment of posterior pelvic floor were enrolled after clinical evaluation. Exclusion criteria were age under 18 and previous history of vulvectomy. They underwent colpocistodefecography (DF) and dynamic endovaginal US examination (Siemens Antares). Recto-anal angle was measured during \"squeeze\" maneuver to evaluate the strength of voluntary musculature contraction and during straining to assess pelvic floor descent. Images were blindly evaluated by two radiologists experienced in pelvic disorders and the interobserver agreement was also calculated. The same measuring reference lines were obtained for each group of examinations. Results: No statistical differences were observed between colpocistodefecography and dynamic ultrasound measurement during the \"squeeze\" maneuver (p = 0.09) and during straining (p = 0.59). Presence of intussusception was blindly evaluated with a 94.5% agreement between ultrasound and defecography. Moreover US study allowed measurements of internal and external sphincters: sphincter thickness and degree of clinically evaluated faecal incontinence showed good correlation. Conclusion: We propose dynamic endovaginal ultrasound as a simple, non-invasive way to assess recto-anal angle functionality, allowing in the same time the evaluation of the thickness and integrity of the sphinterial complex whereas DF can provide only functional information. together with colpocistodefecography, anatomic evaluation of the perineal body in diagnostic evaluation of pelvic floor diseases.

HASTE MR imaging (TR=800 ms, FOV=420x420 mm, matrix=256x256, slice thickness = 5 mm) was acquired at both end-inspiratory and end-expiratory breathhold using parallel acquisition techniques (GRAPPA, 64 reference lines) with acceleration factors ranging between 2 and 4. Depending on the acceleration factor, a minimal TE between 26 ms (PAT=2) and 16 ms (PAT=4) was achieved. The image quality of pulmonary and extrapulmonary anatomical structures and noise level was evaluated. Results: All images were of diagnostic quality. Using an acceleration factor of 4 image blurring was substantially reduced compared to lower acceleration factors resulting in sharp delineation of intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary structures. Expiratory scans provided a higher intrapulmonary signal intensity than inspiratory scans. As visually assessed, loss of signal to noise did not impair image quality even at acceleration factors of 4. Conclusion: HASTE MR imaging of the lung is feasible at 3 T. The use of high parallel imaging acceleration factors allows shorter echo times and reduces image blurring. Due to optimised multi-element coil geometry, sufficient signal-tonoise can be achieved despite high acceleration factors. Expiratory scanning may be favourable to compensate for susceptibility associated signal loss of the lung at 3 T.",

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictivevalue (PPV, NPV) for all lesions were calculated for each sequence. Results: The 3D-GRE sequence showed a sensitivity greater than 90% for all readers in nodules greater than 5 mm in diameter which was comparable to CT. In lesions smaller than 5 mm the sensitivity and PPV declined below 70%. The HASTE sequence showed a sensitivity greater than 86% in nodules over 5 mm.

RFA was indicated due to inoperability or due to high probability of complete renal failure after surgical enucleation of the tumor. If tumor-diameter was larger than 3 cm arterial embolization was performed prior to RFA to reduce heat sink effect and risk of bleeding. RFA was performed under CT-fluoroscopy using analgosedation and local anaesthesia. Follow-up examinations were after 6 and 12 weeks, then every three months using CT or MR imaging. Definition of success was lack of contrast enhancement and shrinking of the treated area. Results: Targeting of RCC using CT fluoroscopy was feasible in all patients. Within the follow-up period no major complication or tumor relapse occurred. In one patient a second RCC after was detected and treated with second RF ablation. None of the patients developed renal failure needing hemodialysis. In one of the patients bleeding into pararenal tissue was noticed, which stopped spontaneously. Conclusion: RFA for inoperable RCC in a solitary kidney is a very effective therapeutic option due to the small complication rate, no deterioration of the renal function and excellent tumor control. Purpose: Safety margins are a prerequisite to avoid local tumor recurrence after RF ablation of liver tumors. The aim was to determine the prognostic value of a volumetric necrosis/tumor quotient.

Bargellini, C. Della Pina, V. Consoli, C. Bartolozzi; Pisa/IT (lcrocetti@libero.it)Purpose: To determine the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation of osteoid osteoma (OO) with a multitined expandable electrode. Methods and Materials: Eleven patients (male, age 14-58 years, median age 22 years) with single OO were enrolled in a prospective, single center, single-arm clinical trial. Diagnosis was obtained by clinical and imaging findings in 10 patients and by CT-guided biopsy in 1 patient. CT-guided RF ablation was performed under conscious sedation by using a 150-200-W generator and expandable multitined electrode (RITA Medical Systems, Mountain View, CA). Follow-up period ranged 3-22 months (mean 12 months \u00b1 7) and included MR examinations and clinical visits performed 6 months after the procedure and at 12-month intervals thereafter. Results: RF ablation was technically feasible in all 11 patients (technical success 100%) without need of surgical access. No major complications occurredin particular, no skin burns were observed. Prompt pain relief and complete ablation of the nidus, as shown by 6-month MR, was achieved in 10 of 11 osteomas (primary effectiveness rate 91%). In one patient, recurrence of pain and persistent contrast uptake of the nidus at MR were present. The OO was effectively retreated by means of RF ablation. No recurrences were observed on follow-up. Conclusion: Percutaneous CT-guided RF ablation of OO performed with a multitined expandable electrode yields high effectiveness rates and has a favourable safety profile.Purpose: The aim of our study was to determine the efficacy of RFA in the treatment of osteoid osteoma regarding complication rate and duration of pain relief. Methods and Materials: Within 42 months, 22 patients (12 male, 10 female, age 9 to 45 years) suffering from osteoid osteoma (OO) were treated. In 8 of 22 patients the OO were localized in the lumbar (5 of 8) or thoracic spine (3 of 8), whereas the other OO were located in the femur (5 of 14), the acetabulum (2 of 14) or other long bones (radius, tibia). In children RFA was performed using general anaesthesia, in adults analgo-sedation and local anaesthesia was preferred. Ablation periods of 5 to 8 minutes at a temperature of 90 o C were used. Cooling of the skin was performed in osteoid osteoma next to the skin (tibia, radius) and an additional needle was inserted to do saline flushing if the OO was next to neural structures (spine). Primary success rate, complications, disease-free interval and follow-up time were evaluated. Results: Within the observation period (3-42 months) all of our patients were successfully treated and had no more complaints. After the first ablation 19 of 22 patients were free of pain, while in 3 patients the ablation was repeated to obtain complete response. No major complications occurred. In 2 patients minor complications (1 hematoma, 1 first degree skin burn) were observed. Conclusion: Radiofrequency ablation is a highly effective, efficient, minimally invasive and safe method of treating osteoid osteoma.

For lesions above 10 cm, treatment protocols in many centres advocate TACE alone. However, we are finding that the combination of TACE followed immediately by RFA for lesions above 10 cm has favorable outcomes. Repeat sessions of combined TACE and RFA are usually performed for these lesions at 3-6 week intervals, depending on the appearance of the lesion at follow-up, correlated with tumour markers. Results: Overall, results are extremely favorable. For large lesions, a regime of multiple sessions of chemoembolization and RFA yields good results with complete tumour eradication in many lesions, even those > 13 cm in diameter. Complication rates are low and post-procedure recovery is usually uneventful. Conclusion: Multiple sessions of TACE followed by RFA yield encouraging results for large hepatomas.

Bockisch, H. K\u00fchl; Essen/DE (gerald.antoch@uni-essen.de)Purpose: Rim-like contrast enhancement on morphologic imaging and increased tracer uptake on FDG-PET may hamper differentiation of residual tumor from regenerative tissue following radiofrequency ablation (RF-ablation). The purpose of this study is to assess the typical appearance of normal liver tissue following RF-ablation when imaged with FDG-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging. Methods and Materials: Two lesions of 3 cm each were created by RF-ablation in normal liver parenchyma of 21 fully anesthesized mini-pigs. Post-interventional follow-up was performed by FDG-PET/CT as well as contrast-enhanced (CE) MR imaging and CE CT. Imaging was performed 1 day, 3 days, 10 days, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-intervention. All imaging procedures were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for areas of increased contrast enhancement and re-gions of elevated tracer uptake. Imaging findings were compared with histopathology. Results: One day following RF-ablation no increase in FDG uptake was visible while elevated contrast enhancement was noticed in the periphery of the necrosis with all morphologic imaging procedures. However, on further follow-up, an area of rim-like increase of FDG-uptake was detected surrounding the necrosis with PET/CT. Both, increased glucose metabolism as well as elevated contrast enhancement were detectable qualitatively and quantitatively for 6 months postintervention. Histology showed an hemorrhagic border converting into a regeneration capsule. Conclusion: FDG-PET and PET/CT may be of benefit over morphologic imaging procedures when assessing patients following RF-ablation for residual tumor, if performed within one day of intervention. Follow-up at a later time will be limited by visualization of peripheral hyperperfusion and tissue regeneration on functional and morphologic data sets.",

Methods and Materials: Twenty six ablation zones were created in seven pigs with five different regimens: Group A, RFA with 6 mL of 36% HS preinjection; group B, wet RFA with infusion of 14.6% HS at 1 mL/min; group C, dry RFA; group D, 6 mL of 36% HS injection; group E, 12 mL of 14.6% HS infusion. RF energy was applied to the liver for 12 minutes using a 200 W generator and a cooled-wet electrode. The dimensions of the ablation zones and delivered energy during RFA were then compared between the groups. Results: The mean delivered energy was higher in group B (104.6 kJ) than in group A (97.2 kJ), which was higher than in group C (49.5 kJ) (p < 0.05).

Main/DE, 2 Regensburg/DE (t.vogl@em.uni-frankfurt.de)Purpose: To evaluate a novel technique of MR-guided galvano-therapy (MR-GG) (electro-chemical therapy (ECT)) for the treatment of prostate cancer in a phase-III trial. Methods and Materials: Thirty three patients with histologically proven prostate cancer were prospectively treated with MR-guided galvano-therapy. After transgluteal puncturing of the prostate, under local anesthesia two MR compatible electrodes were positioned under MR guidance in the periphery of the right and left lobes of the prostate. The patients were treated three times at a weekly time interval. A total of 350 Coulomb was applied to the localized cancer and the prostate gland. Follow-up was performed after three, six and twelve months, respectively, using laboratory data (PSA) and endorectal MR imaging. Results: All patients tolerated the MR-GG well without any major side effects. Twelve of the thirty three patients had some reversible urinating problems. In the follow-up MR evaluation 12 months post therapy twenty four (72.7%) of the patients were classified as \"stable\" with a constant lesion size. In five patients (15.2%) MR imaging showed a homogenization of the neoplastic area, in two patients (6%) we found a size reduction of 30%, and two patients (6%) presented an increase in size of 20% and 30%, respectively. The PSA values showed a decrease in the twelve-month control from an average PSA of 13.5 ng/ml to 5.3 ng/ ml, which is equivalent to a reduction of 60.8% and statistically significant (p > 0.01). Conclusion: MR-guided galvano-therapy possibly results in local control of limited prostatic carcinoma with a concomitant reduction in the PSA value.Results: Both telemetrically and wire based obtained ASP measurements showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) after generating a type I endoleak. For a fluid filled aneurysm sac the exemplary results are averaged over all investigated sizes and positions. With WPS systolic ASP shown as the percentage of IAP increased from 10.1 \u00b1 1.1 to 72.4 \u00b1 1.5 (TPS: 14.6 \u00b1 4.2 to 77.0 \u00b1 2.2), diastolic ASP from 13.6 \u00b1 2.2 to 111.7 \u00b1 3.0 (TPS: 17.3 \u00b1 7.5 to 113.8 \u00b1 4.6), mean ASP from 11.6 \u00b1 1.5 to 93.6 \u00b1 0.7 (TPS: 16.2 \u00b1 5.8 to 98.8 \u00b1 4.5) respectively. Conclusion: Type I endoleaks of all investigated sizes cause an increase in ASP, high enough to be telemetrically detected at all investigated positions even in a thrombosed aneurysm sac. Therefore a telemetric pressure sensor might be integrated into the EVAR procedure and become a routinely used device for follow-up.",

Baseline patient demographic data, pre-and post-procedural renal function (CrCl: creatinine clearance), incidence of renal artery (steno-obstructive disease) and procedure-related (proximal type-I endoleak and migration rates) complications, detected on post-operative surveillance performed with CT-angiography (1, 3, 6 and 12 months) were collected and compared. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of demographic data and pre-operative risk factors. Proximal neck length was significantly shorter in group A (2.14 \u00b1 0.84) than in group B (3.41 \u00b1 1.21). CrCl decreased during the follow-up period in both groups (Group A: 64.24 ml/min to 60.66 ml/min; Group B: 72.41 ml/min to 68.73 ml/min) without statistically significant differences in terms of rate of CrCl decrease during the follow-up period as well as renal artery and procedure-related complications.

Primary and follow-up images were reviewed by two observers for changes of the aneurysm sac diameter, of the periaortic fibrosis (PAF), of potential renal impairment and the procedure related and long term complications. Results: EVAR was successfully completed in all patients. 5 patients had a minimum follow-up period of 36 months (median 65 months). The maximum diameter of their aneurysm sac decreased from median 57 mm (47-95) to median 45 mm (36-60), resulting in a median relative regression of 21.1% (4.8-63.1). PAF regressed in all of these patients, prior hydronephrosis was present in two patients, remaining unchanged in one of them and disappearing in the other one. In two patients a type 3 endoleak was detected and overstented during the follow-up period. Conclusion: EVAR of IAA excludes the aneurysm and seems to reduce the size of the aneurysm sac and the extent of PAF with an acceptable peri-interventional and long term morbidity.

The procedure can be accomplished with acceptable initial morbidity and mortality when compared to surgery. However long term follow-up is essential to monitor the durability of these devices. Purpose: To evaluate the optimal technique for first pass renal perfusion imaging at 1.5 T. Methods and Materials: 15 healthy male volunteers (25-38 years) underwent a prospective intra-individual comparison study of renal perfusion measurement on a 1.5 T MR-scanner (Avanto, Siemens). Each volunteer underwent three exams on three different days with three different sequences after administration of 7 ml Gd-BOPTA (MultiHance\u00ae, Bracco-Altana Pharma): Saturation-recovery (SR) turboFLASH without parallel imaging (TFl), SR-trueFISP (TFi) and SR-turbo-FLASH with parallel imaging (TFl-PI). The temporal resolution of the sequences was 4 slices/s (TFl, TFi) and 6 slices/s (TFl-PI). Field of view (450x373 mm\u00b2) and matrix (192x134) were kept constant for all sequences. Evaluation comprised the semiquantitative assessment of first pass perfusion parameters mean transit time (MTT), time to peak signal intensity (TTP), maximal upslope (MUS) and maximal signal intensity (MSI). In addition the baseline and peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were assessed as well as the image quality which was rated by two radiologists in consensus. Purpose: Magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging (MR-DWI) is useful to assess proton motion by computation of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). This property could be used to assess renal damage, with special regard to unilateral dysfunction. The aim of this study is to estimate the correlation between ADC and stage of chronic renal failure. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (mean age 51.6 years, range 38-66 years) underwent MR examination on a 1.5 T system; in 10 cases there was a history of hypertension, in 3 diabetes, in 3 obstructive uropathy, Takayasu's disease and nephrovascular hypertension respectively. Four subjects without known renal pathology were used as a normal reference. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessed by Cockroft-Gault's equation was used as a functional marker. Imaging protocol consisted of the following sequences: Fast-field echo T1-weighted, TSE T2-weighted and Single-Shot DWI echo-planar sequence (b-value 600 sec/mm2), with application of SENSitivity encoding factor of 2, by using a four channel phasedarray body coil.

A good correlation was found between GFR and ADC (r = 0.76; p < 0.01), with no significant modification after furosemide administration. Purpose: Evaluation of a new standardized ultrasound (US)technique for diagnosis of acute rejection of kidney grafts. Methods and Materials: 22 kidney recipients underwent US examination following administration of 1.6 ml US contrast medium (USCM, SonoVue\u2122) 6 days after transplantation. The examinations were performed on an Aplio US system (Toshiba\u2122). The difference in time from the first increase in signal intensity between the renal artery and renal cortex was determined. Subsequently the temporal course of contrast enhancement in the area of the renal artery following the first peak was recorded over 10 sec and depicted in color using a Windowsbased software. The resulting color-time images were evaluated by three readers who rated the images on an analogue scale from 1 (normal) to 5 (abnormal). Results: Twelve of the 22 patients had an uneventful clinical course. US demonstrated rapid inflow of the USCM into the renal cortex. The calculated time difference was 1.0 \u00b1 0.4 s. The score assigned to the parametric images was 1.7 \u00b1 0.8. Eight of the 22 patients received a biopsy and showed histologically proven rejection. The time difference in this group was twice as high as in the normal group (2.2 \u00b1 0.7 s, p < 0.05). The scores were in the abnormal range (3.7 \u00b1 1.6, p < 0.05). Two patients with perirenal hematoma also showed high scores, without rejection. Conclusion: Acute rejection and perirenal hematoma are associated with a delayed signal increase in the renal cortex. This information can be provided with a single image with standardized color display of the temporal course of USCM inflow. Results: Both methods demonstrated the same small arterial branches of the circle of Willis. Besides the first order branches, e. g. frontopolar a., callosomarginal a. and pericallosal a., also second and third order branches, paracentral a. and medial frontal branches, were seen. The PCMRAs exhibited a better background subtraction compared to the TOF sequence. In comparison to clinical 1.5 T/3 T images, unenhanced MRA of the brain at 7T provides superior vessel contrast and conspicuity. Ultrahigh field MRAs demonstrate higher order branches with smaller calibers than conventional MRAs. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of both TOF and PCMRA of the brain in a whole body 7T MR scanner with improved arterial contrast and vessel conspicuity compared to lower clinical field strengths.",

Reichenbach 1 ; 1 Jena/DE, 2 Vienna/AT, 3 Nijmegen/NL (andreas.deistung@web.de) Purpose: SWI visualizes small cerebral veins and susceptibility differences by combining magnitude and phase information. Prior to using phase images in SWI, phase-wraps have to be eliminated. This study investigated the effects of different phase-unwrapping algorithms and phase-masks (weighting functions). Additionally, a technique for visualizing the whole SWI data over maximum intensity projection (MIP) was tested. Methods and Materials: High-resolution 3D scans were acquired with a velocity-compensated gradient-echo sequence (TR/TE/FA = 67 ms/40-50 ms/25\u00b0) on a 1.5 T scanner (Vision, Siemens, Germany). Different filter sizes for homodyne filtering (2D and 3D) were analyzed in 6 healthy volunteers. The results were compared with venograms created using a region-growing phase-unwrapping algorithm in image-space. Corrected phase information was weighted with different functions and multiplied with the magnitude. For the MIP data were masked and inverted. Results: The conspicuity of vessels depended critically on the quality of phaseunwrapping. Good results were obtained with filter sizes of 25% for 2D and 50% of each k-space dimension for 3D. With homodyne filtering there exists a tradeoff between CNR and phase-wrap suppression in regions with field inhomogeneities. For transverse slices the optimum weighting function maps negative phases between zero and one and sets positive phases to one. The MIP visualizes venous vessels well, whereas tissue is suppressed. Conclusion: Optimized homodyne filters provide a robust method for SWI data processing, whereas in regions with field inhomogeneities phase-unwrapping by region-growing yields superior results. Performing a MIP of SWI data allows visualization of the vessel network similar to other angiographic methods.",

Luccichenti, A. Cherubini, P. P\u00e9ran, C. Barba, R. Formisano, U. Sabatini; Rome/IT (g.luccichenti@email.it) Purpose: To develop a method for assessing functional plasticity of white matter in patients with post-traumatic head injury. Methods and Materials: Six right-handed patients with post traumatic head injury involving motor pathways with hemiparesis mostly recovered after six months from trauma, underwent the following MR protocol using a 3 T scanner: 1) fMRI right and left hand finger tapping using a standard block acquisition design; 2) DTI with the following parameters: 52 images with 1x1x2 mm 3 voxel size in axial plane, NEX=16, b=0 and b=1000 s/mm 2 in 12 directions; 3) 3D FLASH (1x1x1 mm 3 voxel) and PD-T2 3 mm-thick images. The same protocol was performed in six age-matched right-handed healthy volunteers. Diffusion and fractional anisotropy maps were generated from DTI acquisition. Conventional fiber tracking reconstructions of pyramidal motor pathways were generated. Probabilistic connectivity maps of pyramidal motor pathways were generated using cortical activation obtained from finger tapping fMRI as seed point. Results: In all patients, conventional fiber tracking algorithms showed structural integrity of pyramidal motor pathways, that were in all cases close but not involved by post-traumatic lesions. Finger tapping of the hand contralateral to the side of the lesion showed bilateral activation, while connectivity maps generated from these active cortical areas showed increased probability of connection with pyramidal pathway contralateral to the side of the lesion (omolateral to finger tapping) through the corpus callosum. Conclusion: Probabilistic quantification of connectivity of brain areas may potentially allow the assessment of white matter plasticity, representing a powerful tool for understanding mechanisms of recovery and response to therapy.",

Tang; Shanghai/CN (liyuan5714@163.com) Purpose: Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) accounts for a significant portion of primary intra-axial lesions in cases of traumatic brain injury. In this study we want to use diffusion-weighted MR imaging to characterize DAI in the setting of acute and subacute traumatic brain injury. Methods and Materials: Nineteen patients (13 men and 6 women) ranging in age from 26 to 63 years were examined with conventional MR imaging (including fast T2-weighted, FLAIR) as well as diffusion-weighted MR imaging at 1 to 18 days after closed head trauma. According to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), 14 patients suffered from severe head injury (GCS < 8) and 5 patients had moderate head injury (GCS 9-12). Lesions were characterized as DAI on the basis of their location and their appearance on conventional MR images. Trace apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were computed off-line with the diffusion-weighted and base-line images. Areas of increased signal were identified on the diffusionweighted images, and regions of interests were used to obtain trace ADC values. Results: In the nineteen patients studied, lesions were located in the cerebral hemispheric gray-white matter interface and subcortical white matter (14 cases), body and splenium of corpus callosum (3 cases), basal ganglia (1 csaes), dorsolateral aspect of brainstem (1 case) and isotropic diffusion-weighted images showed areas of increased signal with correspondingly decreased ADC. In one case, decreased ADC was seen 18 days after the initial event. Conclusion: Decreased ADC can be demonstrated in patients with DAI in the acute setting and may persist into the subacute period, beyond that described for cytotoxic edema in ischemia.

Radiologists identified abnormal density spots on 3 mm slice transverse images and marked foci in a felt-tip pen. Surgeons enucleated tumors with a 1 cm margin from marking. We considered the margin as positive when foci existed within 5 mm from margin. We evaluated a rate of positive margin, distance between foci and margin, and block number and axis of positive foci. Results: Of the 12 cases, 5 (42%) had a positive margin. Mean + SD of distance between margin and foci were 19 + 13 mm. The number of positive block was within two in all margin-positive cases. Of 9 foci in margin-positive cases, mean + SD of distance between margin and foci was 4.4 + 1.1 mm. Six of 9 positivemargin foci (67%) existed on an axis from nipple to focus center. Conclusion: Since more than half of positive foci existed on the nipple-focus axis and mean distance between margin and foci was 4.4 mm, improvement of the results would be expected if transverse images are examined in more detail and the surgical margin is slightly elongated. Purpose: To assess a potential clip displacement of two biopsy marker clips following stereotactic 11-gauge vacuum assisted breast biopsy (VABB). Conclusion: Doppler sonography is time consuming and operator-dependent in the detection of DVT. In this study, the diagnostic ability of CTV was comparable to that of Doppler sonography and beam-hardening artifact due to arthroplasty did not become a serious problem. Therefore, CTV is a promising alternative modality in the evaluation of post-arthroplasty patients. Methods and Materials: Forty-seven consecutive patients (18 men, 29 women; mean age, 50.8 years; range, 13-76 years) confirmed as having acute DVT on CT underwent follow-up CT at least 2 months later. Mean duration of follow-up CT was 10. 6 months (range 2-42 months). Localization and extent of primary DVT on initial CT, intraluminal residual thrombi, decreased caliber, luminal obliteration, intravenous fibrotic bands, ipsilateral muscular enlargement, and ipsilateral subcutaneous edema on follow-up CT were assessed retrospectively by two radiologists in consensus. Frequencies of residual thrombi, decreased caliber, luminal obliteration, and fibrotic bands were calculated on each affected venous segment; iliac, femoral, popliteal, and calf vein. Results: Nine patients (19.1%) were completely normal on follow-up CT. Thirtyeight patients (80.9%) showed abnormal findings on follow-up CT; intraluminal residual thrombi (n = 7, 18.4%), fibrotic bands (n = 23, 60.5%), decreased caliber (n = 16, 42.1%), luminal obliteration (n = 16, 42.1%), ipsilateral muscular enlargement (n = 28, 73.7%), and ipsilateral subcutaneous edema (n = 7, 18.4%).

Methods and Materials: 17 UE 16-channel MDCT venograms were performed for either vascular mapping (N=6), occlusive disease (N=5), failing hemodialysis access (N=3), trauma (N=2), or vasculitis (N=1). Slice thickness (1.25 mm), reconstruction interval (0.8), and table speed (55 mm/sec) were identical. Images were acquired 60 seconds following the arrival of ionic contrast medium (concentration 350 mgI/ml; volume 90-140 ml; rate 3-5 cc/sec) to the aortic arch. For each UE, enhancement values were recorded in 8 regions (SVC, brachiocephalic, subclavian, axillary, brachial, upper cephalic, median cubital, and forearm deep veins) resulting in a total of 136 analyzed venous segments. All studies were reviewed by two radiologists for qualitative enhancement (0-4 scale). Results: 96% (N=130) of the vascular segments were well depicted and of diagnostic image quality (mean 3.25). Segments deemed to have poor enhancement (N=6) had attenuation values of < 90 HU (mean 1.2). The mean venous attenuation value across all segments was 137 HU \u00b1 23 SD (92-182, 95% CI). Central veins (N=51, mean 147 HU) yielded 13% greater enhancement (p = 0.005) than peripheral veins (N=85, mean 130 HU). Within the central venous segments, 100% had values above 95 HU (range 103-195 HU) and 90%(N=46) achieved values \u2265 115 HU.

Au; Singapore/SG (dnrgohps@nus.edu.sg) Purpose: To assess the impact of gadolinium MR venography on the management of patients with haemodialysis-related thoracic venous disease. Methods and Materials: Retrospective study of 44 consecutive patients with suspected haemodialysis related thoracic venous disease presenting with head or arm swelling, failure of AV fistula or dialysis line placement, or history of multiple central lines was performed over 20 consecutive months. MR imaging findings, results of subsequent interventional procedures, and medical records were reviewed. Scans were performed on a GE or Siemens 1.5 T MR system, with fast SPGR or FLASH sequences, an injection system for triggered gadolinium delivery, and multiphasic image acquisition. Post-processing with image subtraction, and both maximum intensity and 3D volumetric projections from different angles of view was used. Results: 21 female and 23 male patients with end stage renal disease, between 17 to 80 years old were evaluated. Multiple stenotic and occlusive lesions were demonstrated, most commonly involving the right internal jugular vein (23). 18 patients had subsequent interventional procedures -9 had venography confirming mediastinal venous stenosis with 5 successful venoplasty and stenting, and the other 9 had dialysis catheter venous access successfully via the non affected intenal jugular vein (7) or subclavian vein (2). MR findings were also used in 23 patients to plan AV fistula creation or revision, and in 9 to refer for peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion: Gadolinium MR venography is a useful non-invasive investigation which has significant impact for optimising the management of patients with thoracic venous disease. Purpose: To evaluate anatomic structures of patients with idiopathic subclavian vein thrombosis (SVT) compared to healthy controls and to evaluate a potential correlation between clinical provocative tests and the results of MR imaging (MRI). Methods and Materials: Both thoracic outlets of 29 consecutive patients with idiopathic SVT and 29 healthy controls were investigated by MR imaging with the arms alongside the body, patients were additionally imaged after a postural maneuver. We performed analyses of the costoclavicular and the interscalene spaces and evaluated the thoracic outlets for the presence of aberrant muscles. Results: Asymmetric interscalene spaces were not related to the presence of SVT. We detected an aberrant muscle, the musculus subclavius posticus, in four shoulders of patients, three of them symptomatic. In the remaining patients and in all controls no anatomical variant was detected. The minimum costoclavicular distance (MCD) of patients was significantly smaller than in controls (P < 0.001). The thickness of the subclavius muscle did not differ between patients and controls. The fat surrounding the subclavian vessels had a significant influence on the MCD, because patients with less fat exhibited a smaller MCD. The results of clinical provocative tests were not significantly related to any measurement or any anatomical structure determined by MR imaging and exhibited a sensitivity of about 60% for detection of arm sides with SVT. Conclusion: A smaller MCD was the only anatomical finding in patients with spontaneous SVT. Clinical evaluation including provocative tests had a low sensitivity and did not correlate with anatomical conditions evaluated by MR imaging.",

Nijran, A. Al-Nahhas; London/UK (dr_asin@yahoo.co.uk) Purpose: Lymphoscintigraphy is used in the evaluation of lower extremity lymphoedema. We evaluated the role of visual grading using a Summed Lymphatic Score (SLS) and measure of tracer clearance from injection sites in the interpretation of lymphoscintigrams. Methods and Materials: 99m Tc-albumin nanocolloid lymphoscintigraphy was performed in 13 patients (7 males, 6 females; age range 18-74) for 26 lower extremities (21 oedematous and 5 non-oedematous). Clinical records were reviewed for all patients. Images were acquired at 30 and 120 minutes using a Siemens E.",
