Cardiotoxicity as a consequence of anthracyclines and chest radiotherapy continues to be relevant in the modern treatment era. Mitoxantrone has emerged as an important treatment-related risk factor and evidence on traditional cardiovascular risk factors in childhood cancer survivors is accumulating. International surveillance guidelines have been developed with the aim to detect and manage cardiac diseases early and prevent symptomatic disease. There is growing interest in risk prediction models to individualize prevention and surveillance. This State-of-the-Art Review summarizes literature from a systematic PubMed search focused on cardiac diseases after treatment for childhood cancer. Here, we discuss the prevalence, risk factors, prevention, risk prediction, and surveillance of cardiac diseases in survivors of childhood cancer. (J Am Coll Cardiol CardioOnc 2020;2:363-78)",

Based on questionnaires concerning long-term CCS, the reported cumulative incidence is 4.8% by 45 years of age (17) . These results confirmed earlier reports that anthracyclines and chest RT are strongly associated with heart failure (21) . Recently, it has been shown that even low-to-moderate chest RT doses increase the risk of heart failure substantially (22, 23) . In the Dutch LATER (Late Effects After Childhood Cancer) cohort, Feijen et al.

Myocardial fibrosis caused by chest RT may contribute to the occurrence of arrhythmias. Other frequently used cancer agents for pediatric cancers such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may also be associated with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (41, 42) . Prolonged QTc interval, which has arrhythmogenic potential, has been shown in CCS who received anthracyclines with and without chest RT (43, 44) . Also, rhythm disturbances such as premature ectopic beats and atrioventricular blocks have been reported in CCS (45) (46) (47) . The literature on ECG abnormalities in large cohorts of long-term CCS is sparse (46, 47) , Data on the use of ambulatory ECG monitoring to define the prevalence of brady-and tachyarrhythmias induced by cardiotoxic cancer treatments are needed, but must be carefully weighed against the potential patient burden and clinical significance.",

Cardiovascular risk factors were present in approximately 10% of the CCS at the age of 35 years and were strong predictors of heart failure and ischemic heart disease. Although the discrimination of the prediction models improved with the addition of cardiovascular risk factors, the C statistics were modest for both events ranging from 0.69 to 0.79 in the derivation cohort with successful replication in the other one-half of the cohort. Both the heart failure and the ischemic heart disease predictions models showed good calibration. A small, very-highrisk group was identified with cumulative incidences of heart failure or ischemic heart disease of w10% at age 50 years; survivors in this very-high-risk group may benefit from more frequent surveillance and/or early interventions to modify their risk.",

These data support the hypothesis that cisplatin induces direct endothelial toxic effects resulting in increased stress kinase signaling and a propensity for thrombosis via reduction in the capacity for endogenous fibrinolysis.",

In conjunction with the current findings, one would conclude that the common denominator is platinum drugs and that there is no gender-related difference. Furthermore, one would conclude that platinum drugs seemingly induce relatively acute changes in endothelial cells that translate into a reduction in flow-mediated vasodilation and alterations in nitric oxide bioavailability. Interestingly, a prior study in testicular cancer survivors showed that those patients who were exposed to cisplatin-based chemotherapy nearly 3 to more than 20 years ago had a more severe reduction in FMD and higher levels of circulating endothelial cells than those not exposed (13) . The fact that cisplatin levels are detectable even nearly 30 years from therapy supports the theory of long-term exposure and endothelial injury (14) . A difference in vascular reactivity between cisplatin-exposed and cisplatin-nonexposed was not seen in the current study by Cameron et al. (10) . It is important, however, to realize that the vascular response was blunted in both groups, even in comparison with patients with metabolic syndrome (considered to account for the vascular outcomes in testicular cancer survivors as mentioned) (15) . Such results can also not be unequivocally attributed to hypogonadism (16, 17) . (3) (4) (5) (6) . In patients that survive beyond 5 years, mortality rates are 4 to 9 times higher than the general population, corresponding with a 30% shorter life expectancy regardless of age at transplantation (7) . The incidence of heart failure (HF) has been reported to be between 5.6% to 10.8%",

As observed in previous studies (16, 23) , body mass at the time of sacrifice was lower (\u00c012%) in the group administered with DOXO ( Table 1) . Lower body mass with DOXO was associated with lower heart, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and epididymal white adipose tissue mass, food consumption (\u00c017%), and water intake (\u00c026%) ( Table 1 ). There were no significant differences in the mass of other tissues and organs (Supplemental Table 1 ). We first sought to establish that total ROS bioactivity was increased in HUVECs exposed to plasma from DOXO-treated mice compared with sham control mice. To do so, we assessed total cellular ROS using the CellROX fluorescent probe (Thermo Fisher [Waltham, Massachusetts]; catalog# C10422) and found that ROS bioactivity was greater in HUVECs incubated with plasma from DOXO-treated mice compared with sham control mice (p < 0.001) ( Figures 4A and 4E ).",

Most of the present MACE cases were not associated with a decrease in EF from baseline, which is consistent with previous studies (18, 21) , suggesting that relying solely on EF in ICI-treated patients with MACE may be limited for the detection of iRCs. TnI was observed to be mildly elevated at the time of MACE.

We observed an increase in NLR in patients who experi- However, ICI treatment can result in immune-related adverse events (irAEs) targeting any organ. Cardiovascular irAEs, particularly myocarditis, have received considerable attention due to their potentially fatal outcome (3, 4) . ICI were initially tested and approved as single therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma, a cancer type that historically had few treatment options and poor survival (5) . Later, these therapies were tested in patients with lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma (6, 7) . In the latter studies, ICI were tested either in combination with or following exposure to classic chemotherapies or targeted therapies. As a result, there was a growing need to define the cardiovascular sequelae in lung cancer patients treated with ICI, where the cardiovascular risk was complicated by exposure to cardiotoxic nonimmune-based cancer therapies and a high prevalence of conventional cardiovascular risk factors (8) .",

Our patient was initially treated with amiodarone, then started on a beta-blocker. In the case described by Tomcs\u00e1nyi et al.

Amiodarone was thereafter discontinued due to pulmonary toxicity, and discontinuation led to the recurrence of VT. Sotalol was found to be ineffective, as were Class I antiarrhythmic agents (9) . As ibrutinib is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), caution must be exercised when used in combination with amiodarone and the calcium-channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, given that they inhibit CYP3A4 and potentially result in increased serum levels of ibrutinib (7) . Amiodarone may increase the plasma concentration of ibrutinib by 6-to 9-fold (1). Ibrutinib interruption or dose adjustment may be appropriate prior to the initiation of amiodarone. Furthermore, the Class IA antiarrhythmic quinidine and the beta-blockers carvedilol and nadolol also interact with ibrutinib, increasing the serum concentrations of the antiarrhythmic drugs (7) . According to the ibrutinib package insert, ibrutinib interruption is recommended for any nonhematological toxicity that is grade 3 or greater. Once the toxicity has resolved to grade 1 or baseline, ibrutinib may be reintroduced at a low dose (7) .

Results showed that after a median follow-up period of 3.5 years, cardiac function was preserved with dexrazoxane without negative influence on antitumor efficacy or noncardiac toxicities. Importantly, the influence of possible differences in cumulative anthracycline dose per treatment group could not be evaluated in this study (56). Another option is to limit drug exposure in healthy tissues such as the heart and increase drug activity in malignant cells by altering the tissue distribution as with liposomal anthracyclines (57). Liposomal anthracyclines haveshown promising results in adults with breast cancer(5). In a meta-analysis of 2 studies, liposomalencapsulated doxorubicin significantly reduced both clinical and subclinical heart failure when compared to the same dose of conventional doxorubicin, without negative effects on antitumor efficacy and without cardiac adverse effects. In 1 of the studies, patients received a higher cumulative anthracycline dose in the liposomal group. However, again, followup was relatively short and we do not know how longer-term follow-up will influence these results (5).One study compared liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin to the same dose of conventional epirubicin.No significant difference in cardiotoxicity was shown, but that might have been the result of inadequate power or a limited follow-up period (5). To our knowledge, no pediatric RCTs have been performed, so the benefits and harms of liposomal anthracyclines in children remain unclear. High-quality research in children is needed before definitive conclusions can be made.I n f u s i o n d u r a t i o n . The use of longer anthracycline infusion durations may play a role in primary prevention of cardiotoxicity. A Cochrane systematic review compared different anthracycline infusion durations in children and adults with cancer (6). An anthracycline infusion duration of 6 h or longer seemed to reduce the risk of both clinical heart failure and subclinical cardiotoxicity. A clinical practice guideline for children treated with anthracyclines has suggested that although it was not possible to formulate a recommendation regarding a precise and optimal prolonged infusion duration, the use of an anthracycline infusion duration of at least 1 h was strongly recommended (58). Because data in children are limited, different anthracycline infusion durations should be evaluated further in children. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. For both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in CCS, management of cardiovascular risk factors and counseling on healthy lifestyle are essential, although most evidence is still derived from the general population. M e t a b o l i c s y n d r o m e . Hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, together clustered as metabolic syndrome, are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (59). Some CCS are at increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome because of previous cancer treatment. Metabolic syndrome has been established in 9% of French childhood leukemia survivors and in 32% of the St. Jude Lifetime cohort at median attained ages of 21 to 32 years (60,61). Survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy are at risk of developing metabolic syndrome, especially obesity (62). Furthermore, abdominal radiation and nephrotoxic treatment may result in the development of cardiovascular risk factors (63,64). Hypertension is the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factor in CCS, approaching 40% in survivors aged 50 years or older, versus 26% in siblings (17). The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (n \u00bc 10,724) investigated cardiovascular risk factors with longitudinal questionnaires and showed that hypertension had the strongest association with all cardiac events and mortality compared to diabetes, dyslipidemia and obesity (17). In the St. Jude Lifetime study, hypertension was also the only cardiovascular risk factor associated with an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (7). Management of cardiovascular risk factors is essential in all CCS and particularly in those at risk for cardiac disease. No studies have assessed whether more aggressive approaches and treatment goals than in the general population are beneficial in CCS with a high lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions may prevent the occurrence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac disease and may complement pharmacologic risk factor modification. H e a l t h y l i f e s t y le . A healthy lifestyle, including cessation and abstinence from smoking, a sufficient level of physical activity, a healthy diet, and less than moderate alcohol use may benefit cardiovascular health. It may prevent the onset and/or reduce the severity of cardiovascular disease directly or indirectly by lowering the risk of metabolic syndrome (59). Although the association between lifestyle factors and cardiovascular disease has been well established in youth and aging adults (59), there are few studies that have examined the association between lifestyle and either cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors in CCS. In the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, smoking was not associated with cardiac events, most likely because of short exposure time and follow-up (17). In the St. Jude Lifetime cohort study, CCS who did not meet most of the lifestyle recommendations from the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research were more likely to have metabolic syndrome than CCS who did meet these recommendations (61). In recent studies in the St. Jude Lifetime cohort, CCS were shown to have substantially less exercise capacity than community controls on maximal cardiopulmonary fitness testing in recent studies. Exercise capacity was associated with allcause mortality, cardiac function (global longitudinal strain [GLS], but not LVEF), chronotropic incompetence, and worse pulmonary and muscle function (65). Furthermore, CCS with lower exercise capacity had more emotional distress and worse attainment of social roles and health-related quality of life (66). Although causal relations have not been established, based on the above results in the general population and CCS, it is widely assumed that healthy lifestyle interventions will contribute to less cardiac morbidity and mortality. However, the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease has not been established in CCS. Several studies have been performed to support CCS to adapt to a healthy lifestyle, of which most have focused on increasing physical activity. In a meta-analysis of 9 studies, aerobic exercise was positively related to cardiopulmonary fitness in CCS (67). A systematic review by Raber et al. (68) identified 12 studies on physical activity interventions in CCS. Of these, 5 studies found that exercise training improved strength, functional mobility, and flexibility and/or anthropometric fitness (68). Another systematic review on lifestyle interventions in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors targeting 1 or more health behaviors identified 12 studies, of which 6 were successful in changing health behavior (69). Three of these were focused on influencing multiple behaviors, including an individually tailored counseling program on smoking and alcohol consumption. One-half of the reviewed studies delivered lifestyle interventions remotely, using phone calls or online contact. Personalized e-health interventions seem a relatively cost-effective and feasible way to improve lifestyle in CCS, but more studies are needed to examine its efficacy and effectiveness. RISK PREDICTION MODELS Knowledge of the risk of cardiac adverse events before or early after cardiotoxic cancer treatments can be very useful to guide the care for CCS. Multivariable risk prediction models have the potential to accurately estimate risk in individual survivors and should ideally be linked to a proven effective action to prevent or reduce the severity of cardiotoxicity (70,71). Development of prediction models broadly includes a development and validation phase (70). In the development phase, relevant predictors are selected based on subject knowledge and/or stepwise regression (72). Subsequently, model discrimination and calibration are assessed. Discrimination is the ability of the model to discriminate between patients who develop the event and those who do not and is typically quantified by the C-statistic or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (72,73).Calibration refers to how well the predicted risks match the actual risks and can be assessed with a calibration plot (71). In the validation phase, discrimination and calibration are assessed in a distinct cohort, a critical step before the prediction model can be applied to patients (70,71). In CCS, risk prediction models have been developed for heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and cardiovascular",

A population-based study from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program in 28,811 CCS was used to develop and validate a clinical risk score for cardiovascular mortality $5 years after diagnosis (75). Being male, of non-white race, age at diagnosis, lymphoma history, and at any radiation dose were selected as predictors in the Cox regression model. This simple model showed modest discrimination (C statistic: 0.72 to 0.75) and good separation between low-risk and high-risk survivors (cumulative incidence at 30 years after cancer diagnosis of 0.7% and 6.0%, respectively). GENETIC RISK PREDICTION MODELS. There is large interindividual variation in the susceptibility for cardiotoxicity after anthracycline treatment (76). Genetic predisposition may explain why some children will develop cardiotoxicity at lower anthracycline doses whereas others who are treated with high doses will not and thus enable risk stratification of children before anthracycline treatment. Several genetic variants implicated in DNA damage, oxidative stress, iron metabolism, sarcomere dysfunction, and anthracycline metabolism and transport have been described and replicated in anthracycline cardiomyopathy (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 3) (77,78). For a comprehensive overview of genetic variants implicated in anthracycline cardiomyopathy we refer the reader to an upcoming State-of-the-Art Review in JACC: CardioOncology and other systematic reviews (76,77). In the absence of single genes explaining the susceptibility for anthracycline cardiomyopathy, combining genetic and clinical risk factors in a multivariable prediction model may increase the clinical usefulness of screening for genetic variants. Visscher et al. (79,80) developed several genetic risk prediction models. Validation of the first prediction model failed in an independent cohort (79,80). An updated prediction model based on 7 genetic variants and the clinical variables age at start of treatment, anthracycline dose, sex, chest RT, and ethnicity achieved an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI: (81). Although these are promising results, this genetic risk prediction model is not ready to be applied to clinical practice due to several limitations. Calibration was not performed and coefficients of the final model were not provided. In addition, a logistic regression model was used that does not take into account the time-to-event, and also does not properly address survivors who dropped out before the study was performed. Therefore, the model estimates the probability of developing anthracycline cardiomyopathy at any time during follow-up, whereas it is likely more informative for a clinician to understand the probabilities within a certain timeframe. Studies that evaluate the predictive value of genetic variants in combination with clinical variables using time-to-event analyses are needed before genetics can be used in the risk stratification for anthracycline cardiomyopathy in CCS. IMPROVING PREDICTION MODELS WITH ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS. Improvements in discrimination ability of the models may be achieved with the addition of echocardiographic parameters, ECG, blood biomarkers, and/or genetic variants (7,47). Updating risk estimates in a particular survivor with changes in echocardiographic, ECG, and/or blood biomarkers during follow-up may also improve predictions given the results in other areas of research (82). Moreover, acute or early-onset cardiotoxicity is suggested as a predictor for late-onset cardiotoxicity (83). CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND CLINICAL IMPACT ANALYSES OF PREDICTION MODELS. When a potentially high-risk patient is identified by a risk prediction model, preventive measures such as the use of dexrazoxane or liposomal anthracyclines may be considered. Prediction models using covariates that are known before cancer treatment, such as genetic variants or treatment protocols, may be useful for this purpose. As a future application of prediction models, the predicted risk for cardiotoxicity can be weighed against the survival benefit associated with a particular treatment to guide therapy decisions. Risk estimates from a prediction model can also be used to individualize surveillance for asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction in CCS. Closer follow-up can be recommended in high-risk patients while at the same time the surveillance burden can be decreased in patients at low risk for cardiotoxicity. Although the above-mentioned prediction models may be used to inform survivors and clinicians on individual risks for cardiotoxic events, there is a lack of evidence-based clinical actions that can be taken based on the risk estimates from current models. This emphasizes the need for clinical impact analyses to investigate changes in clinical management linked to the results from a prediction model. A trial with a cluster randomization design evaluating usual survivorship care compared to care based on results from a prediction model will provide the strongest evidence but may be impractical to perform in CCS because of the long follow-up needed (84). Another approach to assess clinical impact is decision modeling (84,85). Decision curves can evaluate the net benefit of a prediction model across a range of disease probability thresholds for intervention (86).",

            "text": "Echocardiographic measurement of the fractional shortening (FS) and biplane LVEF are widely used techniques to quantify cardiac dysfunction in survivors of childhood cancer. FS is discouraged in patients secondary to potential regional wall motion abnormalities (87). Moreover, LVEF and FS decreases may reflect later stages of cardiotoxicity. To overcome these limitations, developments in advanced imaging techniques are of great importance. Application of 3-dimensional echocardiography has improved inter-observer and intra-observer variability, which is desirable for longitudinal follow-up (88). Armstrong et al. (89) showed that the sensitivity and false-negative rate of 3-dimensional echocardiography for detection of LVEF <50% measured by cardiac MRI as the gold standard was improved compared to 2-dimensional echocardiography (89). STRAIN IMAGING AND DIASTOLIC FUNCTION. One of the markers that may detect myocardial dysfunction at an early stage is GLS. In adult cancer patients, strain imaging has potential to predict subsequent LVEF deterioration (90,91). A relative GLS decrease of >15% from baseline is suggested as potentially abnormal, whereas a relative decrease of <8% seems not clinically relevant (92). Evidence on strain imaging in CCS is accumulating. Mavinkurve-Groothuis et al. (93) showed a significant difference in GLS between asymptomatic CCS (n \u00bc 111) approximately 15 years after anthracycline treatment and healthy controls.

Whether diastolic dysfunction is associated with asymptomatic systolic dysfunction and predictive of heart failure development warrants further investigation. CARDIAC MRI. Cardiac MRI is a well-suited imaging technique because geometric assumptions are not needed and the high resolution images enables accurate function assessment with high reproducibility (96). A study in 114 adult survivors showed a significant difference in mean LVEF measured by MRI (55.9%) and 2-dimensional echocardiography (61.0%). was identified in 12 CCS (11%) previously undiagnosed by 2-dimensional echocardiography (89). The added value of this modality could lie in the abilities of tissue characterization (i.e., edema and fibrosis), right ventricle systolic function assessment, precise volumetric and strain assessment of other cardiac chambers aside from the LV. Thus, cardiac MRI enables evaluation of structural and functional changes induced by cancer treatment. Yet, studies investigating the role of cardiac MRI in CCS are scarce (97-100). BLOOD BIOMARKERS AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY. The limited diagnostic value of the blood biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and (highsensitive) cardiac troponins in the detection of myocardial dysfunction by echocardiography more than 1 year after cancer diagnosis was shown in a recent systematic review (101). Conflicting results on the predictive value of natriuretic peptides and troponins measured during cancer treatment for subsequent anthracycline cardiomyopathy exist in CCS (102,103). In adult cancer patients, the predictive value of elevated high-sensitive cardiac troponins during cancer treatment for early-onset cardiotoxicity may be more suggestive at specific timepoints (91,104). ECG parameters may also aid in the prediction of myocardial dysfunction. A recent study in anthracycline-treated CCS showed that the QTc interval after chemotherapy was associated with subsequent LV dysfunction (105). GUIDELINES FOR SURVEILLANCE AND TREATMENT OF CARDIAC DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS. The IGHG aims to develop guidelines for surveillance of survivors of childhood cancer and young adult survivors by a global interdisciplinary collaboration (106). Within the guideline development process, recommendations are formulated based on existent national follow-up guidelines and evidence summaries (107-110). Recommendations cover the clinical questions: 1) Who needs surveillance?; 2) Which surveillance modality should be used?; 3) At what frequency and for how long should surveillance occur?; and 4) What should be done when abnormalities are found? C a r d i o m y o p a t h y s u r v e i l l a n c e g u i d e l i n e . The IGHG cardiomyopathy surveillance guideline was published in 2015 (111) and efforts are underway to update this guideline. It serves to define risk groups for the development of cardiomyopathy based on cardiotoxic exposure. CCS treated with anthracycline doses $250 mg/m 2 , chest RT dose $35 Gy, or a combination of anthracyclines $100 mg/m 2 and chest RT dose $15 Gy are regarded as high risk. Anthracycline doses of 100 to 250 mg/m 2 or chest RT doses 15 to 35 Gy are regarded as moderate risk, and anthracycline doses <100 mg/m 2 as low risk. Echocardiographic surveillance is strongly recommended every 5 years or more frequently in high-risk CCS. It is reasonable to also surveil every 5 years in moderateand low-risk CCS. Surveillance should start no later than 2 years after the completion of cardiotoxic therapy. The IGHG furthermore strongly recommends routine screening for and management of cardiovascular risk factors and counseling on smoking cessation and regular exercise.Participation rates of high-risk CCS to guidelinebased echocardiographic surveillance were shown to be less than one-third. In one RCT, telephone counselling more than doubled the participation rate in the subsequent year after correction for recommended surveillance frequency (112). Until now, the IGHG did not formulate treatment recommendations for cardiomyopathy in CCS. When abnormalities are detected, this guideline recommends referral to a cardiologist. Clinical practice guidelines applied by (pediatric) cardiologists after referral are summarized in the section below on guidelines for management of cardiomyopathy in CCS. Coronary artery disease surveillance guideline. The IGHG is currently finalizing a guideline for asymptomatic CAD surveillance in childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors (113). Preliminary studies suggest that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular surveillance modality in asymptomatic CCS treated with chest RT. Emphasis is placed on awareness of premature CAD risk in survivors treated with chest RT. Risk assessment and surveillance and management of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors is needed. Knowing that there is already a difference in the incidence of CAD between CCS and siblings in their late 20s, clinicians should be aware of the potential atypical presentation of CAD in younger patients (17,107). Other cardiac disease surveillance guidelines. As the modality of choice for the evaluation of valvular disease is echocardiography, assessment of valve function and structure are usually incorporated in the surveillance of CCS who are at risk with chest RT doses >15 Gy (111). Furthermore, assessment of pericardial structural abnormalities is possible as well. When abnormalities are detected, a cardiologist should be consulted as specified in some national guidelines (107,109). To detect arrhythmia in an early phase, some national groups suggest performing an electrocardiogram at the initiation of long-term follow-up (107,109). The IGHG cardiomyopathy guidelines refers to (pediatric) cardiology guidelines for further investigation and management of cardiac abnormalities (114-116). However, an exact threshold for abnormal systolic function is not defined. In the general adult population, a LVEF <40% is a robust indicator that medical therapy reduces mortality, regardless of heart failure symptoms. Treatment decisions for patients with a LVEF 40% to 49% should be a \"shared decision\" balancing prognosis, heart failure symptoms, and the individual's treatment tolerance (115,116). In practice, these thresholds are often extrapolated to CCS in the absence of survivorspecific evidence. There is a lack of evidence to support treatment recommendations in CCS. A Cochrane systematic review identified only 1 RCT that evaluated the initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors for CCS with asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction (117). This study only showed improvement in LV wall stress by echocardiography. Possible reasons for failure to show an effect on clinical endpoints are the relatively short follow-up time (median, 2.8 years) and liberal inclusion criteria (118). The European Society of Cardiology published a position paper for the diagnosis and management of cancer patients and survivors in adult cardiology (119). The paper recommends prompt initiation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and bblocker in those with cardiac dysfunction during cancer therapy based on the high risk of developing heart failure. However, these recommendations were not based on RCT data. In long-term follow-up, general heart failure guidelines should be followed (115,116).

The excess malignancy risk in the ezetimibe-simvastatin group was not restricted to a single organ and the risk did not increase over time. Because simvastatin had been studied in more than 41,541 patients in large double-blind randomized trials without an increase in malignancy as previously reported, attention focused on whether the excess in malignancy in SEAS may have been related to ezetimibe (16). Because ezetimibe inhibits the absorption, not only of cholesterol, but also of phytosterols and other nutrients that have possible protective roles against malignancy (17,18), a potential mechanism for increased risk of malignancy with ezetimibe has been proposed (19). To clarify whether an excess in malignancy existed in other large randomized studies with ezetimibe, in 2011 a combined analysis from the SHARP (Study of Heart and Renal Protection) trial (20) and an interim analysis from the ongoing IMPROVE-IT (analysis limited to 11,354 patients with a follow-up of 1 year) was performed in a total of 20,617 patients randomized to ezetimibe versus placebo (15). In contrast to the SEAS trial (mean follow-up: 4.1 years), the combined data from the SHARP trial (mean follow-up: 2.7 years) and the interim IMPROVE-IT data (mean follow-up: 1.0 year) did not show an increased risk of malignancy with ezetimibe (risk ratio: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.12; p \u00bc 0.61) (15). When combining data from all three datasets (SEAS, SHARP, and IMPROVE-IT), the risk ratio (RR) was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.22; p \u00bc 0.46). There was no evidence of an increased RR over time (p for trend \u00bc 0.54), suggesting the absence of a temporal association or causal inference between ezetimibe exposure and risk of malignancy over a follow-up period of 18,604 person-years. Major strengths of our analysis are the systematic evaluation of all tumors (malignant or benign), a thorough classification of all possible malignancies with multiple sensitivity analyses, and an independent assessment by a panel of oncologists who were unaware of study treatment and lipid levels. In contrast, previous studies have usually reported malignancy as a safety outcome, without a broad review of all tumors or use of an independent blinded adjudication process as is typically performed for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints related to the disease. Therefore, we agree with Peto et al. (14) that the malignancy findings reported from SEAS were likely due to chance. The present study reinforces the importance of testing previously unanticipated findings in a large and independent database with prospectively validated methods for malignancy events adjudication (7).",

Besides an increased risk of new cardiovascular events, patients with established CVD have a higher risk of cancer compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio of 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.29 adjusted for age, sex, and calendar year) (1), most likely due to shared risk factors including obesity, smoking, and low-grade inflammation (2,3). Furthermore, even though CVD is still the leading cause of mortality worldwide among adults, in some higher-and middle-income countries, cancer has become the predominant cause of death, partly due to improved prevention and treatment of CVD (4). Given one's absolute individual cancer risk varies, several risk prediction models have been developed to estimate the absolute risk for incident cancer of a specific type, notably lung cancer and breast cancer(5-9). However, no prediction models are available for patients with established CVD specifically. Furthermore, from a patient's perspective, risk of any cancer might be a more relevant metric, and no risk prediction models estimate total cancer risk. Furthermore, classic risk prediction models estimate prognosis in terms of absolute 5-or 10-year risk of cancer, and may not identify those patients who have a relatively low 5-or 10-year absolute risk, but a high cumulative lifetime risk (10). Finally, traditional 10-year risk prediction scores often do not consider the competing risk of noncancer mortality, and are prone to several types of bias (11). Especially in a population of patients with established CVD, the competing risk of noncancer mortality including cardiovascular death should be taken into account to prevent overestimation of cancer risk. Estimating individualized probabilities could help in patients' and clinicians' understanding of cancer risk. As several modifiable risk factors are related to cancer (2) as well as to CVD, discussing these cancer risks with patients could potentially aid in emphasizing healthy lifestyle changes, such as smoking cessation or weight loss. The aim of the current study was to develop and externally validate prediction models to estimate the 10-year and lifetime risk for total, colorectal, and lung cancer in patients with established CVD. METHODS STUDY POPULATIONS. Model development was conducted in the UCC-SMART (Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort-Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease) study, an ongoing prospective cohort study, including 18-to 79-year-old patients referred to the University Medical Center Utrecht with clinically manifest vascular disease or atherosclerotic risk factors. The cohort was initiated in 1996 and is still recruiting patients annually. For the current study 7,280 patients age 45 to 80 years with clinically manifest vascular disease and who gave permission for data requests to other medical authorities were included. External model validation was performed in the CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study; NCT01327846), a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, that included 10,061 participants with a myocardial infarction at least 1 month before study entry and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration ($2 mg/l). Eligible patients were randomized to receive either placebo or canakinumab at a dose of 50 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg",

The funder had no role in study design and conduct of the study, in the OUTCOMES. During follow-up, participants enrolled in the UCC-SMART cohort received biannual questionnaires, gathering information on occurrence of recurrent CVD, bleeding events, incident diabetes mellitus, and end-stage renal disease. Additional information was collected from the hospital or general practitioner's records. An endpoint committee of 3 physicians adjudicated all clinical events independently and conflicting classifications were resolved through consensus. For data on cancer incidence, the UCC-SMART database was linked to the Dutch National Cancer Registry (INKL), a national registry receiving notifications of all new cancer diagnoses in the Netherlands through the Nationwide Network and Registry of Histopathology and Cytopathology, and hospital discharge diagnoses. Participants in the CANTOS trial were followed for incident CVD as well as cancer diagnoses. Even though the primary endpoint of the trial was CVD incidence, patients' records were investigated for cancers reported during follow-up, as prespecified in the trial safety monitoring plan. Incident cancer reports were adjudicated by an endpoint committee of oncologists, blinded to treatment allocation (15). An overview of cancer diagnoses during follow-up for both study populations is provided in Supplemental Tables 2 and 3. For the current study, total cancer was defined as any invasive neoplasm, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. As lung and colorectal cancer are the most common (not sex specific) cancers worldwide (16), these were chosen as separate outcomes. For the endpoint of total cancer, only first diagnoses of cancer were counted. For lung and colorectal cancer, the first diagnosis of that particular cancer type was included, possibly being the second or third primary diagnosis of cancer for a certain patient during follow-up.

The models were developed with left truncation: age rather than follow-up time was used as the underlying time scale. This way, patients contributed person-years between age at study entry and age at study exit, resulting in overlapping observations that allow for lifetime predictions across the range of baseline ages. Because a limited number of patients and events in certain age groups led to instability of predictions, the age range at baseline was restricted to 45 to 80 years. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed visually by plotting scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time, and interactions with age (underlying time scale) were added to the model when a violation was observed. Log and quadratic associations between continuous predictors and the outcome variable were assessed by comparing model fit based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) (17), and transformations were applied when appropriate to improve robustness of the model. AICs of modelswith and without addition of CRP as a predictor were compared to assess differences in model fit. Coefficients of the predictors were adjusted to account for optimism using a shrinkage factor acquired by bootstrapping with 1,000 bootstrap samples.",

To adjust for treatment effects of canakinumab, hazard ratios of treatment effects of canakinumab on cancer outcomes and their competing mortality were determined and added to the respective models. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's c-statistic for survival data, and goodness of fit was assessed by calibration plots of the predicted versus observed risks. For the calibration plot, patients were divided into equal groups of increasing predicted risk. Based on the number of events, patients were divided into 10 equal groups for the total cancer model, and patients were divided into 6 equal groups for the colorectal and lung cancer models. Observed risks were estimated in these groups by using a cumulative incidence function, accounting for competing risks. Recalibration was performed based on the expected to observed ratio.

Presented predicted risks are estimated by the full models for total, colorectal, and lung cancer. van 't Klooster et al. similar. Only lung cancer risk was slightly underestimated in the CANTOS population before recalibration, probably due to variations in smoking habits, or genetic factors causing a higher baseline risk. The higher discriminative power of the lung cancer model (C-statistic 0.74) compared with the total and colorectal cancer models (C-statistics 0.63 and 0.64, respectively), is possibly due to the strong relation between the predictor smoking status and lung cancer. For the prediction of lung and colorectal cancer, a simple model with just age, sex, and smoking status could be sufficient; however, for total cancer and the competing risks, the full model was necessary to achieve the most accurate predictions. For lung cancer, even though the calibration plot showed a 4-year risk of AE3% in the highest risk group, the model allowed for a widespread lifetime risk distribution, assigning lifetime risks up to 37% to a small proportion of patients.

            "text": "STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. Strengths of the present study include the large study populations for both the derivation and external validation of the cancer risk prediction models. Another important strength is the competing risk-adjusted analyses, preventing overestimation of the event of interest, especially in a population of patients with established CVD. Furthermore, by using age as the underlying time scale in the models, predictions are not limited by follow-up time in the derivation cohort and lifetime predictions are enabled. Last, the prediction model is available in the Supplemental Appendix. Limitations, however, should be considered. These include the smaller number of lung cancer and colorectal cancer in the development and validation study populations. Furthermore, external validation in the CANTOS trial could be performed only up to 4 years due to limited length of follow-up, although internal validation of 10-year predictions in UCC-SMART showed good calibration. Previous studies have shown that lifetime predictions based on the current methodologies provide adequate estimates for up to at least 17 years (10), and the advantage of CANTOS is the large number of patients with CVD and detailed information on incident cancer. C-statistics for the total cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer models were moderate (0.62 to 0.74), comparable to previous cancer risk predictions models (5,7,25) and recurrent CVD risk prediction models in patients with van 't Klooster et al. Calibration is a more clinically relevant performance measure for risk prediction accuracy (24), and calibration of the total, colorectal, and lung cancer predictions models in the CANTOS trial population were all reasonable. Although patients were included in stable phase after a qualifying cardiovascular event, patients potentially changed lifestyle habits, such as smoking, during follow-up, and the single baseline measurement might not reflect such time varying covariates. Last, several potentially important predictors, including level of education, socioeconomic status, race, and family history of cancer were unavailable in the derivation cohort and could not be included in the prediction models, possibly limiting model performance. CONCLUSIONS Lifetime and 10-year risk of total cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer can be estimated reasonably well with easy clinically available predictors in patients with established CVD. The wide distribution of predicted lifetime risks for total and lung cancer enables identification of patients at the highest risk for cancer. With additional study, the lifetime total and lung cancer models could be used in clinical practice to further promote healthy lifestyle changes, and application of these models, particularly the10-year lung cancer risk model, could potentially lower thresholds for targeted diagnostics and screening.

Bonneville, MSC I t is known that patients with cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of cancer compared to the general population; this is likely attributable to the presence of several common risk factors such as smoking. Adequate estimation of absolute individual cancer risk requires the combination of such risk factors in clinical prediction models. In this issue of JACC: CardioOncology, a team of international researchers should be applauded for presenting a promising risk calculator for cancer in individual patients with cardiovascular disease (1). As risk prediction is receiving increasing attention in the current Big Data era, a fundamental question is: Are the predictions valid? Validity of a prediction model may be limited by poor reproducibility (internal validity) and poor transportability (external validity) (2). Prediction models are often developed in relatively small datasets with data hungry methods, that is, methods that only work in very large datasets (3). We see this unfortunate practice in the many prediction models that appear for coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis and prognosis (4). This current study stands out positively with sensible modeling approaches in carefully collected datasets and large sample sizes with complete follow-up. Impressive numbers are noted in the development dataset (UCC-SMART [Utrecht Cardiovascular Cohort Second Manifestation of Arterial Diseases]: 1,143 incident cancers among 7,280 patients with median follow-up of 8.1 years) and the validation dataset (CANTOS [Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study]: 509 incident cancers among 9,322 patients with median follow-up of 3.8 years). For specific cancers, numbers are smaller (CANTOS: 123 lung cancers, 72 colorectal cancers). As such, detailed modeling can be difficult, even in overall large datasets. Indeed, some shrinkage of model coefficients was needed, especially for the colorectal cancer prediction model (1). Internal validity of the calculator may be improved with larger numbers of patients, particularly for the lung cancer and colorectal cancer prediction models. Longer follow-up is also important to corroborate the current 10-year and lifetime risk estimates, which are to some extent extrapolations. An additional threat to validity is the limited transportability due to various sources of heterogeneity between populations. The current models were developed within a broader range of clinically manifest cardiovascular disease, as compared to the validation setting (UCC-SMART: coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease; CANTOS: myocardial infarction and elevated C-reactive protein) (1",

The ability to accurately risk stratify these patients is essential for guiding clinical care and treatment options. There are 2 commonly used risk models for the ATTR-CM population. The Mayo risk model includes the cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin-T, stratifying wild-type ATTR-CM (wtATTR) patients into 3 stages (2). The UK risk model includes both wtATTR and hereditary ATTR-CM (hATTR) patients, and uses NT-proBNP and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (3). However, neither model incorporates well-established, easily obtained predictors of outcomes in heart failure (HF), including diuretic dose (4-7) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class. Further, the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) (7) is another widely used risk score that has been validated in other HF cohorts but has not been tested in ATTR-CM. We hypothesized that diuretic dose and NYHA functional class would be robust predictors of mortality in ATTR-CM. We thus sought to define the associations of diuretic dose and NYHA functional class with all-cause mortality in ATTR-CM and assess whether diuretic dose and NYHA functional class are additive to the existing Mayo and UK ATTR-CM risk models. We applied the SHFM to this cohort to both test and compare its ability to predict risk in ATTR-CM patients. METHODS Consecutive ATTR-CM patients referred to a single, quaternary care center (Columbia University, New York, New York) between February 2002 and November 2018 were enrolled in a registry. All patients over 18 years of age with either wtATTR or hereditary hATTR were included. Approval for the study was obtained from the Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data including diuretic dose and NYHA functional class assessment were obtained at the baseline clinical visit. Patients were followed over time. Outcomes, including death and cardiac transplantation, were adjudicated manually from chart review. The current study is a retrospective cohort analysis of these previously collected data. from the Mayo Clinic (2) and the UK data (3). The Mayo classification identified elevated NT-proBNP >3,000 pg/ml and troponin-T >0.05 ng/ml as risk factors. The UK classification used an elevated NT-proBNP >3,000 pg/ml and decreased eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . As our patients had a combination of BNP and NT-proBNP at baseline, we estimated a BNP cutoff >600 pg/ml to correspond to NT-proBNP >3,000 pg/ml (on the basis of a commonly used 5-to 6-fold estimated conversion in clinical settings) (8). Similarly, there was a combination of troponin-T and troponin-I assays at baseline. We chose a troponin-I cutoff of >0.1 ng/ml to correspond to troponin-T >0.05 ng/ml; this was based on the Boston University analysis on light chain amyloid patients for equivalence between troponin-I and troponin-T (9). All patients had eGFR estimates at baseline. For the Mayo risk score, patients were assigned 1 point for either elevated NT-proBNP or BNP and 1 point for elevated troponin-T or troponin-I, for a range of 0 to 2 points. For the UK risk score, patients were assigned 1 point for either elevated NT-proBNP or BNP and 1 point for eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , for a range of 0 to 2 points. We additionally evaluated the SHFM model to provide a separate comparator with a wellestablished risk tool used in other HF cohorts. SHFM includes age, sex, ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, weight, NYHA functional class, etiology, medications (diuretic dose, allopurinol, statins,",

We additionally tested the model after adjusting for renal function, troponin-I or -T elevation, and for either NT-proBNP or BNP elevation; this included variables in the Mayo and UK ATTR-CM risk models. Third, we adjusted for NYHA functional class in the diuretic model. Analyses were repeated with the composite of death or heart transplantation as a secondary outcome. Data are expressed in the tables as hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan-Meier curves are used to display survival probabilities for individual risk markers. The final combined scores for Mayo \u00fe diuretic dose \u00fe NYHA functional class and UK \u00fe diuretic dose \u00fe NYHA functional class were subdivided into tertiles and plotted to estimate median survival. Comparisons between groups were made using log-rank statistic. We tested the discrimination of the various risk models using time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves with estimation of the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) at the 2year time point (10). This time point was chosen due to reported median survival of 2.5 years in hATTR V122i mutation subtype (1). Additionally, given the high early mortality and the contemporary enrollment of patients, the models are less stable over time; hence, the point estimates at 2 years for the models are more accurate than with longer follow-up. To test the robustness of our models, we ran sensitivity analyses calculating Harrell's c-statistic, which is the weighted average of the time-dependent AUC across all available survival times. The likelihood ratio test was used to compare nested models to determine whether the addition of diuretic dose and/or NYHA functional class improved the model fit to either the Mayo or UK scores. The continuous net reclassification index (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement, and median improvement (11) were used to determine incremental benefit of adding diuretic dose and NYHA functional class to either the Mayo or the UK risk scores. Calibration was tested with a modified Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic for goodness of fit incorporating survival data (12).

KEY WORDS cardiac amyloidosis, heart failure, transthyretin APPENDIX For an expanded Methods section and supplemental tables and figures, please see the online version of this paper. PERSPECTIVES COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: The current Mayo and UK risk models for ATTR-CM provide moderate discriminatory ability in our ATTR-CM cohort. Diuretic dose and NYHA functional class are easily obtainable clinical parameters that provide incremental predictive and discriminative value to the existing Mayo and UK risk scores for ATTR-CM. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and determine if they apply similarly to hATTR and wtATTR. Optimized risk stratification tools can also be used to aid in decision making for targeted therapy in ATTR-CM. ransthyretin (TTR)-type cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of heart failure (1). The acceptance of technetium-labeled nuclear scintigraphy for nonbiopsy diagnosis has revolutionized the diagnosis of this condition (2). Until recently, the only treatment options for ATTR-CM were organ transplantation or supportive care. The ATTR-ACT study (3) demonstrated that the TTR stabilizer, tafamidis, decreased mortality and heart failure hospitalizations and ushered in a new era of awareness of ATTR-CM. Prognostic staging systems for ATTR are important in patient counseling, determining treatment options, including timing of advanced therapies for heart failure or palliative care. We proposed the Mayo Clinic cardiac biomarker staging for patients with wild-type ATTR-CM (ATTRwt) using thresholds for troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) to define 3 stages of disease (4). Gilmore et al. (5) reported the UK staging system using NT-proBNP and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Both systems reported a threshold of NT-proBNP of 3,000 pg/ml. The Mayo model uses a troponin T threshold of 0.05 ng/ml, whereas the UK model uses an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <45 ml/min/1.73 m 2 . The UK model included patients with both ATTRwt and hereditary ATTR-CM. In this issue of JACC: CardioOncology, Cheng et al. (6) report the incremental value of diuretic dose and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class added to the Mayo and UK staging systems. Their study included 309 patients with ATTR-CM (66% ATTRwt) from a single center, conducted between 2002 and 2018 (Columbia University, New York). The authors reported that diuretic dose and NYHA functional class were independent predictors of mortality when added to the previously reported staging systems. The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) was able to stratify this cohort according to risk, but the 5year predicted survival using SHFM was higher at 53.7% than the observed 36.7%. The authors noted that the \"modified\" Mayo and UK staging systems (adding diuretic dose and NYHA functional class) provided discriminatory results similar to the SHFM yet were easier to calculate with less input of variables. The current study does not include echocardiographic findings in the analysis. In developing the Mayo staging system, multiple echocardiographic variables were studied, with the exception of left ventricular strain, which was not available in many in our cohort. Only reduced left ventricular ejection fraction remained independently predictive of survival in the multivariable model including cardiac biomarkers.

The discordant results of NYHA functional class as a predictor of mortality is not discussed by the authors but may be reflective of a smaller cohort evaluated by a small number of providers with less variability. Limitations of the interobserver variation in determining the NYHA functional class may limit the use of this variable in larger cohorts. The report by Cheng et al. (6) validates the Mayo and UK staging systems and demonstrates the incremental value of adding diuretic dose and NYHA functional class. Most clinicians incorporate a variety of factors in assessing prognosis. Ideally the staging systems are used as reference points and then tailored accordingly, using the overall clinical assessment. This study, along with the other reports cited, suggests that complex models are probably not needed for prognosis in ATTR-CM. Simple models are easily remembered and incorporated into patient visits. We have now entered a new era of therapy for ATTR-CM. Although the original and proposed \"modified\" Mayo and UK staging systems provide prognostic estimates based on natural history, these models are not applicable to the majority of newly diagnosed patients who will receive therapy. Our new challenges to prognosis of ATTR-CM are 3-fold: 1) determining prognosis in treated patients; 2) assessing response to therapy; and 3) determining outcomes for patients with noncardiac TTR amyloid deposition, such as those found in carpal tunnel tissue and spinal stenosis. Analysis of the ATTR-ACT study and ongoing cardiac trials of TTR-silencer therapy provides an opportunity to evaluate prognostic staging systems in the modern treatment era and to determine markers of therapeutic response. It is hoped that these analyses will be forthcoming, although sponsors may be reluctant to report detailed predictors of nonresponse after drug approval. Patients almost uniformly seek information regarding treatment response. As tafamidis slows the progression of disease, we do not currently have a metric to assess response. Although stabilization or only mild progression of cardiac biomarkers, diuretic dose, hospitalizations, and other simple clinical variables may be reassuring, those variables do not necessarily answer the patient's question: \"Is this drug helping me?\" Due to the focus on imaging, patients often inquire about the results of follow-up studies, usually wondering if there has been regression of myocardial thickening. Given the challenges of determining prognosis using echocardiographic variables, caution is needed in enthusiasm for using these measures to assess therapeutic response. Part of the challenge lies in the pathophysiology of ATTR-CM, which is likely complex and remains incompletely understood. Dr.",

Patients with cancer may also develop complications of cancer treatments that further increase the risk of thrombotic and bleeding events, including: invasive diagnostic and surgical procedures; toxicity secondary to radiotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents, hormonal therapies, immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy; hepatotoxicity; renal injury; tumor friability; established low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) as the guideline-recommended first-line therapy over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for patients with cancer-related acute VTEs, based on data that showed a lower risk of VTE recurrence in patients who were treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (3,4). However, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, demonstrated increased safety and efficacy in comparison with VKAs for management of VTE in the general population (5-8). Recently, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) compared different DOACs, including edoxaban (Hokusai VTE Cancer [Edoxaban for the Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism]) (9), rivaroxaban (SELECT-D [Comparison of an Oral Factor Xa Inhibitor With Low Molecular Weight Heparin in Patients With Cancer With Venous Thromboembolism: Results of a Randomized Trial]) (10), and apixaban (ADAM VTE [Apixaban and Dalteparin in Active Malignancy Associated Venous Thromboembolism: The ADAM VTE Trial]; CARAVAGGIO [Apixaban for the Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism]) (11,12) with dalteparin with regard to efficacy and safety in preventing recurrent VTEs in patients with cancer. A previous meta-analysis (13), which evaluated results from the Hokusai VTE Cancer, SELECT-D, and ADAM VTE trials, observed a trend for reduced VTE recurrence in DOAC-treated patients, in which DOACs were found to be noninferior to LMWH in preventing VTE recurrence in patients with cancer, but were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB). The results of these trials were somewhat conflicting, which might have been due to differences in trial design and enrollment criteria. The recently published results of the CARAVAGGIO trial, the largest trial to date in this specific clinical setting, reported that oral apixaban therapy in patients with cancer was associated with significantly lower VTE recurrence, low rates of bleeding, and reported enhanced quality of life outcome measures compared with dalteparin (12). Applying these newly available data, we performed a meta-analysis to eval-March 31, 2020, because the first journal article was published in 2007 regarding clinical trial testing with a DOAC for the prevention of VTEs (14).

RCTs were included if they compared a DOAC versus dalteparin in patients with cancer and acute VTE.

Although these results were not consistently statistically significant, they concurred with the 2-fold increase in GI bleeding with DOACs compared with that of dalteparin and with previous evidence. These data suggested that patients with GIcancers represented a slightly different clinical category, in which oral anticoagulation might result in a higher bleeding risk. Again, it should be noted that the CARAVAGGIO trial included fewer patients with upper GI cancer than the other studies. The observation that the risk of CRNMB events was higher with upper GI cancers compared with lower GI cancers suggested that the known effect of DOACs on upper GI bleeding might have played a role (21). It is reassuring that this phenomenon was apparently limited to CRNMB and was not associated with major bleeding. However, particular caution should be used in managing anticoagulation, because absorption of oral anticoagulants might be affected in patients with GI cancer or there might be toxicity. Caution should also be used in those who have undergone surgery of the upper GI tract (22). In addition, it is crucial to note that uncertainty remains regarding drug\u00c0drug interaction with oral anticoagulants and cancer therapies. Patients treated with powerful inducers and/or inhibitors of CYP3A4 or Pglycoprotein were primarily excluded from trial participation, and few patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors or other newly approved therapies were included in these trials. It was reassuring that the data reported from the CARAVAGGIO trial served to confirm that DOACs were noninferior to dalteparin in preventing VTE recurrence. Despite the many differences among the 4 trials, their results concerning the prevention of recurrent VTEs in patients with cancer were consistent, with the estimated risk for recurrent VTE being increased with dalteparin. Furthermore, although the CARAVAGGIO trial excluded patients with brain tumors and included few patients with upper GI cancer, the ADAM VTE trial adopted a broader definition of the qualifying VTE event, encompassing upper extremity thrombosis.

Although all included studies were high quality, there was some heterogeneity among the trials. Because we were unable to define the extent to which this heterogeneity might be related to differences in trial designs and the enrolled populations, we could not completely exclude bias.Nevertheless, the meta-analysis results were consistent using both fixed-effect and random-effects calculation models, as well as across study subgroups at sensitivity analysis. The included studies encompassed all DOACs available on the market, with the exception of dabigatran, because no study evaluated the use of dabigatran against LMWHs in this clinical context. Therefore, we do not know whether these results would also apply to dabigatran. Finally, our analysis was limited to the use of dalteparin as the comparator drug, because none of the other LMWHs was selected as the control treatment arm in any of the included studies. This might be because dalteparin was tested in the CLOT study(3).",

Results of this meta-analysis of 4 randomized trials provided compelling evidence for prescribing DOACs with more confidence and perhaps to an increased number of patients with cancer who are at risk for recurrent VTEs. Initial caution was exercised with DOAC use in this setting, which was primarily related to uncertainty regarding the clinical relevance of drug interactions with anticancer treatments and concerns regarding bleeding. Nevertheless, the new evidence of noninferiority in preventing recurrent VTEs and the findings that increased bleeding risk does not involve major bleeding and is primarily related to the enrollment of patients with GI cancer should affect current clinical practice in this setting.

There is no significantly increased risk of major bleeding, but there is an elevated risk of CRNMB events, primarily related to GI cancers. TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The new evidence of noninferiority of DOACs in protection from recurrent VTEs, along with the lack of increased major bleeding, should affect current clinical management for patients with active cancer and VTEs. Careful selection of anticoagulants and continued development of evidence-based management strategies to include DOACs are needed to help ensure the continued careful care of the growing cancer population.

For the past decade and a half, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) monotherapy for at least 6 months has been considered the standard of care for cancer-associated VTE (3). However, concerns had been raised about this standard given lack of full confirmation in a subsequent randomized trial (4) as well as demonstrated issues with patient adherence with this injectable option compared with oral anticoagulation(5). The advent of the class of drugs known as direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has increased available options to treat and prevent recurrent VTE in cancer patients.Promising data from initial randomized trials suggested a potential reduced risk of recurrent VTE in this setting with DOACs but at the cost of an increased risk of major bleeding as well as clinically include both LMWHs and DOACs as options but caution against the use of the latter in patients at high risk for bleeding, particularly the subgroup of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies(8)(9)(10).In this issue of JACC: CardioOncology, Sabatino et al.

These 4 included RCTs comprising 2,907 patients evaluated different DOACs: edoxaban in the Hokusai VTE Cancer trial (7), rivaroxaban in the Select-D trial (6), and apixaban in the ADAM-VTE (Apixaban and Dalteparin in Active Malignancy Associated Venous Thromboembolism) and Caravaggio trials (12,13). All 4 RCTs utilized dalteparin, the only approved LMWH for this indication, as the control arm. An important strength of this meta-analysis is the inclusion of the very recently published Caravaggio study, which substantially increases sample size relative to prior such analyses.",

This challenges the preconception that cardiovascular risk in testicular cancer survivors is a late phenomenon (3,8). Historically, the prospective evaluation of vascular effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been hindered by assessments in heterogeneous groups with differing cardiovascular risk, cancer types, and treatment regimens. Furthermore, examination of immediate effects has been limited and usually without longitudinal assessment (9-11). Understanding the time course and pathophysiological basis of cisplatin-induced vascular and renal injury is critical to inform surveillance and trials of treatment and prevention strategies. Thus, we assessed the effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy on endothelial function, metabolic parameters, fibrinolytic factors, and cardiovascular and renal biomarkers in the immediate peritreatment phase followed by prospective, longitudinal assessments over 9 months in men with testicular cancer. In a further series of studies, we used forearm venous occlusion plethysmography, the gold standard method to evaluate endothelial function (12), to assess endothelial vasomotor and endogenous fibrinolytic function in testicular cancer survivors treated 1 to 7 years prior. We also assessed the in vitro effects of cisplatin on stress kinase signaling and thrombosis pathways in human aortic endothelial cell (",

DISCUSSION Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and renal dysfunction in testicular cancer patients (Central Illustration). These effects are confined to the immediate perichemotherapy period. Our observations suggest the early time period post-cisplatin treatment is one that is potentially of increased renal and cardiovascular risk, and one during which attention should be given to risk reduction with cardiovascular protection strategies. A strength of the study is the early assessment of endothelial vasomotor function within 24 h following chemotherapy. Prior studies evaluating vascular function after cisplatin-based chemotherapy are limited by infrequent assessments performed months or years following treatment (6,9), potentially missing the period of maximum vascular injury and dysfunction. We demonstrate that, following 3 to 4 cycles of BEP, endothelial function is impaired at this acute and vulnerable time. Although endothelial function returned to baseline values at the subsequent 6-week assessment, it is biologically plausible that a similar transient deterioration in endothelial function is induced with each treatment cycle (5).",

Furthermore, BK-induced t-PA release was not different in patients managed with or without cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The capacity for endothelial t-PA release is a sensitive, and mechanistically relevant, marker for the prediction of patients at risk of cardiovascular events (30). Serum cholesterol and HbA1C increased transiently at 6 weeks after 3 to 4 cycles of BEP and similar trends were seen for LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy may have contributed to these observations, we cannot conclude that this is the only explanation. Indeed, a reduction in tumor burden may have contributed to increases in cholesterol(31). Furthermore, glucocorticoid antiemetics may have contributed to changes in lipid profile and glycemia. However, we do not believe glucocorticoids are the sole explanation for the change in lipid parameters. Indeed, in a randomized study in which dexamethasone or placebo were given to healthy male volunteers, dexamethasone did not affect endothelial function, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol, albeit with a different dexamethasone regimen to our study(32).Most studies evaluating the risk of CVD after cisplatin-based chemotherapy have focused on the later period after treatment(3,8,33,34). In the 10 to 19 years following treatment, a 5-to 7-fold increased risk of CVD has been reported compared with patients managed with surveillance or the general population(8,33). Larger studies of up to 2,700 patients demonstrate a more modest 1.5-to 2-fold increased risk of CVD at 10 to 18 years after treatment(3,34). However, the incidence of thrombosis appears to be highest early after treatment. Between 9% and 11% have a thrombotic event within 1 year following 3 or more cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy(9,35).Importantly, a more granular assessment of 15,006 patients revealed a 5-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death in the first year after treatment. This risk fell dramatically thereafter and was not significant after 1 year (1). Therefore, in keeping with our observations, the early period after treatment with 3 or more cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy",

We hypothesize that this profile of renal injury is compatible with widespread endothelial activation and injury. STUDY LIMITATIONS. To our knowledge this is one of the most comprehensive, longitudinal evaluations of changes in vascular and renal function after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, there are some limitations that should be acknowledged. The number of patients in cohort 1 is small, particularly the group managed with 1 to 2 cycles of BEP, and it is not possible to conclude whether associations in this group did not reach statistical significance because of reduced power or because greater cancer burden potentiates the toxic effect of cisplatinbased chemotherapy.

Vascular function was assessed using different approaches in the acute and long-term studies. The use of portable equipment allowed assessment of endothelial function at the patient's bedside in the immediate post-chemotherapy period. We reserved the use of forearm venous occlusion plethysmography for studies in survivors after 1 year. These techniques primarily examine function at different levels of the arterial tree, and we accept this as a limitation. We did not use forearm venous occlusion plethysmography to assess the early vascular effects of cisplatin because this requires arterial cannulation in the context of a potentially pro-thrombotic state and is impractical in the perichemotherapy period. Serial assessment of %FMD each day during chemotherapy provides insight to the duration of effects from cisplatin on endothelial function; it would be helpful to assess %FMD in the period at least 1 year after treatment, but we limited assessments to maximize recruitment and retention of patients undergoing intensive treatment regimes. Although AngioDefender %FMD correlates with Framingham risk score (14), it has CENTRAL ILLUSTRATION Effects of Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy on Endothelial Function Cameron, A.C. et al. J Am Coll Cardiol CardioOnc. 2020;2(3):443-55.Patients with testicular cancer managed with cisplatin-based chemotherapy or surveillance were enrolled. Endothelial function was assessed by % flow-mediated dilatation over 9 months in patients with a recent diagnosis, or venous occlusion plethysmography in patients managed 1 to 7 years previously. Acute and transient endothelial dysfunction was observed 24 h after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and endothelial function was not impaired 1 to 7 years after treatment.

Although we demonstrate deleterious effects of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the early phase that are not evident in the medium-term, these findings could be further strengthened by the inclusion of a larger number of participants and the assessment of survivors treated >7 years previously. Heightened risk of CVD is reported up to 20 years after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (8), although endothelial function has not been assessed beyond 7 years after treatment, and it remains possible that endothelial dysfunction is also detectable in longer-term survivors. CONCLUSIONS Acute and transient endothelial toxicity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and nephrotoxicity are apparent in the early period following cisplatin-based chemotherapy, when cardiovascular risk is greatest (1). Our data highlight the early perichemotherapy period as an important window for focused surveillance of cardiovascular and renal health during which baseline and emergent cardiovascular risk factors should be treated aggressively.

            "text": "t is said that two-thirds of anticancer drugs have their origin in serendipity, and this is most certainly true for cisplatin(1). Fifty-five years ago, Barnett Rosenberg inquired about the influence of an electrical field on cell division and found that the division of Escherichia coli showed an on-off effect depending on the power state(2). Two years later came the realization that the antiproliferative phenomenon had nothing to do with electricity but rather the release of a heavy metal, platinum, from the electrodes. Translating this knowledge to cancer cells was seemingly more straightforward and rewarding, and clinical trials commenced in 1972, leading to the approval of cisplatin for testicular cancer in 1978.Since then platinum drugs have been a game changer in the treatment of testicular cancer in particular, with a decrease in death rates by two thirds. In combination with other drugs, most commonly etoposide or bleomycin and etoposide (BEP), and orchidectomy and radiation therapy, cure rates for testicular cancer have exceeded 90%.One of the most prominent toxicities noted in the original experimental studies was renal failure, and this concern has persisted. Other side effects noted relatively early in clinical practice included vascular events. These were primarily of two kinds: vasospasm, especially Raynauds, and venous and arterial thrombosis(3). Of interest, atherosclerotic plaques do not seem to be a prerequisite for acute coronary events in patients undergoing platinum-based therapies(4,5). This may suggest that induction of endothelial apoptosis with an erosion-type acute coronary syndrome might be the underlying mechanism (or thromboembolism from an alternate source)(6)(7)(8). Of further interest, even after the active treatment period, patients with testicular cancer may remain at higher risk for vascular disease and related events(9).Defining the excess cardiovascular risk, however, has not been easy, especially treatment-related cardiovascular mortality(9). In addition to the debate onthe magnitude and duration of excess cardiovascular risk, there is the debate of whether cisplatin, alone or in combination with other therapies, even plays a causal role. Metabolic changes and the adverse cardiovascular effects of hypogonadism are well described in testicular cancer survivors (9). The study by Cameron et al. (10) in this issue of JACC: CardioOncology aimed to address the nebulous landscape of cisplatin vascular toxicity in an elegant investigation of two cohorts of patients with testicular cancer. The first group included those with active disease for the assessment of early effects. Patients were stratified based on disease severity and related treatment strategy (active surveillance; 1 to 2 cycles of BEP; and 3 to 4 cycles of BEP). The second group included testicular cancer survivors 1 to 7 years from diagnosis, stratified by their management approach at the time: active surveillance or 3 to 4 cycles of BEP therapy. The key observations were as follows: in the early effects cohort, a decrease in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery was recognized in the first 24 h of treatment in both BEP therapy ISSN 2666-0873 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.07.007 *Editorials published in JACC: CardioOncology reflect the views of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of JACC: CardioOncology or the American College of Cardiology.

Of note, the absolute value of FMD was not different between the 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 cycle groups, rather the latter group started with a higher baseline value. The duration of the effect was said not to differ between the two groups, but a recurrent decrease was noted at 9 months in the 3 to 4 cycle group. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen levels increased significantly from baseline to 6 weeks in the 3 to 4 cycles of BEP group but not otherwise. High-sensitive troponin-I, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and highsensitivity C-reactive protein remained unchanged in all groups at all time points. The albumincreatinine ratio increased in both treatment groups within 24 h and this increase persisted for 6 weeks in the 3 to 4 cycle group. An increase in urine interleukin-18 was seen in both treatment groups at 24 h, whereas an increase in Cystatin C was seen only in the 3 to 4 cycle group, with a lower level. In the survivor cohort, based on forearm blood flow response to bradykinin, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (by venous occlusion plethysmography) showed no differences between those on surveillance and those who had received BEP. Likewise, bradykinin induced a dose-dependent net tissue plasminogen activator (but not plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) antigen release in both survivor groups. In human aortic endothelial cells, tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 messenger RNA expression decreased significantly and nonsignificantly in cells exposed to cisplatin. An increase in protein kinase B and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation was seen seemingly with a defined optimum for dose and time constellation (maximal at an intermediate cisplatin dose and 15-min stimulation).The results, as reported, echo prior studies in the field and thereby consolidate the evidence.

Nevertheless, it would be of interest to see if this recurrent decrease relates to any clinical events, and, in general, if long-term serial assessment of vascular reactivity, possibly even with other devices such as the EndoPAT (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Hefa, Israel), can inform and guide management. A high-risk vascular fingerprint for patients with testicular cancer undergoing cisplatin therapy was recently proposed, consisting of $3 of the following: body mass index >25 kg/m 2 , current smoking, blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg (or treated), hyperlipidemia (or treated), and elevated fasting plasma glucose (12). vWF levels increased much more during therapy in the high-risk fingerprint group, which included 3 of 4 patients with arterial ischemic events. The dynamics of vWF levels were recapitulated in the current study by Cameron et al.

The risk of the individual patient, however, is still hard to predict. Of the various parameters, vascular reactivity testing is well suited to serve as a parameter of cardiovascular health and its modification by therapies and lifestyle interventions (Figure 1). All in all, patients with testicular cancer are a prime example of individuals who benefit from being followed in a cardio-oncology approach. Optimal management of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease entities (as well as any renal disease) is as important as their most optimal oncology treatment approach. After all, cardiovascular toxicity with cisplatin use in patients with testicular cancer is a reality with the potential for something heavier than heavy metal serendipity.

Our study differed by defining LVSD with sex-specific 2D-LVEF cutoffs and GLS. Moreover, in our cohort, transplants were primarily of stem-cell origin, and although there were heterogeneous reasons for allo-HSCT, there were also few cases of radiotherapy. The lack of symptoms (NYHA functional class II or III) in a greater proportion of those with LVSD is unexpected. However, symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue are commonly accepted side effects of chemotherapy, possibly accounting for reduced recognition and lack of awareness. The absence of symptoms may also explain the infrequent prescription of cardioprotective medications in our cohort. Plausible explanations for the high frequency of LVSD in this study population include exposure time, age at HSCT, pre-transplantation therapies, and posttransplant risk factors.

Although not statistically significant, it is numerically striking, may have clinical relevance possibly affecting systolic function, and supports the few previous reports on this matter (30). This is an area that deserves further study. Echocardiography is a noninvasive, cost-effective, and readily available technique with a traditional reliance on 2D-LVEF to define systolic dysfunction. The limitations of traditional 2D-LVEF are well known, leading to 3D and speckle tracking echocardiography being recommended by expert consensus panels (15,31). The necessity for HSCT studies to use modern echocardiographic techniques to evaluate structural and functional changes in survivors has been promoted by oncology experts (32). Our study placed an emphasis on high-quality echocardiography with incorporation of modern techniques to ensure conclusive evidence of LVSD. We found a consistent difference between allo-HSCT survivors and control subjects in our measures of LV systolic function. These newer techniques can potentially lead to a higher reported incidence of cardiac dysfunction, but can also identify more patients at risk of developing HF. As is well-established, a relationship between LVEF and GLS exists, although these 2 parameters measure slightly different properties of systolic function. GLS reflects impaired longitudinal shortening and has been described as an earlier marker of myocardial damage, whereas reductions in LVEF (radial and circumferential contraction) are often first seen in more advanced",

By the time they clinically manifest, significant and irreversible damage to the myocardium has already occurred with resultant substantial morbidity and mortality. A standardized screening tool that may identify early harbingers of cardiac injury in highrisk HCT recipients is currently lacking. Based on studies in childhood cancer survivors where subtle abnormalities have been shown to be associated with subsequent heart failure, echocardiography is frequently used for monitoring pediatric HCT survivors, although this modality is not widely used for the follow-up of adult recipients. More advanced technology such as 3-dimensional imaging and speckle tracking echocardiography may lead to greater sophistication in detecting early cardiac dysfunction, which may possibly lead to earlier interventions to mitigate risks of clinically manifest heart failure. In this issue, Massey et al. (1) present a crosssectional study of cardiovascular function in a cohort of long-term allogeneic survivors with malignant and nonmalignant disorders who underwent HCT as children, adolescents, and young adults. Cardiovascular function was measured through clinical, laboratory, and transthoracic echocardiography assessments in 104 survivors and 55 healthy controls irrespective of their cardiovascular risk-factor profile. At a median time of 17.2 years since HCT, survivors had significantly higher burden of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), including decrease in 2-dimensional left ventricular ejection fraction and in global longitudinal strain compared to controls. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain impairments correlated with greater cumulative anthracycline exposure. The investigators alsofound significantly higher prevalence of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia among survivors. Most prior studies on cardiomyopathy and heart failure have primarily focused on either childhood cancer survivors or older adults with malignancy undergoing autologous or allogeneic HCT, and their extrapolation to adolescent and young adult HCT survivors including patients with nonmalignant diseases is challenging. Moreover, self-reported or registry-level data have been mostly used to study an overt and severe phenotype of cardiomyopathy/heart failure. Hence, this study is novel as it helps us understand the magnitude of subclinical LVSD among HCT survivors including recipients with nonmalignant diseases. They show a higher prevalence of LVSD with advanced echocardiographic imaging technology than what has been previously reported; especially in a cohort of HCT recipients who did not receive total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimens.

Notwithstanding the limitations, these findings have several implications in survivorship care and warrant further discussion. First, this study highlights the role of cardiovascular surveillance using echocardiograms in HCT survivors. Heart failure is recognized as a progressive disorder where patients move from subclinical dysfunction to overt heart failure over a variable period (2). It is important to detect and intervene during an earlier stage because the course is largely irreversible once heart failure has progressed to an advanced stage. However, there is no clear guidance regarding the need for routine screening, its frequency, or duration among HCT survivors. Routine use of serial echocardiograms in childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancer survivors exposed to anthracyclines and/or radiation with potential impact to the heart is endorsed by the Children's Oncology Group long-term follow-up guidelines and International Late Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group. In contrast, the international guidelines for screening and preventive practices for HCT survivors do not provide any specific recommendations regarding echocardiographic surveillance (3). Recent publications have questioned the cost-effectiveness and reproducibility of echocardiograms in surveillance (4,5). This is especially relevant when considering cost-and resource-based challenges associated with performing routine serial echocardiograms for the entire and increasing numbers of HCT survivor population. The investigators do not tell us whether better technology adds substantially to the time-tested and widely available 2D echocardiography in identifying LVSD. Also, this study was not designed to tell us how and when to use echocardiography to screen for early cardiac dysfunction, and how often and in which patients these early changes progress to overt heart failure. However, the high prevalence of LVSD, especially in asymptomatic patients, makes the case for continued discovery of interventions to identify and mitigate progression of early cardiomyopathy. This study provides an opportunity to discuss approaches to prevent occurrence of cardiomyopathy or heart failure in HCT survivors. Since anthracyclines and chest radiation have known association with these complications (6), several primary preventive interventions are under study to reduce their exposure in pediatric and young adult oncology population. The use of dexrazoxane as a cardioprotective agent has shown promise in mitigating anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity in the short-term and warrants longer follow-up to understand its effects on reducing late cardiovascular dysfunction (7). Ongoing trials are investigating less cardiotoxic chemotherapy regimens (e.g., liposomal preparation of daunorubicin and cytarabine [CPX-351]) and radiation-free preparative regimens. For survivors with prior exposure to cardiotoxic therapies, similar to those in current study, emphasis must be placed on secondary preventive interventions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have been used for this purpose in cancer survivors with variable degree of success and require further work in HCT population. It is also important to understand the role of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity in the development of late cardiac toxicity, for which HCT survivors are at increased risk due to conditioning regimen exposure and graft-versus-host disease (8). This study also highlights the question about why patients with similar HCT-related exposures have varying risks for developing LVSD and heart failure. A growing body of literature has shown the role of genetic risk factors in development of cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer survivors (9). How can we apply the findings of this study and existent literature to pragmatically care for young adult allogeneic HCT survivors while we await highquality evidence on appropriate screening and preventive interventions against cardiac late effects? First and foremost, these patients need life-long follow-up and high vigilance for early symptoms of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Surveillance must be individualized with a focus on those who are particularly at high-risk (e.g., exposure to high anthracycline doses and TBI). This study shows that HCT survivors who get non-TBI-based conditioning but have prior anthracycline exposure also have a high prevalence of LVSD. Young-adult survivors can be screened with echocardiography using the schedule suggested by pediatric-focused guidelines. If resources do not allow screening of all survivors, imaging can be focused on patients with high-risk exposures.

Cardiovasc Res 2019;DOXO) is the most commonly used anthracycline (5), and its use markedly increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease (6). As such, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the adverse cardiovascular effects of DOXO is an ongoing research priority, as it may help identify therapeutic approaches. To date, the majority of research on DOXO has focused on its effects on the heart and, specifically, cardiomyocytes. Mechanistic studies in preclinical models implicate excessive bioactivity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and consequent oxidative stress in DOXO-induced damage to cardiomyocytes (7,8). The excessive ROS bioactivity in cardiomyocytes after DOXO treatment appears to be mediated by some combination of increased ROS production and suppression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes(8,9). Several sources of excessive ROS production have been identified, including the mitochondria(10). Indeed, DOXO directly induces mitochondrial dysfunction and stimulates superoxide production in cardiomyocytes(11,12).Recent work suggests an important role of the vascular endothelium in DOXO-associated cardiovascular effects(13). DOXO is administered systemically, and vascular endothelial cells are exposed to circu-lating DOXO before the compound is taken up by cardiomyocytes and other tissues. In vitro studies performed in endothelial cell culture indicate that DOXO induces mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulates antioxidant enzymes, and increases ROS bioactivity (14,15). Consistent with these observations, endothelial function of intact arteries assessed by endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) is impaired in DOXO-treated animal models (16,17) and patients compared with untreated control subjects (18). However, the mechanisms by which DOXO induces this endothelial dysfunction in vivo have not been established, nor is there evidence that therapeutic strategies based on these mechanisms can preserve endothelial function after DOXO. Here, we systematically investigated the underlying mechanisms by which DOXO impairs endothelial function in intact (conduit) arteries and show that a mitochondrial-specific antioxidant can prevent these effects. METHODS Detailed descriptions of all procedures and statistical analyses are provided in the Supplemental Material. Studies were approved by the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Care and Use Committee (Pro-tocol# 2618) and conformed to the Guide for the Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57BL6/J mice (4 months of age) were randomly assigned to receive DOXO (10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection; n \u00bc 4) or sham (intraperitoneal injection of saline; n \u00bc 4). This method of administration causes cardiovascular dysfunction in 4-monthold C57BL6/J mice (19). An additional cohort of mice received DOXO (n \u00bc 4) or DOXO \u00fe the mitochondrialtargeted antioxidant mitoquinol mesylate (10-MitoQ) (250 mmol/l in drinking water; n \u00bc 5) for 4 weeks (20), initiated on the same day immediately following DOXO. Data are presented separately for each cohort for vascular endothelial function, but DOXO samples were combined for biochemical experiments. Estrogen may be protective against DOXOinduced cardiac dysfunction (21); thus, only male mice were used in the present study to determine the mechanism by which DOXO causes vascular endothelial dysfunction without the confounding effects of female sex hormones.All mice were euthanized 4 weeks following treatment via cardiac puncture (under inhaled isoflurane anesthesia). Blood was spun and plasma was isolated and saved for cell culture experiments(22)    and for assessment of circulating factors, as described in the Supplemental Appendix. Following sacrifice, carotid arteries were excised and cannulated on glass pipettes for assessment of endothelium-dependent and -independent dilation, as described in the Supplemental Appendix. Then, the thoracic aorta was dissected and cleaned, and 1-mm rings were used for assessment of total(22)  and mitochondrial-specific ROS(20)  or were flash frozen, as described in the Supplemental Appendix.

Carotid artery EDD, measured by the increase in luminal diameter in response to increasing concentrations of acetylcholine, was 57% lower in DOXO versus sham control mice (peak EDD: DOXO, 40 AE 7% vs. sham, 94 AE 3%; p \u00bc 0.006), indicating a marked impairment in vascular endothelial function with DOXO treatment (Figure 1A). To determine how DOXO impairs EDD, we first measured endotheliumindependent dilation as the dilatory response to sodium nitroprusside, a nitric oxide (NO) donor. We found no difference between groups (peak: DOXO versus sham: p \u00bc 0.724) (Figure 1B), indicating that DOXO does not impair EDD by reducing vascular smooth muscle relaxation to NO. Next, we assessed the effects of DOXO on NO-mediated EDD. Administration of the NO synthase inhibitor, N(gamma)nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), reduced EDD in both groups, but the decrease was greater in the sham mice, abolishing the group differences in EDD (p \u00bc 0.546) (Figure 1A). As a result, NO-mediated dilation (peak response to acetylcholine [ACh] alone [\u00c0] peak response to ACh \u00fe L-NAME) was 67% lower in the DOXO compared with sham mice (p < 0.001) (Figure 1C). Together, these observations indicate that DOXO impairs NO-mediated EDD rather than decreasing vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO. EXCESS TOTAL ROS-ASSOCIATED SUPPRESSION OF ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION BY DOXO. Excess bioactivity of ROS is a key mechanism underlying re-(24). To determine the effect of DOXO on vascular ROS bioactivity, we first assessed ROS in the aorta using electronic paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and found it was 40% greater (p \u00bc 0.002) in the DOXO-than Shamtreated mice (Figure 2A). Next, to determine if this excess ROS had a functional role in the impaired EDD of DOXO-treated mice, we assessed EDD in isolated carotid arteries with and without prior incubation with the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic/ROS scavenger, TEMPOL. We found that TEMPOL administration completely restored peak EDD in the DOXO mice to sham levels (Figures 2B and 2C), indicating that impaired EDD with DOXO is likely due to excessive vascular ROS bioactivity. Moreover, we found no differences in the abundance of the cytosolic (SOD1) and extracellular (SOD3) isoforms of SOD, a major endogenous antioxidant enzyme, in the aorta of the DOXO and sham animals (SOD1: p \u00bc 0.157; SOD3: p \u00bc 0.854) (Figures 2D and 2E). These observations indicate that DOXO-associated EDD impairment is likely due to excessive bioactivity of ROS without stimulating expected compensatory increases in SOD1 or SOD3. ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIAL-SPECIFIC ROS IN DOXO-INDUCED ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION. DOXO is reported to induce excess bioactivity of mitochondrial ROS in endothelial cells in vitro (25), but the effects of DOXO on mitochondrial ROS in intact arteries has not been investigated. Accordingly, we next assessed mitochondrial ROS bioactivity in the aorta. We found that aortic mitochondrial ROS was 52% greater (p < 0.001) in DOXO-treated mice compared with sham (Figure 3A). To determine if this excess mitochondrial ROS plays a role in DOXOinduced endothelial dysfunction, we incubated carotid arteries from DOXO-treated mice with the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, prior to assessing EDD.

We found that aortic SOD2 abundance was w70% lower in DOXO versus sham (p < 0.001) (Figure 3D). Together, these results indicate that the greater total bioactivity of vascular ROS and tonic ROS-related suppression of EDD in DOXO-compared with sham-treated mice is mediated by excessive bioactivity of mitochondrial ROS in the absence of appropriate compensatory up-regulation mitochondrial SOD antioxidant defenses.STIMULATION OF TOTAL AND MITOCHONDRIAL ROS BIOACTIVITY BY DOXO TREATMENT IS INDUCED BY SYSTEMIC CIRCULATING FACTORS. We have recently shown that in vivo pharmacological treatments can influence ROS bioactivity in cultured endothelial cells by inducing changes in the circulating milieu that persist after the treatment compound has been cleared from the circulation (22). We hypothesized that this mechanism might be involved in excessive ROS stimulation after DOXO treatment, as DOXO and its primary metabolite, doxorubicinol, are cleared from plasma within 24 to 96 h of administration (26). To test this hypothesis, we used an ex vivo model in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are treated for 24 h with ROS with plasma obtained from DOXO and sham-treated mice (upon sacrifice) after which ROS was assessed (22).",

An increase in mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) with doxorubicin contributes to a state of oxidative stress and reduction in nitric oxide (NO) signaling that promotes the development of endothelial dysfunction in conduit arteries. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant treatment with MitoQ may be a therapeutic strategy for reducing oxidative stress and preserving conduit artery endothelial function with doxorubicin to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. stimulation of excess vascular ROS, consistent with recent observations from our laboratory in the setting of aging (22). The scope of the present investigation precluded an exhaustive interrogation of the identity of the factors involved. However, using a targeted plasma metabolomics analysis, there was a tendency to an overall lower abundance of nucleic acid bases (adenosine, thymidine, cytidine, and guanine), as well as glycolytic and pentose phosphate intermediates, all of which may be associated with states of higher oxidative stress (28,30,43). Particularly, diphosphate and lactate were positively related to vascular mitochondrial ROS. In a second targeted analysis, we assessed the abundance of circulating cytokines, chemokines, and VEGF-A in plasma from DOXO and sham mice, given that DOXO chemotherapy increases circulating abundance of pro-inflammatory cytokines (32) and inflammation can stimulate synthesis of ROS (44). This analysis revealed substantially lower circulating VEGF-A concentrations in the DOXO-treated mice. As a follow-up, we subsequently showed that restoring VEGF-A to sham levels normalized mitochondrial ROS in endothelial cells, demonstrating a role for VEGF-A in regulating endothelial cell mitochondrial ROS with DOXO. These results are in agreement with previous findings in mice in which wholebody overexpression of VEGF-B prevented DOXOinduced impairments in aortic EDD and cardiomyocyte mitochondrial respiration (17). Chronic oral supplementation with the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant MitoQ reverses age-related impairments in NO-mediated endothelial function by mitigating excessive mitochondrial ROS-related suppression of EDD (20,45). The present study demonstrates that chronic MitoQ supplementation also prevents the increases in mitochondrial ROS and consequent reductions in NO-mediated EDD in conduit arteries induced by DOXO treatment. This is potentially clinically relevant as MitoQ is commercially available and safe for use in humans (46,47), and we have shown that 6 weeks of oral supplementation with this compound improves endothelial function in healthy older adults (45). Patients who have undergone DOXO chemotherapy also have vascular endothelial dysfunction (18), and nonspecific (48) and mitochondrial-targeted (49,50) antioxidant therapies can be effective in settings of DOXOinduced cardiomyopathy. As such, MitoQ may hold promise for anthracycline-treated patients, although the use of antioxidant treatment with chemotherapy should strictly adhere to National Cancer Institute guidelines (33). STUDY LIMITATIONS. Future preclinical studies should consider other experimental approaches to facilitate translation to patient populations, including use of tumor-bearing animals to model human cancer; administering DOXO intravenously in smaller consecutive doses over time; larger sample sizes; and mechanistic analyses to determine if the treatment has direct or off target effects. Additionally, future studies should assess cardiac function in parallel with vascular function. Endothelial cells produce endothelin (ET)-1, a provasoconstrictor and pro-atherogenic molecule that is elevated in the setting of heart failure (51) and in patients treated with DOXO chemotherapy (52,53). Moreover, ET-1 stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in endothelial cells (54). Thus, strategies aimed at preventing DOXO-induced increases in ET-1 may lower endothelial mitochondrial ROS production and improve cardiovascular function. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that DOXO-induced endothelial dysfunction in intact conduit arteries is mediated by reduced NO signaling secondary to excessive bioactivity of mitochondrial ROS in the absence of an appropriate compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial SOD (Central Illustration). Importantly, we show that chronic oral supplementation with the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant MitoQ can prevent DOXO-induced endothelial dysfunction in conduit arteries of nontumor-bearing mice by mitigating excessive mitochondrial ROS suppression of EDD. Healthy vascular endothelial function is associated with a marked reduction in future risk of heart failure (55), the major clinical cardiovascular consequence of anthracycline treatment (56). As such, lifestyle and pharmacological strategies that preserve endothelial function hold promise for preventing heart failure and other adverse cardiovascular outcomes associated with anthracycline cancer therapy.",

KEY WORDS chemotherapy, mitochondrial antioxidant, reactive oxygen species APPENDIX For an expanded Methods section as well as supplemental figures and tables, please see the online version of this paper. nthracycline antibiotics have been in use for more than half a century in the treatment of cancer and the dose-limiting cardiovascular toxicity has been recognized for most of that time. Despite this and other toxicities, anthracyclines continue to be important components of chemotherapy for both solid and hematologic malignancies. There has been a great deal of effort put into understanding the mechanisms for the cardiovascular toxicity of anthracyclines and development of strategies to limit the adverse effects, while not interfering with the antitumor efficacy. Preclinical models have been used extensively, and many rodents have been sacrificed in the hopes of making anthracyclines a safer class of medications for humans. Clayton et al. (1) have added to that effort and in an elegant set of experiments advance the concept that protection of vasculature with repletion of mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 could be the answer to this age-old question. The effects of anthracyclines on mitochondrial function with increased generation of oxidant stress are well established, including the effect on mitochondrial coenzyme Q10 synthesis (2). This has led to clinical studies examining whether coenzyme Q10 repletion can prevent cardiotoxicity (3). What is novel in the work from Clayton et al. (1) is the use of modified coenzyme Q10 that is predominantly taken up into mitochondria -\"MitoQ.\" Using this orally bioavailable, over-the-counter antioxidant, they show that the endothelium-dependent vasodilation of carotid arteries is protected in mice treated with a single high dose of doxorubicin. Noting a drop in the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), the investigators advance the hypothesis that doxorubicin disruption of endothelial VEGF could be central to the effects of doxorubicin on arterial function. Preclinical experiments and clinical studies looking to understand and prevent anthracycline-associated cardiovascular dysfunction abound, and it is worth considering how the current study jives with the rest of this literature. Anthracyclines are used clinically in multiple distinct dosing schedules, and the significance of preclinical studies should be considered in this context. In the current experimental protocol, Clayton et al. (1) use a single high-dose exposure, similar to induction chemotherapy in the treatment of some hematologic malignancies, and different from the multiple cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy used in solid tumors such as breast cancer. In this context, it is notable that childhood survivors of hematologic malignancies treated with anthracyclinebased chemotherapy do show signs of persistent impaired vascular endothelial function (4). In contrast, these same changes do not persist in adult breast cancer survivors who received a series of lower-dose exposure to anthracyclines (5). This clinical literature suggests that the findings by Clayton et al. (1) may be most translatable to a subset of anthracycline-treated patients.

The effect of anthracyclines on circulating VEGF-A and other cardiovascular growth factors has been examined in samples collected from children undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

A consequence of blocking the physiological immune checkpoint is overactivation of the immune system and regulatory proteins, resulting in an enhanced inflammatory response that can affect multiple organ systems, specifically termed immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) (3). The most common irAEs encountered in clinical trials and practice are colitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, and thyroiditis (3). Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related cardiotoxicities (iRCs) are less common. Most datasets have observed iRCs in 0.1% to 0.3% of patients. Importantly, however, cases of iRC may be associated with high morbidity and mortality (4). In a recent retrospective analysis from Vigibase (World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, Basel, Switzerland) that records drug-related adverse events, there were several cases of ICI-related myocarditis and pericarditis, with some overlap with vasculitis (5).Studies from several groups have estimated the timing and incidence of iRCs (5-8), but potential indicators of iRC development using markers of inflammation such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have not been fully evaluated in patients with iRCs. In other studies, these markers have been used for identifying irAEs(9)(10)(11) and assessing cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that patients in rural eastern North Carolina (NC), a community where cardiovascular risk factors and disease are prevalent(12,13), had a high incidence of iRCs. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the inflammatory markers NLR and CRP were associated with the development of iRCs.METHODS Patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer who received ICI treatment between February 2015 and February 2018 were identified from the tumor registry at Vidant Medical Center/East Carolina University (VMC/ECU). The study was approved through the ECU Institutional Review Board (15-001400). Patients $18 years of age who completed at least 1 infusion of ICI therapy at VMC were included in the study (Figure 1). Inpatient and outpatient clinic office visits were reviewed. Demographic data including age, sex, body mass index, and ethnicity were collected. Retrospective data collected also included patient lung cancer type and stage; prior radiation therapy; prior and concomitant chemotherapy; ICI therapy and dosage; medical history; cardiac medications; baseline electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiograms; cardiac biomarkers including troponin I (TnI) and brain natriuretic protein (BNP); NLR, calculated from the complete blood count profile; and CRP. The following major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were observed after ICI: 1) non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of acute coronary syndrome symptoms; 2) new onset supraventricular tachycardias (SVT); 3) myocarditis; or 4) pericardial disorders (acute pericarditis and/or nonmalignant pericardial effusion), each in the absence of sepsis, electrolyte disorders, or other confounding medical conditions. MACE in ICItreated patients were graded based on the Common Terminology for Clinical Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland) (14). A clinical diagnosis of myocarditis was based on the European Society of Cardiology consensus statement (15) which included 2 or more of the following clinical presentations: 1) new onset (0 days up to 3 months) or subacute or chronic (>3 months of worsening dyspnea at rest or exertion and/or fatigue with left and/or right heart failure signs and/or imaging findings of new right and/or left ventricular dysfunction or elevations of BNP or TnI; 2) sudden cardiac death or aborted cardiac death; 3) new atrioventricular block or bundle branch block, sinus arrest, ventricular tachycardia, or fibrillation and asystole; or 4) tissue characterization by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showing edema or late gadolinium enhancement. Post hoc review of patients based on definitions suggested by Bonaca et al. (16) as definite, probable, or possible myocarditis were further used to verify adjudication of suspected myocarditis cases.ICI-treated patients without MACE were further categorized as patients who did not experience any irAEs, or experienced noncardiac irAEs, or who had disease progression (did not complete 4 cycles of ICI due to tumor progression).",

In the setting of ICI-related pneumonitis, an upward trend of CRP has been previously documented(19)  similar to that seen with cytokine release storm in chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cells and tumor-infiltrating (TIL) therapy(25). In patients who did not experience any irAEs throughout the ICI treatment course, CRP remained <20 mg/l. In comparison, a significant >2-fold elevation in CRP, compared to baseline, was observed during the time of MACE and irAE. These findings are similar to a previous study conducted by",

The protective roles of PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 in the intricacy of the immunityinflammatory environment against development of atherosclerotic plaque and myocardial infarction have also been previously described in animal models. Hypercholesteremic PD-L1 and PD-1 knockout mice have an exaggerated T-cell-mediated immune response and cytokine secretion that results in a larger atherosclerotic lesion size composed of numerous CD8 \u00fe T cells and apoptotic core (29,30). Similarly, CTLA-4 inhibition results in accelerated atherosclerosis that can be mitigated by CTLA-4-Ig (31). Thus, in the setting of ICI use, this may result in a proatherosclerotic inflammatory signal leading to an increased risk for the development of iRC in patients with underlying coronary heart disease. In cases of ICI-related myocarditis, an increase in inflammatory cells, particularly abundant T cells and macrophages were observed in the postmortem assessment of the myocardium (4).

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents nearly 80% of all lung cancer cases, with most of these cases diagnosed at an advanced stage (1). Although targeted therapies have redefined treatment options for patients with molecularly defined NSCLC (e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutant and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK]-rearranged NSCLC), these therapies are ineffective in those whose tumors lack such genetic alterations. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) harness the immune system and have emerged as novel treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer (2). This approach has resulted in improved survival and a more favorable toxicity profile than conventional chemotherapy. ICI target immune \"brakes,\" systematically activating of immune cells, particularly T lymphocytes, and providing antitumor responses.

To the best of our knowledge, only 1 other case of giant cell myocarditis on ICI therapy has thus far been published. The context differed from our patient's given that the tumor was melanoma, the therapy was ipilimumab (targeting CTLA-4), and cardiovascular death was the outcome (7).The moderate EV-B RNA load associated with major 5\u02b9 full-length viral populations supported the hypothesis of an opportunistic acute viral infection as the cause of the late-onset fulminant myocarditis in our patient. Endomyocardial inflammatory damage could result from EV-induced cytopathic effects and cellular autoimmune mechanisms. The presence of endomyocardial giant cells may have been related both to viral and ICI-induced autoimmune cellular dysfunctions, acting synergistically and resulting in myocarditis. As far as the pathophysiology, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in suppressing inflammation induced by viral infection, allograft transplantation, as well as autoimmune mechanism, protecting tissues from acute histopathological damage. Viruses, specifically EV-B, have developed various strategies to escape from innate immune responses including blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Indeed, cleavage activities of EV-B proteinases can down-regulate PD-L1 expression in cardiac cells in vivo and in vitro inducing severe inflammatory damage (8). Here, on EMB, PD-L1 was only expressed by inflammatory cells and not by cardiomyocytes. Total disruption of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway both by EV-B infection and ICI in cardiac tissue might explain the clinical and histopathological severity of our case. We further hypothesized that ICI therapy cessation may have reestablished T-cell immunity, resulting in viral clearance and complete clinical and imaging recovery.",

Physical examination, pelvic ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) revealed a 6.4 \u00c2 4.3-cm invasive uterine cervical tumor and a lytic bone lesion in the right ileum. Total body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT imaging (Figure 1) showed intense uptake of the tracer in the pelvic mass, the lytic bone lesion, and the IVS (standardized uptake values [SUV] \u00bc 7.0) corresponding to a single 2.4 \u00c2 1.6-cm tumor mass observed in the contrast-enhanced CT.Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal biventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction[LVEF] of 55%), no valvular abnormalities, and an ill-defined solid mass. CT angiography of the heart showed a heterogenous mass involving the mid-distal septum with delayed contrast enhancement. Cardiac MRI (CMR) characteristics of the mass included rapid gadolinium uptake in first-pass perfusion, delayed contrast enhancement, as well as isointense and hyperintense signals in T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, respectively. A biopsy of the cervical mass and the lytic bone lesion confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated SCC. Biopsy of the cardiac mass was deemed unnecessary at this stage, given the bone metastasis and multimodality imaging of the heart findings that were highly suggestive of malignancy. The multidisciplinary cardiac tumor team comprising medical and radiation oncology, cardiology, radiology, and cardiothoracic surgery specialists recommended systemic cancer therapy. The patient received 18 courses of carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with bevacizumab (Avastin, Genetech, South San Francisco, California) with complete resolution of the cervical tumor and the bone metastasis after 4 months of therapy.However, the cardiac metastasis decreased only slightly in size, and 18 F-FDG-PET/CT imaging showed an increase in tracer uptake intensity from 7.0. to 13.1 SUV. Given the patient's young age, excellent response to systemic therapy (excluding the heart), and lack of alternative effective therapy, we proceeded with surgical resection of the metastasis. Surgery(Figure 2) was performed using normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. The tumor was exposed via a longitudinal incision in the right ventricle parallel to the IVS, carefully preserving the left anterior descending coronary artery. A 6 \u00c2 5-cm elliptical portion of the septum including the tumor mass was excised, preserving the septal papillary muscle of the tricuspid valve. It was difficult to ascertain a clean margin in the posterior-basal septum area. The septum was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch sewn into the left ventricular aspect of the septum. Theventriculotomy was then closed and the patient weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass. Transesophageal echocardiography after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass showed mildly reduced LVEF (40%) secondary to asynchronous contraction and loss of septal contribution to global left ventricular function, as well as trace mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Gross pathology clearly demonstrated the tumor. However, tumor histology revealed areas of interstitial fibrosis, necrosis, and areas of inflammation, and there was no evidence of a viable tumor in the entire specimen. Because the pathological report was consistent with no active disease in the heart and a follow-up 18 F-FDG PET/CT after surgery confirmed complete response of all tumor sites, the multidisciplinary team recommendation was to proceed with therapy with curative intent. Shortly after surgery, the patient received 50 Gy of external beam irradiation to the pelvis boosted by 27.5 Gy of vaginal brachytherapy. The patient recovered uneventfully, returned to New York Heart Association functional class I, and continued clinical and imaging follow-up at 3-to 4-month intervals. Repeat 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed complete resolution of the malignancy. Two years after surgery, CMR and 18 F-FDG PET/CT were highly suggestive of local cardiac recurrence showing a 1.6-cm mass in the posterior-basal IVS. The 18 F-FDG PET/CT tracer avidity increased from 0 to 4.7 and up to 13 SUV within a few months. Echocardiographic assessment of the septum was suboptimal, possibly due to post-operative changes and the presence of patch. Transesophageal echocardiography-guided endomyocardial biopsy was negative for tumor. Nevertheless, systemic treatment using the same combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California) was resumed. Forty-five months after initial diagnosis, the patient was in New York Heart Association functional class I to II. CMR showed a slight decrease in the IVS mass size to 1.4 cm. The pathological avidity in FDG-PET decreased to 5 SUV. There were no other systemic or pelvic new findings.",

Excellence, rigor, and community. These are the principles to which we at JACC: CardioOncology strive for and use to guide us in our decision-making. Each journal issue has been built on a strong foundation of original basic, translational, and clinical science; seminal reviews and primers; educational case challenges; impactful patient perspectives; and global viewpoints from key leaders in cardiology and oncology. We have held international sessions at the China International Heart Failure Congress and the Global Cardio-Oncology Society Meeting in Brazil (2), and have hosted live, interactive Journal clubs (3); virtual case presentations (4); and podcast interviews highlighting the patient's perspective (5). As I reflect on the past year and the wonderful advances we have made together as a community, I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude. I am thankful to the communities of cardiology and oncology, and to our enthusiastic and engaged readers who turn to JACC: CardioOncology to learn the most current knowledge in our field. We are committed to providing highly accessible content, and we launched original research podcast summaries in March 2020, recorded by our Associate Editors to provide their unique context to the papers. Our podcasts have had >1,500 downloads since April 2020. I am grateful to the authors who have entrusted us with their work. Manuscript submissions have continued to grow, and we have a strong, healthy submission volume. The depth and breadth of topics published in JACC: CardioOncology within our first year have been remarkable, with some of our most downloaded pieces covering topics including coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) (6,7); amyloidosis (8); cardioprotective strategies in both primary and secondary prevention (9-12); cancer therapies, including osimertinib, CAR T cell, androgen deprivation therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and their",

In addition to the physical burden of disease, there is an emotional and financial toll on patients, family members, and the health care system at large (2). The success of novel cancer therapies has resulted in significantly improved disease-free and progression-free survival for many cancers; however, many conventional and newer cancer treatments, including radiation therapy, chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies, and immunotherapies, are also associated with an increased risk of a number of adverse effects, including cardiovascular toxicity (3). By 2040, it is estimated that there will be approximately 26.1 million cancer survivors in the United States alone. Many of these patients also may be at risk for or experience cardiovascular risk factors or disease (4). Traditionally, cardio-oncology programs that specialize in the monitoring, prevention, detection, and treatment of cardiotoxicity in patients with cancer have been located in large academic quaternary institutions. However, an increasing number of programs are currently being developed in smaller community practices. In 2014, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) National Cardio-Oncology Survey identified multiple factors that have traditionally acted as barriers to developing cardio-oncology programs nationally, including lack of funding, limited interest, lack of infrastructure, and lack of educational opportunities (5). Such limitations directly impact the number of practicing cardiologists who have expertise in cardio-oncology, which may result in significant public health implications, given the rapidly increasing number of cancer survivors.",

The surveys were designed to enable participants to complete answering all questions in <5 min to enhance response rate. Clinicians received reminders 4 times over a 3-week period. The results of the surveys were analyzed to determine current levels of awareness and to identify opportunities to enhance and expand education and address knowledge gaps for both specialist groups. Data were directly and securely exported to Microsoft Excel (2010), within which frequency tables were tabulated using Visual Basic for Applications-coded commands. Data are reported in frequency and proportion format. After identifying specific knowledge gaps from these surveys, the cardio-oncology subcommittees of FCACC and FLASCO developed brief educational materials focusing on 11 fundamental topics in cardiooncology. These documents were designed to be delivered electronically to FCACC and FLASCO memberships in early 2020. The topics were not intended to be in-depth reviews, but instead brief outlines in crucial areas of cardio-oncology for clinicians. Each topic also included linked references for those interested in obtaining further information (6). A total of 303 physicians completed the surveys: 165 members (5.8%) from FLASCO and 138 members (5.5%) from the FCACC.

The design and results of IMPROVE-IT have been published previously (11,12). IMPROVE-IT was a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 18,144 patients from October 26, 2005 to July 8, 2010 after a period of stabilization following a hospitalization for ACS (11). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner to once daily treatment with either 40 mg simvastatin plus 10 ezetimibe or 40 mg simvastatin plus matching placebo. The study population included men and women age $50 years who had been hospitalized within the previous 10 days for ACS, comprising myocardial infarction with or without ST-segment elevation or high-risk unstable angina. To be eligible, the LDL-C level measured within 24 h after hospital admission had to be 50 to 125 mg/dl for patients not receiving prior lipid-lowering therapy, or 50 to 100 mg/ dl for patients on prior long-term prescription of lipidlowering therapy. Major exclusion criteria most relevant to the current analysis included active malignancy or any clinically significant condition other than atherosclerotic vascular disease. Excluded were patients with malignancy diagnosed within 5 years or who were receiving treatment for malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated in situ tumors and nonmelanotic skin malignancy. Other exclusion criteria were hemodynamic instability, acute ischemic or arrhythmic events within 24 h before enrollment, creatinine clearance <30 ml/min, active liver disease, or prior use of statin therapy with a potency higher than 40 mg of simvastatin. STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary endpoint of IMPROVE-IT was a composite of cardiovascular death, major coronary event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, rehospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization occurring $30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. After the publications of the SEAS trial in 2008, the investigators of IMPROVE-IT designed and implemented a protocol to review all tumors occurring during the trial in previously and future-enrolled patients through the end of follow-up. The primary malignancy endpoint consisted of all first new, worsening, or relapsing malignancies, excluding nonmelanotic (i.e., basal and squamous) skin malignancies. The investigators were trained to report all suspected tumors (benign or malignant) using a prespecified data collection tool designed specifically for this study by the Executive Committee in consultation with the independent Oncology Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) (Supplemental Appendix). The completeness of data reported for tumors was closely monitored on site and supplemented by a review of all adverse events reported. All suspected tumors were adjudicated by a pair of independent oncologists unaware of assigned treatment and lipid levels. Pathology reports were used as a primary source of information when available. The tumors were initially classified as malignant or benign, and then subclassified as new versus present prior to randomization. If present prior to randomization, malignancies were additionally characterized as worsening versus relapsing versus stable. Further classifications were performed by organ system disease and malignancy extent. The malignancy extent for solid tumor was graded as: 1) local disease only; 2) spread to contiguous structures; 3) metastatic; and 4) unknown. The extent for leukemia, lymphoma, and other blood malignancies was graded as: 1) acute; 2) chronic; and 3) unknown. The relationship between the malignancy and the vital status was adjudicated by the Oncology CEC. Nonmalignancy deaths were reviewed by a central CEC consisting of neurologists (who reviewed stroke and intracranial hemorrhage) or cardiologists (all other nontumor cases). Disagreements between members were resolved by consensus. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Baseline characteristics stratified by the development of post-randomization malignancy are reported as frequencies and percentages for categorical variable and compared using the chi-square test. Continuous variables were reported as medians with 25th and 75th percentiles (quartile 1 to quartile 3) for continuous variables and compared using the Wilcoxon test. All analyses were performed first on a modified intention-to-treat basis defined as patients who received at least a single dose of the study drug. If a patient developed several primary malignancy endpoints, the first event was used for the primary analysis. Malignancies are presented as Kaplan-Meier (KM) rates at 7 years stratified by the treatment group and compared using the log-rank test. The cumulative incidence plots for the primary malignancy endpoint and the secondary endpoint of death due to malignancy were presented graphically using KM product-limit method. In addition, the frequencies and percentages of malignancy by location are presented by treatment group. The Cox proportional hazard (PH) regression model was used for the analysis and data presented with HR and 95% CI comparing the ezetimibe/simvastatin arm with the placebo/simvastatin arm. We tested for effect modification by evaluating the interaction terms for highrisk subgroups, including gender, age ($75 years vs. <75 years), smoking status (current vs. past vs. never), total cholesterol quartiles, body mass index categories, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, TIMI Risk Score for Secondary Prevention (13), and randomized treatment on the risk of the primary malignancy endpoint. The PH assumption was satisfied using visual inspection of Schoenfeld residual plots and performing Supremum test for PH assumption. Sensitivity analyses were performed considering different definitions of malignancy events: 1) new, worsening, and relapsing malignancies; 2) new malignancies only; or 3) worsening or relapsing malignancies only. For each malignancy endpoint, we performed additional analyses including and excluding basal cell and squamous cell malignancies",

The adjusted AUCs were similar to the AUCs calculated in our sample, suggesting the models were wellvalidated internally.ATTR-CM has increasingly been diagnosed in recent years, due to improved accuracy of noninvasive imaging modalities, enhanced awareness, and development of effective disease-specific treatment options.The spectrum of patients diagnosed ranges from preclinical hATTR mutation carriers to HF with preserved ejection fraction patients presenting with clinical HF, and to those with end-stage disease. It is critical to accurately risk stratify ATTR-CM patients to identify those that need closer clinical follow-up and are more likely to benefit from current and future treatments.Diuretic dose has been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality in other HF cohorts(4)(5)(6)(7)13,14).Putative mechanisms for worse outcomes with loop diuretic agents include activation of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems (15) leading to increases in ventricular filling pressures, decreased glomerular filtration rate due to changes in renal blood flow (16), and exacerbation of arrhythmias (17). For ATTR-CM patients with decreased reserve, increased filling pressures, worsening renal function, and arrhythmias could exacerbate an already precarious condition. It has also been proposed that a higher diuretic dose may serve as an indicator of worse disease severity rather than as a mediator of outcomes (4). ATTR-CM results in a predominantly restrictive HF phenotype, resulting in declines in stroke volume and cardiac output with high right atrial pressures. Hence, a decline in renal perfusion pressure leads to progressive cardio-renal syndrome and is likely a contributor to the higher diuretic requirements over time. The UK model has shown that eGFR is a strong predictor of outcomes in ATTR-CM. Although diuretic dose and eGFR may be interrelated, our analyses show that diuretic dose remains an independent predictor of mortality, even after adjusting for eGFR. models are most frequently used in clinical practice.There has, however, been interest in other potential predictors of risk in ATTR-CM. For example, despite the effectiveness of nuclear imaging in the diagnosis of ATTR-CM(18,19), its ability to risk stratify those with confirmed ATTR-CM has yielded discordant findings as to whether or not increased radiotracer uptake is associated with mortality(18,(20)(21)(22).There has also been interest in the use of echocardiographic-derived parameters including global longitudinal strain, early mitral inflow, deceleration time, myocardial performance index, and stroke volume index as predictors of adverse outcomes; however, there is not, as of yet, any formal staging system that incorporates these parameters for ATTR-CM(18). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging parameters including native T1, extracellular volume, and the presence and pattern of late gadolinium enhancement have also shown promise as prognostic markers in cardiac amyloidosis, but it requires advanced imaging, and much of the data have been with light chain, rather than ATTR, amyloidosis, with extracellular volume perhaps the most robust predictor in ATTR-CM",

In ATTR-CM, the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality were QRS duration, highsensitivity troponin-T, and NT-proBNP(24). As far as we know, there have not been attempts to assessdiuretic dose or NYHA functional class as predictors of adverse outcomes in ATTR-CM, despite the extensive data for diuretic dose and NYHA functional class as risk factors in other HF populations. In this study, we validate the previously published Mayo and UK ATTR-CM models in a relatively large ATTR-CM cohort. We confirm that they each have moderate discriminatory ability in their current forms. A recent study comparing the 2 risk models in 175 ATTR-CM patients found that the UK model had better discrimination than the Mayo model (25). Our analysis found similar results, with the UK model performing slightly better than the Mayo model, although the difference was not significant. We sought to increase the accuracy of risk stratification while keeping the overall model parsimonious with easily obtainable data from the clinical setting.

Adding these easily obtainable parameters resulted in a substantial incremental gain in AUC, increasing the AUC for the Mayo risk model from 0.693 to 0.798 and the UK risk model from 0.711 to 0.813 for all-cause mortality (Central Illustration). The gain in AUC of w0.10 for both the Mayo and UK models when adding diuretic dose and NYHA functional class supports the use of these variables for clinical decision-making. Although not the focus of the current study, we did test the SHFM in this cohort, as it is widely used in other HF populations. Despite the model not being developed for ATTR amyloid patients or HF with preserved ejection fraction, it also showed robust discriminatory ability in ATTR-CM with an AUC of 0.820, probably due to inclusion of diuretic dose and NYHA functional class in the SHFM. However, the SHFM is complex and includes many variables, which may not be readily available in a routine clinic visit. Further, the benefit of HF medications including neurohormonal blockade, which is included in the SHFM has not been proven in the ATTR-CM population. In fact, there is some concern that standard HF guideline directed medical therapies for reduced LVEF, such as beta-blockers, may be detrimental in this population. We find that the much simpler Mayo or UK models, after the addition of diuretic dose and NYHA functional class, was similar in discriminatory ability to the full SHFM despite containing fewer variables and being more readily accessible. ATTR-CM is an emerging disease with increasing recognition over the last decade. As more patients are diagnosed, accurate risk stratification will become more important. Currently, the Mayo and UK risk models provide patients with an estimate of their prognosis. The addition of diuretic dose and NYHA functional class to these models offers incremental insight into disease severity. Given the recently observed difference in benefit of treating ATTR-CM for NYHA functional class I to II versus class III with the ATTR-ACT (Tafamidis in the Transthyretin Amyloidosis Cardiomyopathy Clinical Trial) (26), better understanding of disease progression is needed to guide therapeutic decision-making.

However, we did not separate the data according to these 2 groups due to the limited sample size. With respect to sample size, although our cohort was not large, it is still one of the larger cohorts of ATTR-CM patients studied to date. The study involved a single referral center with primarily NYHA functional class I to III, so its generalizability to other centers, and to those with pre-clinical or end stage disease needs to be tested.Additionally, we did not externally validate our models, given the lack of readily accessible datasets, but plan to do so in future studies. We also did not create separate derivation and validation cohorts secondary to sample size, but we did perform internalvalidation with bootstrapping. The laboratory values in our dataset included both BNP and NT-proBNP and both troponin-T and troponin-I, which were each combined into a single variable. Ideally, all patients should have the same laboratory test performed at baseline. However, the need to combine different assays arguably reflects real-world practice where different institutions will use different troponin and BNP assays. In the current study, we demonstrate that diuretic dose and NYHA functional class are strong independent predictors of all-cause mortality and the composite outcome of all-cause mortality or cardiac transplantation. We validate the Mayo and UK ATTR-CM risk scores, demonstrating that each of these has moderate discriminatory ability in our ATTR-CM cohort. When added to either the Mayo or UK risk scores for ATTR-CM, diuretic dose and NYHA functional class provide incremental predictive and discriminative utility, while maintaining calibration. Given that diuretic dose and NYHA functional class are easily obtainable data points, these should be considered when risk stratifying patients with ATTR-CM in the clinical setting.

Although intraventricular septal thickness was one of the first prognostic markers described, that variable is not independently predictive of survival in AL or ATTR. Measurements of overall cardiac function and physiologic adaptation may be more important in assessing response to therapy than simple structural variables. The time frame between the onset of noncardiac manifestations such as carpal tunnel syndrome and spinal stenosis suggests that ATTR-CM may develop very slowly which perhaps allows for physiologic adaptation of the heart, lungs, and peripheral vasculature. If treatment is successful in slowing progression or promoting regression of disease, the changes may be difficult to detect with current cardiac imaging techniques, at least in the short term. The next frontier in determining prognosis in ATTR lies in the assessment of patients found to have TTR deposition in noncardiac tissues. Many centers are performing clinical or research studies to detect the presence of TTR in ligaments from carpal tunnel release or surgery for spinal stenosis. Although patients with ATTR-CM often have a history of carpal tunnel syndrome or spinal stenosis, it is not known if all patients with TTR amyloid in these tissues will develop ATTR-CM. These patients may be considered \"Stage A\" ATTR, at risk for the development of ATTR-CM, analogous to the stages",

All other authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose. The authors attest they are in compliance with human studies committees and animal welfare regulations of the authors' institutions and Food and Drug Administration guidelines, including patient consent where appropriate. For more information, visit the JACC: CardioOncology author instructions page.Among their overall cohort of 196 patients, 23 patients (11%) developed MACE, including 9 patients with \"possible\" myocarditis, 3 with NSTEMI, 7 with SVT, and 4 with pericardial disorders. The investigators hypothesized that baseline inflammatory state, as measured by a neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), would be higher in patients with MACE than those without.Indeed, baseline NLR was elevated in patients who developed MACE compared to those without MACE, as well as those without other irAEs. There were no differences between baseline CRP concentrations among the groups. Both NLR and CRP at the time of MACE were significantly increased from baseline values. Based on those findings, the authors concluded that NLR and CRP may be useful in the screening and diagnosis of MACE in patients with lung cancer treated with ICI. Cardiovascular toxicities after ICI therapy in lung cancer patients have not been well described, so the authors should be congratulated on completing this study. However, there are a number of limitations with phenotyping this cohort(11). First, the authors used a broad and nonstandard definition of MACE, which conventionally has been defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure(12). In this case, the authors defined MACE as myocarditis, NSTEMI, pericardial disease, or SVT and assumed those endpoints all represented immune-related cardiotoxicities. Although myocarditis has an immune-related pathophysiology and an established and biologically plausible complication of ICI treatment, that may not be the case for isolated myocardial infarction or SVT. It was also unclear if the same underlying biomarkers would predict these inherently different disease processes. Also concerning was the lack of application of standard diagnostic modalities to diagnose myocarditis. Of the 9 patients who developed myocarditis, none underwent tissue characterization using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or biopsy to confirm the presence of myocardial inflammation(13). Whether the patients truly had myocarditis remains unclear. It is worth noting that, although all 9 myocarditis cases in this study only met \"possible\" criteria, suspected cases could still meet \"probable\" or \"definite\" myocarditis criteria without advanced imaging through a robust standard cardiac workup(13). Similarly, pericardial diseases may represent pericarditis, which may be immune-related, or pericardial effusion, which is related to the cancer itself. Radiation therapy prior to immunotherapy has been postulated to prime an endogenous antigen-specific immune response; however, this \"double hit\" may make lung cancer patients more susceptible to pericardial disorders(14). Prior analysis of VigiBase (World Health Organization, Basel, Switzerland), the WHO's global Individual-Case-Safety-Report database, suggested that pericardial disorders were overrepresented in patients receiving anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy for lung cancer(15). In the present study, the incidence of pericardial disorders in an exclusive lung cancer cohort was lower than expected (2%). Whether the pericardial disorders reported were driven by immune toxicity or complications from malignancy standardization in methods and quality assurance in evaluating cardiovascular irAEs represents a major need for the field of cardio-oncology.The second issue is the lack of adjustments for confounders and the need for a multivariable analysis. The authors were interested in evaluating commonly obtained inflammatory markers as diagnostic tools for identifying and monitoring irAEs. In the present study, NLR and CRP levels were retrospectively evaluated at baseline and at the time of MACE. Although these assays are routinely available and inexpensive, elevations in NLR and CRP were not demonstrated to be specific to cardiovascular irAEs.Univariable analysis showed that baseline NLR was indeed statistically different among patients with MACE compared to patients without MACE. However, most baseline laboratory values, including hemoglobin, white blood cell counts, platelets, and creatinine levels were also significantly different between the 2 groups. By not adjusting for potential confounders, including any hematological markers, the specificity of baseline NLR in predicting ICI-associated irAE is unclear. Indeed, for NLR or CRP to emerge as important biomarkers, a multivariable analysis would be a more appropriate approach. This is especially rele-vant in this cohort where the use of higher doses of steroid in the MACE group (78% vs. 35%, respectively; p < 0.001) could be the primary driver of neutrophil demargination and elevated NLR. The authors admit that CRP has been previously shown to be elevated in their population presenting with ICI-related pneumonitis, and NLR was elevated in patients that developed noncardiac irAEs. Thus, the search for a specific biomarker indicative of cardiac irAEs continues and likely requires a prospective clinical trial. In summary, the characterization of cardiovascular toxicity among lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy represents an important contribution to the field of cardio-oncology. As the indications for immunotherapy continue to expand, the need to understand the risk factors for the development of potentially life-threatening cardiovascular toxicities arising from immunotherapy is imperative. Although inflammatory biomarkers may be associated with the development of MACE, it remains to be determined whether these markers are specific enough to change life-prolonging immunotherapy treatment strategies.

Twitter: @CardioOncology, @mandararas18. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved as a first-line treatment modality for patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). The proportion of patients with cancer who require TAVR has gradually increased, with a prevalence close to 4% (1). Although surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been a long-standing treatment option for AS patients, cardiac surgery in cancer patients carries an increased risk of infection, conduction abnormalities, bleeding, and post-procedural intensive care requirement (2). As a less-invasive option, TAVR is therefore promising. Limited data have assessed the short-and long-term outcomes of cancer patients, and there are no data regarding readmissions in this population. We investigated a large, representative, nationwide cohort to evaluate the feasibility and short-term outcomes of TAVR in this group. The Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) is a database created by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project that encompasses weighted estimates of one-half of the total hospitalizations in the United States (3). We used this registry to retrospectively select patients who were admitted between January 2012 and September 2015 and underwentTAVR using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision procedure codes (35.05 and 35.06). Among included patients, we assessed for the presence of a malignancy using the International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision diagnoses codes (140.X to 209.X). We performed chisquare tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables to evaluate comorbidities and outcomes, as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess mortality predictors after adjusting for age, sex, and all comorbidities (Table 1). All regression models were multivariable, and results were presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM, Armonk, New York) for the weighted values of observations as provided by the NRD to measure national estimates. A 2-sided value of p < 0.05 was set for statistical significance. NRD data are anonymized and considered nonhuman subject research; thus, institutional review board approval was not required. A total of 63,352 patients underwent TAVR and were included, of which 2,850 (4.5%) had a malignancy. Cancer patients were more likely to have an underlying cardiomyopathy (10.8% vs. 8.8%; p < 0.001), and heart failure (11.2% vs. 8.9%; p < 0.001), but less likely to have hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic lung disease, and other comorbidities (Table 1). Post-procedural outcomes, including all-cause inhospital mortality, stroke, bleeding, and permanent pacemaker implantation, did not differ in patients with and without cancer (Table 1). However, cancer patients were more likely to develop acute kidney injury (17.9% vs. 16.2%; p \u00bc 0.023), and to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge (20.2% vs. 17.4%; p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, and all comorbidities mentioned in Table 1, there remained no difference in all-cause in-hospital mortality (OR: 0.873 [95% CI: 0.715 to 1.066]; p \u00bc 0.183), but there was a higher likelihood of 30-day readmission (OR: 1.21 [95% CI: 1.09 to 1.34]; p < 0.001). Mortality rates were similar irrespective of stage or site of cancer. When analyzed specifically by site, only patients with colorectal (OR: 3.66 [95% CI: 2.30 to 5.82]; p < 0.001), urinary/bladder (OR: 1.87 [95% CI: 1.17 to 2.98]; p \u00bc 0.009), and uterine (OR: 5.03 [95% CI: 2.33 to 10.89]; p < 0.001) cancers were associated with the increased risk of 30-day readmission, when compared with patients without cancer. The most common cause for readmission in both groups was heart failure, followed by infections and sepsis. Current guidelines recommend TAVR to be performed in patients with a life expectancy >12 months (4). However, it is seldom possible to predict the life expectancy of cancer patients, and successful treatment of AS may allow for more intensive cancer treatment modalities, which in turn could affect survival. In many cases, symptomatic AS may be the rate-limiting step in cancer management. Thus, a multidisciplinary decision-making team of interventionalists and oncologists is warranted. A recent multicenter study comparing 222 cancer patients with 2,522 \"no-cancer\" patients undergoing TAVR showed that the 2 groups had similar 30-day outcomes, and1-year mortality was higher in individuals with advanced cancer(5). The novelty of our study lies in the reporting of higher readmission rates in such patients, as well as the observation that certain types of cancers were more commonly associated with early readmission, most notably from heart failure and infection. These summative findings support that TAVR in cancer patients is appropriate on a case-bycase basis, and that optimal post-procedural cardiovascular rehabilitation as well as careful observation for post-procedural infections may result in overall better outcomes.Our study is not without limitations. There is a paucity of information with respect to patient-level data regarding cancer treatments, as well as otherunaccounted comorbidities and causes of death. Being an administrative database, it relies on physician/ hospital reporting of outcomes. In addition, because of the retrospective nature of the analysis, it is not possible to differentiate active malignancies from history of malignancy. Information on dates of inhospital outcomes and post-discharge out-of-hospital mortality are not recorded in NRD, which prohibits conducting a competing risk analysis for in-hospital outcomes or readmission. It is noteworthy that our comparator arm represents a high-surgical risk population, as TAVR in intermediate-and low-risk patients obtained approval in 2016 and 2019, respectively. It would be interesting to see how this affects the findings of future trials, especially those that also address the question of quality of life, which is an important consideration in decision-making in advanced cancer patients undergoing palliative therapy. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.05.023Please note: The authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose.

Radiation therapy (RT) is an established treatment for breast cancer and is associated with a reduction in disease recurrence and death. Thoracic RT is associated with incidental cardiac exposure, which can lead to a spectrum of radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) (1). The mechanisms underlying RIHD are multifactorial, including direct cellular damage, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis (1). Identification of surrogate endpoints that predict the development of latent cardiac RIHD could help to guide primary prevention (2). Previous research has included heterogeneous populations with variability in RT dose and use of combination chemoradiation (2,3), resulting in difficulty in differentiating the adverse effects of each treatment modality. Accordingly, we sought to isolate a population of breast cancer patients undergoing RT without adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-naive women with left-sided breast cancer were consecutively enrolled. The protocol was approved by the institution's Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/17/Austin/533). Whole-breast radiation without regional nodal radiation was delivered with tangential, 3-dimensional conformal methods. Prescription dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions or 42.4 Gy in 16 fractions administered over 6 weeks. Treatment planning included deep inspiration breath-hold scans. Mean heart dose (MHD) was calculated. Patients underwent serial echocardiography with global longitudinal strain (GLS) at 3 time points: baseline, at completion of RT, and 12 months. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and GLS were calculated according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines. A significant decline in left ventricular function was defined as a decrease in LVEF of more than 10% to below the lower limit of normal (ejection fraction 53%) or a decrease of >15% in GLS compared with baseline, independent of symptoms. The reproducibility of echocardiographic parameters including GLS in our laboratory has pre-High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured daily during the first week of RT, and weekly thereafter. hs-cTnT assays have a limit of detection of 5 ng/l and a coefficient of variation of <10% at the 99th percentile upper reference limit of 14 ng/l. The reference range for NT-proBNP was <125 pg/ml for patients age 0 to 74 years and <450 pg/ml for patients age 75 to 99 years. Continuous variables are expressed as mean AE SD or median with 25th and 75th percentiles (Q1 to Q3) and compared using the Student's paired t-test; change in biomarker concentrations was evaluated by 1-way repeated analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Tests of normality were performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The data analysis was carried out using Stata 13.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.In total, 20 patients were recruited and underwent baseline assessment. One patient was lost to follow-up.Of the 19 patients included in the final analysis, the mean age was 64 AE 12 years. Patient and echocardiographic characteristics are presented inTable 1. The mean heart dose was 1.3 AE 0.7 Gy and the maximum heart dose was 3.9 Gy. Baseline LVEF was 62.8 AE 3.9% and GLS was \u00c020.1 AE 2.5%. No significant change was recorded at 6 weeks post-RT in LVEF (63.1 AE 4.7%; p \u00bc 0.77) or GLS (\u00c020.2 AE 2.8%; p \u00bc 0.95), or at 12 months post-RT (LVEF 64.1 AE 4.2%; p \u00bc 0.36 and GLS \u00c020.0 AE 2.8; p \u00bc 0.91). Serum hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP were unchanged throughout RT (median [Q1 to Q3] NT-proBNP 59 pg/ml [39 to 115 pg/ml] at baseline vs. 69 pg/ml [48 to 120 pg/ml] at conclusion of the study; p \u00bc 0.99; hs-cTnT 5 ng/l [5 to 7 ng/l] at baseline vs. 6 ng/l [5 to 7 ng/l] at the conclusion of the study; p \u00bc 0.42).Although contemporary RT techniques limit the MHD, it is not yet known whether this translates to reduced cardiotoxicity. There is growing enthusiasm in the detection of surrogate endpoints for latent RIHD that could identify patients at risk and guide preventative therapies. Although the use of biomarkers and GLS has shown potential for detecting early signs of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, we did not determine significant changes in these markers with RT.

Although widely available and commonly used, we did not detect any significant changes with RT. The reason for this admittedly is unclear; these markers may be less relevant to RT cardiotoxicity, or it may also be that there is no detectable injury or stress with RT in the acute setting that can be quantified by these circulating markers.Demissei et al. (3) have studied alternative markers indicative of vascular dysfunction and inflammation with promising results. Given the difference in the magnitude of radiation exposure and chemotherapy use across different disease types and sites, isolating a chemotherapy-naive breast cancer population is a strength of this study. However, the interpretation of our results is limited by the small sample size, observational design, and intermediate duration of follow-up. In this single-center study, we found no evidence of subclinical myocardial dysfunction or injury during and up to 12 months post-RT. This suggests that RT delivered with contemporary techniques is not associated with early cardiac sequelae. Larger studies are needed to further verify this hypothesis and establish the long-term risks of RIHD. MBBS, MD Matias B.

The patient had close follow-up in the cardio-oncology clinic, heart failure medications were titrated to maximumtolerated doses, and steroids were subsequently tapered. An ambulatory 24-h Holter monitor showed no significant rhythm or conduction disorders.To investigate the presence of viral markers of cardiac infection, frozen EMBs were sampled and analyzed at a quaternary university hospital laboratory (EA-4684, Cardiovir, Reims, France). Molecular assays for the detection of viral genomes were performed for enteroviruses (EVs), human herpesviruses (HHV1 to HHV8), and human parvovirus B19 (HPVB19). Only enterovirus RNA genomes were detected, and the RNA genome copynumber was then estimated by a standardized RT-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The mean EV-B viral load was 6000 genome copies/mg of total nucleic acid extracted, indicative of a moderate viral genomic replication load in the cardiac tissue. To differentiate between acute and persistent EV-B infection, we investigated the proportions and 5\u02b9 uncoding region sizes of EV-B populations using referenced molecular assays. Three EV-B populations were identified with a major proportion (45.6%) of full-length viral forms associated with 2 minor viral RNA populations, characterized by deletions ranging respectively from 8 to 36 (34.1%) and 37 to 50 nucleotides (20.3%) in the 5\u02b9 uncoding region.

The hypoxemia typically results from capillary leak syndrome, a low-pressure pulmonary edema.

Fifteen days later (34 days after hospital discharge) the patient woke up with acute shortness of breath, and was found to have an oxygen saturation of 88%. Prior to this episode she had not reported any dyspnea, but had noted nausea for the past 3 days. She was taken by ambulance to an outside hospital. Initial chest x-ray was interpreted as pulmonary edema and a possible left lower lobe infiltrate. PA d at the time of hospitalization was 22 mm Hg. She was intubated for progressive hypoxic respiratory failure. Per outside hospital records, a bedside TTE showed severe LV dysfunction but normal right ventricular function. She was treated with multiple vasopressors for presumed mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. She experienced a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia and expired later that day.CAR T cell therapy is a newer treatment for hematological malignancies and a form of immune therapy that uses a patient's immune system to detect and kill tumor cells(1). T cells are collected from the patient via apheresis and are then genetically engineered in a laboratory to produce CAR proteins on their surface, which allow them to recognize antigens and kill targeted tumor cells when reintroduced into the patient. Importantly, CAR T cell therapy can be effective in chemotherapy-refractory lymphoma, inducing durable complete remissions lasting >2 years in some patients with DLBCL (1).The side effects of CAR T cell therapy, such as CRS and arrhythmias, can be challenging to manage in patients with HF.

However, the fact that our patient died 1 month after discharge highlights how vulnerable these patients are, and that long-term success may be difficult to achieve in patients with severe LV dysfunction. It is not clear what precipitated the patient's acute decompensation with possible mixed septic and cardiogenic shock. Some have questioned whether there could be a latent period with continued circulation of CAR T cells after treatment, leading to delayed cardiac toxicities such as arrhythmias and decompensated HF; this warrants further study(3). Also, risk assessment using cardiopulmonary exercise testing in addition to RHC may help to identify suitable patients better.

Additional reasons included lack of mentoring (27%), lack of interest (26%), and inadequate reimbursement (16%). Lack of importance was noted by 16%.Whereas 29% (47 of 161) of oncologists treated patients with potential cardiotoxicities more than once per week, 36% cared for patients with cardiotoxicities less than once a week and 35% cared for these patients less than once per month. The most common cardiotoxicities reported by participating oncologists included heart failure or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (84%), arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation (43%), arterial or venous thromboembolism (42%), and QT prolongation (36%).Myocardial infarction/ischemia/vasospasm was reported by only 10% of respondents.The survey results indicated that oncologists most commonly initiated cardiac evaluations or consultations for patients treated with the following cancer treatments: anthracyclines (95%), trastuzumab (88%), vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (55%), multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (47%), and immune checkpoint inhibitors (39%). The survey presented herein represents the first step of a statewide, collaborative initiative dedicated to enhancing cardio-oncology knowledge and education. With the results collected from our surveys, we have developed a program of basic education in cardio-oncology, which is available via the electronic platforms of the FCACC and FLASCO (6). The society platforms act as a permanent repository of information and include monthly e-mail blasts that highlight cardio-oncology topics. Based on the limited number of cardiologists and oncologists with expertise in cardio-oncology, we hope that involvement at the local and state levels will encourage an increased focus on cardio-oncology in more provider groups. This may improve access to care for these complex patients, because most patients are treated in community practices rather than in large academic centers. For institutions without dedicated cardiooncology programs, our hope is that such efforts to enhance education and increase awareness may improve prevention, early detection, and coordination of care of patients who suffer from both cancer and cardiovascular disease. We developed focused educational documents for regarding 11 fundamental cardio-oncology topics (6). The goal of this program is to provide basic information regarding the most common cardiotoxic cancer treatments, including the following: anthracyclines, anti-HER-2 therapies, 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine, TKIs, proteasome inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and radiation therapy. These educational materials also focus on specific cardiac topics for patients with cancer, including thromboembolism, arrhythmias, cardiac imaging, and survivorship. The documents can be found at: https:// accfl.org/Cardio-Oncology.This project is unique in that it sought to address current cardio-oncology knowledge gaps specific to the cardiovascular care of patients with cancer among both oncologists and cardiologists in Florida; however, the proportion of respondents was very small, and we recognize this as an important limitation(7).The study design did not account for differences in responses by age, sex, or practice setting demographics. Of the respondents, 49% reported that they practiced in an academic/hospital setting, and 43% indicated that they were in private practice, with the latter group most likely being underrepresented relative to the Florida physicians' workforce. Thus, the data provided by the respondents may not be generalizable to all members of the FCACC and FLASCO. This survey is not a representative sample of Florida's physician population at large and may have sampling bias, reflecting the opinion of physicians who are more actively engaged with medical professional societies than other physicians. However, it highlights the need for further awareness, advocacy,",

            "text": "One study surveyed 303 oncologists about knowledge of cardiotoxicities in France. The results showed that only 35% of oncologists actively followed guidelines from oncological societies, and no oncologists were aware of recommendations from cardiac societies(8). However, 88% of respondents did support the development and implementation of cardio-oncology programs. These findings strongly suggest that lack of cooperation between cardiologists and oncologists is an international phenomenon. Fortunately, there also appears to be increasing support for creating new programs to address thisneed. The next step of our statewide advocacy, survey, and educational program is the establishment of a large multistate network with involvement of the ACC and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) state chapters. This will allow different states to use a similar platform to assess the needs of their own ACC and ASCO members and to develop and share methods to close knowledge gaps. Thus far, this burgeoning network includes members from 19 ACC state chapters: Florida, Missouri, Indiana, Tennessee, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas, Maryland, Virginia, Illinois, Georgia, Ohio, California, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, Minnesota, Colorado, and Milwaukee. It also includes 6 ASCO chapters from both academic and private practice settings (9) and has now also incorporated members from 9 countries with International Cardio-Oncology Society-affiliated chapters (ic-os.org), including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, England, France, Poland, Japan, and India. This network will become a platform for multiple future collaborations. We look forward to expanding our network to meet the needs of our colleagues and provide enhanced care for cardiooncology patients.
