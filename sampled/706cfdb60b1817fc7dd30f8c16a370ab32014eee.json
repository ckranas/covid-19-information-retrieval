Imaging plays a central role in staging cancer providing information which guides treatment decisions. This information is becoming increasingly complex due to the development of functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and to the highly sophisticated morphological and functional information derived from CT and MR imaging. Such advances together with the relentless increase in incidence of cancer and improved survival rates have led to rising demands for imaging studies. The goal of cancer imaging is to improve patient outcomes by providing a high quality service in which information derived is accurate, concise and relevant to patient management. Thus strategies in cancer imaging need to be developed, agreed and continually updated. Factors which influence strategies include trends in incidence and mortality, technological advance, the outcome of clinical and imaging research and multidisciplinary team working. The radiologist is a key member of the multidisciplinary team and should develop guidelines and protocols for individual tumours and have knowledge of patterns of tumour spread, the major staging classifications and current treatment options. The radiologist should advise on the choice of imaging modality and provide appropriate protocols for imaging studies. The cancer staging report is of critical importance and should contain a description of imaging findings and a clear, concise statement regarding tumour stage. In this presentation these issues will be addressed using examples in different tumour types to provide an introduction and overview to the Cancer Staging Categorical Course. Learning Objectives:",

Reznek; London/UK (r.h.reznek@qmul.ac.uk) This talk will discuss the significance of the results in cancer staging in two contexts: (a) how the results influence the patient's outcome and (b) how interpretation of the results has to be made with knowledge of the clinical situation. (a) A robust hierarchical framework exists for measuring the effect of imaging technology on the patient's health requiring assessment of the technical performance, diagnostic performance, diagnostic impact, therapeutic and health impact. Each of the steps in this framework has to be satisfactorily tested before proceeding to the next. The method of testing each step will be defined and explained using everyday examples of the application of imaging to stage cancer. Difficulties in assessing each step, particularly the therapeutic and health impact will be discussed. (b) Interpretation of the significance of the results in an individual case requires a detailed understanding of diagnostic performance. The standard parameters for the measurement of diagnostic performance includes sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. The importance of predictive values, prevalence, receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves and interobserver variation will be discussed and illustrated with examples. Learning Objectives:",

Bone marrow edema is a generic term commonly used by radiologists to describe a pattern of bone marrow changes characterized by the presence of moderate decrease in signal intensity on T1-weighted spin echo images and intermediate to high signal intensity on T2-weighted spin echo images in the bone marrow. From an histological point of view, the use of this term is rather incorrect as edema is rarely a predominant feature at microscopic analysis. However, radiologists should regard the presence of bone marrow edema as a sign indicative of an active process. The current lecture will illustrate the MR appearance of marrow edema and cover the wide spectrum of conditions in which it is observed. We will emphasize the role of the radiologist in making a specific diagnosis, starting from a non specific finding like marrow edema. The value of a multimodality approach will be emphasized. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn how to confidently recognize bone marrow edema of the femoral head at MR imaging to avoid confusion with hip osteoarthritis or femoral head avascular necrosis. 2. To emphasize the natural history of bone marrow edema lesions of the femoral head. 3. To discuss the differential diagnosis of bone marrow edema lesions including transient osteoporosis, epiphyseal stress fracture and osteonecrosis.",

The labrum is ten times stiffer than the hyaline cartilage and broadens the acetabulum by about 20 %. Degeneration of the labrum leads to mucoid/cystic transformations of the labrum matrix (=abnormal intralabral signal), followed by mild free edge blunting. Because of the abnormal internal structure labral tears may develop. In 40 -80 % of patients with degenerative osteoarthritis labral tears are found (most commonly anteriorly and anterior superiorly). They have a very low tendency of self healing -very similar to the degenerative tears in the menisci of the knee joint. On the other hand it is well known that asymptomatic labral tears are found in 42 -58 % of all persons over 50 years. Labral tears are also found in 72 % of patients with dysplasia, in patients with Perthes disease, slipped epiphysis and reduced anteversion, as well. The femoro-acetabular impingement (= Pincer impingement) and the Cam-impingement (acetabular rim syndrome) -are leading to labral damage (edema, blunting, tear, paralabral cyst) and are followed by damage of the neighbouring cartilage, ending up in early degenerative osteoarthritis. Labral tears and internal structure abnormalities may end up in the development of large paralabral cysts (filled with synovial fluid) and/or labral calcifications. It is thought that paralabral tears are connected with and based on labral tears. Learning Objectives: 1. To get good knowledge of normal anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. 2. To learn standard-imaging procedures and indications. 3. To understand common variations resulting in different joint loading. 4.

Pfirrmann; Z\u00fcrich/CH (christian.pfirrmann@balgrist.ch) Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a conflict occurring between the proximal femur and the acetabular rim. Femoroacetabular impingement is caused either by abnormalities of the proximal femur or the acetabulum. Often a combination of factors may lead to FAI. The repetitive mechanical conflict occurring in flexion and internal rotation will lead to lesions of acetabular labrum and the adjacent acetabular cartilage. Two distinct types of femoroacetabular impingement can be distinguished \"Cam\" and \"Pincer\" impingement. \"Cam\" impingement is caused by jamming of an abnormal femoral head neck junction into the acetabulum during forceful flection and internal rotation of the hip. This results in abrasion of the acetabular cartilage or its avulsion from the labrum and subchondral bone in a rather constant anterosuperior area. Chondral avulsion in turn leads to tear or detachment of the principally uninvolved labrum. Cam impingement is common in young and athletic males. \"Pincer\" impingement is the result of linear contact between the acetabular rim and the femoral head-neck junction. The femoral waist is usually normal and the abutment is the result of an acetabular abnormality, often a general over-coverage (coxa profunda) or local anterior over coverage (acetabular retroversion).",

The evaluation of cardiac metric parameters was mainly developed in the seventies and eighties by modalities of nuclear medicine. With the introduction of cardiac MR a new method without radiation exposure became available and with promising capabilities for morphometric evaluation. With the development of high gradient MR systems routine imaging of the myocardium became an important new diagnostic tool in the beginning of the nineties. Already in that time the first observations on late enhancement (LE) MR imaging of the myocardium to detect myocardial infarcts were published. Today with the development of parallel imaging MR is profiling itself as the modality of first choice for LE CMR and studies show its superiority over nuclear methods. Even reliable perfusion MR techniques become available and are also highly competitive compared to nuclear scanning. Surprisingly the latest developments in MDCT show a remarkable capability for myocardial evaluation and it is not sure were this will lead to. Stress testing became a reliable tool when cine MR imaging was used as monitoring modality instead of ultrasound and it probably will be the one and only modality that can safely and reliably monitor the myocardium during stress testing. The 3 lectures on these topics will address the developments in these fields and focus on the future role of imaging modalities in the evaluation of the myocardium. Learning Objectives: 1. To display the capabilities of myocardial radiological techniques. 2. To understand the relation between the clinical problem and the radiological application. 3. To learn how to use the different imaging techniques.",

            "text": "Myocardial stress testing: Towards an objective approach in radiological perspective D. Kuijpers; The Hague/NL (kps@xs4all.nl) Functional information about the presence of myocardial ischemia is crucial in patients with chronic chest pain. Myocardial stress imaging is based on the ischemic cascade and in radiological perspective mainly focused on the analysis of perfusion-and wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac stress MR imaging can be performed with adenosine (perfusion analysis of the left ventricle) or dobutamine (wall motion analysis). How should one apply these techniques? A diagnostic algorithm for symptomatic patients with stable chest pain is discussed. The role of CT calcium scores as the initial diagnostic filter is explained in relation to cardiac stress MR imaging. High dose dobutamine stress MR imaging is a reliable technique for the assessment of myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease. Technological advances have evolved this technique to an adequate alternative to the standard cardiac stress tests. Its high reproducibility and excellent image quality of the anatomical features of the left ventricle and left ventricular function at rest and during stress makes it an ideal technique for the comprehensive evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Besides its ability to detect myocardial ischemia, dobutamine stress MR imaging has proved to be diagnostic for myocardial viability as well. The use of myocardial tagging has improved the diagnostic accuracy for myocardial ischemia even further. Safety and feasibility of the technique has been well established. The use of this technique and the clinical applications are discussed. Colorectal cancer screening has vast potential. Beyond considerations for cost and diagnostic accuracy, the effectiveness of any colorectal screening strategy will be dependent on the degree of patient acceptance. MR colonography has been shown to be accurate regarding the detection of clinically relevant colonic polyps exceeding 6 mm in size, with reported sensitivity and specificity values of over 90%. To further enhance patient acceptance, strategies for fecal tagging have recently been developed. Techniques underlying MR colonography will be described and clinical experience with fecal tagging techniques will be outlined. There is a challenging task for radiologists in helping to improve the therapeutic management of rectal cancer patients. With the introduction of new treatment strategies there is a growing need for an accurate imaging tool to identify patients who are at risk for a local recurrence. The main risk factors for local recurrences are the CRM, the nodal status and distal location of the tumour. MR imaging is at present the best technique to evaluate the CRM. There is evi-dence that MR imaging is superior to CT for the assessment of organ invasion. The role of multislice spiral CT in rectal cancer has been tested in a Dutch multicenter study of which we are awaiting the results. Identifying nodal disease is still a diagnostic problem for the radiologist. Despite the identification of lymph nodes even as small as 2-3 mm on MR imaging, detection of nodal metastases is not possible on bases of morphological criteria. However promising results have been reported with the use of Iron oxide enhanced MR imaging for the detection of the nodal status in rectal cancer. These results will be discussed in the given lecture. Lower-extremity venous insufficiency is a common medical condition; although many people seek medical treatment for varicose veins because they find them unsightly, most also experience symptoms. Left untreated, nearly 50% of patients with significant superficial venous insufficiency will eventually experience chronic venous insufficiency characterized by lower extremity swelling, eczema, pigmentation, haemorrhage, and ulceration. Great saphenous vein reflux (GSV) is the most common underlying cause of significant varicose veins. Traditional treatment for this has been surgical removal of the GSV. Although surgical ligation and stripping of the GSV has been the most durable treatment, it is associated with significant perioperative morbidity.",

For large residual varicosities left after ablation of the highest point of reflux, there is ultrasound guided injection of foam or liquid sclerosant, stab avulsion or trivex. For reticular and spider veins there is meticulous sclerotherapy or topical laser. The choice of therapy is often a matter of physician and patient preference, but it is preferable that a radiologist involved in varicose vein therapy at the least be able to offer access to treatment for the full range of venous problems.

The first step in endovenous laser ablation is a careful history, physical examination and a venous ultrasound. Once the source of reflux is determined the patient is placed in a supine position for treatment of the greater saphenous vein (GSV). The GSV should be punctured at the lowest point on the leg as possible. The GSV is punctured using ultrasound guidance. The laser fibre is inserted through a vascular sheath, followed by the application of tumescent anesthesia. The laser fiber is deployed under ultrasound guidance from the saphenofemoral junction to the puncture site. Patients are instructed to wear 30-40 mm Hg compression hose for two weeks after the procedure. Patients are followed up at serial intervals to ensure the greater saphenous vein is occluded, along with supplementary sclerotherapy injections.

            "text": "Setting up an IR practice for treatment of varicose veins: How I did it J. Brookes; London/UK (jocelyn.brookes@uclh.org) There is growing precedent for direct clinical management of patients by radiologists. In defined specialist areas where the entire treatment spectrum is within the skill set of the radiologist, it seems reasonable for consultation and management to occur within the same clinic. This has advantages for the patient in meeting and discussing their problem and gaining true insight into the proposed treatment before committing to it. It is, most of all, a logical and efficient medical pathway for the patient and their physician. The management of thyroid masses by radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians provides such a model. Another is the clinical practice model for embolotherapy for complex AVM's. Many interventional radiologists see angioplasty follow-ups in a clinic or at least on a ward round and are familiar with direct clinical care. Most radiologists in the UK are doubly qualified as physicians or surgeons and are fully trained in direct clinical care. Laser ablation treatment for varicose veins is a specific clinical indication for which the entire treatment spectrum falls within the skill set of the interventional radiologist. The method was, indeed, developed and promoted by interventional radiologists. It is the ideal clinical indication for the establishment of a \"Clinical Interventional Radiology\" practice. The physician-radiologist can take direct referrals, advise, treat and refer or discharge as necessary, staying within her clinical competency. Building referral networks and supportive relationships with surgical colleagues is a realistic goal. Although undoubtedly challenging, establishing an IR practice is a logical (and enjoyable) specialty development at this time. The majority of lesions consist of small rounded opacities which can be classified according to position within the secondary lobule and/or relation to the pleural surface. Diseases presenting the nodular pattern include a variety of granulomatous diseases arising in the lung, haematogenous spread of diseases halting in the small vessels, and bronchogenic diseases, when the reaction to an inhaled substance is limited to the adjacent areas. Centrilobular nodules: The nodules tend to be centered at a certain distance from the pleural surface and at times also from the interlobular septa. Centrilobular distribution is more typical of diseases in which the elementary lesions originate from or near the peripheral bronchioles. Random nodules: These nodules are often of good density with sharp borders, mainly due to their being confined into the interstitium. Their distribution is reasonably uniform in the secondary lobule and parenchyma. At times they can be seen in contact with the extremities of the vascular structure from which they appear to originate (feeding vessel sign). In short, their spatial distribution appears to be uniform. Perilymphatic nodules: These nodules tend to be prevalent in the perilobular and subpleural interstitium and are therefore abundant along the costal pleura and the fissures. They are more common in diseases which spread along the lymphatics, and may therefore be found within the lobule and along the vessels and bronchi (beaded appearance). The spatial arrangement of these lesions tends to be patchy. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand why some disease present as a nodular pattern. 2. To recognize that the aspect of the nodules helps to understand their texture and localization. 3. To recognize that the distribution is very helpful to focus their origin and the underlying disease. 4. To discuss an approach to the differential diagnosis based on the distribution and appearance of abnormalities.",

It may result from interlobular and/or intralobular interstitial thickening by fluid, fibrous tissue, or infiltration by cell or other material. Although a reticular pattern can be found in a variety of diseases, the HRCT appearance of reticulation and the distribution of abnormalities are important keyfindings in the differential diagnosis. A course reticular pattern associated with severe distorsion of lobular architecture, traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis is indicative of fibrosis and can be observed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other causes of UIP. Similarly, a reticular pattern characterized by irregular cystic spaces and honeycombing is almost typical of end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. A smooth reticular pattern characterized by interlobular septal thickening and a normal lobular architecture can be found in pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, sarcoidosis, lymphangitic spread of cancer, and amyloidosis. In patients with lymphangitic spread of cancer or lymphoma, sarcoidosis, silicosis or coal worker's pneumoconiosis a nodular appearance of thickened interlobular septa can be observed. Intralobular interstitial thickening can also be seen in the absence of significant fibrosis. When this is the case, traction bronchiectasis or other manifestations of fibrosis are absent. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with the reticular pattern seen on HRCT scans and the underlying pathological changes. 2. To review the spectrum of imaging findings of the most common diseases presenting with a reticular pattern.",

It is produced by volume averaging of pathologic abnormalities too small to be clearly resolved in HRCT, i.e. minimal septal or alveolar interstitial thickening, minimal filling of the alveolar spaces, or in some cases it may be the result of increased capillary blood volume -most properly described as \"mosaic perfusion\" in the latter case. Ground glass therefore represents isolated or combined involvement of lung compartments and is non-specific. Distribution and associated lung parenchymal findings are essential for the diagnosis. To avoid pitfalls in the recognition of this pattern it should only be called on thin slices. It should also be considered that a number of factors may affect lung density including the depth of inspiration, gravitational differences, photopenic artifacts, and window and level settings. In the differential diagnosis in patients with acute symptoms pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, and infection (particularly in immunocompromize) should be considered. Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, sarcoidosis, alveolar proteinosis should be considered in chronic cases. Subpleural distribution is highly associated with the UIP histologic subtype of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Ground glass superimposed on septal thickening (\"crazy paving\") is most frequently associated with alveolar proteinosis, ARDS, lipoid pneumonia or subacute alveolar hemorrhage. When a geographic distribution is observed, assessment of the relative size of lung vessels and inspiratory and expiratory slices are essential for differentiation between vascular and airway disease.",

Knowledge and familiarity with cardiac anatomy is a prerequisite to understand both cardiac physiology and pathological changes in congenital and adult heart disease. Depiction of cardiac anatomy on imaging studies until relatively recently has involved plain X-rays, cardiac catheterizations and ultrasonography, the latter two being almost exclusively practiced by cardiologists. Indications of cardiac imaging on sequential CT or early MR scanners remained relatively limited in the everyday clinical practice, mainly due to the low temporal resolution of these modalities and/or the unacceptable required long scanning times. With the advent, however, of modern multislice CT and the evolution of cardiac MR imaging a still evolving wide spectrum of new clinical indications arises. Traditional training in Radiology during residency often does not yield familiarization with different structures in specific intrinsic organ-related tomographic planes (long-axis, short-axis, 4-chamber etc), which are mainly used by cardiologists. Cardiologists on the other hand are not generally familiar with tomographic imaging and the variety of post-processing techniques (MPR, MIP, SSD, Volume rendering etc), already widely used in everyday radiology. Successful patient management requires additional familiarization with different modalities used by both specialties, as well as establishment of a common ground of communication. This lecture will focus on depiction of cardiac anatomy on different imaging modalities, familiarization with different imaging planes, specific anatomical charac-teristics of cardiac chambers as well as anatomical variants which may mimic or cause pathology. Learning Objectives: 1. To familiarize with cardiac anatomy and most important anatomical landmarks. 2. To be able to identify different anatomical landmarks in imaging studies of normal and abnormal hearts. 3. To understand and be able to plan imaging studies in various imaging planes. 4. To be able to identify morphologically the different cardiac chambers in congenital heart disease.",

The purpose of this presentation is to (re-) introduce some general aspects of cardiac physiology and to give an insight into the basic mechanisms of cardiovascular performance as they can be evaluated with the newer imaging modalities. Starting with the smallest contractile unit, i.e. the sarcomere, the heart as a muscle and pump, will be analysed and the parameters of function, deformation and load will be discussed. The distinction between deformation parameters (wall thickening, stroke volume, ejection fraction) and intrinsic or extrinsic changes in contractility will be made. The functional implications of the specific characteristics of the circulatory components will be shown and as an example the coronary circulation will be discussed. Briefly some aspects of valvular function will be touched upon. At the end of this presentation, the participant should be able to choose the correct parameters of cardiac performance and to make a comprehensive evaluation of pump function.

The presentation of TOCS is variable due to a combination of neural, arterial or venous symptoms.

On mature fistulas, flow rate monitoring during dialysis sessions is now a well established method of screening for stenoses, with thresholds ranging from 350 mL/min for forearm fistulas to 600 for grafts. There is no indication for imaging of asymptomatic stenoses as long as the overall access flow rate is above these thresholds. In cases of clinical abnormalities with preserved flow rates, US examination can diagnose stenoses and help choose between surgical and endovascular treatment. However, angiography remains the gold standard when US does not reveal a clear explanation for clinical abnormalities or when clinical examination indicates that percutaneous dilatation would be the best treatment. US examination can be useful when monitored flow rates fall below thresholds but urgent angiography with concomitant dilatation may be preferable in order to avoid the risk of acute thrombosis.

Kinkel; Ch\u00eane-Bougeries/CH (karen.kinkel@grangettes.ch) Endometriosis corresponds to ectopic endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. Clinical symptoms include dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility, painful defecation or urinary symptoms. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to identify and differentiate locations to the ovary (endometriomas) and the bladder wall. Characteristic sonographic features of endometriomas are diffuse low-level internal echos, multilocularity and hyperchoic foci in the wall. Differential diagnoses include corpus luteum, teratoma, cystadenoma, fibroma, tubo-ovarian abscess and carcinoma. Repeated ultrasound is highly recommended for unilocular cysts with low-level internal echoes to differentiate functional corpus luteum from endometriomas. Hysterosalpingography remains the key examination for patients complaining about infertility (scheduled between day 8 and 12 of the menstrual cycle to prevent radiation of possible early pregnancy). Posterior locations of endometriosis include uterosacral ligaments, torus uterinus, vagina and recto-sigmoid. Sonographic and MR imaging features are discussed for each location. Although ultrasound is able to diagnose most locations, its limited sensitivity for posterior lesions does not allow management decisions in all patients. MR imaging has shown high accuracies for both anterior and posterior endometriosis and enables complete lesion mapping before surgery. Endometriomas are T2 and T1-hyperintense persisting at fat suppression. Posterior locations demonstrate abnormal T2-hypointense signal, nodules with occasional T1-hyperintense spots and are easier to identify when peristaltic inhibitors and intravenous contrast media are used with decreased enhancement compared to myometrium, bladder detrusor or muscularis propria of the colon. Anterior locations benefit from MR imaging urography sequences within the same examination to identify the position and possible luminal narrowing of the ureter. Learning Objectives: 1. To identify features of ovarian peritoneal, vaginal, bladder, rectal and bowel endometriosis at ultrasound and MR imaging. 2. To discuss differential diagnosis in patients with pelvic pain. 3.

The diagnosis and understanding of these arterial diseases is critical for the correct management of stroke as different treatment approaches are undertaken according to the aetiology. Atherosclerosis is, by far, the most common arterial disease among adults and other pathological processes include arterial dissection, small-vessel disease, inflammatory and noninflammatory vasculopathy and vasomotor disorders. In children there are several vasculopathies responsible for vaso-occlusive disease like sickle-cell anemia, acute regressive angiopathy and Moya-Moya disease, neurofibromatosis, dissections, vasculitis associated with intracranial and systemic infections. An overview of the major carotid and vertebral pathological diseases responsible for ischemic stroke in adults and children, highlighting the accuracy of the different imaging modalities for its diagnosis and the imaging appearance of these diseases, is given.

MR mammography (MRM) occupies a strong position among other diagnostic imaging methods. The task of a radiologist specialized in \"breast imaging\" is to rule out malignancy, staging of tumour extent or to set the diagnosis in the easiest and cheapest way, shortest possible time and with minimal patient discomfort. Combination of high quality mammography and sonography is essential. According to our experience as many as 30% of all indications to MRM are incorrect; these are mostly ambiguous focal changes (core biopsy is a method of choice) or findings of bubious microcalcification. MRM is relatively often indicated on basis of an interpretation of low quality mammograms and substitutes cheaper spot compression/magnification mammography. Main indications of MRM are: Exclusion of rupture and complications of silicon implant, assessment of scarring after breast conserving therapy, exclusion of multifocality and preoperative assessment of the extent of carcinoma in mammographically dense breast. It is suitable for screening of, \"BRCA1.2 positive\" women and for monitoring of chemotherapy. On the other hand it is inappropriate for young symptomatic women with dense breasts, in cases of clustered microcalcification or for differentiation of inflammation from inflammatory (erysipeloid) carcinoma.",

            "text": "Author also describes recommended techniques of imaging and evaluation with emphasis on standardization of procedure. He shows typical cases. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the breast has proved to be a valuable tool in the detection and work-up of breast lesions. Most of these lesions are small and not visible by other imaging modalities such as mammography or US. Thus, MRguided preoperative localization techniques or MR-guided percutaneous biopsy can provide a histologic work-up of such lesions. MR-guided preoperative localization seems to be a well-established procedure. However, MR-guided biopsy is still problematic. Although prototypic biopsy systems have been developed, considerable progress is still required. Thus, needle biopsy currently is not recommended for lesions smaller than 10 mm. Beside the potential of MR imaging of the breast for monitoring of interventional procedures MR imaging provides also the impetus for the development of dedicated systems for MR-guided therapy. A variety of minimally invasive procedures have already been used to characterize and treat breast lesions. These therapies include thermal treatments, percutaneous excision or breast lumpectomy, and interstitial radiotherapy. This course reviews current techniques for MR-guided preoperative localization and percutaneous biopsy in breast lesions. The diagnostic accuracy achievable with these techniques will be discussed. Potential for new research opportunities and directions will be provided. MR screening in high-risk patients is now a validated indication with several reports demonstrating its effectiveness for detecting breast cancer. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has a high sensitivity but a limited specificity, due to the non selective extravasation of gadolinium chelates from blood into the interstitium of both normal and pathological tissues. New techniques can be added to improve these results. The high capillary perfusion of cancers can be assessed with T2*-weighted first -pass MR imaging; hydrogen MR spectroscopy allows the detection of an abnormal choline resonance peak in cancers. First results of combined MR studies are encouraging with a very high reported specificity. MR elastography is an imaging-based method for quantitatively imaging the elastic properties of breast tissue. Preliminary results show a significant difference between normal and malignant tissues. MR imaging at 3 Tesla allows a high temporal and spatial resolution and improved also the spectroscopic data. New different contrast agents are under evaluation. Macromolecular contrast media should diffuse only across the pathological endothelium of malignant tumours. These agents seem promising and allow quantitative assessment of tumor blood flow and microvascular permeability. Current clinical applications have to define the optimal MR protocols. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxyde agents increase the detection of malignant axillary lymph nodes (no captation after intravenous injection, T2*-weighted sequence) and can be used in association with gadolinium chelates for the staging of breast cancer. Intramammary injection of this contrast medium seems possible for the detection of the sentinel lymph node. In recent years blood pool agents have received increasing attention for highresolution imaging of the cardiovascular system, as MR angiography (MRA) is less invasive and more cost-effective than conventional angiography. A prerequisite for blood pool agents is a higher efficiency on signal enhancement than non specific agents to allow visualization of small vessels, i.e. coronary and peripheral arteries. With higher r1 relaxivity, they are expected to demonstrate improved diagnostic performance, intense and selective vascular enhancement at a dose lower than doses for approved gadolinium contrast agents. Blood pool agents currently under clinical trials present a high r1 relaxivity and a vascular pharmacokinetic behaviour. For MRA, different drug design strategies, i.e. macromolecules, small molecules with reversible albumin binding, and iron oxide particles have been investigated. With imaging at 3 T and higher, their r1 NMRD profile has also to be considered to maintain r1 efficiency at high field. To fully benefit from the higher r1 and the longer vascular residence time, dedicated MRA acquisition and post-processing methods need to be implemented in concert with the blood pool agent evaluation. Dose adjustment, safety, patient benefit and cost are also key issues before marketing. Blood pool agents have many other applications, i.e. tissue perfusion, permeability and vessel wall imaging. With new MR markers, it is also feasible to target molecular actors of atherosclerosis. In conclusion, blood pool agents and their targeted derivatives are very promising for the diagnosis of vascular diseases and for molecular imaging of the unstable plaque. The great sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) to the variations of signal intensity (SI) induced by CM has led to the development of several different types of CM, which utilize the paramagnetic properties of gadolinium or manganese or the superparamagnetic properties of iron. Cell-specific CM are mostly targeted to the liver. Liver specific CM (LSCM) with a first phase of extracellular distribution give both dynamic (morphological) and late phase (functional) useful information for lesion characterization. LSCM with exclusive distribution to the hepato-cellular compartment has a very high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating hepatocellular vs non hepatocellular lesions. The use of the superparamagnetic effect of iron oxide particles is based on a distribution in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). SPIO particles are cleared from the blood by phagocytosis accomplished by RES, so that uptake is observed in the normal liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, according to the size of the particles. Malignant lesions lack both the RES and the capacity to take up particles. After SPIO injection, the darkening of normal parenchyma which surrounds neoplastic lesion increases their contrast, thus appearing more hyperintense at T2weighted images. It is necessary to have an in depth knowledge either of the biological and histological characteristics of lesions either of the enhancement mechanism of cell-specific CM to gain significant accuracy.

USPIO are currently investigated for the diagnosis of various phagocytosis associated processes, such as inflammation, encephalomyelitis and atherosclerosis. USPIO may provide a positive T1-enhancement, similar to standard Gd-based contrast agents, and a T2-effect, which correlates with the phagocytic activity of the investigated process. New applications of macromolecular Gd-based contrast agents (MMCM) are directed towards enhancement of pathological processes at high field strengths. New MR contrast agents represent receptor targeted contrast agents and \"smart\" contrast agents. As examples of receptor targeted contrast agents, folate receptor specific contrast agents and Gd-labeled monoclonal antibodies against Her-2/neu will be introduced. As examples of \"smart\" contrast agents, the galactosidase-sensitive Gd-chelate EgadMe, T 2 -contrast agents which can visualize specific oligonucleotide sequences and Ca 2+ sensitive Gd-chelates will be reviewed. Established and new MR contrast agents are currently investigated for cell labeling purposes and subsequent in vivo tracking of stem cells. Advantages and disadvantages of various MR contrast agents and labeling techniques will be explained and reviewed. The ability to trace the in vivo stem cell distribution with non-invasive imaging techniques may improve our understanding of how stem cells mediate recovery of injured organs and may be ultimately applied clinically to monitor transplantation procedures.

Vaupel; Mainz/DE (vaupel@uni-mainz.de) In solid tumors, O 2 delivery is frequently reduced or even abolished, mostly due to abnormalities of the tumor microvasculature, adverse diffusion geometries, and tumor-associated and/or therapy-induced anemia. Up to 60% of advanced solid tumors may exhibit hypoxic areas that are heterogeneously distributed within the tumor. In approx. 30% of pre-treatment patients, a decreased O 2 transport capacity of the blood as a result of tumor-associated anemia can greatly contribute to the development of tumor hypoxia. While normal tissues can compensate for this O 2 deficiency by a rise in blood flow rate, advanced tumors (or at least larger tumor areas) cannot adequately counteract the restriction in O 2 supply and thus the development of hypoxia. Hypoxia-induced alteration in gene expression and thus in the proteome (< 1% O 2 or < 7 mmHg), and/or genome changes (< 0.1% or < 0.7 mmHg) may promote tumor progression via mechanisms enabling cells to overcome nutritive deprivation, to escape from the hostile microenvironment and to favor unrestricted growth. Sustained hypoxia may thus lead to cellular changes resulting in a more aggressive phenotype. In addition, hypoxia is known to directly or indirectly confer resistance to X-and \u03b3-radiation, and some chemotherapies leading to treatment failures and thus poor prognosis. Methods currently available for detection of tumor hypoxia are (1) invasive microsensor techniques for direct pO 2 measurements, (2) electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry, (3) intravascular O 2 detection, (4) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging techniques, (5) noninvasive detection of sensitizer adducts, and (6) immunohistochemistry using exogenous or endogenous hypoxic markers.

Hypoxia and FDG metabolism are not independent parameters and hypoxia is affecting glucose metabolism. We noted an association of HIF-1a expression and the pharmacokinetics of FDG in colorectal tumors. In giant cell tumors a correlation of HIF-1a and k3 was found, giving evidence for a modulation of the FDG kinetics by hypoxia related gene expression. Several approaches were made to use a hypoxia specific tracer for PET studies. One of the most common radiopharmaceuticals for hypoxia imaging is F-18-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO), which accumulates in tissues with oxygen concentrations of less than 3 mm Hg. Studies have shown that FMISO can be used to detect and quantify local tissue hypoxia. One limitation of FMISO is the slow pharmacokinetics, demanding imaging either dynamically for more than one hour or late images at least 90 min after tracer application. Besides FMISO, nitroimidazole analogues and tracers based on thiosemicarbazones (e.g. Cu-60-ATSM) have found increasing attention due to the shorter time interval required for the assessment of tissue hypoxia.

The development and application of non-invasive methods to rapidly determine the distribution and extent of tumour hypoxia in an individual tumour would clearly enhance cancer treatment strategies and be of considerable clinical use. The underlying principles, some pertinent experimental studies, and current issues concerned with the utility of two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methodologies being exploited to investigate tumour hypoxia will be discussed. 19 F MR oximetry relies on the linear increase of the MR imaging spin-lattice relaxation rate R 1 of PFC emulsions, hydrocarbons whose protons have been replaced with fluorine nuclei, with increasing oxygen tension. Molecular oxygen has a very high solubility in PFC emulsions, permitting oxygen tension measurements to be made in tumour locations where the PFC is sequestered. The measurement of PFC spin-lattice relaxation rates in vivo is currently the only NMR methodology from which absolute tumour pO 2 measurements can be derived. 1 H MR imaging methods, with their high temporal and spatial resolution, are also being investigated as surrogate markers of tumour hypoxia. Deoxyhaemoglobin, which is paramagnetic, creates magnetic susceptibility variations, increasing the MR imaging transverse relaxation rate R 2 * of water in blood and in the tissue surrounding blood vessels. Gradient recalled echo (GRE) MR imaging methods are sensitive to R 2 * and thus to blood deoxyhaemoglobin levels. Deoxyhaemoglobin therefore acts as an intrinsic, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast agent. As the oxygenation of haemoglobin is proportional to the arterial blood p a O 2 , and therefore in equilibrium with tissue pO 2 , measurements of tumour R 2 * should provide a sensitive index of tissue oxygenation. Purpose: PET/CT has become a widely accepted modality in various disease entities. In the diagnostic work-up of malignant tumors, the combination of functional and morphologic data, and the ability to examine the whole body which is achieved with PET/CT, are regarded as most useful.

Results and Discussion: The incremental value of hybrid PET/CT as compared to secondary fusion is limited, when both experts in CT and PET are involved in the reading. The advantages of the combined modalities are in part due to the fact that clinicians receive a diagnosis \"out of one hand\" instead of separate reports, which may not be fully in agreement. When sophisticated CT techniques are combined with PET, the preparation of the patient and the examination is very involved. Therefore, one should select the appropriate approach in every individual patient.

FDG is the most frequently used PET tracer, with new tracers emerging. Usually PET/CT is used for whole body scans and gives information on both Tand N-and M-staging. For T-staging PET/CT is superior in lung cancer. PET/CT is favourable in head and neck cancer, for primary cancers and relapse, and for esophageal cancer for preoperative staging. PET/CT may be beneficial for Tstaging in pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoma. In relapse of colonic and rectal cancer PET/CT is superior to other methods. In cervical cancer PET/CT has a high diagnostic accuracy for both T-, N-and M-staging. For ovarian cancer recurrence, PET/CT is useful. In lymphoma, PET/CT is superior for initial staging, relapse evaluation, and treatment monitoring after 1-2 series of chemotherapy.

Cook; Surrey/UK (gcook@icr.ac.uk) FDG PET and PET/CT has the potential to overcome some of the limitations of nodal and metastatic staging with conventional anatomical imaging. With nodal staging there is the potential to improve sensitivity by detecting cancer within subcentimetre nodes and to improve specificity by showing absent uptake in enlarged but benign reactive nodes. PET as a modality on its own suffers from poor anatomical definition, and therefore localisation of lymph nodes may be difficult. This disadvantage is largely overcome by the introduction of combined PET/CT. There are studies that confirm the accuracy of FDG PET and PET/CT in staging a number of cancers, e.g. lung cancer and lymphoma (both upstaging and downstaging) leading to appropriate inter and intramodality changes in medical management. In other cancers, no advantage has been shown using FDG PET, e.g. axillary staging in breast cancer compared to sentinel node sampling. FDG PET is generally more sensitive in M staging in many cancers than conventional imaging as it is a whole body technique and metastases can be detected in most organs. Additional or complimentary information can be gained by detecting unsuspected distant metastases in the skeleton, lungs and liver. Sensitivity for detecting brain metastases is poor and the sensitivity for detecting pulmonary and peritoneal disease may be limited when metastases are particularly small.

Hahn; Munich/DE (Klaus.Hahn@med.uni-muenchen.de) Some excellent articles in the literatures have shown that 18 F-FDG PET is increasingly used to assess the tumour response in patients undergoing chemoand/or radiotherapy of solid tumours such as breast, lung, colorectal, head and neck and oesophageal carcinoma. PET imaging performed as a baseline and after the initiation of treatment allows prediction of response as early as after the first cycle of chemotherapy, whereas other imaging procedures such as sonography, plain film radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are not able to predict reliable therapy response early in the course of treatment. PET is currently the most sensitive and specific imaging measurement to obtain information about tumour physiology and metabolism. Tumour cells have increased glucose metabolism due to increased expression of glucose transporters and hexokinase as a result of oncogenic transformation, and 18 F-FDG is essentially trapped within the tumour cell. Therefore 18 F-FDG-PET may provide important prognostic information about the proliferative rates and the antiproliferative effect of cancer therapy. There is now convincing evidence that reduction of 18 F-FDG uptake in the tumour is an early indicator of response at a clinical or subclincal level. If a combined PET/CT-system are used for therapy monitoring and follow-up of malignant tumours, the marrying of structural information allows superior sensitivity for residual small-volume disease and metabolically guided biopsy. The ankle and foot have received much clinical attention because they are subject to equilibrating proprioceptive and mechanical forces resulting from the body weight in everyday, professional and athletic activities. The tendons and ligaments of the ankle and foot are an important part in the chain of transmission and absorption of bearing forces, and thus in providing stability and functionality of gait and running. Therefore, they are prone to overload and overuse syndromes which cause restricted movement and pain. Ligament pathology mainly includes traumatic sprains, responsible for a huge monetary burden to the health system. Tendon pathology includes a) injuries, as a result of prolonged abnormal training in sports activities, use of improper footwear and obesity, b) rheumatic or metabolic diseases, and c) tumors such as ganglionic cysts and giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath. Diagnostic imaging is important for detecting and characterizing the cause of the underlying disorder and thus in guiding the appropriate treatment. Ultrasonography is a low-cost non-invasive modality of first choice for tendon imaging. MR imaging is the ideal modality to depict the normal and abnormal anatomy of both ligaments and tendons, often demonstrating associated osseous and soft tissue findings. The addition of kinematic MR imaging further expands its capabilities by evaluating the functional impairment. MDCT is now under investigation for imaging both the tendons and the osseous structures in traumatic or postoperative abnormalities. All the available imaging modalities have strengths and weaknesses and therefore their clinical role should be well understood. ",

The disorders of the Achilles tendon are generally classified as peritendinitis, tendinitis and partial and complete tendon ruptures. CT is generally able to document these pathologies and MDCT may offer more accurate information about the three-dimensional extent of the lesions. In general, however, the information provided by MR imaging in these conditions is more accurate and this method is considered the diagnostic method of choice. The plantar aponeurosis is a strong fibrous band which extends from the inferior portion of the calcaneous to the region of the metatarsal heads. The main causes of the plantar heel pain are plantar fasciitis, plantar fibromatosis and plantar soft tissue infections. Also in these cases MR imaging is considered the diagnostic method of choice to evaluate the plantar aponeurosis and its related abnormalities. CT and MDCT may be also useful in selected cases. The chest radiograph is the most frequently performed examination in most hospitals and private practices. Many physicians believe that if a lesion is present in the lungs, it will show up on the radiograph. Large scale studies, spanning over 20 years, have shown that 20 to 30% of radiographs considered as normal are in fact pathological and that up to 20% of radiographs considered as pathological are in fact normal.

            "text": "Investigation of polytraumatized patients with multidetector CT, which enables precise evaluation of solid organ trauma, leads to a more conservative management of all abdominal trauma irrespective to their grading. Advances in CT technology had improved the identification of both contrast extravasation and non-bleeding vascular injuries and can predict the need for embolization in low-grade trauma. Contrast blush (CB) on CT after splenic fracture is not an absolute indication for immediate angio-intervention. Conversely, CB after liver trauma is associated with a significant increased mortality and requires angio-embolization systematically. The liberal use of angiography and the technical refinements in embolization have broaden the indications and improved the results of the non-operative management in high-grade injuries. Immediate angiography should be performed in the following settings: 1. As primary damage control modality in lieu of devastating surgery in unstable patients suspected to develop massive retroperitoneal or pelvic hemorrhage. 2. After damage control laparotomy for complex hepatic or mesenteric injuries in order to detect and treat deeply located vascular lesion not detected at surgery. 3. For all high-grade (IV-V) hepato-splenic or renal injuries, irrespective to the hemodynamic status. 4. To stop visceral bleeding in stable patient and obviate otherwise unnecessary surgery. 5. To differentiate CT findings of \"ongoing hemorrhage\" from small intra-parenchymal or muscular CB or venous bleeding which don't require intervention. Angio-embolization should be expected to stop bleeding in over 90% of the patients. Failures are nearly due to delayed intervention or underestimation of severity of injury on CT. Post-embolization complications are few rare. Myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by a wavefront of necrosis that marches from subendocardium over midmyocardium to subepicardium over time. Mechanisms of muscle necrosis in irreversible ischemic myocyte injury are loss of cell membrane integrity and of intracellular-extracellular ion homeostasis resulting in swelling of the infarcted cells, accompanied by interstitial edema. In a severe ischemic injury, progressive tissue swelling causes microvascular obstruction resulting in impaired resting perfusion. Thus, MI can result in three different conditions, myocyte necrosis with gross microvascular damage causing microvascular obstruction, myocyte necrosis without gross microvascular damage, and non-necrosed, salvaged but stunned myocardium. After MI, diagnosis of myocardial viability focuses on the prediction of functional improvement after revascularization therapy. The morphologic approach is based on the detection of the ratio viable/non-viable cells. The end-diastolic wall thickness is an indirect parameter of this ratio, because thinned myocardium contains a reduced number of viable cells. This approach has a high sensitivity, but a low specificity and can only be used in chronic MI after infarct healing. Delayed enhancement allows for direct visualization of necrotic or scarred tissue. By measuring the transmural extent of delayed enhancement, the probability of mechanical improvement can precisely be given. Imaging of microvascular obstruction by first-pass perfusion or delayed enhancement gives additional information on viability and patient prognosis. The functional approach is simulation of sufficient reperfusion by the use of low-dose dobutamine-stress. This technique has a good sensitivity with a high specificity for the prediction of wall motion improvement. Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has been validated as a useful non-invasive diagnostic method in patients with various cardiac diseases. Because of the combination of fast rotation time and multi-slice acquisition with a high spatial resolution, MDCT is able to provide detailed information on cardiac morphology and on the coronary arteries at the same time. First clinical studies described the possible value of MDCT in the evaluation of patients with myocardial infarction from routine contrast-enhanced MDCT angiography of the coronary arteries, without an increase in volume of contrast agent or radiation dose administered to the patient. It was shown that by performing standard MDCT coronary angiography, areas of infarcted myocardium can be identified with moderate to high sensitivity, and infarct localization may be assessed with sufficient accuracy. To some degree, infarct age and infarct volume can be estimated. However, performing the routine multidetector-row CT angiography protocol of the heart and coronary arteries, areas of decreased CT attenuation can correspond to perfusion defects and/or infarcted tissue at the same time. In fact, this protocol resembles a first-pass perfusion technique at rest. In a number of cases, a clear differentiation of a perfusion defects (myocardium viable) vs. a myocardial infarction is not possible using this technique. Therefore, future studies will focus on delayed enhancement (DE) effects, which seem to be detectable using contrast enhanced CT imaging of the myocardium, similar to DE MR imaging techniques. Sonography (US) represents the most commonly used imaging modality for the guidance of percutaneous ablative treatments owing to its availability, rapidity, ease of use and cost-effectiveness. However, differentiation of induced necrosis from viable tumor is not possible with baseline and color Doppler sonography and therefore both immediate and long-term assessment of therapeutic result is usually accomplished by contrast-enhanced helical CT and MR imaging which are not real-time modalities and can be performed only at the end of treatment sessions. Furthermore, small neoplasms (the most suitable for local ablations) are sometimes clearly visualized on CT, but cannot be adequately detected by ultrasound. These major limitations are currently almost entirely overcome by the use of contrast-enhanced sonography (CEUS).",

In our experience and according to literature reports, the sensitivity of CEUS for the detection of residual tumor is almost equivalent to that of contrast-enhanced helical CT, with an average of only 4-6% of cases with residual viable foci visualized by CT and not by CEUS. In our experience, since the introduction of intraprocedural CEUS the rate of partially unablated tumors has dropped from 16.1% to 4.9%. Cost-effectiveness and reduction of patients' discomfort related to the need of re-treatment are the two most outstanding advantages of CEUS in RFA of liver malignancies. The objective of thermal tumor ablation is to induce in situ thermal coagulation necrosis. Assessment of tumor response after thermal tumor ablation differs from other treatments in that the lesion remains and the complete ablation creates an area of necrosis larger than that of the pretreatment tumor. Therefore WHO and RE-CIST criteria cannot be applied. The primary goal of imaging is to assess the efficacy of the local therapy. Imaging findings of complete response, partial response, and local tumor progression will be described. The imaging findings are mainly based on lesion and periablational enhancement, size of the necrotic defect, sharpness of the margins at CT and MR imaging and lesion signal intensity on T1-or T2-weighted imaging at MR imaging. Examples of pitfalls will be shown. Another goal is to survey for any local recurrence or development of any additional new disease.",

Standardized terms and reporting criteria C.D. Becker; Geneva/CH (Christoph.Becker@hcuge.ch) Image-guided tumour ablation is currently gaining increasing importance in a variety of clinical settings and indications. In order to render results more comparable and reproducible, it is necessary for radiologists to use terms and reporting criteria in a standard fashion. The technical description of each ablation procedure should include not only whether coagulation necrosis was induced by chemical agents such as concentrated ethanol or by thermal energy delivered with cryoprobes, radiofrequency electrodes, microwave antennas, laser fibres, or highfrequency focused ultrasound, but should also mention dosage or energy parameters as appropriate for each technique. Imaging with US, CT or MR imaging is key not only for planning, targeting, monitoring of the ablation procedure, but also for the assessment of the result of ablation. Precise measurements should always be provided, including description of the size of the initial tumour, the visible ablation zone (including its involution over time) and the so-called \"ablative margin\" which describes the safety zone of ablation around the tumour. When describing the different changes seen on images in and around the so-called \"ablation zone\" the radiologist should be aware that not all of them correspond with the zone of coagulation necrosis on pathologic examination, but that a variety of phenomena may be due to reactive changes, such as vaporisation, hyperaemia, or oedema. Since an ablation treatment in a patient often consists of more than one distinct procedure, complications should be best reported per procedure; major potentially life-threatening complications should be distinguished from transient, self-limited symptoms and signs such as the postablation syndrome. The concept of the vulnerable plaque and the vulnerable patient was introduced to describe atherosclerotic plaques prone to rupture and thrombosis. The main feature of the vulnerable plaque is a thin fibrous cap overlying a large heterogeneous lipid core. Inflammatory-cell infiltrates are also markers for plaque vulnerability. In addition, the concept of arterial remodelling is being increasingly recognized. MR imaging is a promising contender for vessel wall imaging, and currently evaluation of atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries by MR imaging is superior to that of the coronary vasculature. MR imaging permits accurate, noninvasive, serial in vivo measurements of artery wall dimensions without the need for ionizing radiation. Also, it provides tomographic assessment with consistent localization, which enables identification of arterial remodelling over time and clinical results have been reported for the aorta and carotid. The use of highresolution MR imaging for plaque characterization and evaluation of total vessel plaque burden, including effect on luminal diameters, is a rapidly expanding field. The vessel wall is imaged using a spin-echo technique with different contrast weightings (T1, T2 and PD) to assist in plaque characterization. MR imaging can help characterize the lipid core, fibrous caps, calcification, normal media, and adventitia in human atherosclerotic plaques in vivo. Characterization of intraplaque haemorrhage and acute thrombosis is also possible. In conclusion, the concepts of the vulnerable plaque and arterial remodelling are here to stay as our under-standing of the atherosclerotic disease process continues to grow. Consequently, the role of newer imaging techniques focussing on quantitative aspects of atherosclerosis will increase. Vulnerable plaques (VP)are characterized by large lipid pools, thin fibrous caps, positive remodeling, signs of inflammation, and enhanced adventitial neovascularization. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has a high resolution (100-150 um), provides cross-sectional and longitudinal images of coronary segments. Single and rarely multiple VP are found in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) -unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, sudden death -but also in patients with stable angina (about 20%). These lesions are mainly not hemodynamically significant and produce therefore no symptoms due to the remodelling process which is visualized by IVUS. In ACS syndromes plaque rupture is found in 65 %, plaque erosion in 35 % of patients and rarely calcified noduli. Plaque material may be washed out leading to ulcerations which are very thrombigenic. Thrombus formation may be incomplete or complete and can be identified, whereas intramural hemorrhage is much more difficult to be detected but is an important pathogenetic process. The resolution of IVUS is not high enough in order to detect plaque erosion, but is able to visualize calcified noduli. IVUS is combined with intracoronary Doppler in order to estimate the coronary flow reserve. Macroand microvascular disorders can be differentiated which are even found in non obstructing lesions due to microembolization. Most important have been follow-up studies demonstrating that healing of plaque rupture may occur, but can be very slowly with intermittent thrombus formation within the plaque ulcerations. Despite the shortcomings, IVUS is at the moment the \"Gold Standard\" vascular imaging technique which has entered the clinical arena. Learning Objectives:",

Nowadays, it has kept this role only for the paediatric patients, while the abdominal approach with an empty bladder is used for large pelvic masses. In all the other cases transvaginal sonography is the preferred technique for evaluation of the endometrium, small uterine lesions and as a preliminary step for hysteroscopic procedures. Transvaginal sonography has been complemented in recent years by additional techniques. Sonohysterography has been developed to obtain a better analysis of the endometrial surface and uterine cavity and is performed by perfusing the uterine cavity with saline flushed through a catheter passed into the cervical canal. Sonohysterography allows the differential diagnosis between endometrial hyperplasia and polyps, by defining the implantation base of the lesions. It also allows us to define the extent of the intramural portion of submucosal fibroids, which dictates the most appropriate surgical approach for their removal. Transvaginal colour Doppler demonstrates the vascular anatomy of the uterine wall and its lesions: intramural fibroids typically display a basket-like macrovascularity, while adenomyosis has a homogeneous pattern of blood flow. Although endometrial carcinoma tends to display a low-impedance pattern of flow at pulsed wave Doppler, the clinical usefulness of this finding in the diagnosis of the condition is far from being established. The use of contrast enhancement in this field is still experimental, the most promising results coming from the post-embolization assessment of uterine fibroids.

This course reviews the technical aspects of MR imaging exploration of invasive cervical cancer such as choice of sequences, slice orientation, intracavitary and intravenous contrast media injection for MR examination for initial staging, follow-up examinations during radiation therapy (external RT and brachytherapy) and suspected recurrence. The imaging features encountered during initial staging such as parametrial, bladder, ureteral and rectal invasion are reviewed with particular emphasis on findings to guide fertility conserving surgery, external radiation therapy or brachytherapy. These findings will be correlated to the FIGO classification for invasive cervical cancer. Lymph node involvement of cervical cancer and its repercussions on MR imaging are highlighted. During follow-up, especially if cervical cancer is treated by chemoradiation, post radiation changes of the pelvic organs and spaces can render the interpretation of MR images more difficult and the use of dynamic-acquisition contrast-enhanced T1-weighted SE MR images is useful to distinguish post-radiation fibrosis from recurrence.

Intracranial aneurysms become symptomatic as a result of rupture with consequent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Unruptured aneurysms may be discovered when they cause neurological symptoms which depend on the location and size. With the advent of spiral and multi-slice CT, CT angiography (CTA) has been proposed as an adjunct to plain CT in investigating SAH and it is under debate whether it can replace intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (IADSA) in treatment planning. Although MR angiography (MRA) has given good results in detecting aneurysms in acute SAH, it is preferred as a screening modality for patients at risk and for the follow-up of aneurysms treated with endovascular coiling. MRA has the advantage of displaying cerebral vessels without contrast medium, although it provides a limited coverage of the intracranial vasculature. IADSA is still the most sensitive tool in detecting intracranial aneurysms and should be performed within 24 hours of bleeding to ensure correct therapeutic management of patients. The selective intraarterial injection of iodinated contrast medium ensures optimal enhancement of the intracranial arteries with superior resolution than CTA or MRA. Patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm should be treated as soon as possible after the haemorrhage to prevent rebleeding and to provide adequate medical treatment of vasospasm. In the last decade the endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms with Guglielmi detachable coils, which consists of filling the aneurysmal sac with soft platinum coils through a microcatheter, has completely revolutionized the therapeutic management of patients.

            "text": "A-085 Although it is often possible to characterise mediastinal masses and pulmonary lesions into benign and malignant disease, in many cases a tissue diagnosis remains necessary. The appropriate use of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and cutting needle biopsy (CNB) enable a correct diagnosis to be made in most instances. When performing these biopsies it is important to understand both the advantages of needle type and imaging modality chosen, and their disadvantages. This presentation will focus on the benefits and limitations of cytology and histology, and the use of ultrasound and multislice CT for image guidance. The use of pleural biopsy in diagnosing malignant disease and the use of fibrinolytic therapy in loculated pleural disease will also be discussed. MR guidance is clinically established for non-vascular interventions like biopsies, radio frequency ablation and drainages. Different MR scanners with field strengths varying from low to high field systems have been successfully used. Especially breast lesion marking is an important clinical indication for those lesions only visible on MR imaging. Visualization of metallic instruments and their artefact behaviour for different imaging sequences and sequence parameters will be discussed. The performance of vascular interventions has made dramatic progress over the last five years due to the continuous development of fast imaging sequences offering not only real-time imaging speed but also excellent image contrast of the vascular tree and the beating heart. Stent placement in the iliac, renal and coronary arteries has been performed in animal experiments. Vena cava filter placement, coil embolization, and placement of atrial septal occluders are other interventions performed under MR-guidance. Passive visualization as well as active tip tracking and instrument visualization was exploited for different vascular interventions. The different strategies of device visualization will be compared and the implications for safety will be stressed. In addition, the feasibility of using safe non-metallic guide wires is introduced. Visualization of interventional Magnetic resonance guidance of interventional vascular procedures offers several advantages over fluoroscopic-guided techniques including the absence of ionizing radiation, avoidance of potential hazards of iodinated contrast material, and superior soft tissue contrast. Particular problems are the availability of MR compatible materials such as stents and guidewires with respect to cost factors, visibility, and safety profile. The aim of this presentation is to demonstrate the possibility of performing MR-guided interventional therapy for iliacal, femoral, and popliteal artery stenoses with commercially available materials supported by MR real-time imaging and intra-arterial MR angiography. For angioplasty of iliac artery stenoses nitinol stents are placed with gradient-echo MR imaging guidance using a 2D-FLASH sequence. Anatomic landmarks and the known coordinates of the stenosis along the z direction depicted on the initial MR angiograms are used to localize the stenosis and the desired stent position. For angioplasty of the femoral and popliteal arteries intra-arterial MR angiography is performed before and after angioplasty in each patient. A FLASH 3D sequence is applied and a total of 5 mL gadodiamide is injected via the arterial access. MIPs are used as roadmaps and localizers for the interactive positioning of a continuously running 2D-Flash sequence with a temporal solution of 2 images/second. The lesion is crossed by a balloon catheter, which is mounted on a guide wire. MR imagingguided stent placement in iliac arteries and angioplasty of femoropopliteal stenoses is feasible in selected patients. Safety precautions have to be considered when using conductive guide wires while MR imaging. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn realizing problems related to MR-guided angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery using conventional devices. 2. To discuss the indications for MR-guided angioplasty.",

            "text": "To make MR guided cardiac catheterisation a reality, there is a need to be able to visualise the catheter within cardiovascular structures in real time. This requires fast imaging, which has become possible because of recent developments in MR hardware and software. Cardiac gated steady state free precession (SSFP) sequences, which benefit from high signal to noise ratio, good blood pool myocardial contrast, and high spatiotemporal resolution, have become the mainstay of cardiac MR. Passive catheter visualisation relies on inherent properties of the catheter to provide either local signal enhancement or loss. We have demonstrated that with standard balloon catheters filled with carbon dioxide, passive visualisation and manual tracking of catheters was possible using an interactive SSFP sequence. The benefit of this approach is that it uses standard catheter laboratory equipment and thus poses no greater safety risk to the patient. There has also been considerable work using active methods of catheter tracking. With these techniques an antenna or coil is incorporated in the catheter allowing automatic tracking and visualisation. However, there are still some safety concerns with these active tracking techniques because of the possibility of heating. Recently, we published the first study of MR guided cardiac catheterisation in humans. We were able to demonstrate that MR guided cardiac catheterisation was safe and practical in a clinical setting, with a reduction in ionising radiation exposure, better visualisation of cardiac anatomy, and acquisition of more pertinent physiological information. CT remains the standard for initial assessment of tumour size, tumour extent and mediastinal and chest wall involvement, despite its well-known limitations. Certain CT findings have been demonstrated as being diagnostic of unresectable disease. However, these CT signs can be misleading and care should be taken not to overestimate tumour growth into the chest wall or the mediastinal structures. The continuous technical improvement has allowed the development of techniques such as virtual bronchoscopy, computer-aided diagnosis and volumetric quantification of lung tumours that might improve or simplify T-staging with CT in the future. MR imaging can be a useful complement to CT scanning in some selected cases. It has proved superior to CT for identifying involvement of major mediastinal blood vessels and the carina. However, the ongoing technical improvement of CT with high-detail reformatted images will further influence the potential role of MR imaging in staging patients with lung cancer. At this moment, the use of FDG-PET in T-staging of patients with NSCLC is limited. The difference in FDG uptake has been used successfully to differentiate between tumour and peritumoural atelectasis and inflammation. This is particularly important for planning of radiotherapy in patients with lung cancer associated with atelectasis. FDG-PET may also play a role as a predictor for the prognosis after treatment in patients with lung cancer. The first reports on the use of PET-CT scanners, which combine high detail morphological and metabolic information, are promising. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn the staging classification for lung cancer and the implications of this staging for patient management. Esophageal cancer is staged using the TNM system. The majority of patients present with advanced disease and are generally treated nonoperatively, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, patients with presumed limited stage disease may be treated with chemoradiation therapy and/or esophagectomy. The role of imaging is to correctly stage patient disease so that appropriate therapy may be instigated. CT scanning of the chest and abdomen using intravenous contrast is used to detect local tumor invasion into adjacent structures (T4 disease) and/or presence of distant metastases (M1), suggesting inoperability. Such features, however, generally need biopsy proof before denying a patient surgery. CT is incapable of determining depth of tumor invasion into the esophageal wall. Therefore, if the CT shows apparently resectable disease, many patients will then undergo endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of the esophagus, in order to more precisely establish the T stage of the primary tumor. At some institutions, patients with tumor limited to the mucosa or submucosa at EUS proceed right to surgery, whereas those with deeper extent of tumor and/or tumor involved regional lymph nodes undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery. EUS assessment of depth of tumor invasion (T stage) is felt to be sufficiently accurate (85-90%) that management decisions are made based on EUS imaging findings. However, EUS assessment of regional lymph node involvement is inaccurate; EUS guided biopsy of detected lymph nodes is necessary to confirm nodal involvement by tumor. Many patients now also undergo whole body PET scanning, primarily to search for occult distant metastases. Over the past years, there has been an increasing interest in cellular imaging. Cellular imaging can be defined as the non-invasive and repetitive imaging of targeted cells and cellular processes in living organisms. A key requirement for cellular imaging is the availability of high-relaxivity MR imaging contrast agents and secondarily to link them to surrogate markers. Another important challenge is the trade-off between image resolution and detectable contrast agent concentration, which must be overcome in the case of real cellular imaging. Generally, gadolinium chelates may be used for cellular imaging, but currently used agents exhibit too low relaxivities. Covalent side-chain linking would in part solve this issue, could also be used for specific targeting, but well validated models are still lacking. Currently, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO) are the preferred MR contrast agents for cellular imaging. Depending on their size, surface charge and coating, they are engulfed by different cells of the macrophage/monocyte phagocytotic system. SPIO's for example are used for tissue specific imaging of the liver since they are taken up by the Kupffer cells. Recently several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the capacity of USPIO enhanced MR imaging to detect and follow monocyte/macrophage activity in various inflammatory disorders even outside the vascular compartment. Using USPIO macrophage activity, several inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, atherosclerotic plaques, and nephritis as well as musculoskeletal infections and arthropathies may be targeted, promising a breakthrough in non-invasive imaging of cellular progression of disease. Learning Objectives: 1. To provide a definition of cellular imaging. 2. To discuss the basic concepts of cellular imaging. 3. To provide an overview over the contrast agents which are suited for cellular imaging.",

Imaging Findings: The long blood circulating time and the progressive macrophage uptake of USPIO in inflammatory tissues are two properties of major importance for pathologic tissue characterization. USPIO are able to target macrophages of normal lymph nodes and are used for MR lymphography in cancer. On animal experiments and several human studies (MS, Stroke, tumors), cell-specific MR imaging in CNS inflammatory conditions has been demonstrated besides the information provided by usual MR sequences.

However, glomerular or tubulo-interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells is a very common reactive process, either in native or in transplanted kidneys and macrophages play a major role. Because dextran-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles are taken up by mononuclear cells, especially macrophages, they can be used as a cell-specific contrast agent. Several animal experiments have demonstrated that in vivo targeting of intrarenal macrophages or activated mesangial cells by USPIO-enhanced MR imaging is possible. Relative intrarenal signal variation was related to the level of iron content, to the degree of cellular infiltration, and to the degree of renal dysfunction. The location of the maximal signal decrease depended on the type of nephropathy: exclusively cortical in experimental glomerulonephritis, exclusively medullary in ischemia-reperfusion and diffuse in toxic or obstructive nephropathies as well as in renal graft rejection. Recent studies in humans showed that USPIO-enhanced MR imaging may allow differentiation between inflammatory and non-inflammatory renal disease, and in the scenario of suspected acute graft rejection may differentiate rejection from acute tubular necrosis.

            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis A.M. Lutz; Z\u00fcrich/CH (amelie.lutz@usz.ch) Cellular MR imaging using iron oxide particles is an exciting tool for researchers to study molecular and cellular processes of various diseases. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles are already clinically applied MR contrast agents in hepatic imaging. Ultrasmall iron oxide particles (USPIO), however, promise many more clinical applications. Due to their small diameters, a large fraction of these particles can surpass phagocytosis in liver and spleen enabling tagging of macrophages in lymph nodes and migrating macrophages. Clinical studies using USPIO-enhanced MR imaging show promising results in detection of minimal metastatic disease in lymph nodes. In addition, macrophage labeling with USPIO has successfully been demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies of various inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, the properties of USPIO can be exploited for imaging of chronic inflammatory diseases of the musculoskeletal system: most of all in rheumatoid arthritis where macrophages have a central role as major secretors of proinflammatory cytokines promoting joint inflammation and destruction. Studies in experimental rabbit models of antigen-induced arthritis have proven the feasibility in tagging synovial macrophages of affected joints. Moreover, the inherent T1-shortening properties of USPIO may be used to image the synovial hyperperfusion of arthritic joints for quantification of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. As newer therapy approaches target macrophage activity and synovial neoangiogenesis, USPIO-enhanced MR-imaging might become a very valuable diagnostic tool in rheumatoid arthritis in the near future. Technique: MDCT-arthrography of the shoulder provides isotropic volumetric acquisitions with excellent MPR reformatted images in all oblique planes. An acquisition time of nearly 30 seconds with neutral rotation of the humerus avoids motion artifacts in painful and older patients and consistent high quality. The increased radiation dose due to the high number of submillimetric slices (about 180) is limited by the MDCT technique. Rotator cuff tear: CT-arthrography should be performed only for preoperative imaging. We report a series of 50 cases of rotator cuff disease explored by both CT-arthrography and MR-arthrography. CT-arthrography appears highly accurate in determining the coronal and sagittal extension of full thickness tears, and does so more easily than MR-arthrography for the posterior extension of the tear. When a full thickness tear is lacking, CT-arthrography cannot explore the superficial aspect of the tendons. For subscapularis and biceps tendons, additional lateral or medial rotation slices or a kinetic study may be easily performed by CT-arthrography. Fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff muscles is always assessed on soft-tissue filtered axial and sagittal slices. Shoulder instability: We reviewed 15 capsulolabral injuries explored by both imaging modalities. CT-arthrography appeared less efficient in assessing the capsule and the ligaments, particularly the IGHL. However, CT-arthrography better assesses bony defects of the glenoid. A glenoid view (Bernageau's view) could complete MR-arthrography. The quality of both examinations is high since patients are usually young and cooperative. Primary omarthrosis: CT-arthrography rules out a tendon tear and assesses very accurately the glenoid bony stock. Learning Objectives: 1. To present the procedure of CT arthrography of the shoulder with multidetector computed tomography. 2. To present the most relevant CT arthrography abnormalities of tendons, ligaments, cartilage and muscles in rotator cuff disease and shoulder instability. 3. To discuss the advantages (reproducibility and fastness, bone assessment, high spatial resolution) of CT arthrography compared to other imaging modalities.",

            "text": "The reduced image acquisition times of MDCT have made scan timing more critical than for single detector CT, but have provided radiologists with an opportunity to improve CT contrast enhancement. It is therefore important for radiologists to understand 1) the factors that determine the magnitude and timing of arterial and parenchymal contrast enhancement for CT, and 2) identify the modifications needed to optimize contrast enhancement for 4-row to 64-row MDCT. The magnitude of arterial enhancement is dependent on the rate of iodine delivery and the total iodine dose, whereas that of hepatic parenchymal enhancement is dependent on iodine dose. Thus for CTA performed with MDCT, contrast medium volume can be decreased. However, contrast dose for liver imaging cannot be decreased, even with rapid MDCT acquisition. The most important patientrelated factor that affects the magnitude of aortic or hepatic enhancement is body weight. Enhancement magnitude is inversely proportional to body weight. Therefore, very large patients require higher iodine dose. The technical factor that determines the timing of peak aortic and hepatic enhancement is injection duration (the longer the injection duration, the longer the time to peak enhancement). Peak enhancement is delayed in patients with reduced cardiac output. For CTA, scan delay should be individualized with bolus tracking or test bolus. The greater the number of detector rows, the shorter the acquisition time for a particular MDCT examination. As the acquisition time decreases, the scan delay for a particular Balancing image quality and dose remains a decisive topic in the practice of CT; however, more and more technical means have become available which can support the radiologist in this process. The interdependence of dose, noise and spatial resolution are governed by physics and will not change. Typical values for these parameters, including patient dose values, will be reviewed. The high isotropic spatial resolution of typically 0.4 -0.6 mm available today can only be increased further at the expense of significantly higher dose or noise. These relations will be discussed and illustrated using simulated and measured results. Technological advances in modern scanners aim at controlling image quality in an automated fashion. The goal is to have the user select the level of image quality and the machine will then provide this user-selected level of image quality in an automated fashion. In doing so, the user is relieved from selecting scan parameters to a high degree. The underlying concepts of tube current modulation and automatic exposure control will be discussed. ",

            "text": "Computed tomography has now become of age. In many aspects of clinical medicine, CT has been shown to be superior to the physical examination. Not only can it be used as a teaching substitute for the cadaver in the dissection room, Multidetector CT can also display the whole range of many standard clinical conditions and signs. MDCT can show the budding clinician how difficult certain clinical signs can be to elicit and how certain anatomical variations can cause very misleading features. Simple signs such as collateral veins in SVC obstruction, lumbar (sacral) oedema and tricuspid regurgitation can all be ascertained from close scrutiny of the images. Indeed it is, increasingly, becoming the duty of the radiologist to point out such signs as such clinical skills are diminishing. When will the syllabi for medical and surgical pre-clinical and post-graduate training start to reflect the enormous training opportunities available in clinical radiology? When will there be a reduction in numbers of training posts in some areas to allow the necessary expansion of radiology? When will clinical practice really change to maximise the potential benefits that MDCT can bring to patient care? Multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has significantly developed in the last years. All the cutting applications of CT and in particular CT angiography have been enhanced. High spatial resolution and high temporal resolution are mandatory for a proper angiographic evaluation using MDCT. MDCT is a wellknown standard for the detection pulmonary embolism. Subsegmental branches of the pulmonary artery can be well depicted. The study of the abdominal aorta is a common indication for MDCT angiography. Thoracic aorta is a routine study with MDCT with the exception of the ascending aorta. With the introduction ECGgated MDCT imaging, motion artifacts at the aortic root can be ruled out. Computed tomography of the coronary arteries has reached the edge of clinical implementation. Only large trials are now missing to understand what will be the role of this technology for the detection of coronary lesions. Extensive validation literature on 16-slice and the first reports on 64-slice technologies suggest that this modality is ready for clinical implementation. Currently the role of cardiac CT is not defined. Clinical studies are lacking while professionals are increasingly asking for guidelines and indications. Besides very well established clinical applications of MDCT, such as detection and rule-out of pulmonary embolism and diagnosis of aortic diseases, the new generation of MDCT scanners and in particular the newest 64-slice generation are now being implemented in the clinical workup of patients with acute chest pain including coronary arteries. The potential of MDCT in triage settings is to be fully explored in the next years. ",

One of the major drawbacks of this cement is its stiffness particularly in osteoporotic spine. The new cements particularly phosphocalcic cements are very promising. However, there are some difficulties to inject those cements and we will precise when, where, which and how to use them. Percutaneous tumour management with radiofrequency ablation alone or associated to vertebroplasty is the other promising procedure in spine. The indications of this technique will be developed in details. Other advances are the development of new devices for tumour resection with radiofrequency or mechanical aspiration. These devices are particularly interesting in spinal tumours with rupture of posterior wall and risk of spinal cord compression. These materials are used previous to cement injection to resect and produce a room in the tumour reducing the risk of tumour bulging in the canal. Other devices are used in osteosclerotic metastasis. The injection of cement is particularly difficult with high risk of leakage in osteoblastic lesions. The use of the ablation systems and dilatation instruments allow easing the vertebroplasty and reducing the risk of complications by leakage. Other advance is to fill skeletal cystic lesions and aneurysmal bone cyst with bone graft. ",

Heini; Berne/CH (paul.heini@insel.ch) Cement augmentation using PMMA cement is known as an efficient treatment for vertebral compression fractures (VCF) with a rapid release of pain in most patients and prevention of an ongoing kyphotic deformity of the vertebrae treated. However performing a vertebroplasty there is no chance to restore vertebral height. Using the technique of kyphoplasty a certain restoration of vertebral body height can be achieved. There is a limitation of recovery due to loss of correction when deflating the kyphoplastic ballon and before injecting the cement. In addition the instruments used are quite expensive. Lordoplasty is another technique to restore kyphosis by indirect fracture reduction as it is used with an internal fixateur. The fractured and the adjacent vertebrae are instrumentated with bone cannulas bipediculary and the adjacent vertebrae are augmentated with cement. After curing of the cement the fractured vertebra is reduced applying a lordotic moment via the cannulas. Having the pretension maintained the fractured vertebra is reinforced. We performed a prospective trial of 26 patients with a lordoplasty procedure. There was a pain relief about 87% and a significant decrease in VAS value from 7.3 to 1.9. Due to lordoplasty there was a significant and permanent correction in vertebral and segmental kyphotic angle about 15.2\u00b0 and 10.0\u00b0 and also a significant restoration in anterior and mid vertebral height. Lordoplasty is a minimal invasive technique to restore vertebral body height. An immediate relief of pain is achieved in most patients. The procedure is safe and cost effective. Vertebroplasty is gaining popularity in the treatment of specific painful spine lesions. It remains unclear, however, what possible side effects the cement might have upon the vertebral body and intervertebral disc. We performed a histologic and radiographic analysis of the endplate and disc in the goat spine after vertebroplasty with poly (methyl methacrylate) cement or calcium phosphate cement, to study possible differences in surrounding tissue reaction. Furthermore, we assessed whether a defect in the endplate, simulating endplate fracture and allowing for contact of cement with disc tissue, had any effect on endplate or disc degeneration. Twenty-four mature goats were divided between two follow-up periods (six weeks and six months). All animals underwent bilateral transpedicular vertebroplasty at two lumbar levels, where one of four treatments was applied: injection with calcium phosphate cement with or without endplate defect, and injection with poly (methyl methacrylate) cement with or without endplate defect. The effect of the treatments on the integrity of the disc, endplate and surrounding tissue was examined by semiquantitative histology and radiography. No signs of disc or endplate degeneration were seen in any of the sections. The mean disc height did not decrease from the postoperative period to follow-up in any group thereby supporting the histological findings. A mild inflammatory reaction was found in four vertebral bodies in the poly (methyl methacrylate) groups. The results of this study suggest that vertebroplasty with either of these cements can be performed without an increased risk of disc or endplate degeneration even when endplate discontinuity is present. Learning Objectives: 1. To recognize the possibility of nutritional pathway obstruction and subsequent degeneration of the intervertebral disc after vertebroplasty. 2. To learn the radiologic and histologic changes after vertebroplasty with PMMA and calcium phosphate cement in a large animal model. 3. To discuss the differences in indication for different types of cement in vertebroplasty for osteoporotic and traumatic fractures.",

The intradiscal technique involves a posterolateral ipsilateral approach to pain in the lumbar spine with intradiscal infiltration of 3 cc oxygen-ozone gas mixture at a concentration of 27\u00b5g followed by intraforaminal injection. It is neither possible nor advisable to inject more than 1 ml of gas mixture in the cervical spines. The success rate of oxygen-ozone treatment of disk disease and low back pain and sciatica varies from 75% to 90% in different series and depending on the technique adopted. Our results administering oxygen-ozone are satisfactory compared with those obtained using other percutaneous techniques. In particular, the success rate in our series was similar to that reported in a number of studies using enzymatic chemonucleolysis. However, oxygen-ozone administra-tion is even less invasive than enzymatic chemonucleolysis. Oxygen-ozone administration is a useful means of treating cervical and lumbar herniated disks, cervicobrachyalgia, low back and sciatic nerve pain in patients who fail to respond to conservative management, before embarking on surgery. The colorectum is the fourth commonest site for cancer world wide, although the incidence is second only to lung cancer in Northern Europe and North America. There has been a marked increase in incidence amongst migrants adopting a Western lifestyle, and although a clear genetic predisposition exists, over 75% of cancers develop in people with no identifiable risk factors. Most colorectal cancer arises form precursor adenomatous polyps, with the adenoma-carcinoma sequence taking around 10 years. There is however an increasing realisation that progression of disease may be accelerated in flat or depressed adenomas, which could account for up to 25% of cancers. Good evidence exists that endoscopic polypectomy can prevent colorectal cancer and a clear relationship exists between cancer stage and prognosis. Colorectal cancer thus lends itself well to population screening, being prevalent, treatable and preventable by well-established techniques. The optimum screening strategy is not yet established. Many candidate tests exist, but only faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) has been shown to be both feasible and to reduce mortality in randomised control trials. Data from large-scale trials of flexible sigmoidoscopy are currently awaited. Emerging technologies such as CT and MR imaging colonography and DNA based stool tests may play future roles. Mass screening is not without risk with cardiac morbidity secondary to laxative use or sedation, and complications related to endoscopy such as perforation and haemorrhage all well described. Cost effectiveness compares well to more established programmes such as breast screening, but is heavily reliant on frequency and initial screening age. Learning Objectives: 1. To demonstrate an understanding of the epidemiology of colon cancer. 2. To review the rationale of screening for colorectal cancer. 3. To discuss the disadvantages of screening.",

Fecal tagging, using either iodine or barium compounds, is of great value to improve specificity, especially for small polyps. Dual scanning with the patient respectively in prone and supine position is obtained. Scanning protocols are in continuous evolution, in parallel with the development of new multidetector-row CT (MDCT) scanners. With the use of MDCT scanner and sub-millimeter collimation isotropic voxels are routinely achieved, improving the quality of reformatted as well as endoluminal images. The use of low-dose protocols minimizes radiation exposure. The acquired volumetric dataset is post-processed on dedicated workstations using commercially available software programs.

CTC has replaced double contrast barium enema as primary imaging technique in symptomatic patients and is important as an adjunct in incomplete colonoscopy examinations. Most series concern CTC after extensive bowel cleansing, but more recent series have demonstrated that accurate CTC after limited bowel preparation is feasible resulting in reduced burden to patients. The role of CTC in screening is currently extensively studied. Studies on CTC with extensive bowel preparation in low prevalence populations have demonstrated that high sensitivity and specificity can be obtained in such populations. However, factors such as reader experience and evaluation technique influence the results and require further study. Primary two-dimensional evaluation is commonly performed, but recent studies seem to indicate the advantage of primary three-dimensional evaluation. Reduction of the burden of CTC (primarily extensive bowel preparation) is mandatory before the technique can be implemented. Modified bowel preparation and radiation exposure reduction are feasible and large series with this CTC-modifications are mandatory in low prevalence populations. Development of accurate automated polyp detection is important for cost effective screening programs. Digital detectors have now become the state-of-the-art in diagnostic radiology. They have opened up new frontiers in diagnosis, but have also created the need for additional expertise and for new evaluation and quality control criteria.

The other method employs a direct converter such as selenium which is particularly suitable for mammography. Both flat detector technologies are based on amorphous silicon active pixel matrices. Flat detectors facilitate the clinical workflow in radiographic rooms, foster improved image quality and provide the potential to reduce dose.

Different technologies are used for image detection: Phosphor plate technology has been continuously improved since its early introduction. Acceptable Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) can now be reached, particularly when using a dual side read-out. Also promising is the developing technology of needle-structured screens. Integrated digital flat panels are based on two main technologies, both using an amorphous silicon read-out matrix. Differences are in photon detection mechanism: photoconduction in Selenium (direct detection), or scintillation in a CsI layer, captured by a photo-diode array in the a-Si panel (indirect detection). Reducing the electronic read-out noise in the silicon matrix has significantly improved DQE for both flat panel technologies. In addition, further progress can be obtained using a thicker and less diffusive scintillator for indirect detectors. Increased DQE at low dose levels is essential when the detector operates in fractionated dose mode, e.g. for the purpose of tomographic imaging. The last category of detectors is present in scanning devices. There too, different technologies are used: moving slot associated with scintillator and CCD, or multiple slit scanning associated with photon counting detectors. In the latter case, X-ray detection is performed in silicon detectors or avalanche-amplified gas detectors. The scanning technique displays good X-ray scatter rejection. Photon counting eliminates electronic noise, thus providing a dose-independent DQE. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the various technologies used for image detection in digital mammography. 2. To understand their main properties and peculiarities. 3. To gather information on the most recent evolutions in these technologies.",

However, there is increasing pressure on breast screening units to move to digital mammography because of the broader issue of implementing a film-less and paperless radiology department within the hospital. Any change in imaging technique in breast screening must be supported by research evidence to demonstrate that quality will be maintained. Thus, any change must be preceded by consideration of the equipment's clinical and technical suitability, as well as the key practical question of how to integrate digital mammography within a mature breast screening programme. Any assessment must include a review of technical parameters to define appropriate tests for assessing equipment performance, including the display systems and develop guidance on equipment optimisation. Clinical issues to be addressed include studies of workflow management (includ-ing the use of previous images) and assessment of acceptability to women and staff. Critical to this process is the performance of suitably designed clinical trials so that digital mammography can be compared in an objective manner with film/ screen mammography. Digital mammography will need to be integrated with existing picture archiving and communication systems and hospital patient administration systems. A key issue for a breast screening programme is that often mammography is undertaken on mobile units which move to different locations in the community. The lecture will discuss the various issues and propose potential solutions. Assessment of anterior cranial fossa floor neoplastic invasion yields a great impact on surgical planning. Bone destruction of the skull base and dura mater invasion are key information provided by imaging techniques. CT better shows bone destruction, whereas MR is more precise in grading dural invasion, which implies a worse prognosis. A proper assessment requires a careful analysis of the signal intensities that compose a \"sandwich\" of signals corresponding to the bony floor of anterior cranial fossa, the overlying dura mater, and the CSF. On enhanced sagittal and coronal SE T1, when a sinonasal neoplasm abuts the cribrifom plate interface, without interrupting its hypointense signal, the lesion should be considered limited to the ethmoid/nasal fossa. Replacement of the hypointense signal by tumor implies bone penetration. In this case, a thickened enhancing dura mater usually borders the neoplasm. If uninterrupted, the neoplasm may be graded as intracranial-extradural. Conversely, focal or more extensive replacement of enhanced thickened dura mater by tumor signal indicate intracranial-intradural invasion. Brain invasion is suspected in the presence of edema. Resectability of tumors invading the brain does not solely depend upon the depth of tumor extent into the brain, nor bilateral brain invasion. It requires a thorough evaluation of several other issues, the most important being the histological type and patient's performance status. Patients with limited brain invasion treated by craniofacial resection are reported to have no significant decrease in survival compared to those with dural invasion alone. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with CT and MR techniques and their use in suspected anterior skull base tumors. 2. To know the basic anatomy of the anterior skull base and to be able to identify anatomic variants. 3. To know the characteristic aspect of a variety of anterior skull base tumors and be able to provide a differential diagnosis. 4. To be able to recognize characteristic patterns of tumor spread. 5. To be aware of therapeutic implications of imaging. 6. To know the basic CT and MR imaging aspects of post-surgical and post-RT treatment and be able to identify recurrences. A key point is the knowledge of pathways between the extracranial and intracranial spaces. Imaging technique: Both CT and MR imaging are often needed to study CSB lesions exactly. In CT examinations, the following general guidelines are recommended: slice thickness \u2264 3 mm, axial and coronal planes (as reformations in multi-detector CT) and bone algorithms. A routine MR imaging examination of the this area should include axial, coronal and sagittal images such as T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with a slice thickness between 3 to 5 mm. Intrave-nous contrast medium is used to evaluate the cavernous sinus and potential tumours. Contrast enhanced T1-weighted images are helpful in the demonstration of perineural spread. Nowadays angiography is mostly performed in combination with interventions. Tumours of the skull base: Diseases of the skull base can be divided into intrinsic lesions and lesions affecting the skull base from adjacent spaces. The latter will only be mentioned. In intrinsic lesions, the volume of the lesion is centred in the skull base, but these lesions, especially tumours, are rare. Most common tumours and tumour like lesions of CSB and their differential diagnoses will be demonstrated on typical examples.

Image-guided percutaneous techniques for thermal tumor ablation have been one of the major advances in nonsurgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Percutaneous ablation is currently accepted as the best therapeutic choice for patients with early-stage HCC when liver transplantation or surgical resection are not suitable options. Over the past two decades, several methods for chemical or thermal tumor destruction have been developed and clinically tested. RF ablation has been the most widely assessed alternative to chemical ablation with ethanol (percutaneous ethanol injection, PEI) for local treatment of HCC. Three randomized studies compared RF ablation versus PEI for the treatment of earlystage HCC. The first trial, performed in European centers, failed to show a statistically significant difference in overall survival between patients who received RF ablation and those treated with PEI. More recently, survival advantages have been identified in two Asian studies. All three investigations showed that RF ablation had higher local anticancer effect than PEI, leading to a better local control of the disease. Therefore, RF ablation appears as the preferred percutaneous therapy for patients with early-stage HCC on the basis of more consistent local tumor control. Clinical research with cryo and microwave ablation has been conducted in the framework of feasibility studies. These early investigations showed feasibility and safety of these procedures. However, further trials are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of these novel treatment options with respect to RF ablation and to devise an unbiased therapeutic strategy. Radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases can be done under conscious sedation or general anesthesia. General anesthesia limits possibilities of deep inspiration for lesions located near the diaphragm but permits more easily the treatment of multiple tumors in a single session.

Pereira; T\u00fcbingen/DE (philippe.pereira@med.uni-tuebingen.de) Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is increasingly used for the therapy of inoperable malignant tumors involving solid organs. Although minor complications (definition has been reported by SCVIR) are common similar to all other image guided interventions, the rate of major complications remains under 2%. The majority of them are related to thermal injury. Nevertheless RF ablation involves some elements of risk depending on the location and the size of the tumor to be treated and the aggressiveness of the entire procedure. Adverse effects are pain, fever, fatigue and nausea. The most frequent complications, also depending upon the tumor type and location, are bleeding, pleural effusion and infection. Tumor cell seeding and grounding pad burns are seldom, and may be considered as iatrogenic complications. Perforation of bowel structures occurs most often by using ultrasound as the imaging modality for guidance. Renal and lung ablation may be related to organ-specific complications such as ureteral strictures or pneumothorax respectively. To perform RF ablation in a safe way, the interventionalist must: a) be aware of potential risks related to tumor location and tumor type, b) use an adequate imaging modality to monitor the procedure, c) recognize the preliminary signs of complications, d) be able to treat the majority of these complications. In this categorical course, we will illustrate a broad spectrum of minor and major complications and provide practical tips for preventing or treating them. The development in recent years has resulted in achieving significant advances in molecular biology allowing the identification of genes and pathways related to the disease and in parallel technologies allowing improved spatial and temporal resolution, better depth penetration, enhanced sensitivity, improved image processing and advanced combinations of different imaging modalities. In the following, the aims of molecular imaging are presented as well as the methodological requirements such as laboratory equipment, and radiological modalities such as CT, PET-CT, MR imaging and optional technology. Different methods will be introduced to increase spatial and temporal resolution in order to improve sensitivity, depth penetration, image processing and the impact of different imaging modalities. The role of the molecular imaging team will be highlighted including the cooperation with scientific groups such as biological and molecular oncology and various other basic sciences. In summary, it will be a challenging task to structure a molecular imaging program as it needs integrative cooperation between various techniques and fields of experimental and clinical medicine. Animal imaging laboratories must be considered from two different angles. 1. Why set up animal imaging laboratories? To answer to this, one must have above all a clear research program. Strategic research orientations will be discussed, according to the NIH and NIBIB programs. 2. Which kind of equipment? Performance and limitations of current animal imaging modalities will be reviewed. Finally, data on small animal imaging facilities of Europe and US will be provided. Learning Objectives:",

Public and private payers are also spearheading initiatives to stem the costs of treating acute events, which are neither cost-effective, nor advantageous for patients who would drastically benefit from earlier disease detection. Further, the pharmaceutical industry is seeking to develop novel treatments in therapeutic areas such as neurology, where objective clinical diagnosis of disease would help drug developers assess the impact of a potential treatment. Just as most of the therapeutics used commonly were ushered in by advances in diagnostics, more sophisticated diagnostics will lead to new pharmaceutical development resulting in more targeted, patient-specific and cost-effective treatments. Patients will benefit, physicians will benefit, and payers will benefit. This session will further detail how the relationship between diagnostic and pharmaceutical R&D will evolve. We will discuss examples of tandem diagnostic and pharmaceutical development that GE Healthcare is exploring in Alzheimer's and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We will explore the regulatory shifts that might catalyze these advances, reiterating the importance of interaction between the academic research communities and the diagnostics industry. We will also detail opportunities for improved cooperation between academia and industry that might further support the objectives of each. Learning Objectives: 1.

These may concern the whole range of scientific and technological fields, from social sciences to astronomy, through genomics and nanotechnologies. Examples include libraries, databases, biological archives, clean rooms, communication networks, research vessels, satellite and aircraft observation facilities, coastal observatories, telescopes, synchrotrons and accelerators. They may be \"single-sited\", \"distributed\" and \"virtual\". ESFRI members are from all EU member states and seven associated countries representing the Ministers of Research.

Current MSCT scanners examine the abdomen and pelvis within one breathold, i.e., without motion-artifact. MSCT of the urinary tract allows for multiplanar image reconstruction with meaningful diagnosis of the precise location, size, and extent of renal lesions in imaging planes other than axial. Postprocessing tools provide 2D-and 3D-impressions of renal lesions in relation to renal parenchyma, extrarenal fat, renal sinus, pyelocaliceal system, ureter, blood vessels, and surrounding organs. Urinary tract trauma typically occurs in motor vehicle accidents, assaults, sports, fall from heights or from surgical procedures. Trauma may be blunt, penetrating or due to deceleration. Specific symptoms, e.g. hematuria, may be absent even in severe injuries. The radiological evaluation includes the occurrence and extent of renal injury (contusion, laceration, fracture, shattered kidney) with or without ischemia, rupture of the collecting system (urinary leakage), subcapsular and perirenal hematoma, vascular pedicle injury (renal artery and vein) and associated injuries. Ultrasonography and urography should not be used for initial evaluation, since the degree of injury may be grossly underestimated. Multislice CT (MSCT) using thin collimation, isotropic voxels and coronal and sagittal reconstructions greatly facilitates interpretation. Scanning in the early vascular phase depicts vascular injuries and the extent of ischemic renal injury. Scanning should also be performed in the excretory phase, > 8-10 minutes after contrast injection, including the entire abdomen and pelvis to assess the extent of urine and blood leakage. MSCT can be decisive in identifying the relatively rare cases where surgical or radiological intervention is necessary. Bladder rupture may be intra-or extraperitoneal. Surgery should be considered in cases of intraperitoneal rupture. MSCT including late imaging (10 minutes) after intravenous contrast is accurate in differentiating the two, by identification of opacified urine intra-or extraperitoneally. Alternatively, MSCT may be performed after diluted contrast medium has been instilled through a transurethral Foley catheter (CT cystography), but bladder catheterisation should only be performed after urethral injury has been ruled out.",

In the evaluation of extra-axial brain tumors CT and MR imaging represent the two most important and commonly used imaging modalities. CT is superior for detecting areas of calcification and for evaluating bony changes related to the tumor. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is also very helpful in the presurgical evaluation of the tumors. The multiplanar capability and the superior contrast resolution of MR imaging makes it the best technique in the evaluation of extra-axial brain tumors. MR imaging permits more reliable distinction between intra-and extraaxial tumors and provides better delineation of the relationship of extra-axial tumors to the surrounding brain and vital structures involved by the tumor. Additionally MR imaging is also more useful in delineating tumors of the posterior cranial fossa where beam hardening artifacts obscure their delineation on CT. Imaging studies play an important role in the diagnosis of extra-axial tumors and provide crucial information to the neurosurgeon in preoperative planning. Neuroradiology plays a key role in the diagnosis and preoperative setup of patients with brain tumours. State-of-the-art imaging requires a standardised imaging protocol, careful and systematic study of the images and finally an attempt at characterisation of the lesion. The radiological diagnosis and differential diagnosis of intra-axial tumours no longer relies on CT-scan and routine MR-sequences alone. Standard multiplanar imaging has to be combined with fMRI to allow exact anatomical location of the lesion and precise determination of the extension of the tumour. Perfusion and diffusion MR become more and more important in the differential diagnosis of cerebral mass lesions and in grading and typing of gliomas.

The performance of a percutaneous intervention includes number of specimen, specimen radiography in case of microcalcification, histopathologic handling of the probes and finally the use of standard of reporting after histologic-radiologic correlation. 70 % (minimum) and 90 % (best practice) of all cancer patients have to be confirmed histologically before surgery. Imaging guidance should be chosen in respect of the most reliable way to visualize the lesion. The shortest approach should be attempted in accordance with the surgeons. Performance indicators of every localisation method are: 1. the distance between wire and lesion, 2. the percentage of non -palpable lesions successfully removed with one step procedure and 3. the benign: malignant biopsy ratio. Outcome quality assurance requires comprehensive documentation and a multidisciplinary approach to get institution-specific audit results. (2) to provide an accurate histological diagnosis for malignant lesions, to design the patient's treatment before any surgery. The difficulty of these procedures is that the diagnoses are made only on a sampling of the targeted lesion. The definitive conclusions can be made if appropriate radiological information are provided to the pathologist. In the histological report, relevant information are required for the appropriate clinical management of the patient. Benign lesions that need to be excised have to be clearly identified. For malignant lesion, the amount of information given is controversial but is related to the quality of the sampling. For in situ carcinoma, the histological type, the nuclear grade and the absence of invasion on the analyzed samples should be provided. For invasive carcinomas, the type, the grade, the mitotic index and immunohistochemical predictive factors should be evaluated when possible. Some specific information for radiological/histological analysis, have to be clearly documented within the report to guarantee the accuracy of the sampling. This information depends on the type of the targeted. The remaining discordant cases should be discussed in multidisciplinary meeting. Lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell lesions and lobular neoplasia are more frequently diagnosed on core needle biopsies. A cautious diagnostic management of these \"borderline\" lesions is warranted. Chronic liver disease leading to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis represents the most common and clinically important etiopathogenetic base of sinusoidal portal hypertension (PH). The presinusoidal PH evolves as a result of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction or infiltration of portal spaces (schistosomiasis, congenital fibrosis). The hepatocytes are usually not touched by these pathogenetic processes. Postsinusoidal PH is characterized by diffuse obstruction of the hepatic venous tree, or by venoocclusive disease, touching primarily the central hepatic venule. The critical sequella is ischemic liver injury due to a reduction in hepatic perfusion.",

To the unwary observer they present a bewildering spectrum of radiographic appearances that can lead to misinterpretation and suboptimal management. Although primary malignancies of bone are relatively rare they frequently pose an intriguing problem for the radiologist as the pathologist is often equally challenged.

The purpose of this presentation is to highlight the less obvious benefits that HRCT has brought. The role of HRCT in elucidating the pathogenesis and behaviour of some DILDs has only emerged in the last few years. In particular, HRCT has helped to reconcile apparent discrepancies between pathologic diagnosis and expected clinical outcome in the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. HRCT has increasingly revealed what histopathologic examination of a small volume of lung tissue cannot, namely the frequency with which different pathologic processes may be present in a given individual. In this context, the concepts of coexistence, overlap and transformation will be explored. As a consequence of both the diagnostic prowess of HRCT and patient preference, lung biopsy confirmation of DILD is increasingly confined to \"atypical\" cases such that there are difficulties in acquiring enough data for morphologic studies. In a clinical trial setting, HRCT is now being used as a powerful means of stratifying subjects who were previously recruited and categorised by relatively crude criteria. As an example, HRCT of a study group of subjects labelled as having \"COPD\" showed a heterogeneous group of conditions with 29% of the group having bronchiectasis as the primary pulmonary disease. HRCT continues to reveal more that just a histospecific diagnosis. The introduction of new radiotherapy and surgical techniques requires close collaboration between clinician and radiologist to optimise the application of imaging. This principle will be illustrated by a review of how MR imaging has helped implement new therapies for the treatment of cervical and rectal carcinoma. In cervical cancer the selection of patients for uterus-conserving surgery has been optimised by accurate MR imaging prediction of the relationship of the tumour to the internal os. Also, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been aided by co-locational imaging between MR imaging and CT to define the gross tumour volume (GTV). Widespread implementation of pelvic IMRT has been prevented by the lack of a validated method for defining the nodal clinical volume (CTV). Recent work has shown the accuracy of ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) in distinguishing infiltrated from normal nodes in gynaecological malignancy. By evaluating 1216 nodal contours, using USPIOs, guidelines for outlining pelvic nodes have been produced.",

However, in the last 10 to 20 years, digital imaging modalities are becoming more prevalent as new techniques and equipment are developed. Most standardization work was directed at the source of radiation with little attention the recording media. Radiological equipment had to be designed and operated in such a way as to optimize the fundamental properties of films. Most standards and regulations were intended to ensure that these characteristics would be maintained during the operation of the equipment. However, with the advent of digital receptors and their different operational characteristics, these principles do not necessarily apply and need to be revisited. The standardization of digital image receptors brings new challenges to Standard Writing Organizations and to governments alike. The standardization work is further complicated by the multiplicity of technologies available in digital image receptors. Acceptance and Quality Control tests that have been used for years are no longer appropriate. Standard Writing Organizations and governments are also trying to find a balance between stringent requirements which could discourage technological development and innovation, and inadequate requirements which could lead to high patient doses and poor image quality.",

No single musculoskeletal disorder has generated more passionate discussion than bone osteonecrosis with its poorly understood physiopathogeny, its wide range of clinical presentation and its debated treatment. MR imaging largely contributed to the discussion mainly because it provided new insights into the natural history of ischemic lesions of bones and demonstrated several patterns of involvement. This presentation addresses key imaging features of bone osteonecrosis such as elementary lesion patterns and subchondral fractures in the case of epiphyseal osteonecrosis. Imaging features that enable differentiation between epiphyseal osteonecrosis, rapidly progressive osteoarthritis, transient osteoporosis and epiphyseal fractures will be emphasized.

Hematogeneous spread is the most common cause of spinal infection due to a dense vascular network around the vertebral column. Infection starts in the well-vascularized anterolateral edge of a vertebral body which has a particularly dense supply and infection spreads within the vertebral body, adjacent soft tissues and, involves intervertebral disc from here. MR imaging in the examination is the method preferred today, being highly sensitive and specific than plain radiography and CT. Although finding the difference between tuberculosis and pyogenic spinal infection is difficult clinically and radiographically, symmetric and large paravertebral abscess, disc preservation in the early stage of the disease, involvement of posterior elements are the much favorable radiological findings for spinal tuberculosis. Osteomyelitis indicates infection of bone and marrow space. It can be classified into three forms: acute, subacute and chronic. There are three routes of infection: hematogenous, implantation, and contiguous. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of the disease. In pediatric age group, osteomyelitis is seen in two different entities as infantile and juvenile osteomyelitis related to blood supply of the bone. The diagnosis of osteomyelitis, is largely dependent to use combination of plain radiography, MR imaging and/or scintigraphy. On plain film, early findings include smaller lytic lesions which may coalesce into larger lesions with time. Periosteal reaction, sequestration, cortical thickening, thick periosteal reaction and sinus tracts are the findings of subacute or chronic osteomyelitis. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn anatomic details of vertebral column and to make correlation with pathological changes which occur due to spinal infection. 2. To learn how to make interpretations of radiological changes at spinal infection using with plain radiography, CT and MR imaging. 3. To understand pathological changes due to spinal bone infections and choose appropriate imaging algorithm for making differential diagnosis between pyogenic infection and spinal tuberculosis. 4. To learn causes of bone infection and make correlation with clinicopathological classification. 5. To understand the pathophysiology of paediatric osteomyelitis and contrast it with the available imaging modalities. 6. To discuss the differences of imaging features between acute, sub-acute and chronic bone infections. Within a few months of the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, X-ray images were used to plan and guide a surgical intervention. This lecture provides a brief history of the subsequent technological advances that led to surgical navigation and image directed therapy. In the first half of the 20 th Century triangulation methods were used to locate and remove foreign bodies. In the 1950's real-time fluoroscopic imaging provided the means to place devices and assess their effect in cardiovascular interventions. In the 1970's the advent of 3D imaging, together with the stereotactic frame, provided the means to place a needle at a 3D target in the brain. Improved methods for registration between images, plan and patient provided real-time surgical navigation largely supplanted the stereotactic frame. Parallel developments in image directed radiotherapy allowed planning and accurate delivery of radiation. Over the last couple of decades a number of other energy sources have been developed for image directed tissue ablation including radio-frequency, high intensity focussed ultrasound, light in photodynamic therapy and cryo-ablation. Image directed therapy has to date primarily been restricted to applications in which the spatial transformation between the coordinates of the patient's anatomy and the image derived plan can be described by the 3D motion of a rigid body. Where therapy is to be delivered to soft deform-ing tissue this is clearly inadequate. This talk will describe the computational and engineering challenges in building appropriate patient specific computational models of soft deforming and moving anatomy and their validation in image guided interventions and image directed therapy. Image guidance will be augmented by high-resolution, intra-operative imaging based on optical, ultrasound or MR technologies. These technologies will be integrated with novel, molecular based, patient-specific treatments that will translate from the laboratory to the clinic. The subjective interpretation of breast lesions with mammography, ultrasound, and MR-imaging is difficult to evaluate and to improve. Medical audit is the only way to measure breast imaging performance in a manner, that includes not only technical, but also interpretive capabilities of the system. The \"Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System\" (BI-RADS TM ) is a quality insurance tool, designed to standardize breast imaging reporting, reduce confusion in breast imaging interpretations, and facilitate outcome monitoring. Through a medical audit and outcome monitoring, the system provides important peer review and quality assurance data to improve the quality of patient care. The BI-RADS TM is the product of a cooperative effort between members of various committees of the American College of Radiology and has become a widely accepted tool all over the world. There is a need for continuous education of the BI-RADS TM -classification because it is arranged to be used in everyday practice and should make it possible to issue meaningful unambiguous breast imaging reports. This BI-RADS TM -session is organized to provide participants with an introduction to the most important sections of this system. These are the breast imaging lexicon for mammography, ultrasound, and MR imaging; the reporting system, including report organisation, and finally follow-up and outcome monitoring. Beside the theoretical background participants will be trained under supervision how to apply the BI-RADS TM by teaching breast imaging cases. The material will be presented in an interactive way with audience participation and self assessment by use of an electronic voting system (key-pads). The majority of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal neoplasms are squamous cell cancers. As these tumors arise from the mucosal layer, inspection is important in staging the lesion. Imaging is needed to detect deep tumour growth into the paraglottic space, cartilage involvement and extralaryngeal or extrapharyngeal tumour spread. Overall, CT and MR imaging show comparable results in defining tumour extent. Surgery and radiotherapy are the only curative treatments for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy can be used as an adjunct to one or both of the other treatment modalities. Most early staged cancers can be cured by either surgery or radiotherapy. Patients with moderately advanced lesions may benefit from combined therapy. Advanced lesions often can only be treated palliatively. The treatment plan for a particular patient is the result of a multifactorial decision process including tumour characteristics, tumour staging and volume, patient condition, and patient/institutional preferences. Objective tumour data from imaging studies, are helpful to ensure a firm basis for informing the patient about his prognosis and for treatment decision making. After radiotherapy, the detection of residual or recurrent tumor by physical examination is difficult. The use of follow-up imaging allows to identify patients at risk for recurrent tumor, and to detect these recurrences at an earlier stage than clinical examination alone. This potentially leads to more prompt salvage surgery in non-responders but whether a survival benefit is achievable remains to be proven. Imaging is also of value to differentiate treatment complications, such as laryngeal necrosis from tumor recurrence. A-159 C. The contrast-enhancing disc D.

This is probably the reason why the use of gadoliniumchelate has been propagated for assessment of disc space infection and for the distinction between recurrent disc herniation and peridural fibrosus in patients who underwent spinal surgery. However, even normal discs may enhance minimally during MR imaging when intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents are administered and delayed images are obtained. The weak enhancement of normal discs is caused by the fact that diffusion is the only mechanism how contrast agent may enter into the disc. Marked contrast enhancement of the entire disc is rare and, if present, most commonly associated with phlegmoneous disc space infection. More commonly peripheral disc enhancement may be observed due to ingrowth of fibrovascular tissue within the disc or the adjacent bone marrow. Peripheral contrast enhancement may be present in extruded or fragmented discs and in degenerative discs with abnormalities of the adjacent bone marrow of Modic Type I. A typical representative of localized contrast-enhancement at the vertebral rim at the insertion of the annulus fibrosus is the Romanus lesion in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Slight peripheral enhancement of the disc may also be present in Schmorl's node. Finally disc enhancement is a hallmark of disc space infection. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the role of MR contrast agents for evaluation of spinal disc abnormalities. 2. To provide an overview of the disease spectrum which are associated with an enhancing disc. 3.

They are defined as small round or oval opacities with well-defined margins, and a size of less than 3 cm. Before the widespread use of computed tomography (CT), nodules were primarily detected on chest radiograms, and when they measured more than 1 cm in diameter. Nowadays, with CT scanning applicable to most indications for imaging of the chest, more and smaller nodules are detected in different patient populations. This tendency is enhanced by technical progress, and by every step in the development of new CT scanners. Whereas the increasing sensitivity in nodule detection is desirable for early diagnosis of lung cancer, and for the care of the oncologic patient, it may pose significant problems for the management of individual patients. Although recent CT lung cancer screening trials have yielded an abundance of data, and thus, helped to create a new body of knowledge regarding the morphology, biologic characteristics, and growth rate of lung nodules, a large number of important questions remain: Is a nodule found in a smoker benign or malignant? Which nodule out of several found in a smoker is malignant and which is benign? How shall we manage a five millimeter nodule detected in a patient with a non-pulmonary cancer? Shall we use invasive or non-invasive methods to explore a 6 millimeter nodule in a non-smoker? To answer these questions, a number of fundamental issues must be addressed. Therefore, this special focus session will review the epidemiologic, biologic, and molecular basics important for the understanding of managing patients with pulmonary nodules. Second, the morphologic, metabolic, and dynamic CT features of focal pulmonary abnormalities and pulmonary nodules will be elucidated. Finally, new guidelines to enhance the diagnostic armamentarium of the radiologist will be presented and integrated into a practical management approach to pulmonary nodules in low-risk and high-risk patients. Learning Objectives: 1. To familiarize the attendees with the epidemiology and biological behaviour of pulmonary nodules. 2. To describe the radiologic tools and criteria to perform a state-of-the-art assessment of a pulmonary nodule. 3. To provide guidelines for a practical management approach to pulmonary nodules in different patient populations.",

Pure (non-solid) or mixed (partially-solid) ground glass opacities (GGOs) are more likely to be malignant than solid nodules. The great majority of small (< 5 mm) nodules are benign. The likelihood of a solid nodule being malignant increases with increasing size. Round shaped GGOs and mixed nodules with GGO in the periphery and high attenuation in the centre are very often malignant whereas solid nodules with a polygonal shape are most commonly benign. A ratio of maximum transverse diameter to maximum z-axis dimension > 1.78 is highly specific for benign nodules. Smooth margin of solid nodules is most commonly associated with benignancy. Although complex shape, irregular or spiculated margin, and air content of solid nodules are more frequent in malignant than benign nodules, the discriminant role of these features remains limited. Both diffuse calcification of the nodule and presence of fat in a solid nodule are definitive criteria of benignancy. For solid nodules (> 10 mm) a negative quantitative contrast enhanced CT or negative FDG-PET is a strong predictor of benignancy. Most benign GGO and mixed nodules disappear after 3-month follow-up. Appearance of solid components in GGO nodules in follow-up is a very high predictor of malignancy. Volume doubling times of malignant GGO and solid nodules are on the order of 2 years and 6 months respectively. ",

Clearly, lung nodules in a smoker have a different significance compared to those detected in an oncologic patient, or those seen in a young non-smoker with no risk factors for malignant disease. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that apart from pretest probability, the traditional morphologic criteria, nodule size and patient age are important factors in the construction of a management model for patients with pulmonary nodules. Current management strategies for indeterminant small pulmonary nodules have raised serious concerns, because they are partly flawed or, partly outdated. For example, existing recommendations involve several follow-up CT examinations for every indeterminant nodule, regardless of its size. Such elaborate follow-up protocols are not required for very small nodules, and particularly, not when such nodules are found incidentally in young non-smokers without a history of cancer. Furthermore, in young patients, the risk from radiation must be weighted against the risk of missing a malignant disorder, or the risk arising from an invasive diagnostic approach. As the risk of malignancy increases with nodule size, focal abnormalities with a diameter of more than 8 mm require a more aggressive and potentially invasive diagnostic approach to confirm or rule out cancer. The aim of this presentation is to provide the audience with a practical approach to the management of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules of various sizes in patients with different risk profiles for a malignant pulmonary disorder, such as lung cancer.

New strategies in data handling are required to deal with the increasing number of acquired images, augmented by frequently needed orthogonal reformations. Three-dimensional volume rendered visualization of MDCT volume data sets produces much more then only impressive images. On the one hand the reduction of the collimated slice thickness, beside other significant benefits, realizes the isotropic voxel, which is the prerequisite for sophisticated three-dimensional visualization. But on the other hand the continuing technical innovation in MDCT technology is responsible for a true data explosion. The major consequences are: 1. conventional image interpretation slice by slice becomes time consuming, as there are thousands of single images to deal with 2. The isotropy of the acquired volume data enables distortion-free threedimensional visualization. Challenged by the data explosion evolving from MDCT, alternative visualization and analysis using volumetric tools, including 3D visualization and thick MPR reconstructions must evolve from luxury to necessity. MDCT protocols may have to be tailored on their clinical usability in consideration of three-dimensional display. More and more the volumetric display of volumetric data become reality and may lead to volume reporting. The presentation will give a overview on current useful 3D applications with a focus on emergency room usability including some technical fundamentals. CT scanning plays a major role in the emergency diagnosis of head, spine and spinal cord injury, stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used in spine and spinal cord injury and to diagnose ischaemic stroke. The new therapeutic potential of thrombolysis demands an urgent diagnosis and the adoption of a \"brain attack\" or \"stroke unit\" protocol similar to the cardiology approach to heart attacks. From a therapeutic standpoint, neuroradiology can tackle the emergency treatment of subarachnoid haemorrhage with the embolization of aneurysms, AVM and fistulae and treat ischaemic stroke by locoregional intra-arterial thrombolysis.",

Chateil; Bordeaux/FR (jean-francois.chateil@chu-bordeaux.fr) Emergencies in children are quite different from the pathologies encountered in adults. Management of children in the emergency room includes several important steps. The first one is the clinical knowledge of the paediatric diseases. This point is mandatory in childrens' hospitals, but sometimes more difficult to obtain in general hospitals. The second point, in relation with imaging, concerns the equipment and the radiographers. Conventional imaging remains a very important step, because many diseases can be identified with plain films. In some cases, specific devices can be useful, to perform a good exposure including chest device and sand sacks to help the immobilisation. A good practice is essential. Sonography is very often used in paediatric emergencies: in most cases, abdominal examination is performed, but also musculoskeletal, testicular, chest ultrasound is useful. High frequency probes are always mandatory. CT and MR imaging are performed with the same devices as in adults. One of the most difficult point is the need for immobility, and in some cases, sedation or anaesthesia have to be performed, and specific monitoring equipment can be used. Attention to the level of radiation delivered with CT is also very important in children. The third specific point concerns the radiologist. An awareness of the main emergencies pathologies is essential. The radiologist must also be familiar with all the normal variations which mimic pathology. Specific or rare diseases can be more difficult to teach to the entire population of radiologists, and teleradiology can be helpful to solve some urgent cases. The liver provides excellent soil in which metastases can establish, thus it is the second most commonly involved organ by metastatic disease from virtually any primary malignant neoplasm. Hepatic involvement by metastatic tumor and the duration of survival are considered to be inversely related, nevertheless the available therapeutic arsenal becomes more and more effective and thus information regarding presence, number and localization of liver metastases may greatly influence therapeutic decisions and outcome of the disease. However effective the clinical and laboratory tests may be, the final diagnosis of hepatic involvement is based on results of imaging procedures. The list of modalities available for this purpose includes transabdominal and intraoperative ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography, image-guided biopsy and different methods of nuclear medicine. Detectability, appearance and characterization of liver metastases depend on site of origin, tumor characteristics, size and localization of lesions. The usual diagnostic algorithm is based on routine ultrasound and CT examination, but the clinical situation may require more accurate evaluation by contrast-enhanced US, CT-arterio-portography, or cell-specific contrast-enhanced MR imaging examination. Proper knowledge of efficiency of these methods is indispensable for finding the most effective diagnostic algorithm for the each individual patient. In comparison to metastases and HCC in cirrhosis, primary malignant hepatic tumours without cirrhosis are less common. 10% -40 % of all HCC may occur in the non-cirrhotic liver -potentially arising from adenoma/adenomatosis -whereas the tumours' imaging features compare to HCC in cirrhotic liver (hypervascularization, necrosis/heterogeneity in large tumours, fibrous capsule, fatty metamorphosis, calcifications). Fibrolamellar HCC, a tumour of young adults, distinct from HCC regarding origin, differentiation and prognosis, is characterized by lamellar fibrous strands, a fibrous central scar, calcifications, and heterogenous enhancement. Less common tumours arising from the cholangiocellular cell line are represented by the intrahepatic (peripheral) and the extrahepatic (ductal) cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumour). Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (CC) accounting for about 10 % of all primary hepatic malignancies arise from biliary ductal epithelium in the hepatic periphery often mimicking metastases with respect to imaging findings. Unlike intrahepatic CC, extrahepatic CC often causes biliary obstruction while the tumour itself frequently is not displayed. In contrast, biliary cystadenocarcinoma appears as uni-or multilocular cystic masses, whereas peripheral nodular and septal enhancement may represent malignant components of this tumours. Angiosarcoma, a rare tumour derived from endothelial cells, has a strong association with the exposure to toxic agents.

            "text": "Recent clinical studies have shown that there is a progressive decrease in both portal and arterial intranodular blood supply as the dysplastic nodule progresses from low to high grade followed by progressive increase in arterial supply as the nodule progresses from well to poorly differentiated HCC. These changes are the result of two, possibly independent, processes acting in parallel: a) Capillarization -(liver sinusoids becoming ordinary capillaries) and b) Angiogenesis (development of newly formed \"unpaired\" arteries). Moreover, these intranodular vascular changes dictate the imaging findings of an HCC demonstrated on a dynamic multiphasic CT and MR, or contrast enhanced US. These imaging findings represent actually a spectrum of findings with significant overlap among the different cirrhotic nodules making their differentiation sometimes difficult. Background: Benign pleural disease commonly occurs after asbestos exposure. Asbestos-induced benign pleural disease can be subdivided into pleural plaques, pleural effusions and diffuse pleural thickening. Pleural plaques are the commonest manifestation of asbestos exposure and consist of elevated areas of hyaline fibrosis arising from the parietal pleura. Pleural plaques commonly affect the posterolateral chest wall, diaphragm and mediastinal pleura, the apices and costophrenic angles being typically spared. On CT, pleural plaques are seen as circumscribed areas of pleural thickening with well-demarcated edges. Benign pleural effusions due to asbestos exposure are often underdiagnosed and consist of haemorrhagic exudates. They may spontaneously resolve, persist or recur after many years. Diffuse pleural thickening is less specific for asbestos exposure than pleural plaques and is often preceded by pleural effusion. Diffuse pleural thickening involves the visceral pleura. Pleural fibromas have various synonyms including local, fibrous benign mesothelioma; localized fibrous tumour; subpleural, submesothelial or pleural fibroma but solitary fibrous tumour is the current accepted term. The majority arise from visceral pleura and are attached to pleura by vascular pedicle which may be demonstrable on imaging. They may be mobile and change in shape with position. Pleural lipomas are mesenchymal tumours which are recognizable as being of fat attenuation on CT. Conclusion: Benign pleural diseases often have characteristic imaging features and cross-sectional imaging, including CT, can be very useful in the evaluation of these conditions. Ultrasound, multislice CT, magnetic resonance imaging and PET-CT may all be used in the investigation of suspected malignant pleural disease. The use of disease distribution, degree of pleural thickening and involvement of the chest wall have all been shown to be of benefit in discriminating malignant from benign disease. This presentation will discuss the use of these features and the use of the different imaging techniques to aid in the diagnosis of pleural disease. Additionally image guided biopsy has now been shown to be effective in the investigation of suspected malignant pleural disease, and an explanation of the techniques available for pleural biopsy will be presented. Functional MR imaging is a non-invasive technique capable of depicting brain activity. It is extensively used in the neurophysiological study of the human brain, and more recently clinical applications have appeared in the presurgical workup of patients with brain tumours as well as in the study of the diagnosis and treatment of different neurological and psychiatric diseases. This refresher course will review both the MR physics and physiological principles underlying the functional MR imaging technique. The Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast, as well as other techniques will be discussed. Pitfalls regarding false positive and false negative fMRI activation will be addressed. It will review the most widely used (clinical) protocols to visualise brain activity during sensory (visual, taste, sensation, auditory, \u2026), motor and cognitive actions. The difference, advantages and challenges of block and event-related paradigms will be discussed. Details of acquisition and post-processing relevant to the study of specific brain activations will be elaborated on, e.g. on the use of adapted fMRI sequences for the study of the auditory system, where auditory stimuli have to be delivered without interference of the MR imaging scanner noise. Finally, stimulation equipment to deliver visual, auditory, and other stimuli, as well as monitoring equipment to record responses, eye movements, etc. \u2026 will be covered. In summary, this part of the RC will introduce the audience to the basic principles, techniques, paradigms and stimulation equipment that is at present used in state-of-the art fMRI studies. Preoperative fMRI of motor, somatosensory and language function is used worldwide by an increasing number of medical centers for safer surgery on brain tumors and epileptogenic foci. The method has not yet reached the status of a standardized diagnostic procedure. Therefore this talk provides the information that is relevant for the successful and responsible application of fMRI prior to brain surgery: The functional neuroanatomy of the motor and somatosensory systems and of language is summarized. Optimized clinical fMRI protocols and reference data are presented. Physiological and important pathological diagnostic findings are presented as well as the intraoperative validation of the functional localizations in neuronavigators using electrocorticography. Multimodality integration with MEG is presented. Important limitations and pitfalls of preoperative fMRI are discussed. Learning Objectives:",

Bizzi; Milan/IT (alberto_bizzi@fastwebnet.it) Plasticity means different things to different scientists, but most would agree with the following definition: A change in structure over time resulting in a change of function. Plastic changes occur at the level of the synapse, and are consequently reflected at the level of neuronal networks. It has been established that human brains show considerable plastic changes during development and that plasticity is also present in injured adult brains. In patients with lesions of the nervous system plasticity is the active or passive process of reorganizing connections and re-coordinating a network of areas while function is recovering. Brain functions may be localised in functionally segregated brain regions but are mainly represented in extended, connected, overlapping and highly parallel processing networks. In normal subjects, it is characterised by a decrease of focal brain activity going along with an increased connectivity between the collaborating nets. Recovery of function seems to imply the \"reconnection\" or the recoordination of a network of areas. Non-invasive functional neuroimaging methods such as fMRI offer the experimental opportunity for measuring changes in connectivity and functional segregation that accompany and underpin behavioural change or functional improvement after brain injury. This presentation will review the potential applications and limitations of fMRI to illustrate plastic changes occuring in patients after stroke, head injury or along the course of a relapsing remitting disease such as multiple sclerosis. Pain of dental origin is most frequently caused by the root canal or the periodontal ligament space. Inflammation, trauma or tumor in this region can easily spread into the surrounding soft tissues, sinus or jaw bone. In addition, a multitude of diseases occurring in the jaw can involve the teeth leading to pain as a first indicator of a lesion. While conventional imaging methods such as panoramic radiography and dental film are very useful in detection of these diseases, newer imaging methods including dental CT and dental MR have recently gained importance in diagnosing dental associated diseases of the mandible and maxilla. Unfortunately, most radiologists have had little experience in this area and many of the CT and MR findings remain undescribed. This presentation will focus on the technique and usefulness of CT and MR in diagnosing pathologic conditions and complications leading to pain of dental origin. Furthermore, the correct imaging technique and the most important error sources will be discussed. To enable a clear understanding of dental CT and MR, clinical images will be added to demonstrate the correlation of intra-oral findings and the radiological presentation. As a goal, the radiologist should be aware of possible findings presenting as pain in the jaw region and be able to communicate them to the clinician. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with causes of pain of dental origin. Cortical changes are best depicted by CT, whilst soft tissue including bone marrow is best visualized by MR imaging and OPG shows the relationship to the dentoalveolar system. Common causes of pain are disk dislocation, osteoarthritis (\"internal derangement\"), rheumatoid arthritis, and trauma. Imbalance of the muscles of mastication or masticator space tumours, as well as dysfunction of the cervical spine or sacroiliac joints are rare causes for facial pain.",

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been widely studied in primary or secondary treatment of liver, renal and lung lesions. The indications of percutaneous management of malignant skeletal lesion are usually palliative, with pain control as the primary aim. RF ablation of bone metastases in patients with refractory pain destroys sensory nerves and tumour cells, interrupting pain transmission and reducing the humoral cascade involved in both nerve sensitization and osteoclastic activity, thus resulting in pain relief. The RF ablation creates well-delineated local tumour destruction with excellent pain control. However, skeletal tumour which has structural compromise with risk of compression fracture should be consolidated. For long bones, (e.g. femoral shaft) osteosynthesis is necessary but for flat bones, percutaneous cementoplasty will reduce the risk of compression fractures. Percutaneous cementoplasty is a therapeutic injection of bone cement into a vertebral body or bone which has structural compromise. It treats both pain and consolidates the weakened bone preventing further collapse. A painful lytic skeletal lesion, without fragility or risk of pathological fracture is the best indication for RF ablation alone; destroying the soft tissue mass and reducing pain. However for larger lesion with paravertebral invasion as well in cases of bone weakening secondary to a large mass, the combination of both techniques is an excellent procedure to ablate the tumour and to reduce the risk of vertebral body collapse. The best examples outside the spine are the iliac bone with extension of the tumour to the acetabulum or tibial and femoral condyle metastases. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises approximately 80% of primary malignant lung tumors. Lungs are also the second most frequent site of metastatic disease. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for early-stage NSCLC and oligometastases from colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, because of the high prevalence of chronic respiratory disorders and atherosclerotic vascular disease, only 30% of patients with NSCLC are clinically operable. On the other hand, the high risk of recurrence and the need to remove functioning lung tissue along with the lesions limit the indications for surgery in patients with colorectal metastases. Image-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique used to treat solid tumors. Because of its ability to produce large volumes of coagulation necrosis in a controlled fashion, this technique has gained acceptance as viable therapeutic option for unresectable liver malignancies. Recently, investigation has been focused on the use of RFA for the treatment of lung tumors. Pilot clinical trials have shown that this technique can achieve effective and reproducible tumor destruction with acceptable morbidity, and have suggested that it could represent a viable alternative or complementary treatment method for selected patients with NSCLC or lung metastases who are not candidates for surgical resection. However, further investigation in larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up will be needed to confirm these promising results and to establish the role of RFA in the clinical management of nonsurgical patients with lung malignancies. The appropriate use of modern imaging has now been shown to be effective at several levels. Clinicians become more confident about their diagnoses -for example in patients with lumbar spine problems when MR imaging evidence is available. Patients usually prefer CT and MR to more invasive alternatives -e.g. MR imaging rather than radiculography. And there are economic advantages to the health community if modern imaging is used appropriately. For example, in patients admitted for acute abdominal pain, the overall length of hospital stay is reduced if CT is used at an early stage. Similar evidence about improved clinical confidence and therapeutic decisions apply to CT for thoracic disorders. For these reasons sophisticated imaging is increasingly used at the start of the patient's journey through the diagnostic pathway rather than at the end. Sets of imaging data can now be interpreted and analysed at leisure retrospectively, regardless of the initial problem. Such comprehensive diagnostic possibilities call into question changes in the roles of primary care, radiologists and imaging departments and specialists. Increased reliance on radiological investigations, often at the expense of detailed physical examination, has been shown to be of advantage to the patient in terms of time, cost and health outcome. Are radiology departments now ready to assume more of a gatekeeper role? Some of the advantages and problems which may be encountered will be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the potential implications of radiology departments offering initial triage and treatment. 2. To appreciate the cost-effectiveness studies required to validate such an approach, both in the acute and community setting. 3. To reflect on the discussion that such a proposal might provoke.",

Adam; London/UK (Jane.Adam@stgeorges.nhs.uk) By tradition, professionals who have undergone appropriate training and been appointed to a substantive post have been regarded automatically as competent. This concept is now being called into question in the medical profession. There are many contributory factors to this change, including medicolegal scrutiny, but it is undoubtedly true that medicine is developing at a very fast pace, making it impossible for doctors to rely solely on knowledge gained during their training and necessitating the continual updating of knowledge and skills. The drive for the reassessment of doctors' performance at intervals during their careers has been greater in some countries than in others, and various different methods of assessment are in use or in development. The simplest schemes encourage doctors to attend appropriate courses or show that they are keeping their knowledge up to date, whilst the most elaborate rely on formal examinations for recertification. There are, however, many other methods including the appraisal of doctors' work by their peers, work colleagues and patients, and attempts to evaluate the diagnostic error rates of individual radiologists. All methods have limitations in terms of their reliability in assessing the professional and personal performance of doctors in their everyday practice.

When regarding the trends of the past decade, a trend towards increased utilization of crosssectional imaging with CT and MR imaging and decrease of plain radiography and diagnostic angiography is evident. It can be anticipated that this trend will also continue in the future. Newly emerging methods may have major impact on radiological practice. Molecular imaging, the transfer of molecular medicine methods to radiology, opens new horizons in the assessment of genetic risk, selection of appropriate therapy and monitoring of response to therapy. The markers employed require highly sensitive imaging methods. PET, ultrasound and MR imaging seem to be most appropriate. Optical imaging is only able to visualize structures close to the surface of the body, so that limited applications are to be expected. Performance of CT-scanners is improving very fast and may become a real competitor to coronary angiography in the near future. Cardiologists follow a strategic plan to take over this technique, as well as MR imaging of the heart. The radiology community has to undertake major efforts not to lose this important field. MR imaging has great abilities in assessing morphology, physiology and function. With higher field strengths, these abilities are even more enhanced. Multicoil, multi-receiver-channel systems allow for coverage of the whole body. Comprehensive imaging instead of dedicated examination strategies tailored for specific clinical questions may result.

Those standards must include the complete chain in clinical patient contacts. Current management should be based on guidelines detailing how and when to do which examination, with which equipment, with available radiologic knowledge catalogues. This interactive course will concentrate on common interpretation errors, but also on technical problems. Attendants will discuss cases in which the correct diagnosis was missed. Ways are shown how to avoid such errors. Cerebral metastases are currently the most common and feared complication of systemic cancer. Incidence is rising with improved survival of cancer patients. Placement of tumour emboli in the brain depends on passive supply of tumour cells via blood circulation. Hemispheric, brain stem, and cerebellar metastases arise proportionally to the weight and blood perfusion of these structures. Deposition of metastases occurs at the points of turbulent flow where the vessel calibre changes or at arterial end points. The most common neoplasms producing brain metastases are lung, breast, melanoma, colorectal, renal cancers. Clinical presentation and current therapeutic considerations depend on systemic dissemination of malignancy, localisation and especially, number of cerebral metastases. Therefore in cancers that frequently seed brain metastases, MR imaging as a screening method is more reasonable and cost-effective than CT. Lesions undetected on CT are less than 1-2 cm in diameter, located near to convex and skull base. Visualisation of additional metastases on CT could be improved by administration of double to triple contrast dosage and performing scans with 1-3 hours delay. On MR imaging routine contrast dose T1-WI with magnetisation transfer contrast improves detection of small lesions. The recommended basic MR imaging protocol and usefulness of additional sequences in establishing a correct diagnosis will be reviewed. Primary malignant glial tumour, abscess, spontaneous parenchymal haemorrhage, primary CNS lymphoma, inflammatory granuloma are typical differential diagnoses for single metastases, whereas consider abscesses, multifocal embolic infarction, and demyelinating disease for multiple deposits.

Direct extension from contiguous extra-cranial neoplasms, secondary invasion of the meninges by calvarium and skull base metastases, and migration along perineural or perivascular structures are less common. The incidence of leptomeningeal metastasis seems to increase, probably because of the increment in survival of many systemic neoplasms. Leptomeningeal invasion gives rise to tumor cells dissemination by CSF, eventually leading to neoplastic coating of brain surfaces (neoplastic meningitis). The CSF exam is the most useful non-imaging based test. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging is complementary and can be invaluable, detecting up to 50% of false-negative lumbar punctures. MR findings range from diffuse linear leptomeningeal enhancementfollowing the gyri and extending into the sulci -to multiple enhancing extra-axial nodules. Obstructive communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus may occur, due to obstruction of ventricular system or CSF resorption. Both calvarial and epidural metastases infrequently transgress the dura, which acts as a barrier against tumor spread. Radionuclide bone studies are still a valuable screening test to detect bone metastases. On CT and MR, bone metastases extending intracranially and primary dural metastases show the characteristic biconvex shape, usually associated with brain displacement away from the inner table. Although CT is better in detecting bone erosion of the skull base, MR is more sensitive in demonstrating even subtle abnormalities of the meninges, providing more detailed information about dural involvement. Perineural and perivascular spread from head and neck neoplasms require thin-section contrast-enhanced MR. Learning Objectives: 1.

To discuss the future of the diffusion weighted images in suggesting the diagnosis of spine metastases. Image quality is an important consideration for any medical imaging device. The transition from analogue to digital radiography in recent years has paralleled a renewed attention to image quality. Particular attention has been paid to detector and displays, two major components of digital imaging systems. Considering their crucial role, the performance of these devices can have a direct impact on the quality and efficacy of the interpretation process. The performance of digital detectors, as one of the first elements of the imaging chain, has a \"permanent\" impact on image quality, as no image can be improved beyond the inherent quality provided by the detector. In terms of displays, soft-copy displays, the most common display modality today, are by nature dynamic in nature, enabling manipulation of the images. However, this dynamic advantage comes at a cost: the performance of soft-copy displays can vary from device to device, vary over time, and vary as a function of the state of the calibration and set up of the device. Recent international efforts have led to the development of guidelines for characterizing the performance of detector and soft-copy display devices. This presentation will provide a framework for characterising image quality in the context of digital detectors and displays. It delineates particular methods and procedures for characterising the performance of these devices. Specific focus will be placed on the guidelines recently developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) for digital detectors, and those by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM TG18) and the IEC. A PACS system has to be considered a hospital resource. To understand the digital image management is it possible to adopt qualitative methods (interviews, questionnaires) or quantitative methods such as the number of examinations performed/patient treated or statistical analysis on turn-around time (time elapsed from examination request, execution time [ET] and the availability of report [RT] ) and on the average hospital stay by using the HIS/RIS data. It is commonly known that in a fully digital environment average turn-around time diminishes. How it diminishes is a workflow indicator: The different percentages of examinations executed/referred/completed as a function of the time are workflow indicators. How many workstations per ward, their type and number of monitors are well know arguments. Voice recognition, hanging and access protocols are some of the elements that are useful for the implementation of a \"second level\" PACS. Methodologies to adapt the display to environment need a multidisciplinary-multidepartment PACS planning committee. A quantitative analysis of PACS effects on the efficiency and effectiveness in overall patient clinical treatment can derive from a workflow optimization. The faster availability of reports can result in faster clinical action and a reduction in average length of patient hospital stay; however it is hard to attempt a statistical or economic assessment of this element because of its intrinsically multifactorial character. The keys to success are the interdepartmental cooperation and target sharing, training and continuous performance monitoring. Nuclear medicine and particularly PET have demonstrated over the last few years, that they are uniquely suitable to stage and monitor tumors during therapy. This is due to several factors: 1. Nuclear probes are orders of magnitude more sensitive than probes used in other clinical imaging modalities. 2. Since in FDG PET mainly tumors are depicted, the very high \"signal to background\" information makes it relatively easy to identify tumor foci. 3. Modern NM equipment is very efficient in assessing entire body regions and thus suitable for staging. High quality WB images are obtained in less than 30'. 4. The lack of anatomical references in FDG PET images has been overcome by the introduction of combined modality imaging with PET-CT and SPECT-CT, which make the entire examination more sensitive and more specific. While for some tumors such as bronchial carcinoma, NM imaging modalities are primarily used in initial staging, in others such as lymphoma, the emphasis is on therapy assessment. There exists a large body of literature demonstrating the superiority of NM approaches over conventional, more anatomically oriented imaging modalities. Minor limitations in the usefulness of NM methods are a lack of specificity of tracers such as FDG vis-\u00e0-vis inflammatory foci. However, in clinical practice, this limitation is rarely relevant. With the development of further tracers, particularly for PET imaging, it is expected to overcome these limitations. This will make PET uniquely suitable to become a key imaging modality in the quest for developing more personalized therapy approaches. ",

Tumor activity can be visualized by targeting angiogenesis either directly by mapping altered gene expression levels or indirectly using biomarkers such as the quantification of perfusion or other physiological parameters (e.g. glycolyis using FDG PET). Also, processes related to apoptosis and degradation of the extracellular matrix can be mapped based on specific contrast agents targeting annexin V and Matrix Metalloproteases, respectively. Once specific markers are found, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or drugs can be attached to locally deliver therapy. Gene therapy can be guided by MI. The delivery of a gene can be targeted using real-time image guidance. In addition, expression of a marker gene can be quantified using PET, MR imaging or other imaging modalities using labelled ligands. Spatial and temporal control of transgene expression can be achieved based on a combination of MR imaging-guided local hyperthermia and a heat-sensitive promoter. Stem cells may be used as gene therapy vectors and for tissue repair. Stem cells have been isolated, and labelled with MR contrast agents, then re-injected and tracked towards their target using serial MR imaging. Such methods are promising in clarifying the homing of stem cells and may allow image-guided stem cell therapy. The study of the mediastinum is performed with cross-sectional imaging (CT or MR imaging), due to the lack of contrast among the different mediastinal structures in conventional radiography. Nevertheless, the PA and lateral chest radiograph may be very useful as the initial examination to detect mediastinal masses and to suggest the next procedure to perform. The study of the mediastinum starts with a thorough knowledge of the radiographic anatomy and most common variants. Differentiation of pulmonary from mediastinal masses is easily made by knowing basic semiology (pregnancy sign). To facilitate the differential diagnosis among different pathologies it is convenient to divide the mediastinum into different areas (thoracic outlet, anterior middle and posterior, including supra and intravascular compartments). The radiographic appearance and location of masses on cross-sectional imaging will contribute to narrowing the differential diagnosis. Rectal cancers have traditionally been thought to fare worse than colon cancers due to higher local recurrence rates and poorer overall survival rates. However, with better surgical techniques (total mesorectal excision), superior preoperative imaging (high resolution magnetic resonance imaging) and neoadjuvant treatments (radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy), rectal cancer local recurrence rates are reducing and overall 5 year survival rates of 75% are being achieved. Accurate local staging of rectal cancer requires good quality high resolution imaging of the rectum and mesorectum. A thorough understanding of the surgical anatomy and the pathology of rectal cancer is required in addition to a multidisciplinary team (involving surgeons, radiologists, pathologists and oncologists) discussion of the imaging findings. The routine use of high resolution T2 weighted can identify a number of poor prognostic features preoperatively, namely increasing depth of extramural spread, potential surgical resection margin involvement, N2 nodal disease, extramural venous invasion and peritoneal infiltration. Team discussion of these findings enables a preoperative treatment strategy to be tailored to these prognostic features and the patients clinical condition. Therefore, in approximately 30-40% of patients, MR imaging features will result in preoperative administration of chemoradiotherapy to prevent incomplete resection. Tumor regression and subsequent resection with clear margins can then be achieved in the vast majority of patients thus treated but an appreciation of the post treatment related changes and relation of these to the initial baseline imaging is important. The careful use of MR imaging in preoperative decision making and treatment planning substantially reduces the number of non-curative rectal cancer resections. Both PET-FDG and whole body MR imaging allow a study of the whole marrow within a one step examination. PET studies the metabolism, and the superimposition with CT images localises well the abnormalities. It is expensive, uses a sophisticated contrast medium, and a specific environment, and is not very specific. False negative results (such as in prostate metastases) are discovered and analysed, so that precise indications will be clarified. Whole body MR imaging is cheaper, faster (less than 30m examination with 2 sequences), performed without injection, easy to read, but non specific either. It studies bone marrow signal. It is more efficient on fat marrow, and if 2 types of sequences are used (such as STIR and T1W-SE). Image quality may not be satisfactory (skull, moving locations, artefacts induced by the vessels). PET is certainly more reliable to evaluate treatment effectiveness. Learning Objectives:",

Minimally invasive, image-guided, thermoablative therapies are developing in many fields of cancer therapy as adjuncts to surgical approaches. The methods used in clinics to induce thermal cell death are focused ultrasound (FUS), radiofrequency (RF), laser and cryotherapy. Imaging techniques guiding these treatments (by ultrasound, CT or MR imaging) allow for accurate and safe positioning of the device to the target, and precise definition of the tumor volume. However, the actual limitations of these techniques are the limited volume of tumor accessible for efficient treatment and the absence of monitoring of the delivered thermal dose during the procedure. The main improvements provided by MR imaging are its ability to get a 3D control of the organ and its surroundings for safety, measurement of temperature in real time and in 3D, and monitoring of level and location of the delivered thermal dose, making the control of heat distribution and diffusion possible. Its compatibility with laser and US energy delivery systems is convenient whereas it requires specific filtering for RF systems. It will make FUS monitoring more accurate because it is the only technique allowing the visualisation of the thermal focal point. ",

Noninvasive, three-dimensional mapping of temperature changes is feasible with MR, and may be based on the relaxation time T 1 , the diffusion coefficient (D), or proton resonance frequency (PRF) of tissue water. The use of temperature-sensitive contrast agents and proton spectroscopic imaging can provide absolute temperature measurements. The excellent linearity and near-independence with respect to tissue type, together with good temperature sensitivity, make PRF based temperature MR imaging the preferred choice for many applications at mid to high field strength (1 T or above). The PRF methods employ RF-spoiled gradient echo imaging methods. A precision of 1 o C, for a temporal resolution of 1 s and a spatial resolution of 2 mm, is feasible for a single slice for immobile tissues. Corrections should be made for temperature-induced susceptibility effects in the PRF method, and motion artefacts. Fat suppression is necessary for most tissues when T 1 , D or PRF methods are employed. Excellent registration is important to correct for displacements between scans. When combined with minimally invasive heating methods, continuous MR temperature mapping can provide feedback coupling in order to ensure a desired temperature trajectory. MR guided focused ultrasound is a particularly promising method for medical therapies. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the basic principles of MR temperature imaging. 2.

Computed tomography (CT) may be used as an alternative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has some important potential advantages over US and CT that warrant its use for monitoring RF ablation. Firstly, a variety of hepatic contrast materials enable detection of some tumour nodules that are invisible with US and CT. Secondly, MR imaging at high field strength allows in vivo temperature mapping with phase shift algorithms. Colour-coded mapping of isothermes and energy deposition over time obtained with this method could render monitoring of RF ablation more accurate and reproducible, and facilitate visualisation of local heat loss due to convection by larger vessels. Over the past few years, we have successfully used an open-field 0.23 T MR unit for guidance of RF ablation in selected patients. So far, however, many RF generators and electrodes still produce major artifacts in the high-field MR environment, thus hampering real-time temperature mapping. An additional, practical drawback is the difficult procedure of targeting liver nodules under MR guidance, which may take up to several hours in the MR suite. For these reasons, the clinical role for MR guidance and monitoring of RF ablation has so far been almost negligible. It appears likely, however, that progress in the areas of MR compatibility, new real-time targeting methods, thermometry software, and respiratory gating may render MR guidance and monitoring of RF ablation of liver tumours more practical and enhance its role in the near future.

Tempany-Afdhal; Boston, MA/US (ctempany@bwh.harvard.edu) Purpose: To describe the principles of MR guided FUS, the role of MR imaging in leiomyomas and summarize the results of the clinical trials in MR guided FUS for uterine leiomyomas, with over 700 procedures performed to date worldwide. Methods and Materials: Today, there are a variety of less invasive alternatives to hysterectomy available, such as myomectomy, hormonal therapy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), and more recently MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS). MRgFUS is a thermal ablation method that uses sound waves created in tissue as a source of thermal injury. Ultrasound waves are focused through intact skin of the anterior abdominal wall resulting in localized thermal tissue ablation and non-perfusion, or necrosis, of a sub-volume of the targeted tissue. Results: Using interactive target segmentation on MR imaging, an outlined volume can be non-invasively treated, monitored by on-line MR temperature control. Utilizing an effective combination of image guidance and energy delivery, MRg-FUS therefore allows for preservation of uterine function while obviating the need for a minimally invasive procedure or surgery. Conclusion: MR imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery can non-invasively cause thermo-coagulation resulting in necrosis of uterine leiomyomas. MR imaging provided excellent guidance for treatment planning, direct monitoring of treatment delivery and thermal changes in the sonicated tissue. The FUS therapy used in this trial of women with symptomatic uterine leiomyomas appears to be feasible and is safe. MR imaging-guided FUS can be recommended for further testing as an alternative to currently available therapies for symptomatic leiomyomas. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been used for prostate cancer treatment since the early 1990s. The HIFU beam is delivered by an endorectal transducer under sonographic guidance. This treatment has currently two main indications: 1. Localized prostate cancer in non-surgical patients: 5-year results challenging those of external-beam radiotherapy (ERB) have been obtained by several groups; 2. Salvage therapy of local recurrence after prostate ERB: promising preliminary results have been obtained in these patients for whom a palliative hormone therapy is usually the only valid alternative. In part these good results are due to recent improvement in prostate cancer imaging. Further improvements due to imaging are expected in 4 directions: 1. Patient selection: PET scanning has shown promising results in depicting sub-clinical metastases; 2. Intraprostatic tumor mapping: contrast-enhanced dynamic MR imaging accurately depicts the cancer distribution within the gland, (especially in patients with history of ERB), which may allow for better targeting of treatment; 3. Evaluation of HIFU-induced tissue destruction: currently, no imaging method can accurately assess the uniformity of thermal tissue ablation. The role of Elastography and Color Doppler in depicting areas of incomplete tissue destruction and/or cancer recurrence is under evaluation. 4. Evaluation of the prostate perfusion rate: currently, temperature is not monitored during the procedure and the same treatment parameters are applied to all patients. Current research is aimed at finding an accurate way of obtaining perfusion maps of the prostate in order to adapt the treatment parameters to the actual local perfusion rate observed in each patient. The introduction of contrast agents and the development of contrast-specific techniques opened new prospects in US. With the advent of second-generation agents and low mechanical index real-time scanning techniques, contrast US established itself as an easy-to-perform and reproducible examination, and appeared to be ready for routine clinical application. US contrast agents may improve information about macrovasculature, enhancing B-mode imaging, all Doppler modalities and by means of contrast-specific imaging. While results from preclinical experiments and initial clinical studies have been promising, most of the clinical indications of contrast-enhanced US remain to be validated. Concerning microvascular assessment, contrast US has a role especially in liver imaging for focal liver lesion detection and characterization. It has been shown that contrast US substantially increases the ability to detect liver metastases and to characterize focal lesions not diagnosed at baseline study. In the setting of liver cirrhosis, detection of arterial hypervascular supply by using contrast-enhanced US within a nodule emerged during surveillance may allow a confident diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Owing to its ability to display tumor vascularity, contrast US has also been shown to be a tool for guidance, monitoring and assessment the outcome of percutaneous treatments. Microbubbles have shown promise also in gene therapy. There is evidence that the low power used in diagnostic imaging systems may be sufficient to produce therapeutic effects, without significant toxicity. Microbubbles can be targeted to tissues and a transgene can be either mixed with or complexed to microbubbles, thus increasing the probability of genes entering the cells. Learning Objective: 1. To describe the specific characteristics of US contrast agents, in terms of physical properties and biodistribution.",

Correas; Paris/FR (jean-michel.correas@nck.ap-hop-paris.fr) Ultrasound contrast agents are strict blood pool agents as microbubbles administered intravenously remain in the vascular compartment due to their size. They enhance the Doppler signals in case of technical failure for the assessment of deep vessels or when the flow is reduced (tight stenosis). However, the huge increase in signal intensity results in multiple artefacts that can limit the value of this technique. New ultrasound sequences have been developed to take advantage of the resonant properties of the microbubbles in order to increase the resolution of the contrast examination and limit artefacts. Ultrasound contrast agents can be used to improve the assessment of macrovascular diseases, such as renal artery stenosis and occlusion, aortic aneurisms and grafts, carotid and peripheral arteries, portal vascular tree, as well as transcranial Doppler imaging. Commercial ultrasonic contrast agents are small encapsulated gaseous microbubbles which are designed to resonate at diagnostic ultrasonic frequencies (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and to give ultrasonic enhancement up to 10 10 times greater than a solid microbubble of the same size. Recently there has been an increasing interest in manipulating these microbubbles to target specific sites within the body. The most commonly used method of targeting is the attachment of a biotinylated antibody or ligand to the surface of a microbubble. Targeted microbubbles can also be used to deliver genes or drugs to specific locations within the body. Drugs can be encapsulated within the microbubbles or embedded into the microbubble membrane. Likewise DNA can attached to the surface or encapsulated within the microbubble structure. Transfection techniques (Transfection refers to a range of techniques used for introducing specific double stranded DNAs into dividing cells in such a way that they can be taken up by the nucleus and expressed), can be divided into viral and non-viral approaches. Non-viral methods include liposome mediated transfection, electroporation, bombardment, microinjection and sonoporation. Of most interest is sonoporation which causes transient permeability of cell membrane by the application of ultrasound without causing damage to the cells. The transfection efficiency of this method has been shown to be high compared to both viral and other non-viral methods. Learning Objectives:",

Today, oncologic imaging examinations comprise a major portion of both oncologic and general radiologic practices. Proper interpretation of oncologic images requires complex knowledge specific to the type of cancer. Understanding of key imaging findings in tumor response assessment is essential. The optimal choice of imaging examination to answer cancer type-and cancer site-specific questions should be standarized. Even more importantly, training for oncologic inter-pretation should be accelerated, as present practice is lagging behind computer and technological advances. One of the major benefits of imaging is that the findings may be quantified and evaluated for changes over time. As imaging, due to its much-improved spatial resolution and capacity to offer information beyond anatomy, has become a surrogate marker for treatment response, a number of critical questions have arisen. For example, which system (WHO or RECIST) of tumor measurement and response classification should be used? Which is the best approach to measurement -uni-dimensional, bi-dimensional, or volumetric? Moving beyond anatomy, assessment of tumor biology and biological prediction of tumor response through techniques such as perfusion, angiogenesis and metabolic characterization are providing glimpses into the future of imaging assessment of tumor response and the development of new cancer-generic (e.g. apoptosis, hypoxia) and cancerspecific agents. The complexity of imaging is increasing not only with the number of available imaging and post-processing techniques, but with the diversity of relevant therapeutic options. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that a single imaging modality can be misleading if used alone, but more robust when combined with other imaging approaches. ",

Early rules governing the methodology for using imaging were established to provide consistency in reporting results of cancer therapy. Today, there are many more options available, both for treatment of cancer and for assessing response with measurements and with other imaging methods. New classes of antitumor therapy have been developed that have a biological antiproliferative effect that may induce a delay in tumor growth or less tumor shrinkage than previously seen with cytotoxic chemotherapies. Methodologies and rules governing response assessment include the use of unidimensional measurements or bidimensional measurements, and some have proposed utilizing volumetric measures.

There is a need for imaging techniques which early and sensitively detect response or recurrence, and account for tumor heterogeneity. Two possible criteria will be discussed: perfusion and metabolism. Perfusion: In larger tumors, neo-angiogenesis leads to the formation of pathological vessels, generally more than normal, with increased permeability. This can be assessed by contrast-enhanced CT or MR imaging. With dynamic imaging (3D + t) signal-intensity over time curves are generated, whose shape can be interpreted visually, or which can be analyzed by using pharmacokinetic models and calculating the amplitude and the exchange constant. These parameters are related to the microvascular density, the perfusion, and the permeability (leakiness) of the wall. Such studies may serve to differentiate benign from malignant lesions, but also to quantify treatment effects on vascularity that may precede the macroscopic response. Metabolism: Tumor cell metabolism is considerably different from metabolism in normal tissue. A variety of metabolites can be measured in vivo by MR spectroscopy. Different effects can be observed in tumors: (i) loss of tissue-specific molecules, such as citrate in the prostate, (ii) an increase of choline together with a decrease of creatine indicating a loss of membrane integrity, or (iii) an increase of lipids, indicating necrosis.

Glucose uptake and metabolism has turned out to be a very early indicator for therapy monitoring as it measures a molecular rather than an anatomic parameter in a way, which is relatively easy to assess in a whole body imaging mode. Therapy response monitoring is more relevant in some tumors than in others. Major experience exists in assessing response to therapy in lymphoma and GIST tumors, where treatment primarily relies on chemotherapy. It is accepted that in many lymphomas FDG PET is uniquely suited for therapy response assessment after six therapy cycles and the results indicate that PET is useful as early as after one chemotherapy cycle. Therapy assessment in ENT tumors after RT is also used. RT tends to generate a substantial inflammatory response, thus specificity is high, but the presence of FDG uptake does not necessarily imply tumor recurrence. It is expected that with the advent of the new generation of tumor treatment drugs, PET with FDG and other radiopharmaceuticals will assume an even more prominent role to discriminate between responders and non-responders.

The peritoneum, the largest serous membrane in the body, is reflected over abdominal organs to form a series of folds known as ligaments, mesenteries and omenta. These peritoneal reflections are composed of two serosal layers containing fatty areolar tissue, blood vessels and lymphatics and they attach, interconnect, suspend and supply the abdominal viscera. They may act as conduits or barriers in the spread of intra-or extra-peritoneal diseases and they influence the peritoneal fluid circulation along with bowel peristalsis, gravity and hydrostatic pressure gradients. Although not directly visible on imaging, the twelve major peritoneal ligaments and mesenteries can be identified by their typical position, organ relationships, fatty composition and anatomic landmarks provided by their constituent vessels. Peritoneal folds involved by edema, inflammation or neoplastic infiltration alter their composition, become thickened and they are directly recognized on imaging. Multiplanar CT reconstructions and specific MR imaging sequences, including 3d FLASH and True-FISP sequences, are useful in demonstrating normal and abnormal ligaments and mesenteries. Peritoneal reflections subdivide the peritoneal cavity into multiple compartments and recesses that are visualized when distended by fluid. These subdivisions provide the anatomic basis for localization of acsites, abscesses, seeded metastases and traumatic effusions. Familiarity with the normal anatomy and, consequently, with the anatomic barriers or pathways for diseases spread in the abdominal cavity is essential for proper cross-sectional imaging interpretation. Detection of peritoneal carcinomatosis is a major challenge in onco-imaging because of emerging and promising treatments for this condition. Reported sensitivity of imaging is low, inferior to 50 %. Even though, it may be overestimated due to the lack of gold standard, like surgery in many series. Detection relies on peritoneal fluid and peritoneal nodules, especially the localization to the liver surface and to the greater omentum known as the \"omental cake\". These signs lack sensitivity and/or specificity. Nevertheless, modern imaging provides the tools to improve dramatically the detection rate, using a combination of technical improvements, anatomical knowledge and multimodality comparison: Technical tips are thin slices, multiplanar reconstruction, appropriate use of contrast media. Anatomical knowledge consists in the identification of peritoneal spaces and structures, as well as the most common but overlooked seeding sites. Radiologists should be trained to detect small peritoneal nodules confidently, because it is mandatory in the era of laparoscopic surgery. It also helps in tumor follow-up. Multiplanar imaging is especially useful. Multimodality approach combines the advantages of US (high resolution images of superficial structures), MR imaging and MDCT (unique anatomical display), PET-CT (detection of small active enhancing nodules) to improve both detection and characterization of detected lesions, avoiding the drawbacks of each single method.",

Major features of primary peritoneal tumors, which are rare conditions, will also be presented. Primary infective and inflammatory disease of the peritoneal cavity is uncommon but can occur in Tuberculosis and in Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis associated with chronic liver disease. More often it is secondary to infective or inflammatory disease within the abdominal cavity and is associated with pathologies such as perforation, appendicitis, diverticulitis, cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis. Sclerosing peritonitis can occur as a long-term complication of chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Inflammatory change in the mesentery can occur in any gut-associated pathology, particularly Crohn's disease and in less common diseases affecting the mesentery including mesenteric panniculitis, epiploic appendigitis and HIV/AIDS. Whilst routine abdominal ultrasound and MR imaging can contribute significantly Intracranial aneurysms are being treated by both surgical and endovascular methods. Most endovascular techniques include packing of the aneurysm sack with platinum microcoils. While surgical clipping is more effective in preventing recanalization, the endovascular approach is significantly less invasive. For ruptured lesions, endovascular treatment is recommended whenever technically feasible, as recent studies (ISAT) demonstrated better clinical outcomes following endovascular than surgical aneurysm repair. Some morphological features, such as large size or poor neck to size ratio are associated with a high incidence of recurrence.",

Intracranial vascular malformations are classified as capillary, venous and arteriovenous (AVM) lesions. The proper diagnosis is made by noninvasive MR imaging techniques. For AVMs, catheter angiography is necessary to choose the most appropriate therapeutic modality. These include surgical removal, transarterial embolization, radiosurgery and combinations of the above. The optimal technique is chosen based on the size, location and flow pattern of the malformation. Embolization is performed using adhesive and nonadhesive liquid embolics and employed either as a sole treatment, a preoperative measure to reduce intraoperative blood loss or to reduce the size of the AVM in preparation to radiosurgery. In general, 20-40% of all AVMs can be cured by embolization alone and 60-70% by combined techniques. Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of disability in adults in Europe. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had been used within 3 hours of symptom onset and studies are going on to test the benefits of rt-PA for acute stroke within 6 hours of onset. Strict exclusion criteria are designed mainly to prevent the risk of a cerebral hemorrhage. Endovascular transarterial treatment is evolving as possible new modality. A combination of intravenous and/or endovascular thrombolytic treatments are going to be discussed such as vascular retrieval snare, laser thrombectomy, ballon angioplasty, ultra-sound-enhanced chemical thrombolysis and intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy, together with a presentation of current literature and our clinical practice. The current indications for treating symptomatic significant carotid artery stenosis will be given. There is now evidence that treating symptomatic stenosis greater than 70% within the first two weeks has most benefit. The most recent evidence concerning carotid angioplasty and stenting will be given, including presentation of a meta analysis of completed randomised trials between stenting and carotid endarterectomy, the overall conclusion for the meta analysis from existing randomised data being that there is no evidence for difference in major risks or benefits. Minor risks and costs favour endovascular treatment but with the wide confidence intervals further randomised trials are needed. There will then be a brief presentation of the International Carotid Stenting Study and other currently ongoing randomised trials. The lecture will conclude with a discussion of current technique in carotid angioplasty and stenting as well as a discussion as to whether cerebral protection should be used or not. PACS makes the digital enterprise happen. The transition from an analogue to a digital radiology department opens new possibilities in the quality assurance of the radiological process. Whereas in the analogue department, quality assurance is mostly limited to manual programs that are not linked together, in a digital environment automated quality programs can run continuously and can be linked into one quality report. It is obvious that such a digital radiology department concept needs a careful workflow with state of the art PACS equipment, secure transmission protocols and a legal framework. All those aspects are part of the departmental quality assurance program. RIS and PACS quality assurance criteria, with a QC program, need to be included. As a result of those quality assurance programs, the department can be audited in a more effective way. Besides the quality assurance audit on the PACS, a clinical governance policy needs to be installed in the radiological department. This allows auditing of the departmental workflow, equipment, statistics, timeliness of the service and the quality of the reports. Such an audit needs to include complaints, significant incidents and other feedback. Efficient implementation of PACS requires extensive local configuration of communications with diagnostic modalities, RIS, HIS and other information systems. PACS vendors cannot be expected to perform this task optimally at each site without active contributions from local radiologists and radiographers. DICOM provides standardisation far beyond the basic digital image formats and image transfer. It also defines formats for communication of image acquisition parameters, standardisation of image displays, and functionality for radiological workflow. In real world PACS installations, there may be shortcomings in the display of modality-dependent acquisition parameters, and there may be inconsistencies in the display of images throughout the site. Through some knowledge of DICOM, radiologists and radiographers can identify such shortcomings and provide requirements for improvement with reference to the standard, and thus make sure that the DICOM compliance that was negotiated in the contract is realised appropriately. The technical framework of IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) contains integration profiles that specify how the DICOM and HL-7 standards shall be implemented in workflow. The profiles are intentionally very detailed, to minimise ambiguity in local implementation. However, the standardised information objects that represent actions or activities still need to be matched to the information structure in the local information systems. These information objects typically contain codes and descriptors as important data elements. Several of the coding schemes for these elements must be defined by radiologists and radiographers. Standardisation of such codes within and among institutions is crucial for efficient exchange of radiological information. Radiology is by now irreversibly linked to the use of computers, and consequently to the software available. While the range of products available is vast, costs are also high; unfortunately industrial products do not always meet our requirements completely and we need something more. The concept of \"Open Source\" -of software made available to a community of users by its developer so that it can be adapted to their specific requirements -is also enjoying success in the field of radiology. According to this philosophy, the examples of digital radiological workflow components are multiplied based on open source software: an entire diagnostic imaging department can be built based on such solutions. We will look at how radiologists can take advantage of this opportunity and benefit from a significant reduction in costs, as well as possibilities for personalization that would not be possible using the classical solutions. A key to successful outcome after uterine fibroid embolization is the appropriate selection of patients and careful post-embolization follow-up with the gynecologist and radiologist involved. Because the symptoms associated with uterine fibroids are not specific, deciding who is an appropriate candidate involves precise clinical and imaging evaluation prior to embolization. Since imaging plays a vital role in the preprocedural planning, magnetic resonance imaging should be obtained to assess uterine fibroids and associated conditions that may imitate or exacerbate the symptom complex. Radiologists should play a central role in patient evaluation but also during post-embolization recovery and follow-up. The understanding of complications and failures associated with embolization ena-bles radiologists to effectively counsel and manage patients after the procedure.",

            "text": "Radiologists performing uterine fibroid embolization should also be familiar with the different techniques available. Recent technical improvements may influence the outcome from therapy and reduce complication rates. The method of uterine fibroid embolization has been extensively described in the literature. In essence it involves the placement of a catheter into the uterine arteries and injection of embolization particles into the uterine arteries to obtain fibroid infarction. Non spherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles were the first embolization agents used for uterine fibroid embolization. Spherical embolization particles, such as trisacryl microspheres and PVA spheres have been developed to address some of the disadvantages of non-spherical particles such as the unpredictable level of arterial occlusion and clumping. The appropriate technique of embolization (i.e. angiographic end-point) with each of the available products is still an ongoing debate. Background: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. It is defined as blood loss greater than 500 ml following vaginal delivery or more than 1,000 ml following cesarean section. Risk factors for PPH may be recognized before delivery. Such patients warrant delivery in maternity units, with protocols and resources available to deal promptly with massive obstetric haemorrhage. Management requires restoration of the circulatory blood volume, management of any coagulopathy, and remedying the cause of bleeding. Embolization of the uterine arteries or anterior division of the internal iliac arteries is an essential part of the management protocol. Procedure Details: Prophylactic placement of catheters into the internal iliac arteries in readiness for embolization avoids delay in patients known to be at risk. Embolization of the uterine arteries or the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries may be performed using gelatin sponge or particulate emboli. Conclusion: To be part of an effective emergency protocol, radiological expertise should be available 24 hours a day. Once PPH occurs, rapid transfer of the patient to the main radiology department is desirable but may not be feasible, so radiologists should be prepared to travel to the patient. This requires good communication between the radiologists, obstetricians and anaesthetists so that all team members are aware of the management options. A rapidly changing healthcare environment all over Europe is constantly facing a lack of financial resources because of a quickly increasing number of innovations in therapy and diagnostic methods with dramatically increasing costs. IT-solutions offer the opportunity to create new economical pathways of patient care. But it is a struggle for the European radiology community to meet the challenge of changing the old structures in diagnostic patient care and to provide modern diagnostic pathways for the healthcare system of tomorrow. Instead of taking the chances, e.g. with the help of telemedicine, this improvement is often combated by healthcare providers and radiologists. The building of medical expert networks via telemedicine will not solve all problems in healthcare, but it leads to a higher availability of expert knowledge in hospitals and to an increased diagnostic quality in patient care with reduced costs. Teleradiology is the pacesetter for the continuous process of cross-linking in healthcare and has to be regarded as keycard for the integrated care of tomorrow. The European radiology community must take this chance if they want to play a leading role in designing an e-health platform in order to meet local and global competition. The achievement of these innovative efforts will be electronic patient databases accessible with secure health professional and patient card systems, and optimized administrative as well as diagnostic and therapeutic pathways. Established in 1999, the Imaging Service Network is successfully working on these topics by operating and constantly further developing a radiology driven ehealth platform. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn more about the advantages and opportunities of using teleradiology among hospitals in Germany. 2. To detect economical and technical benefits of using a radiology driven competence network for exchanging teleradiology data. 3. To discuss the influence of teleradiology on the development of health infrastructures.",

Our environment enables \"friendly\" integration with local radiology departments by sharing information systems. Workload needs to take into account the relative time and effort required to review and interpret different types of imaging studies, not only volume. CT and MR imaging disproportionately tax radiologist capacity and are in high demand in teleradiology services. Study complexity is also related to the different types of clinical scenarios. Other challenges are how to integrate radiologists from different organizations and define the role of sub-specialists in productivity and added-value. The teleradiologist workstation and access to patients' clinical information and previous studies are important for performance and productivity. Failure to review previous examinations is a significant cause of errors in both perception and cognition. Audit procedures to check the quality of service, the accuracy of the reports and the overall therapeutic and clinical impact are necessary. This must include clinician feed-back.

Instead, most men in the USA and worldwide have a bone scan & CT scan and then are asked to decide on a \"definitive\" form of therapy. The latter approach has been shown in multiple papers to grossly understage PC due to the lack of sensitivity of both bone and CT scanning. In this presentation, a logical and strategic approach to the evaluation of men with PC is presented. Such an approachbased on over tens of thousands of human outcomes in the evaluation of PC provides to patients and physicians alike, an evolved manner to evaluate the patient's biologic findings & make further recommendations to optimize a successful outcome. The above strategic approach to the staging evaluation process is further enhanced by an objectified reporting format. This allows the clinician to readily assess the patient's status as regards tumor burden & response to therapy.

Unfortunately, this technique has shown to miss up to 35% of clinically relevant cancers. Subsequently the number of cores has been increased to improve cancer detection, however several studies have shown no significant improvement in cancer detection. To increase cancer detection new imaging techniques have been studied, which can assess tumour vascularity, since it is well known that cancerous tissue generally grows more rapidly than normal tissue and demonstrates an increased blood flow, as compared to normal tissue and benign lesions. Such new US techniques include colour and power Doppler US and the application of US contrast agents with contrast specific US techniques, such as grey-scale harmonic imaging, which has dramatically changed the role of US for prostate cancer detection. Several studies have shown that contrast enhanced US allows for targeted biopsies and can significantly improve cancer detection when compared with systematic biopsy. Furthermore elastography or \"strain imaging\" seems to have a great potential in prostate cancer detection. Virtual navigation tools allow for an image fusion between MRI images and US, which allows for targeted biopsies with real-time US into suspicious areas detected on MR imaging. These current trends show that these new imaging techniques allow for prostate cancer visualisation and thus for targeted biopsies and can therefore replace the current \"gold standard\" for prostate cancer detection-the systematic biopsy. The prevalence of metabolic disorders is higher then previously believed. Metabolic disorders account for a significant percentage of the pathology seen in the CNS, especially in the pediatric population.

This lecture will focus on some of the more common metabolic disorders, their imaging, and clinical characteristics. Also different imaging methods, especially MR imaging and also new MR imaging techniques that will help in the diagnosis, will be discussed. Paediatric hemolymphoproliferative diseases (HLD) are a constellation of disorders that prominently include leukaemia, lymphoma, and histiocytoses. These conditions are invariably severe, and are burdened by elevated morbidity and mortality in the absence of proper treatment. HLD are systemic disorders, i.e., they typically affect multiple organs and systems in the human body. As a whole, they account for about 40% of all malignancies in children. Intensive treatment regimens have resulted in a significant increase in the number of survivors, but have also disclosed new phases of the natural history of these disorders, among which is involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). CNS disease is not consistent, but when present, it is commonly associated with worsened prognosis. Moreover, current treatment modalities, including systemic therapy (i.e. combination chemotherapy) and specific CNS prophylaxis (i.e. intrathecal chemotherapy with or without cranial irradiation), are potentially neurotoxic. Schematically, a rational approach to neuroimaging of CNS manifestations of HLD basically involves three perspectives: (i) Direct involvement of the CNS from primary disease, (ii) other CNS disease related to underlying and secondary effects of disease, and (iii) treatment-related complications. Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important, often crucial role in the diagnosis of several of these disorders. Close interdisciplinary collaboration between hemato-oncologists and neuroradiologists is of paramount importance to provide affected children with an early diagnosis and proper treatment. Learning Objectives: 1. To identify the MR imaging characteristics of direct central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the principal hemolymphoproliferative disorders in the pediatric age group. 2. To become familiar with CNS disorders indirectly related to hemolymphoproliferative diseases, including infection, cerebrovascular, and hematological abnormalities. 3.

We will also introduce state-of-the-art non-rigid registration algorithms that can compensate for tissue deformation or align images from different subjects. Applications of image registration include combining images of the same subject from different modalities, aligning temporal sequences of images to compensate for motion of the subject between scans, providing guidance during surgical procedures, correcting for soft tissue deformation, and aligning images from multiple subjects in cohort studies. Over the last decade image registration has emerged as an extremely successful and powerful tool in medical imaging in a wide range of applications. Early examples include the combination of structural information from MR with the functional information available at lower spatial resolution from PET or SPECT. As the technology became more advanced very accurate alignment of intra-modality data became feasible. This allowed subtle temporal changes in structure or function to be analysed. Examples included functional MR and highly accurate detection of cerebral atrophy. Image registration to the physical space of the patient in the operating room was the key enabling technology in image-guided surgery. All these applications were built on rigid body registration technologies. Non-rigid registration, in which one image is warped or morphed into the space of another, has more recently found wide ranging applications, from the measurement (as opposed to detection) of change, to the propagation of segmentation in the automated interpretation of images. Accurate measurement of tissue growth and destruction in the monitoring of therapy and the progression of disease is achieved by analysis of the deformation fields produced by the non-rigid registration. Atlases can be built from large numbers of example images that have been aligned and the statistics of the resulting deformation models can be used to build statistical shape models. These models can then be used to propagate organ outlines to improve measurements of size and shape. Recent work includes the use of the deformation field to analyse motion and deformation when imaging moving structures and in the prediction of motion in image directed therapies. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn how to carry out very precise measurements of change, growth, atrophy. 2. To understand how to apply image registration in motion analysis.",

Todd-Pokropek; London/UK (A.Todd@ucl.ac.uk) Image registration techniques require validation, which in general implies the availability of a gold standard. For rigid registration this then permits the definition of a target registration error and a number of successful evaluations of rigid registration techniques have been completed. Non-rigid registration includes a model of interpolation and cannot be evaluated in such a simple manner. We are interested in the accuracy of registration at all points in image space, but \"weighed\" by the clinical objective to be achieved. Non-rigid registration must also include a model of the process of deformation (for example a model of tissue characteristics) and can be divided into spatial deformation and material transport. It is then possible to define the registration in terms of the deformation vector field and transport field, where some methods exist for their assessment. In general, a suitable strategy for validation of such methods starts by using real clinical data and deforming it, for example using a finite element (tissue based) method. The accuracy of restoring the data back to its undeformed state provides a baseline for evaluation, although the use of circular methods (where the forward and reverse operations match) must be avoided. An alternative and novel approach not requiring ground truth to compare different non-rigid methods is based on a statistical analysis of tolerance and overlap of registrations. However clinical trials are eventually required to confirm this validation on real clinical data for real clinical applications. Learning Objectives:",

Ligaments are mainly affected by acute traumatic lesions while tendons can be concerned by metabolic, degenerative, inflammatory or infective disorders. The aims of the different imaging techniques are: to confirm the presence of pathological changes and assess their severity; to truthfully evaluate the other local structures in order to plan an eventual surgical treatment when this is required; in selected cases, such as infective tenosynovitis, to guide a diagnostic needle aspiration. Both ligaments and tendons disorders are mostly investigated by ultrasound (US) and MR imaging although occasionally standard radiographs and CT can be useful. The choice between US and MR imaging depends on a variety of factors. Local anatomy: because of their anatomic position US can't assess several structures that are very well depicted by MR imaging (cruciate ligaments of the knee, glenohumeral ligaments of the shoulder). Deep structures are in general poorly assessed by US while superficial structures are well evaluated. Dynamic evaluation: only US allows visualisation of ligaments and tendons during joint movements or muscles activations. This allows accurate assessment of intermittent tendon instability. Patients comfort: US can be performed in a few minutes and is well accepted by patients. Many patients are uncomfortable with MR imaging. Contraindications: US can be obtained in every patients while MR imaging has well known relative and absolute contraindications. The quality of the equipments available as well as the experience of radiologists are additional important factors affecting the decision to use US or MR imaging. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn the US and MR appearance of acute tears, chronic stress lesions and degenerative changes in tendon and ligament disorders. 2. To discuss the imaging findings with respect to underlying pathology. 3. To understand the role of US and MR for the diagnosis of tendon and ligament disorders. For decades, Russian radiology developed in isolation. Now radiologists have realized that there is one universal road for development of the health service. Russian radiologists have started to participate actively in the work of the international scientific societies, symposiums and congresses, including ECR. They have the ability to compare the European and domestic approaches to protection and improvement of health of the population. It became obvious that the national radiology service should keep a bit of the best; change and reconstruct the rest, and this process can be quite difficult. Recent decision to turn to teaching medicine based on postulates of Bologna declaration was a very progressive one, giving hope for further improvements. It is essential to change the structure of radiology in Russia. Bad examples of wrong regulations (e.g. the radiologist legitimately has no right to use ultrasound and internist after 3 months of teaching can do it) should disappear as quickly as possible. At the same time, radiologists themselves should raise professionalism and ac- Ultrasound is well known as an excellent imaging modality. However, the use 2D ultrasound as a method of choice for many diseases is limited due to difficulties in image interpretations in comparison to other imaging modalities, like CT or MR imaging. Technologic advances can play an increasing role in ultrasound imaging. New technology incorporates a complete set of 3D and 4D imaging features, including 3D-volume rendering, post processing with maximum and minimum intensity projection (MIP, MinIP), virtual imaging, surface rendering. 3D data collection can be performed by using free hand rotation scanning mode or automated scanning with ultrasound probes that include scanning mechanism. Advance technology permits high resolution optically tracked freehand or automated volume imaging methods to be applied to diagnostic ultrasound incorporating interactive manipulation of volume data. 3D scanning provides greater anatomical information about organs and allows them to be viewed in plans unobtainable from 2D scanning. Integration of views obtained over a region of a patient with 3D scanning may permit better visualization and allow a more accurate diagnosis. Moreover, volume imaging provides the physician with the capability to image the patient after he has left the scanning site and reevaluate the diagnosis with clinicians or experts across the network. Combination 3D ultrasound imaging with real-time 3D or 4D offers new potential for ultrasound and provides access to a wide range of clinical applications. Learning Objectives: 1. To become familiar with the principle and application of 3D/4D ultrasound imaging. 2. To understand the contribution of this new technology compared to 2D ultrasound imaging. 3. To comprehend the indication for the 3D/4D ultrasound imaging in routine practice.",

Sinitsyn; Moscow/RU (vsini@mail.ru) Cardiac radiology has developed over the last decade as one of the most important fields of diagnostic radiology. Progress of CT and MR imaging has substantially increased the involvement of radiologists in cardiovascular imaging. Each of these noninvasive modalities could provide in one examination, images of cardiac anatomy, function and perfusion plus coronary and peripheral vascular circulation. Multiple clinical studies have shown high diagnostic value of both CT and MR imaging in cardiac imaging. For the time being, it looks like CT has advantages for screening of cardiovascular diseases and noninvasive coronary angiography and MR imaging looks more preferable for functional cardiac studies and myocardial imaging (perfusion and viability). Several guidelines for appropriate utilization of noninvasive imaging techniques have been suggested. However, due to rapid changes in technology it is too early to define the exact clinical niche for each of these imaging techniques. Definitely, we need more evidence-based comparisons of CT and MR imaging with traditional cardiac imaging techniques. In order to keep the leading role of radiologists in diagnostic imaging they should fully understand the clinical and diagnostic implications of all modern cardiac imaging techniques. Professional radiological societies must provide focused training to radiologists in cardiac and vascular imaging. Some examples of curriculums for subspecialty training in cardiac radiology exist and they are waiting for further improvements and implementation. ",

Complex radiological diagnostics gave an opportunity to get full information about the presence and amount of air and liquid in abdominal and thoracic cavities; to define exactly the foreign body topography, including X-ray negative and not enough contrast bodies; to determine the volume and verify prolonged bleeding. Osteoporosis, osteomalacia, parathyroid disorders and Paget's disease are associated with imbalance between osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity of bones. Some radiographic features reflect the gross pathologic and histologic abnormalities of these diseases. Bone resorption can be categorized as subperiosteal, intracortical, endosteal, subchondral, trabecular, or subligamentous and subtendinous. Accumulation of osteoid tissue can create lucent sites in the cortex and coarsened pattern of the trabeculae. Increased amounts of trabecular bone can create abnormal radiodensity on skeletal radiographs. Excessive and disorganized new bone formation can lead to the appearance of architecturally abnormal osseous tissue.

This dream is now almost within our grasp, thanks to unprecedented technical developments in recent years. Some of these techniques are already implemented as part of the clinical armament used for diagnostic decision making like coronary calcium scoring, functional exams in congenital heart disease and left ventricular failure, viability studies, and even coronary CT angiography. Even more novel applications lurk just around the corner, poised to enter the clinical arena: assessment of the total coronary plaque load, characterization of coronary plaque composition, detection of vulnerable plaque, as well as combined functional and metabolic examinations. These exciting achievements have pushed back the frontiers of non-invasive diagnosis of cardiac disease and expanded the role of the radiologist beyond our traditional turf. Is this a friendly development, or should we be concerned about the possibility of fierce battles and loss of our new turf as has happened in similar situations in the past? Are we sufficiently equipped and trained to participate in these exciting developments, now and in the future? Perhaps we stand a better chance of remaining part of the game if we reconsider our goals and modify our strategy: instead of fighting other specialists we should consider building up multidisciplinary teams with shared responsibilities. The key to our future success lies in our skills in placing the patient in the center of our attention, in developing not only image interpretation but also thorough clinical knowledge, and in applying our best and most advanced imaging techniques within the global context of health management. The staging of kidney tumors includes a systematic approach to recognize and describe the local, regional, and distant extent of tumor burden. Staging results determine therapeutic approach, success of individual treatments and prognosis of individual patients. Evolving diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic experience re-defines staging categories. In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the Robson classification has widely been left for the TNM classification. Since 2002, the TNM classification includes RCC of 4 cm or less in stage T1a, since recent surgical experience suggests that partial nephrectomy (nephron-sparing surgery) can be curative, while it preserves excretory capacity. Since surgery is currently the only means of curative treatment, lymph node (N-) or distant metastatic (M-) extent of RCC is associated with unfavourable prognosis. However, evolving concepts of chemotherapy, such as tumor anti-angiogenesis, demonstrate promising effects on tumor volume. Staging of RCC involves various imaging modalities, such as abdominal sonography, chest X-ray, i.v.-urography, computed tomography (CT), bone scan, cavography, phlebography, MAG-3-clearance scintigraphy, MR imaging, cardiac or trans-esophageal sonography and, rarely, imaging-guided biopsy. The increase in speed and range of both CT and MR imaging suggests that these modalities may soon limit or obviate the need for other imaging modalities in the staging of renal tumors. Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the kidney is a differential diagnosis in patients with solid renal lesions who do not have other primary tumors. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn staging classifications for renal cell carcinoma and their respective implications for patient management. Given the biological heterogeneity of prostate cancer, the high prevalence of indolent disease, and the desire for patient-specific treatment, non-invasive evaluation of tumor prognostic variables (e.g., tumor location, volume, aggressiveness, and extent) is of great clinical interest. This lecture will focus on the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton MR spectroscopic imaging ( 1 H-MRSI) to assess these prognostic variables and improve the primary staging of prostate cancer. 1 H-MRSI provides a metabolic map of the prostate. Prostate cancer identification is based on the detection of an increased [choline + creatine] to citrate ratio and a decrease in polyamines. Because MRI/ 1 H-MRSI can detect cancer in zones of the prostate not palpable by digital rectal examination and often not sampled during biopsy, it is useful for directing repeat biopsies when PSA levels are elevated but previous biopsies are negative. MR imaging has been shown to aid in the identification of extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion, two essential factors in local staging (specific MR imaging criteria for these features will be presented in the lecture). The addition of volumetric data from 1 H-MRSI significantly improves the evaluation of extracapsular extension and decreases interobserver variability. MR spectroscopy has the potential to improve the assessment of prostate cancer aggressiveness, as the ratio of [choline+creatine] to citrate in prostate cancer correlates with Gleason grade. MR imaging can also The elbow or wrist can be scanned either with the patient prone and the arm extended above the head, or with the patient supine, with the arm beside the body. In order to facilitate interpretation of the images choosing the correct imaging planes is crucial. It is recommended to include fluid sensitive sequences such as T2 FS or STIR in the imaging protocol. Sequences and planes used are dependent both on the MR imaging, the field strength, the patient and the clinical question. Especially in the wrist, thin slices are recommended. All fractures are not detected on plain X-rays in the acute stage. In cases with a strong clinical suspicion of a possibly hazardous fracture, MR imaging can be used in the acute setting to confirm -or exclude it. An increased amount of joint fluid may, except fractures, also be explained by a bone bruise, not seen on plain X-rays. Bone bruises are often seen in association to ligament injuries. In the acute phase an increased amount of joint fluid is often seen. When fluid-sensitive sequences are used the joint fluid acts like a natural contrast agent. MR is also suitable for the diagnosis and staging of tendon and muscle injuries. Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the basic anatomy of the wrist and elbow. 2. To become familiar with common acute traumas of the wrist and elbow. 3. To discuss the imaging technique and MR imaging findings in wrist and elbow trauma.",

Characteristic US findings may be extraarticular (tendovaginitis, bursitis or soft tissue edema) or intraarticular (effusions or erosions). Quantification mainly relies on the analysis of Doppler signals on a four-grade scale: 0 -no signal, 1single vessel signals, 2 -confluent vessel signals, 3 -more than 50% of synovium covered by vessel signals. In conclusion, valuable information may be added to the results of clinical investigation and conventional radiography. The use of US may reduce the time interval from the first onset of symptoms until the initiation of proper treatment. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the different techniques of sonographic imaging including power Doppler US and contrast media application. 2. To discuss the current quantification systems. 3.

            "text": "The development of imaging based outcome measures is of increasing interest in the field of inflammatory arthritis. Clinical trials of highly effective, though expensive, biological anti-inflammatory therapies have resulted in keen interest in the quantification of the inflammatory and damage components of these arthropathies. Following a standardised development is advised when assessing a new scoring system. This is based on recommendations from OMERACT, an expert body closely involved with assessment of arthritis outcome measures for clinical trials. This process involves the determination of truth, discrimination and feasibility. Truth is based around validation with criterion validity, construct validity and face validity. Discrimination includes reliability with intra & inter observer variation, interscan variation and sensitivity to change important factors. Feasibility relates to the potential for the imaging modality to be used in a clinical setting. This lecture will describe this process in the context of ongoing research in rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondylo-arthropathy, defining the terms used in the OMERACT process. Imaging tests can play a pivotal role in screening. In the past decades, only mammography has been considered to be a valuable radiological screening test in the European community. Few subjects in the current areas of radiology have matched the intensity of controversy generated by the use of CT and MR scanning for screening asymptomatic presumably healthy people. The purpose of medical screening programs is to lower morbidity or mortality in the population at reasonable costs. Only those diseases are screened to advantage for which proper treatment is available if applied at a sufficiently early stage of disease. Furthermore, the target disease must be sufficiently prevalent. The latter can be enhanced if the screened population can be selected based on known disease risk factors. This session will emphasize how appropriately designed controlled clinical trials can provide information on benefits, harms, and costs of screening programs. Then three main topics will be put in perspectives. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn why true benefits, harms, and costs of screening for cancer can only be determined from appropriately designed controlled clinical trials. 2. To discuss on assessment of screening programmes for lung cancer using a low dose MDCT. 3. To put in perspective screening CT colonography for colonic polyps and cancer, and screening whole body MR imaging for cardiovascular and oncologic diseases.",

            "text": "Screening for disease is frequently advocated. Diagnosing a disease at an early stage has enormous intuitive appeal. The decision to screen, however, depends on a number of prerequisites: 1) the disease should be common and have substantial morbidity and/or mortality; 2) the screening test considered should be acceptable, feasible, and accurate for the detection of subclinical disease; 3) curative potential must exist primarily at early disease stages; 4) early detection must result in improved patient outcomes; 5) there must be sufficient resources for screening, diagnosis, and therapy; and 6) when screening a (selected) population there must be a favorable trade-off between risks, benefits, and costs. The mean gain in life expectancy and increase in quality of life with screening is generally small. The majority of the screened population will experience no benefit, whereas only a very small proportion will experience a large benefit. Reported gains in survival may be due to lead-time bias, overdiagnosis/pseudodisease, length bias, and pseudo-stage shift. At the same time, the potential harm of screening through false positive results affects a large proportion of the screened population and can lead to an enormous use of medical resources. Whereas randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are absolutely crucial in defining the benefits of screening, a preliminary estimate of the costs and benefits that can be expected with screening can be derived with simulation (decision) models. Models are also very useful adjuncts to RCTs in extrapolating short-term results to long-term outcomes and in estimating the associated costs. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand that although screening for cancer has enormous intuitive appeal, the decision to screen depends on a number of prerequisites related to the trade-off between benefits, harms, and costs. 2. To learn about the prerequisites of a diagnostic test that will be used for screening. 3.

Sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), it joins two entities: the Lung Screening Study through the Division of Cancer Prevention, and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) through the Cancer Imaging Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. The study is a randomized, controlled multicenter trial comparing low-dose spiral CT to chest X-ray (CXR) to determine which screening test will result in fewer lung cancer deaths in a high risk cohort. The primary endpoint is lung cancer-specific mortality, for which the trial has 90% power to detect a 20% difference in mortality between the two arms. Additional joint endpoints include: all-cause mortality, stage distribution at diagnosis, screening test performance, and medical resource utilization for a positive screening result. The ACRIN NLST has independent endpoints that include: overall medical resource utilization and a formal cost-effectiveness analysis, screening-related quality of life, effects of screening on smoking behaviors/beliefs, and the creation of a specimen bank for biomolecular research. Participants are healthy individuals 55 to 74 years of age with a heavy current or former cigarette smoking history. The trial launched in September of 2002; accrual finished ahead of schedule in April of 2004 with 53,476 individuals enrolled. Subjects have received three annual screens and will be observed for medical outcomes up to 2009. The baseline characteristics of the subjects and available data will be presented, along with trial mileposts moving forward. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the experimental design of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). 2. To review primary and secondary aims of the NLST and their relationships to broader concerns in lung cancer detection. 3. To learn the available data from the NLST.",

Halligan; London/UK Colorectal cancer is an ideal disease to screen for: it is common; there is a considerable lag between the pre-malignant adenomatous polyp and subsequent cancer; cancer can be prevented by polypectomy; and effective treatment is available for established cancer if detected early. Unfortunately, 75% of patients who develop cancer have no identifiable risk-factors so effective screening must be by mass-population. There are two possible screening targets -established cancer and/or adenomatous polyps. Faecal occult blood, for example, effectively detects only cancer -there is no opportunity for cancer prevention. In contrast, the potential of CT colonography is based on sensitivity for both cancer and polyps: A recent meta-analysis found sensitivities of 0.96 and 0.93 (for polyps 1 cm or more) respectively. It is also very specific (0.97) on a per-patient basis, an important attribute for a screening test that requires subsequent investigation for treatment (i.e. endoscopy). Other test characteristics are also very promising -it is both safe and appealing to patients, hopefully increasing compliance. Intriguingly, it also offers the possibility to examine other intra-abdominal organs but whether this is beneficial or not in asymptomatic patients is the subject of considerable debate, and models populated by trial data will be required to answer this with certainty. The main obstacle in the way of CT colonography in a screening context is wide inter-observer variability, which is not surprising given that it is a relatively new test. The effect of accredited training programmes and computerassisted-detection (CAD) on this will need further research. Learning Objectives:",

With the advent of parallel acquisition techniques (PAT) and multichannel wb-MRI systems with 32 or more independent receiver channels those limitations have been largely overcome. Dedicated organ-based exams can now be reduced to a few breath holds. The introduction of 3 Tesla wb-MRI systems has further advanced these possibilities. Clinical indications of wb-MRI include the staging of multiple myeloma, tumors without 18 F-FDG-uptake and the assessment of systemic inflammatory musculoskeletal disease. Several studies have shown the superior accuracy of wb-MRI compared with bone scintigraphy for the assessment of skeletal metastases, recent studies may even demonstrate equal accuracy in comparison with PET-CT. Arising applications are the specific imaging of diseases such as diabetes, bronchial carcinoma or secondary pulmonary hypertension. The role of wb-MRI for preventive imaging of cardiovascular and oncologic diseases remains to be determined in prospective controlled clinical trials. Initial data suggest that cardiovascular screening with wb-MRI has a high accuracy for assessment of systemic atherosclerotic vascular disease and could replace a more time-intensive multi-step multi-modality diagnostic algorithm. Due to the absence of radiation this may be a valuable imaging alternative for individuals with a high predisposition for vascular disease such long-standing diabetes. This presentation will review the radiological features seen in patients after lung transplantation. Radiological manifestations of the first postoperative phase, including surgical and non-surgical complications, will be presented. An analytical approach to acute and chronic rejection will be proposed. The presentation will also discuss radiological features of infections and neoplasms seen after lung transplantation. The role of imaging in the long-term follow-up of lung transplant recipients will be discussed, and a radiological algorithm for the early recognition of chronic rejection as manifested by the \"bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome\" will be proposed. Learning Objectives: 1. To illustrate the spectrum of imaging findings after lung transplantation. Over the past 10 years, considerable experience has been accrued using both diffusion MR imaging and perfusion MR imaging, by means of contrast agents, to measure cerebral hemodynamics and other cerebral diseases. Diffusion and perfusion MR imaging can be performed on nearly all up-to-date clinical scanners. Imaging technology is at a stage where, in addition to morphological information, the concomitant acquisition of functional and physiological information is possible. The most common clinical application of both techniques is within the field of stroke imaging where diffusion MR imaging can be considered a \"must do\" and perfusion MR imaging is added to solve further questions. However, imaging of neoplasia, inflammation, trauma and infection have gained considerable interest as well.",

            "text": "Diffusion-tensor-imaging (DTI) provides non-invasive information about organization of brain tissue on a microscopic level. Tissue organization, as measured by DTI, is characterized by anisotropy, magnitude-and direction of diffusion of water molecules. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of these parameters give evidence about membrane permeability, maturational state of axons, axonal thickness, integrity, and connectivity. In addition, compartmentalization (with respect to intra-or extracellular space) of water can be determined, and hindrance to water motility can be identified. The diffusion tensor is an ellipsoid, the parameters of which reflect the local properties of the water molecules as mentioned above; the eigenvalues correspond to the amount of diffusivity in each direction, while the eigenvectors indicate the directions. The eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue defines the principal direction of a structure. This information may be color-coded, and allows construction of three-dimensional maps of fibres. Thus the course and thickness of white-matter tracts may be visualized. DTI has been shown to contribute information regarding maturational changes of white-matter, connectivity of malformations of cortical development, growth patterns of brain tumors, demyelination and remyelination processes in multiple sclerosis, compartmentalization of acute edema, Wallerian degeneration in chronic vascular disease, diffuse axonal injury in post-traumatic states, connectivity of epileptogenic foci and fibre anomalies in psychiatric diseases. To determine the feasibility and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the local treatment of invasive breast carcinomas 2 cm or less in diameter, we undertook a pilot study on 21 malignant lesions in 20 patients immediately before their scheduled lumpectomy or mastectomy. A conventional RFA generator and a 15-gauge multi-array needle-electrode were used. The RFA device was placed in the lesion and its prongs deployed under real-time US guidance. A temperature of approximately 95\u00b0 C was maintained for 15 minutes at the tips of the prongs. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen included nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-diaphorase stain, a vital stain specifically designed to confirm cell death. The outcome of the procedure was ablation of the tumor with an adequate margin, as confirmed by the absence of viable tumor in the specimen. In all cases, complete ablation of the target lesion visualized on sonography was achieved. One patient, however, who had received preoperative chemotherapy for a T2 tumor, still had a small residual tumor detectable both mammographically and sonographically after chemotherapy and her target lesion was ablated, but residual occult (mammographically and sonographically invisible) invasive carcinoma was found on pathologic examination. No adverse effects of the procedure occurred. US-guided percutaneous ablation of small invasive breast carcinomas is feasible with commercially available RFA devices and is safe. However, significant operator dependence and skill requirements, combined with the current inability to verify the margins of the ablated lesion, are obstacles preventing this technique from being used as an alternative to the current standard treatment for small breast carcinoma (lumpectomy and radiotherapy), except in rare selected cases. Indications for adrenal ablation include isolated, limited malignant disease and hormone secreting tumours. Although adrenal metastases are often a marker for widespread disease they can be isolated and merit treatment e.g. in non-small cell lung or colorectal cancer. Percutaneous image guided ablation is an attractive alternative to surgery in patients with Cushings as these patients are usually obese and heal poorly. The percutaneous approach to the adrenal is the same as biopsy. Ablation of normally functioning adrenal tissue can result in severe hypertension secondary to release of vasopressors. Arterial monitoring of blood pressure and the ready availability of IV vasodilators are required. If hypertension occurs, interruption of the ablation is usually associated with a return to normal. Laser, radiofrequency, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy have all been used for prostatic ablation. TRUS and fluoroscopy were the traditional guidance methods but MR imaging allows imaging of the surrounding structures, of the needle/ electrode trajectory and of the treatment effect. In thermal techniques cooling/ warming of the urethra may be required. Assessment of treatment efficacy is best achieved with contrast enhanced high field MR imaging. Ablation of isolated pelvic recurrence from colorectal cancer is useful in patients who still have active disease despite optimal radiotherapy. Similarly ablation of isolated nodal disease, either pelvic or para-aortic, is technically feasible. It is necessary to avoid or displace vulnerable structures. Bowel loops can usually be displaced. Care must be taken to avoid the sciatic nerve or lumbosacral plexus. Despite prophylactic anticoagulation acute massive pulmonary embolism (PE) is still a common and often life-threatening entity. Survival of patients with right ventricular dysfunction depends on rapid recanalisation of the pulmonary arterial occlusion. Percutaneous catheter treatment represents a therapeutic option for these patients. Catheter devices include standard diagnostic catheters, balloon catheters, dedicated suction catheters (Greenfield vacuum cup catheter), rotating pigtail catheter, hydrodynamic thrombectomy catheter, and high-speed rotating tip catheters. The principles employed are extraction and/or fragmentation of the embolic material. Fragmentation of central emboli and dislocation of the fragments to the periphery result in a relative gain of non-obstructed cross-sectional area. The increased total surface area of the fragments accelerates the efficacy of an accompanying thrombolysis or of spontaneous intrinsic lytic activity. In the workshop pulmonary placement and navigation of the pigtail rotation catheter will be demonstrated as well as the mechanical action for recanalisation. The indications, safety, efficacy, the influence on hemodynamic parameters, possible complications, and pitfalls will be discussed. Percutaneous inferior vena cava (IVC) filter implantation represents a mechanical prophylaxis of PE. Absolute indications are recurrent PE despite sufficient anticoagulation and occurrence of PE in patients with contraindicated anticoagulation. The most common IVC filters will be presented. Implantation can be performed via femoral or jugular access. Temporary and facultative temporary filters can be removed within a certain duration after placement. Filter complications include misplacement, IVC thrombosis, perforation, migration, filter breakage, and recurrent PE. Therefore, diligent checking of the indication for IVC filter implantation is advisable. ",

All this is applicable to the ordinary radiological activity while in emergency, where the planning is not possible due to the difficult management of the request, the tools of control of the work flow just allows to identify the necessity of further engagement of the human resources. The new modalities of diagnostic procedure and the rapid development of those already existing update the features of the modalities work load. If the innovation allows a wide reduction of the time consuming for each diagnostic procedure with an improved productivity supplied to the radiologist, it needs an increase of the human resources and sometimes an internal reorganization to make possible the same quality standard for reporting. This situation is well emphasized in case of the formal procedure MDCT in which, at present, 16 detectors technology produces images dataset of 350 as mean number; such volume of images obligates to carry out evaluations in softcopy reporting using advanced WS with advanced software for multidimensional analysis. Quality of service and customer satisfaction are closely related and quality can be defined as meeting or exceeding customer requirements. There are several approaches to maintaining and improving quality in radiology. Traditional quality assurance (QA) programs usually focus on establishing a certain minimal quality level through defined standards, usually set by an external regulatory body. In contrast to this, continuous quality improvement (CQI) is an ongoing process based on continuous collection and improvement of performance data relevant to the various customers. Examples of important performance indicators in radiology are incidence of adverse events, patient wait time, report turnaround time, appointment availability and referring physician satisfaction. Radiology provides services both to customers internal to the organization (e.g. referring physicians from other clinical departments) as well as to external customers (e.g. patients) and the needs from these two groups may not always be aligned. A typical example for this is if emergency inpatient procedures lead to delays for outpatients. Processes in radiology have to be organized in such a way that these conflicts are kept to a minimum. It is important to realize that high quality of service and cost-efficient operation do not contradict each other. In many cases, the same measures which lead to improved quality of service will also result in a reduction of costs. In other cases, an increase in cost of operation in radiology may be compensated for by additional patient revenue or higher cost-efficiency in other areas of the institution. Learning Objectives:",

Archive security is multifactional, involving: archive redundancy, including disaster recovery and off-site storage; limitation of archive access, both physical and password protected; and robust audit trails to investigate any breech of archive security. At the level of the workstation simple measures to ensure data safety involve implementing appropriate log-out times, screen-savers, virus checkers and secure physical placement of workstations. Teleradiology and telemedicine over public networks necessitate added safety measures such as encrypting the data and avoiding local insecure data caches on personal computers.

There are four levels of hierarchy in the development of an organisation: operational effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, commercial effectiveness, and strategic effectiveness. Although strategic effectiveness is the highest level, it also is the starting point of new development at the level of operational effectiveness because strategic orientation is the trigger to start the sequence again. When change has reached its goal at each level before moving on to the next level, the process of development will be swift, coherent and focused. If more than one level is activated at the same time, the process will take too much energy and will be divergent. Operational effectiveness means that the product lines (producing clinical output, research, education) of the enterprise run smoothly. At a minimal level this is operational integrity, and a top level this means that a department meets high international standards. The infrastructure of the department is a major determinator of operational effectiveness. Resources like human resources, technical platform, and budget determine the infrastructure. Infrastructure is also based on effective exchange and availability of information. Development and use of resources and informatics is therefore pivotal in improving operational effectiveness. Only if operational effectiveness is reached may the enterprise move to the higher levels of development. The introduction of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanners has altered the approach to imaging the paediatric thorax. This presentation focuses on the main principles of volumetric CT imaging, and applies generically to 16 slice detector CT scanners. The general principles however apply to all MDCT imaging and we describe the reconstruction techniques that apply for imaging the thorax and the paediatric low-dose protocols which we use in our institution giving examples of the most common clinical applications.",

            "text": "In an environment where the rapid acquisition of CT data allow general hospitals to image children (whereas in the past children would have been referred to specialist centers for children to be sedated, when image acquisition was more prolonged), it is vital that the general radiologists have access to appropriate protocols for use in children. This is important in order to dramatically reduce the delivered radiation dose and ensure appropriate contrast bolus delivery and timing, so that examinations do not need to be repeated inappropriately. With MR imaging, we are so far not able to show the same precise pictures of the lung parenchyma as in CT. First the principle problems are discussed that occur with imaging of the lung parenchyma on MR imaging. Central bronchus lesions are detectable on MR imaging with the same reliability as in computer tomography. The visibility of intrapulmonary metastases depends on the size of the lesion. Peripheral metastases can be recognised from a size of 4 mm by using optimal investigation strategies. Interstitial processes show discrete findings: Fibrosis is better demonstrated on MR imaging since it shows on T2 and even on T1 images a higher signal due to its cellular component. Alveolar processes are very well visible on proton MR imaging due to the high liquid content, even in small findings. The possibilities of functional imaging by using proton MR imaging are demonstrated. Perfusion measures are the most common functional assessment in clinical use. With colour coded perfusion maps, perfusion defects are often very clearly visible. Even the spatial resolution is much higher than in conventional perfusion scintigraphy. Imaging of ventilation is still work in progress. Methods we used are oxygen enhanced imaging of the air space, volume estimation of the lung and imaging of trapped air by using expiration technique. A new possibility seems to be the estimation of the lung function diffusion by means of nebulized Gadubutrol. With a combination of morphological and functional imaging, MR imaging of the lung will find its place in paediatric radiology. Learning Objectives: 1. To point out the principle problems that will occur when you image the lung in MR imaging. This lecture will review the role of thoracic imaging in children with systemic disorders. Following a discussion of examination techniques, specific systemic conditions with thoracic manifestations will be presented. Their general features will be described prior to a review of their specific imaging characteristics. This re-view will emphasize both advanced imaging techniques and recent developments. Plain radiographs remain the most common thoracic imaging study. Computed radiography is replacing film radiography in many sites but its resolution remains lower. Computed tomography (CT) is the primary cross-sectional imaging modality used to evaluate all thoracic components due to its increased sensitivity and specificity compared to chest radiography. CT may be used either to better evaluate radiographic abnormalities or to assess the presence and extent of a suspected complication of a systemic disease. Low-dose techniques have been applied to both helical CT and high-resolution CT (HRCT). HRCT is the method of choice for the evaluation of diffuse parenchymal disease. Evaluation of the mediastinum and chest wall should be performed with helical CT. Parenchymal characteristics such as fibrosis or ground glass increased density cannot be seen using MR imaging. However, MR imaging is better in evaluating the chest wall or in demonstrating soft tissue inflammation and rib bone marrow changes compared to CT. Nuclear medicine can add functional information to the morphological information provided by CT and MR imaging. The systemic diseases in children includes the connective tissue diseases, immunodeficiency and immunodeficiency syndromes, chronic granulomatous disease, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, cystic fibrosis, phacomatoses such as tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, etc. ",

Many different MR imaging and CT examinations contribute a major part of the AGES study where radiographers play an important and challenging role. The AGES study is a collaboration project between the National Institute of Aging in USA and the Icelandic Heart Association (IHA). The study goal is to examine 8000 elderly individuals to characterize diseases and conditions of importance in old age. Conclusion: Quantitative analysis methods for the MR imaging and CT data are robust and suitable for large population based studies like the AGES study. It is our experience so far that the skill mix environment in the radiology department has brought the radiographers into new and exciting dimensions of their profession. To be involved in all steps of the image process from acquisition to analysis has proved to be challenging, motivating and to give opportunities to combine work and education. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss the various tasks carried out by radiographers in the study from image acquisitions to the analysis of the image data acquired with CT and MR imaging. 2. To learn about quantitative and semi-quantitative analysis techniques applied in the imaging part of the study with focus on the cardiovascular system, the muscular-skeletal system and the brain. 3. To discuss how the skill mix environment in the study has created research and post-graduate educational opportunities for radiographers. Purpose: To describe the installation and operation of a 3 T MR system in Sheffield, UK used for both research and clinical imaging and with reference to safety issues at higher field strengths. Some non neuro applications will also be discussed. Methods and Materials: A Philips Intera 3 T MR system was used for both clinical scanning and research studies. Volunteers were recruited initially for full optimisation of protocols and sequences, along with an ethics approved 1.5 T/ 3 T comparison study. Images from both will be presented along with clinical images and images from both neuro and non neuro research studies. Results: Advantages of 3 T MR are increased spatial resolution, better T2 and T2* contrast and increased flow effects. Disadvantages are decreased T1 contrast, increased susceptibility artefact and increased flow/movement artefact. Consequently, specific groups of patients are more suitable for scanning at 3 T e.g. those requiring MR angiography ,epilepsy imaging or EPI studies. Modern MR scanners approach the safety limits for patients for almost all relevant physical parameters of the MR scanner. These parameter can have specific physical effects: applied dynamic gradient fields -which may create peripheral nerve stimulation; acoustic noise produced by the gradients -which makes the use of ear protection essential; and the RF fields transmitted by the RF coilswhich may heat up the human body, make it essential to implement safety measures on the MR scanner. The static magnetic field (known to create instantaneous effects such as nausea or dizziness or metallic taste) may become a limiting factor for future scanners. The MR specific limits of these parameters for patients are described in the IEC 60601-2-33 international standard for safety of MR equipment. In 2004, new European legislation has been accepted which also limits these parameters for MR workers and thus has direct implications for the use of MR. In particular high field systems and interventional MR are hindered by this new legislation. This necessitates as a matter of urgency, more research to determine the safety levels, which should be added to the IEC standards for MR. In spite of these hazards MR scanners are still considered to be a most safe and patient friendly modality. In MR imaging safety issues affect everyday clinical practice. Every patient and visitor to the MR suite has to be screened for implants, tattoos, eyeliner, and clothing, i.e. anything which may move in the magnetic field or heat up and cause injury. It is important to note that MR imaging burns are the most reported incident type. Even the way the patient is set up within the bore of the magnet is an important safety issue, especially if there are monitoring devices involved. These issues will be reviewed in the talk. Another major cause of injury in MR is projectile hazards; ways in which to minimize the risk of this will be discussed in term of good practice within the MR suite. Currently higher and higher field strengths are being installed which in turn means that patients and staff are exposed to higher and higher noise levels; this presents noise protection issues which will be discussed. Another important concern is that of pregnancy and MR imaging. The current state of play regarding imaging of pregnant patients and pregnant staff working in MR imaging will be addressed. MR guidance of interventional procedures requires fast imaging sequences to speed up the procedure and even real-time imaging for guidance of vascular interventions. Interventional devices used have to be MR-safe as well as MRcompatible. Using passive methods for device visualization one has to be aware of the artifact behaviour of interventional instruments in order to correctly localize the instrument tip. The artifact behaviour can be quite dependent on the applied imaging sequence (gradient versus spin echo) and sequence parameters like echo time and phase encoding direction. Active methods can overcome these potential problems and allow not only for device visualization but also for slice tracking. Drawbacks of active methods are more sophisticated hard-and software requirements. Furthermore safety issues concerning heating of long conductive wires have to be taken into account in order not to jeopardize the patient or interventionalist. Initial approaches are using fiberoptic means to achieve MRsafe active instrument visualization. While passive device visualization is sufficient for interventions like biopsies, vascular interventions will greatly profit from the possibility of slice and tip tracking of active means especially in the region of small and tortuous vessels. Performing interventions in the MR environment requires special awareness of all personnel involved in the procedure including anesthesiology. Consequently, a dedicated team should be set up in order to avoid accidents from inexperienced handling of metallic patient support devices. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is now well-established in many countries as a uterus-conserving alternative treatment for symptomatic fibroid disease. This is despite any level 1 evidence or randomised controlled studies. The indications and the comparison of UAE with alternative treatments will be discussed. Also how best to establish a fibroid embolization service. Although the technique of selective catheterisation of the uterine arteries has changed little since the earliest reports some refinements have occurred. Practical aspects of the procedure and methods of dealing with difficult catheterisations will be detailed.",

            "text": "The management of these patients after discharge from hospital is very important and the combined roles of both the radiologist and the gynaecologist will be assessed. Complications and their management will discussed. Finally fertility is an important issue particularly in younger women. The evidence that fertility does not appear to be adversely affected following UAE will be reviewed. Uterine artery embolization has been applied successfully for the control of acute or delayed post-partum hemorrhage, post-surgical hemorrhage, hemorrhage from ectopic pregnancy, treatment of uterine arteriovenous malformations, and as prophylaxis prior to high risk surgery such as caesarean section in patients with placenta previa. The technique of embolization is similar regardless of the indication. The choice of embolization agent varies depending upon the indication and regional vascular anatomy, as in any other vascular bed. The author applies PVA particles for elective uterine artery embolization, and gelatin sponge in cases of acute hemorrhage when only a transient effect is required and the patient has concerns regarding future fertility. In the emergent setting, the care of the hemodynamic consequences of precipitous bleeding is the most important concern. This implies having a protocol for emergent uterine artery embolization devised with the obstetrical team ahead of time. After uterine artery embolization, the patients invariably develop post-embolization syndrome consisting of 3-5 days of significant pain and fever. Treatment is symptomatic. It is critical that radiologists be involved in post embolization care, as clinicians and most clinicians are not familiar with the consequences of embolization. Ovarian cancer is the most lethal among the gynecological malignancies with more than 2/3 of patients presenting at an advanced tumor stage. Tumor spreads most commonly directly and via peritoneal pathways in the pelvis and abdomen and is followed by lymphatic dissemination. Rarely, patients present with hematogenous metastases at the time of diagnosis. The prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer is directly related to the tumor stage and residual tumor burden after cytoreductive surgery. Exploratory laparotomy has been the cornerstone in the management of ovarian cancer, as it offers staging and tumor debulking. Understaging at initial laparotomy, however, is a problem in more than 30%, mainly due to unexpected peritoneal spread outside the pelvis and new surgery techniques. Recently, CT and MR imaging have been accepted as adjunct imaging modalities for preoperative treatment decisions. Based upon imaging findings complementary information may be rendered towards surgical planning and clinical management. It may alert the surgeon to tumor sites difficult to visualize intraoperatively, such as deposits in the upper abdomen and lymph nodes. It may also influence subspecialist cooperation or referral to an oncology center. Furthermore, it offers high efficacy in identifying resectable from non resectable disease. Identification of the latter may help to select patients with advanced ovarian cancer who may benefit from chemotherapy before debulking. Sports activities either professional or not are growing in importance into our day-life. This means a corresponding higher frequency of sport-related injuries, leading to muscles, tendons, ligaments and bone pathological involvement. Usually in these conditions an early and correct diagnosis is required to avoid subsequent joint instability and/or functional impairment. Many of the diagnostic techniques now available play an important role in sports-related diseases; however to choose the right diagnostic protocol it is always necessary to know how traumatic forces acted. The most frequently involved joints are those provided by the largest range of motion: shoulder, knee and ankle. As this field of diseases comprehend either acute and chronic traumas we will consider only the degenerative conditions caused by long-lasting microtraumas and overloads which may lead to stress fractures, synovial hyperplastic reactions, chondral and subchondral suffering, tendon's degeneration, impingement syndromes and entrapment neuropathies (typically involved structures narrowed into bony or ligaments channels). Plain film is usually the first examination to perform as it allows the best detection of bony alterations as consequence of altered loads, being able to clearly depict osteophytes, bone sclerosis and osteochondral fragments. However in many cases plain film may result completely negative as in stress fractures, impingement syndromes and ligament derangements. In these cases ultrasound, magnetic resonance and computed tomography allow a complete evaluation of all the remaining soft joint components. An appropriate US examination of the knee requires state-of-the-art equipment including a high-frequency (at least 7.5 MHz) linear transducer with available color/power-Doppler mode. Since side-by-side comparison during the examination can be misleading due to asymptomatic overuse lesions, knowledge of normal US anatomy is essential. Some remarks with regard to patient positioning will be made. Because of their high prevalence, patellar tendinosis and iliotibial band friction syndrome will be discussed in detail, followed by a shorter overview of overuse lesions of other tendons, bursae, Hoffa's fat pad, some meniscal lesions etc. Beside its wide availability and low cost, US is preferred for extra-articular pathology because of its high spatial resolution, the possibility to target the examination to the patient's painful area, allowing a dynamic examination. However, one should keep in mind that the correlation between clinical symptoms and US findings is not always good. The use of US in the evaluation of intra-articular overuse lesions is limited. Although several US experts report a good accuracy for meniscal lesions, for this type of pathology MR imaging is preferred. The most recent literature on US in overuse lesions of the knee deals with the subject of intratendinous neovascularisation in patellar tendinosis. Although certainly not the only cause of tendon pain, the presence of this neovascularisation of non-inflammatory origin seems to correlate better with symptoms than grayscale findings of tendinosis. US guided sclerosing injection of these vessels is a promising new therapeutic option. An acute impaction force on a bone results in a \"contusion bone bruise pattern\", corresponding to trabecular microfractures, marrow edema and/or hemorrhage. Standard radiography is usually negative, whereas on MR imaging, these contusions manifest as relatively huge ill-defined areas of decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images. They are, however, most conspicuous on fat-saturated T2-weighted or STIR images. Focal bone bruise may result from direct trauma to the bone, but most often a pattern of bone marrow changes on adjacent bones occurs due to impaction of one bone on another. Systematic analysis of this pattern and location of these \"kissing contusions\", together with the associated soft tissue changes can reveal the specific mechanism of injury. Distraction injuries are usually due to valgus, varus or rotational stress on a joint, resulting in a small avulsion fracture related to a tendinous, ligamentous or capsular attachment on the bone. Because the cortical bone is involved rather than the trabecular bone, the resulting \"avulsion bone bruise pattern\" is much less extensive than in impaction injuries.",

The possibility to visualize neoangiogenesis mammographically is challenging. Results of first clinical studies and future developments will be presented. A limitation of PET imaging is the poor anatomic information. In the last 3 years, integrated PET/CT imaging has been clinically introduced. Integrated anatomic-molecular imaging has several advantages. The addition of PET provides a rapid way of acquiring attenuation correction data and the availability of perfectly matched anatomic data, increases the accuracy of diagnosis. The restricted sensitivity of FDG PET for small lesions in breast cancer, particularly in invasive lobular carcinoma is well recognized This limits the role of PET in evaluation the primary breast lesion. The major clinical role of PET/CT today is in the evaluation of metastatic disease. The ability of PET/CT to monitor treatment response allows individualization of therapy. FDG uptake decreases rapidly with effective chemotherapy, at a rate faster than the decline in tumor size. A lack of decline in FDG uptake with treatment suggests lack of efficacy of treatment. At present integrated SPECT/CT has been introduced for evaluation of axillary microscopic metastases using sentinel lymph node scintigraphy. Our data suggest that combined SPECT/CT imaging is a promising method for minimal invasive sentinel node biopsy, particularly for retrosternal nodes. ",

Intrinsic absorbers such as hemoglobin, fat and water can be exploited to interrogate breast tissue characteristics (e.g. perfusion, angiogenesis) non-invasively. More recently the definition of breast cancer related proteins has prompted the development of target specific fluorochromes for cancer detection. Optical tracers have been explored experimentally for non invasive detection of molecules relevant for the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer (e.g. EGF receptor). Moreover, treatment response to chemotherapy can potentially be monitored by apoptosis -targeting probes. Autoquenched 'smart' probes can sensitively detect protease expression of primary tumors and help to define nodal involvement in a 'sentinel' lymph node model. Due to an inherently lower sensitivity of MR imaging to depict molecular structures efficient signal amplification strategies are essential for molecular MR contrast agents.

The abnormal vascularity induced by cancers allows their detection using contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE MR imaging). Similarly iodinated contrast medium used with digital mammography can show breast cancers even within dense fibroglandular tissue. Two techniques have been reported. One uses temporal subtraction with imaging of the breast in the craniocaudal projection. Digital images are taken before and after the injection of contrast medium. Registration and logarithmic subtraction are performed with resulting images showing the lesions with increased iodine content. Kinetic curves are created by selecting a region of interest whose signal intensity is tracked over time. Combining this with tomosynthesis may provide further information. Another technique uses dual energy. Images are taken using energies above and below the k edge of iodine, before and after the injection of contrast medium. This has the advantage of having no breast compression during the injection and the use of the mediolateral oblique position which demonstrates more breast tissue. Both temporal subtraction and dual energy techniques have been successful in detecting breast cancers. They may find a similar role to CE MR imaging in the diagnosis of breast cancer but at a lesser cost. The enormous technological advances of CT and MR imaging have had an exceptional impact on the study of the urinary tract. Urography with multislice CT and MR imaging are gradually becoming the mainstay of imaging the urinary tract in many centres in the developed world. CT urography (CTU) refers to imaging the urinary tract with multislice CT following intravenous injection of water soluble iodinated contrast medium. Dynamic multiphase scans and multiplanar images of the urinary tract of almost isotropic resolution can be provided by this technique. However, no agreement has yet been reached on the optimal approach to perform CTU. The dose of the contrast medium, the number of phases that should be obtained after contrast injection, the induction of diuresis whether with intravenous saline or a small dose of diuretics, and the use of compression are some of the issues which remain contentious. There is also no universal agreement on the best approach to review the large number of images that are produced per examination, and which image reconstructions should be performed routinely. In this session different approaches to CTU will be presented highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Clinical applications and concern about radiation dose will also be discussed. MR urography (MRU), either T2 MRU or excretory MRU are important techniques for imaging the urinary tract, particularly when there is contraindication for the use of ionising radi-ation or injection of iodinated contrast media. How to perform these examinations, clinical indications, advantages and limitations will be presented. The comprehensive approach to CT urography (CTU) images the urinary tract in each of three renal enhancement phases: Unenhanced, nephrographic, and excretory. This approach has been shown to detect malignant and benign abnormalities with sensitivities that are likely to exceed those of excretory urography (EU) and even retrograde pyelography. Appropriate patient selection for comprehensive CTU is important, since this technique exposes patients to more radiation exposure than EU or more limited CTU techniques. Fortunately, the majority of patients with suspected urinary tract neoplasms are elderly and the adverse effects of incremental radiation on this patient population are limited. Also, use of a separate nephrographic phase series does not increase patient radiation burden dramatically. Most CTU radiation exposure occurs during excretory phase acquisition (which is utilized with all CTU approaches). While standard threedimensional reconstructions (utilizing thick slabs or the entire data set) are aesthetically pleasing, they are insensitive in detecting urinary tract neoplasms. However, preliminary work indicates that coronal plane reconstructions utilizing image thicknesses of \u2264 2 mm are equally sensitive to axial images. These coronal reformatted images are preferred to axial images because they are fewer in number and they also take significantly less time to review. Awareness of pitfalls in CTU interpretation is important. False positive diagnoses most commonly result from ureteral kinks, prominent renal pyramids, or from volume averaging, all of which can simulate urothelial lesions. False negative diagnoses are more likely in unopacified or poorly distended portions of the renal collecting systems and ureters. Limited CTU is an effective replacement of intravenous urography for routine assessment of the urinary tract. Patients are scanned (4X2.5 mm) in the supine position (the upper abdomen pre contrast injection, and the whole abdomen 5 minutes after 50 ml of 300 mgI/ml non ionic contrast medium and 10 mg of frusemide). The patients are turned several times prior to the post contrast scanning. Contiguous axial images (5 mm slice thickness) of the abdomen and pelvis, contiguous thin coronal (3 mm slice thickness) and thick coronal (80 mm slice thickness) images of the kidneys and ureters using maximum intensity projection (MIP) are produced on hard copies. On average 6 to 8 films [30 x 40 cm, 20 frames/film] are produced per examination. Our experience so far suggests that limited CTU is adequate for assessment of patients with urinary symptoms including haematuria with good visualisation of kidneys, pelvicalyceal system, ureters and urinary bladder. The radiation dose, number of images, cost and time required for the examination is significantly less in comparison to multiphase CTU. The technique can be modified in selected cases if more information is required particularly in assessment of undetermined renal masses. The main limitations of the technique include suboptimal nephrogram and difficulty in assessing unexpected calcification of the ureters and urinary bladder. The principle indication for MSCT urography is the detection of urothelial tumours, which present most commonly with haematuria or more rarely with unexplained hydronephrosis. Secondary indications include detection and evaluation of a renal mass, investigation of loin pain, persistent urinary tract infection, pelvic tumour staging and 3D planning for percutaneous procedures. Absolute contra-indications include known contrast allergy and pregnancy. Relative contra-indications are presented in terms of risk versus benefit. For example the justification of the use of MSCT urography in the case of a 28-yr female presenting with microscopic haematuria and no other risk factors for urothelial cancer compared with a 78-yr male with macroscopic haematuria who has been a life-long smoker. Advantages and disadvantages of MSCT urography with respect to other diagnostic imaging tests depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the imaging tests for detection of upper tract urothelial tumours. The emerging evidence that MSCT urography compares favourably with other imaging modalities for the detection of urothelial cancer will be carefully examined. Economic, radiological and political reasons are limiting the use of MSCT urography in our institutions. A model incorporating all the above factors will be presented to illustrate how the use of MSCT urography may fit into established pathways of patient investigation. During the past decade, MR urography has emerged as a potential clinical alternative to conventional intravenous urography (IVU) and CT urography (CTU). The concept of MR urography (MRU) intends to obtain typical urographic views without resorting to radiation exposure. Moreover, MRU provides different approaches for imaging the upper urinary tract in a comprehensive way neither achievable with IVU nor CTU. One MR urographic strategy applies heavily T2weighted turbo spin-echo sequences for obtaining unenhanced static-fluid images of the urinary tract independent of the renal function. The second MR urographic strategy is based on the acquisition of fast T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences after renal excretion of an intravenously injected gadolinium chelate and is referred to as excretory MRU. A basic knowledge of the diverse examination techniques makes it easy to put MRU into operation. To date, MRU offers several firstchoice applications in adults and children and its indication should not be confined to patients who do not tolerate iodinated contrast agents. MRU will probably not compete with CT in the diagnosis of urolithiasis, but MRU should always be considered as alternative to IVU and CTU for imaging congenital anomalies, disorders affecting transplant and postoperative urinary tracts, intrinsic and extrinsic tumor diseases. MRU especially features the option to be combined with other MR examination techniques in a single session such as standard abdominal MR imaging, MR angiography or MR nephrography. In the near future, this integrative approach of MR imaging in modern uroradiology may obviate the need for multiple separate, costly, and time-consuming diagnostic procedures. In the past few years liver transplantation has become a definite approach to cure adult and pediatric patients with several diffuse liver diseases and even with primary liver neoplasms. Imaging plays a key role in the pre-operative evaluation of: 1. patients with diffuse and focal liver disease, possible candidates for liver transplantation; 2. possible living liver donors.",

It is now possible to be extremely precise in the definition of the correct organ volume and define preoperatively which type of resection will be made during surgery. The role of all imaging modalities will be evaluated and their role will be defined. Liver transplantation is the accepted treatment of patients with irreversible liver cell failure, some metabolic disorders and a selected group of patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. Over the last decade, the major transplant centres have reported improving survival rates even though during this period they have developed more complex surgical techniques including split-liver, auxiliary and liverelated transplantation, and have treated more marginal higher-risk patients. This successful outcome has been dependent on appropriate recipient selection, robust surgical technique, improvements in immunosuppression and intensive care management and prompt recognition and treatment of complications. Diagnostic and interventional radiology have been core specialties in achieving the goals of improved graft and patient survival. Improvements in surgical technique have decreased the more common vascular and biliary complications but the newer surgical techniques present differing diagnostic and interventional challenges particularly in paediatric recipients. Developments in MR and MDCT allow many of these vascular, biliary and infective complications to be diagnosed non-invasively. Vascular techniques of angioplasty and stent placement may reverse the sequels of graft ischaemia or portal hypertension. MRC allows the diagnosis of biliary strictures that may be treated by dilatation or stent placement. Imaging is also important in the diagnosis of recurrent disease and the acquired diseases of prolonged immunosuppression including atypical infection and the post transplant lymphoproliferative disorders PTLD. This presentation will review the current status of these techniques and review the European experience. Learning Objectives:",

The evolution of atherosclerotic plaque is represented by accumulation of lipoprotein in the intima. Oxidative stress induce local leukocyte migration into the intima with development of foam cells and growing of atherosclerotic plaque. In this manner the fatty streak can evolve into a fibrofatty lesion. In the later stage calcification can occur and fibrosis continues, yielding a fibrous capsule surrounding a lipid-rich core. Two-thirds of myocardial infarcts involve a fracture of the plaque's fibrous cup. The so-called \" vulnerable\" plaque shows a relative lack of smooth muscle cells due to inflammatory mediators, the prominent accumulation of macrophages and large lipid pool. Thus, the imaging modality of choice should be useful to distinguish lipid core and inflammatory reaction. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is an invasive modality considered useful to distinguish fibrous and calcified plaques with respect to \"soft\" or \"mixed\" plaque with higher spatial resolution than any other imaging modality.

Since coronary calcification often can be depicted on plain film chest X-ray, there has been a interest in quantifying these calcifications and in using them as a predictive factor to assess the risk of a future cardiac event for a long time. With the advent of electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) and multidetectorrow CT (MDCT), the near-isometric, ECG-gated CT-acquisition of the whole heart in one breathold and the quantitative measurement of coronary calcifications became feasible and available for a larger patient population. Due to the high attenuation of calcium, CT is extremely sensitive in depicting vascular calcifications in unenhanced scans. At least for the quantification of coronary sclerosis an unenhanced scan is mandatory, because iodinated contrast material would impair any quantification method. For coronary calcium screening using MDCT at least 4 detector rows should be used. Acquisition should be performed ECGgated to avoid motion artifacts. Reconstructed section thickness should not exceed 3 mm. An automated or semi-automated quantification tool should be used to ensure an examinor-independent evaluation. While Agatston score has been initially designed for use with EBCT, absolute calcium mass equivalent to calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) should be used with MDCT to quantify coronary sclerosis. Coronary calcification is not a X-ray sign of a specific disease but a marker to assess risk of future cardiac events. It has to be valued in due proportion to age and sex of the screened individual. Recommendation for changes in lifestyle or pharmaceutical intervention also depend on other known cardiac risk factors. Cardiovascular risk factors fail to identify up to half of all asymptomatic individuals who will suffer a coronary event. Especially in subjects at intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) on the basis of cardiovascular risk factors, added information from a noninvasive test of atherosclerotic burden may be helpful in guiding decisions on preventive measures. Assessment of the presence and extent of coronary calcium by new CT techniques may improve risk assessment for primary prevention of CHD. A number of studies has shown that increasing amounts of coronary calcium are associated with a strongly increased risk of coronary heart disease. Information on the ability of coronary calcification to improve risk prediction based on cardiovascular risk factors is scarce. In a recent prospective study, a high calcium score altered predicted risk of CHD in subjects considered to be at intermediate risk on the basis of the Framingham risk score.",

MR spectroscopy allows the examination of tissue biochemistry, which adds to the diagnostic information obtained by e.g. conventional radiology, angiography, CT and different MR modalities. As MRS techniques have become more user friendly and reliable, clinical in vivo applications are increasing, more metabolites can be included in data analysis, and confidence of interpretation increases. When investigating patients with focal brain lesions, the use of single volume short TE methods for lesion characterization combined with multiple volume methods adding spatial information is advantageous. In focal brain lesions difficult to classify based on imaging characteristics, MRS often can optimize the reliability of diagnostics and prognostics. However, the sometimes only subtle MRS changes, as well as small differences and large overlaps in spectra of different pathologies demand careful interpretation of MRS findings and correlation with MR imaging features.

Examples include white matter disorders such as adrenoleukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy, in which MRS can be valuable to determine whether a bone marrow transplantation should be considered as treatment. Characteristic spectra may also be obtained in patients with disorders with a disturbed energy metabolism such as mitochondrial diseases. Leukodystrophies with demyelination are generally characterized by an increase of Cho and myo-Ins and a reduction of tNAA due to axonal damage. Hypomyelinating disorders may have other spectroscopic patterns, such as normal levels of tNAA and Cho, and an increase of myo-Ins and tCr, due to gliosis. However, there are many differences between the leukodystrophies with regard to the severity, the location and the extent of spectroscopic abnormalities. Furthermore, within each disorder large variations are observed, depending on the stage of the disease. Follow-up studies in particular have provided knowledge on metabolic changes during disease progression, which can often be interpreted in terms of structural and/or functional changes such as gliosis, demyelination and neuroaxonal damage. Accurate identification of these dynamic metabolic abnormalities by MRS may be used for early prognosis which may help the choice of therapy, and is also being applied to investigate therapeutic effects. Considering the fact, that 35 -40 % of the elderly population in nursing homes die from chronic aspiration, the clinical need for swallowing investigations is underestimated. Reflux induced swallowing disorders are an increasing problem with the modern lifestyle. Moreover, especially in Europe, there is a lack of trained radiologists in this field. In the last 10 years the number of publications in this field has dramatically increased (1200%!). The usual applied technique is videofluoroscopy at 25 images/s. The development of a low-dosage DSI at 8-24 frames/s will be the future. Dynamic MR imaging is an upcoming technique of which we will present our first clinical results.",

            "text": "In cases of motor disturbances, dynamic imaging is the only valid assessment. Some morphologic changes can be visualised by conventional static imaging. In order to control expenses, according to Donner, it is essential to apply a \"tailored\" examination, centered on the individual patient's complaint. This may include the use of different consistencies and different contrast agents. The efficiency of the optimised imaging strategies will be demonstrated in differ-ent pathologic entities, including neurologic dysphagia, reflux-associated impairments and post-surgical patients including laryngectomized patients with special diagnostic approaches for dysphagia in newborn and children. An explanation of pathophysiology in each type of disturbancy will be given. Also, the on-line testing of therapeutic approaches for the different types of disorders based on the radiologic findings will be explained. Swallowing disturbances require a dedicated multidisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic team, consisting of at least: A radiologist, a voice/speech pathologist (and/or phoniatrician), and an ENT surgeon. Diagnostics often require a combination of static and dynamic examination of the upper digestive tract in all stages of swallowing: A. oral phase B. pharyngeal phase C. oesophageal phase Leading symptoms of swallowing disturbances eligible for medical or surgical intervention are problems of bolus passage and aspiration. Problems of bolus passage Many obstructions or anatomical anomalies in the upper digestive tract (webs, stenoses, benign or malignant tumours, osteophytic cervical spine protrusions, diverticula or pharyngoceles, dysfunction of UES or LES) are eligible to surgical treatment. Besides level, severity, location (intraluminal, intramural or external) and type of obstruction (static or dynamic), possible compensatory mechanisms are also evaluated. Aspiration Aspiration may remain unnoticed by the patient (silent aspiration) and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Dynamic evaluation with different bolus consistencies is required, to determine severity, level and patho-physiological background. Timing, contact, duration, distance and coordination of movements of important structures (mobile tongue, base of tongue, velum, constrictor pharyngeus muscle, epiglottis, hyoid and thyroid cartilage) should be evaluated, as well as developed compensatory mechanisms, to determine the best treatment options. Many surgical interventions to prevent aspiration interfere with phonation and/or respiration and require adequate pre-operative planning and patient counselling, which can only be correctly executed following detailed radiological evaluation. Background: The interdisciplinary management of oropharyngeal dysphagia falls within the competence of ENT, phoniatrics and speech language pathology. Oropharyngeal dysphagia/aspiration may be due various etiologies including structural abnormalities of the upper aerodigestive tract, neurological diseases or psychogenic disorders. If no causal therapy of the disease is necessary/possible, functional (logopedic) treatment may be indicated. To establish an individually tailored treatment program of the dysphagic patient, the pathophysiology of dysphagia and the type and degree of aspiration should be sought. For this purpose, the dynamic instrumental diagnostic methods of fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and videofluoroscopic swallowing study are used. Procedure Details: FEES \"as first line examination\" analyses morphology and function of the oropharyngeal swallowing phases. However, limitations of endoscopy have to be taken into account, which include no direct visualization of the bolus on its entire way from the oral cavity to the stomach as is offered by videofluoroscopy, non visualization of aspiration during the swallow, of laryngeal closure, hyoid/laryngeal elevation, upper esophageal sphincter and of the esophagus. Therefore, videofluoroscopy as \"golden standard\" is necessary in many cases. In the radiological examination, compensatory treatment techniques proposed by the phoniatric-logopedic team, are assessed to see if they improve swallowing function. Conclusion: Together with FEES, videofluoroscopy is indispensable for the management of oropharyngeal dysphagia. Therefore, the knowledge of swallowing disorders enables the radiologist to provide the diagnostic information needed by the phoniatrician. A close cooperation between phoniatrician and radiologist is required. This presentation reviews technical approaches to whole body scanning using a quadrature body coil and moving tabletop. The talk reviews technical issues such as patient positioning, acquisition time, acquisition parameters, and image post processing using ViewForum software. The second part of the talk focuses on clinical application of whole body scanning in oncology, as an alternative to bone scan in detection of skeletal metastases, as an alternative to PET scanning in tumour staging, and in the evaluation of patients with both lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The third part of the talk focuses on potential improved whole body scanning using intravenous iron contrast pre-administration. In this section the talk will focus on administration techniques, imaging protocols, and timing of image acquisition following ionic agents. As demands for urologic CT-scans continue to increase, more departments implement a \"scan and send\" policy. Therefore the radiographer will have more responsibility for the whole examination process. This includes designing the protocols, contrast administration, quality assurance, secondary reconstructions, taking decisions about supplementary scans etc. To minimize the number of recalls, radiographers must have an intimate understanding of the technical, antatomical and pathological aspects of urological CT imaging. The radiographer's role in the CT work-up of urological patients will be discussed in general, including (but not limited to): dose, contrast, patient cooperation, technical considerations, reconstructions, impact on patient flow in radiological as well as clinical departments. The following CT protocols will be examined in more detail: -CT urography -CT of the bladder -CT angiography of the kidneys There is a variety of different applications for digital techniques in the field of radiology, and each application has specific requirements for the X-ray equipment. It is characteristic for any digital-radiography device that the X-ray detection stage, the final storage, and the means for displaying the image are physically separate components. This is of importance for a definitive understanding of the differences between analogue and digital-radiography systems for the practical application as well as for quality control. From that perspective the principles of the most popular technological solutions for radiography applications (photostimulable plates, electro-direct flat panel detectors, opto-direct flat panel detectors) are discussed. The principles of X-ray detection and signal processing will be shown on a physical level as well as its impact on practical applications. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the basics of X-ray detection: What happens in the scintillators, what is the captured \"signal\" and which processes of signal deterioration exist (noise, flare etc). 2. To learn the principles of available technological solutions (photostimulable plates, electro-direct flat panel detectors and opto-direct flat panel detectors). 3. To understand the differences in physical imaging performance. Practical considerations with respect to application fields will also be discussed.",

            "text": "The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) approved in 2003, a document on \"Managing patient dose in digital radiology\", which was published in 2004. The ICRP report is structured as four chapters and three appendices. Diagnostic information provided by modern digital detectors can be equal or superior to conventional film-screen systems, with comparable patient doses. However with digital systems, an overexposure can occur without an adverse impact on image quality. This overexposure may not be recognised by the radiologist or radiographer and a tendency to increase doses can therefore occur. The ICRP document summarizes actions that can influence image quality and patient doses and includes an assessment of the impact of each action. The document includes eight formal recommendations dealing with: 1) training aspects; 2) review of diagnostic reference levels; 3) patient dose audits; 4) availability of the original image data to the user; 5) optimisation when new digital systems or new post-processing software are introduced; 6) procedures for quality control; 7) justification criteria; and 8) role of the industry promoting tools to know and control the exposure parameters. It is expected that the ICRP report helps to profit the benefits of this important technological advance in medical imaging with the best management of radiation doses to the patients. It is also expected to promote training actions before the digital techniques are introduced in radiology departments and to foster the industry to offer enough technical and dosimetric information to radiologists, radiographers and medical physicists to help in the optimisation of the imaging. The aim of all imaging methods is to answer the diagnostic question with sufficient quality. Decoupling of image acquisition, image processing and image documentation leads to new possibilities and risks for the quality of digital radiography. The aim of image quality optimisation is to reach the necessary quality with the lowest possible dose. The following concept shows the strategy for optimization and quality assurance in digital radiography. 1. Optimisation: Optimal postprocessing is not independent from the dose range. Therefore the necessity exist to optimise the quality depending on the dose and the clinical situation. 2. Objectivation: A strategy for quality management can be performed for each kind of examination in different centres. Afterwards the result will be objectivated by phantom exposures. 3. Standardisation: The range of results, which corresponds to a sufficient image quality, will be defined by these reference centres; and for an unknown equipment image quality can be determined by evaluation of similar phantom exposures. Dose and quality management means, that in a broad range the dose and quality can be optimized and adapted to the clinical question. For the future optimisation, objectivation and standardization will be necessary in the framework of European quality assurance programs like \"SENTINEL\". With the advent of modern therapeutic procedures such as functional sinus surgery (FSS), sectional imaging modalities have assumed major importance in diagnosis as well as treatment planning, especially in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases such as maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinusitis. Today treatment planning is done with a CT examination, which affords maximum spatial resolution for defining key bony structures and aerated spaces. Several pathologic entities including inflammatory processes, benign or malignant tumors lead to the unspecific symptom of nasal obstruction. In general, disturbances of the epithelium in acute and chronic sinusitis lead to mucus retention and possible superinfection. In problem cases such as chronic inflammation or complete paranasal sinus obstruction, MR imaging makes an excellent adjunct for differentiating inflammatory and neoplastic processes. The understanding of normal anatomy, anatomical variations and physiology within the nasal cavity, the paranasal sinuses and its adjacent structures is a prerequisite for the radiological diagnosis of sinus disease. It will help to determine the location and nature of the ostiomeatal obstruction in sinusitis and is necessary for accurate tumor staging in the paranasal region. The role of different imaging techniques will be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn the normal anatomy and anatomical variations of the paranasal sinuses. 2. To understand the state of the art imaging technique in the paranasal region. 3. To review the most common imaging findings in patients with nasal obstruction. 4. To review typical radiologic features of benign and malignant tumors. 5. To recognize CT and MR appearance of chronic sinusitis. The typical imaging appearance of mucocele, sinonasal polyposis, and post-surgical infection will be presented. ",

In recent clinical trials, these modalities have been used not only to refine our subject inclusion/exclusion criteria but also to evaluate whether a drug has reached the target organ and whether it has produced the desired biological effect. During this session we will present a series of recent examples where imaging has dramatically improved our understanding of the underlying neurobiological deficit in a range of psychiatric indications. The psychiatric conditions that will be reviewed include developmental disorders, schizophrenia, addiction, depression and dementia. Some examples where imaging has helped to facilitate the translation of pre-clinical disease models to the clinical environment will also be discussed. Whilst the use of MRI techniques has become a cornerstone of the neurology clinic, the application of such methods in psychiatry was rather limited until the advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Functional MRI has, over the past decade, superseded radionuclide imaging techniques and blossomed into a widely used psychiatric research tool. This presentation will review the neurobiological findings from FMRI research in a wide range of less well documented psychiatric disorders. Despite the disparity in earlier findings, greater standardisation of image acquisition, analysis, paradigms and improved clinical classification is leading to greater convergence in observations from different laboratories. FMRI is also beginning to realise its potential as an important mediator between genes and phenes and may thus contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of major neuropsychiatric diseases. The role of FMRI in the objective assessment of therapeutic intervention and early prediction of response to treatment is also discussed. Learning Objectives: 1.

The revealed metabolites depend on the nucleus chosen for MRS; most studies focus on proton MRS and its major metabolite, N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). NAA is a neuronal viability marker and has been found to be reduced in various brain regions in a number of psychiatric disorders, drug abuse, and personality disorders. More recently, NAA reduction was also seen in healthy subjects carrying genes predisposing to such disorders. The underlying pathology explaining NAA reduction includes neurodevelopmental disorders, acquired neurodegeneration or toxicity leading to neuronal cell loss or reduced neuronal density. There is some controversy about the regional specificity of the findings, whether they predate the disease onset and to what degree they may reflect medication status, comorbidity, phenotypic subtypes, genotypic predisposition or morphometric variation. Careful control of such factors and adequate power is required to yield reliable answers to these remaining issues. Recent advances in data acquisition and processing, in particular the availability of field strengths \u2265 3 Tesla enable the assessment of amino acids such as glutamate, glutamine and GABA. These metabolites are of particular pathobiologic interest in psychiatric diseases as they may reveal focally altered neurotransmission. Specific patterns related to hypoglutamatergic or altered GABAergic transmission, have been identified in major depression, schizophrenia and panic disorders. This emerging application of high field neurospectroscopy shows also promise to predicting and possibly monitoring therapeutic responses. To be an adequate partner for thoracic surgeons and pulmonologists, the radiologist must be familiar with the principles of operations for lung resection. They vary widely, from a small pneumotomy for enucleation of a benign peripheral tumor to a radical pneumonectomy. Some complications my be anticipated, whereas others are purely random. To minimize them, radiologists play an important role in the postoperative care and have to know more than the two clinical adages, that \"pneumonectomy is greater than the sum of its parts\" and that \"pneumonectomy itself is a disease\". The three major complications during the operation are injury to a major vessel, cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial ischemia, and the development of a contralateral pneumothorax. More important for radiologist are the postoperative appearances and complications. In the early group hemorrhagic, cardiac (herniation, tamponade, ischemia, shunt), pulmonary (postpneumonectomy pulmonary edema, atelectasis, torsion, pneumonia, air leak, and fistula), pleural (persistent residual spaces, effusion, empyema, chylothorax), esophageal, and neurologic (injury to intrathoracic nerves, spinal cord injury) complications are important and possibly life threatening. Late complications to be familiar with are the postpneumonectomy syndrome and superimposed late infections.",

Small infants are most often shaken while larger infants are more often submitted to shaken/ impact injury. The resulting brain damage is devastating. The infant presents with most non-specific symptoms, making the clinical diagnosis of abuse extremely difficult. The repeated accelerations and decelerations and rotations associated with repeated shaking of a small baby will cause venous haemorrhage into the subdural space, a very important marker indicating that the baby has been shaken. Repeated instances of abuse will cause haemorrhages of different ages. The same treatment will also cause tearing injuries seen in the white/grey matter interface, often with small haemorrhages as well as retinal haemorrhages. Hypoxic/ischaemic brain injury added upon the tearing injuries aggravates brain oedema. The finding of subdural haemorrhages, brain oedema and retinal bleeds in combination mean child abuse is the only clinically reasonable diagnosis. The most important method used to diagnose abuse of infants is CT-scanning. It is an effective way of showing subdural haemorrhage and can give an indication of the age of the haemorrhage. MR imaging has a superior sensitivity in detecting collections of haemorrhage in the subdural space. It has a superior ability to demonstrate brain injury.

            "text": "Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is increase in ventricular size due to an imbalance between the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its drainage by the arachnoid villi. The result is increased intracranial pressure. Three major mechanisms account for the development of hydrocephalus. The first mechanism is obstruction to CSF flow, which is usually secondary to conditions such as a congenital stenosis/web of the aqueductus Sylvii, inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, meningitis, granulomatous infiltrations, blood clot, and various tumors. The second mechanism is decreased absorption of CSF by arachnoid villi, which is seen in subarachnoid and intraventricular bleeding, inflammatory conditions, and tumoral seeding to subarachnoid spaces. The third mechanism is the overproduction of CSF, unique to infants and young children and caused by choroid plexus papillomas and carcinomas. While congenital anomalies, infections and hemorrhagic insults are leading causes in newborns and infants, infections and tumors are more common in older age groups. Hydrocephalus may be classified on the basis of the level of obstruction as communicating (extraventricular) or noncommunicating (intraventricular) hydrocephalus. The situation might be compensated or noncompensated depending on the presence of transependymal CSF migration. All of the above will be discussed during the lecture with their corresponding neuroimaging findings, including antenatal and postnatal transcranial ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and advanced techniques. Differential diagnoses for neuroimaging findings and for age groups, as well as neuroimaging findings following therapeutic shunting operations, with their complications, will be discussed briefly as well. The role of liver resection for benign and malignant liver diseases is expanding because of the markedly reduced operative mortality in recent years, improved surgical techniques, and better perioperative management. Development of local ablative therapies for liver tumors, such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation, is posing a competition to liver resection. However, such techniques also have allowed expansion of indication for hepatic resection to patients with bilobar tumors, where one lobe is resected and small neoplasms in the other lobe are treated with RF ablation.",

Strict cooperation between surgeons and interventional radiologists is mandatory in order to select patients who will benefit from combined procedures. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has demonstrated a good local efficacy for small hepatic tumors. However many reports underlined the difficulties to achieved complete ablation of tumors larger than 30 to 35 mm or when tumor are smaller but in contact with large hepatic vessels. Angiographically-assisted tumor ablation has been used to try to overcome these difficulties in ablation. Vascular occlusion of the inflow or the outflow to the tumor will decrease perfusion mediated tissue cooling due to tumor tissue microperfusion and thus allows larger volumes of ablation. In clinical practice, percutaneous arterial embolization or venous occlusion could be used according to the type of tumor treated. Pringle maneuver during peri-operative RFA produce the same effect. Vascular occlusion of a large vessel in contact with a tumor will avoid \"heat sink effect\" due to convective cooling of the tumor portion close to the large vessels. Experimental studies have demonstrated that any vessel 3 mm or larger can induce incomplete ablation and clinical series have demonstrated that presence or absence of a peritumoral vessel 3 mm or larger, is an independent predictor of treatment outcome. We demonstrated that vascular occlusion of this vessel can improve RF ablation outcome. In a similar manner, vascular occlusion has been used to improve outcome of renal ablation by increasing the volume of ablation. More recently, experimental work demonstrated that bronchial occlusion during RF increases the volume of ablation by decreasing both air flow and also blood flow. Capabilities for local tumor control are rapidly advancing, especially to minimal invasive procedures and thus inducing a change within the working environment. In particular, navigational aid is requested in order to minimize trauma to collateral tissue.",

Rizzatto; Gorizia/IT (grizzatto@libero.it) Major breakthrough to help radiologists in breast US is mostly linked to the increasing computing capability of new systems and their digital scans. CAD applications use sophisticated image analysis scheme and advanced decision engine to help differentiate benign and malignant lesions. They may integrate a variety of features such as automated segmentation, characterization, classification, annotation and report generation. Elastographic score is a new feature, easy and quick to be integrated with all other US and imaging signs. Adequate patterns are obtained in over 96% of all patients. Significant increase in diagnostic accuracy is obtained mainly in BI-RADS\u2122 3 and 4. Real time sonoelastography significantly reduces the biopsy rate in cystic lesions and may suggest appropriate intervention for malignancies with less typical basic features. Perfusion ultrasound with continuous low mechanical index and contrast agents may add useful information in: 1. Advanced cancers treated preoperatively and receptor positive cancers in elderly patients. Perfusion shows changes in vascular clusters and kinetics that are predictive for outcome parameters and are earlier detectable than volume reduction. 2. Patients with metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor foci mostly result in a lack of perfusion; smallest detected lesions are 3 mm. Sentinel node procedure may be saved in 25% of patients. Positive cases are straight scheduled for axillary dissection; the use of operating room is maximized. Multi-modality \"fusion\" breast imaging systems are developed to co-register different modalities (US, MR imaging, mammography, optical imaging) to increase both the sensitivity to breast cancer and to maximize the procedures performed under US guidance. Cross-sectional imaging (MR and CT) has improved dramatically over the last few years, and will have an important impact on the imaging protocols of many congenital heart diseases. In particular, the creation of 3D anatomical images, which can be interpreted by all, is extremely useful for making diagnoses and planning treatment.",

For the correct staging of patients with multiple myeloma sensitive detection is mandatory in order to estimate prognosis and to decide for adequate therapy. MR imaging is superior to radiography for both, focal and diffuse involvement. With parallel imaging and special coil devices, such as total imaging matrix (TIM-Siemens) a screening of the whole red bone marrow cavity for myeloma infiltration is possible within a reasonable time. Patients without bone marrow infiltration have a significantly longer survival than patients with bone marrow infiltration in MR imaging at the time of diagnosis. However, even in stage I disease (Durie & Salmon) and negative X-ray films bone marrow infiltration in MR imaging may be detected in 29-50% of patients. Those patients typically show an earlier disease progression. Recently, MR imaging has been implemented in the clinical staging of patients with multiple myeloma. MR imaging may also monitor response to therapy. Signs of good response in cases with focal involvement include reduction of signal intensity on T2-weighted spin echo images, lack of rim-like enhancement after contrast material injection or even a normalisation of bone marrow signal. In case of diffuse involvement a partly patchy reconversion to fatty marrow can be seen. Learning Objectives:",

However, this test is associated with a small but significant risk of complications, patient and operator are exposed to ionizing radiation, the test is expensive, and patient discomfort has to be considered. While coronary CTA is a very powerful method that is thought to replace X-ray coronary angiography in part, there is still the issue of X-ray exposure and nephrotoxic contrast agents while complementary information about the coronary vessel wall and coronary flow may not easily be obtained. Therefore, coronary magnetic resonance imaging is an alternative that has to be considered. Using MR imaging, the coronary lumen blood pool, the coronary vessel wall, contrast agent uptake in the coronary vessel wall, and coronary flow can be investigated and quantified. Furthermore, multicenter experience exists for coronary MRA while first results are still expected for CTA. However, coronary MR imaging is technically very challenging. A high spatial resolution, substantial volumetric coverage and a high contrast between the coronary lumen blood-pool and the surrounding tissue is mandatory while substantive extrinsic and intrinsic cardiac motion has to be suppressed. With contemporary MR imaging hardware, software, methodology, contrast agents, and high magnetic field strength, these issues are being addressed and first patient studies look very promising. In particular, the use of contrast agents for the characterization of coronary atherosclerosis is a rapidly evolving area of research. -Pre-operative in non-coronary surgery to screen the patients without CAD.",

Becker; Munich/DE (christoph.becker@med.uni-muenchen.de) Vulnerable plaques may rupture when exposed to shear stress and the thrombogenic lipid material may enter the bloodstream. In the most unfortunate event, thrombus progression may turn the vulnerable plaques into culprit lesions that occlude the coronary vessels, leading to myocardial ischemia, ventricular fibrillation and death. In the initial stages of atherosclerosis, the coronary vessel widens at the location of the atherosclerotic plaques. The phenomenon is called \"positive remodelling\" and explains why such plaques may not be seen by cardiac catheter. Non-fatal plaque rupture or erosion at end stage may heal, organize and subsequently calcify. Fibro-calcified lesions may reduce vessel lumen diameter (negative remodelling) with consecutive reduction of blood flow and myocardial ischemia. Only CT and MR imaging may have the ability to non-invasively assess the extent of the atherosclerotic plaque burden in the coronary arteries. MR imaging is superior to CT in terms of soft tissue differentiation. However, CT is currently superior to MR imaging in terms of spatial and temporal resolution to image the small and constantly moving structures such as the coronary arteries. The entire extent of coronary atherosclerosis with calcified and non-calcified Knowledge and understanding of the advantages and drawbacks of current radiological techniques is essential to establish the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy, a factor that will avoid redundant information and unnecessary risk and inconvenience to the patient.

The former technique has its advocates but is operator dependent and it is difficult to compare serial examinations. MR imaging with predetermined protocols allows for accurate assessment of the surgical site and easy comparison of serial scans. There are limitations to the use of MR imaging in the early post-operative period. The fundamental feature suggestive of tumour recurrence is the identification of high signal intensity on T2-weighted or STIR images with mass-effect. Post-operative complications which may also be associated with high signal intensity, with or without mass-effect, will be discussed as will the role of paramagnetic contrast medium. Finally, the potential of diffusion weighted MR imaging and PET scanning will be covered. Female pelvic pain is extremely common and has a huge social and economic impact. Its diagnostic and therapeutic assessment remains difficult, given the variety of possible causes. Diagnostic imaging plays a key role along with clinical examination. Imaging modalities are essentially US and MR imaging. In many cases they will be used along with, or instead of, diagnostic laparoscopy. New techniques have recently emerged, driven by radiologists and aimed at relieving pelvic pain by treating specific causes of pelvic pain. Embolization of pelvic and ovarian varices is an established treatment for pelvic congestion syndrome, uterine arterial embolization to treat uterine myomata is now a recognized alternative to myomectomy or hysterectomy. Embolization of uterine arteries in the treatment of pain caused by adenomyosis is an emerging technique, with results that are promising but in need of further assessment. ",

Results -adjustments can be then used as a feed back to referring doctors, on exposure factor changes, patient handling on projections and on examination method changes. Learning Objective: 1. To explain the advantages and benefits of systematic self-assessement on the whole imaging protocol process. Increased use of mammography and population screening means that many cancers now present when small with good survival. Current treatments are also improving the survival of larger lesions. This means that relative survival for the best prognostic groups is approaching 100% at both 5 and 10 years. The conventional prognostic indices (using size, grade and node status) break down and fail to identify the small numbers that still \"inexplicably die\" from breast cancer. After all, 95% survival still means 5% mortality. Is the presence of microcalcification a better prognostic indicator for small cancers? Is screening itself an independent factor or are we just over-diagnosing? It is clear that both ultrasound and MR imaging are better than conventional X-ray mammography at detecting both multi-focality and bilateral cancer, but this is at the risk of too many false positives. There is always the possibility that by detecting sub-clinical disease we are advising over aggressive surgery. This could also be true for distant staging, as currently there is limited evidence that detection of metastasis at a pre-clinical stage alters outcome and can, of course, lead to inappropriate use of aggressive treatment. In this talk I will review the evidence, but the answers are far from clear. Perhaps treatment needs to be re-thought. Our challenge is to identify the small number of women who presently lie in the good and moderate prognostic groups, who would benefit from intensive diagnosis and treatment, as opposed to the majority who perhaps just suffer. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand factors affecting breast cancer survival, specifically relating to small cancers. 2. To review indications for different imaging modalities in local and distant staging of nonpalpable breast cancer. 3. To re-assess current treatment paradigms in the light of improved survival.",

A proposal for a large research infrastructure in imaging has been forwarded to the expert group, making the ESFRI initiative relevant for diagnostic radiology.Learning Objectives: 1. To comprehend the concept of research infrastructure. 2. To learn about the ESFRI, The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructure. 3. To become familiar with the new concept of research infrastructure in radiology in Europe. How can EU policy influence development in fundamental research? H. Pero, J.-E. Faure; Brussels/BE (Jean-Emmanuel.Faure@cec.eu.int) The European Council identifies knowledge and innovation as a major priority for delivering on the goals linked with European future competitiveness. It also recognises that research is the main driver for the production and exploitation of knowledge, and that research, technology, education and innovation hold the key to Europe's future in many respects. The Community Framework Research Programme (FP7), in its non-nuclear part, will be composed of four main Specific Programmes, each with a clear objective: Co-operation; Ideas; People and Capacities. It is within this last programme, Capacities, that Research Infrastructure actions will play a fundamental role. Adequate research infrastructures (RIs) are indeed essential to promote technological innovation by offering the necessary conditions and the critical mass to carry out cutting edge research. Enabled by information and communication technology, recent concepts of infrastructure are also expanding providing an enormous cumulative value as repositories of fundamental knowledge in many disciplines. A policy on RIs at European level provides therefore added value by pooling talent, maximising resources, and generating a strategic vision for research in the European Research Area. Funding the construction of new RIs affects the direction of research for many years. Therefore, it is vital to define priorities well, which will enable the funding of the most important projects needed in the next ten to twenty years. This should be based on a global vision where the European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) will play an important role. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand better the EU policy for research. 2. To realise the role of research infrastructures to support top-level scientific research. 3. To stimulate reflection on the European roadmap for research infrastructures. A. Urothelial tumors N.C. Cowan; Oxford/UK (nigel.cowan@nds.ox.ac.uk)Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) allows fast acquisition of thin slices for large body volumes. Single breath-hold acquisition & faster table speeds reduces movement artefact. Thinner slices allow reduction in pixel size with improvement in spatial resolution. By adjustment of image matrix, reconstructed FOV and pixel size, isotropic voxels may be reconstructed providing the opportunity for 3D imaging techniques to be applied. The principle indication for MSCT urography is the detection of urothelial tumours, which present most commonly with haematuria or more rarely with unexplained hydronephrosis. Correct timing of the acquired series is critical and is usually between 10-15 minutes post-injection of contrast medium. 2-series acquisition is possible using a split-bolus technique for administration of contrast medium. The effective dose for 2-series MSCT urography is ~11.5 mSv compared with 2.5 mSv for intravenous urography (IVU). For MSCT urography the risk of fatal cancer induction is calculated as 1 in 1,400 and for IVU 1.7600. It is important to restrict MSCT urography for appropriate population groups at high risk of cancer.MSCT signs for urothelial tumours are of a papillary or polypoid mass sometimes with invasion of adjacent structures. Circumferential wall thickening is a lesser-known CT sign. MSCT urography visualizes the entire urinary tract, which is an advantage for the detection of urothelial cancer, a multifocal process. Small tumours may be identified throughout the entire upper urinary tract and also within the bladder. Wide windowing is essential. MSCT urography compares favourably with other imaging modalities for the detection of urothelial cancer. Learning Objectives:1. To optimise the use of MSCT for the investigation of urothelial tumors. 2. To review the radiological signs of urothelial tumors using MSCT. 3. To illustrate the diagnostic pitfalls of using MSCT for the investigation of urothelial tumors. 4. To compare the use of MSCT for the investigation of urothelial tumors with other imaging modalities.

Sittek; Munich/DE (harald.sittek@med.uni-muenchen.de)Minimally-invasive needle biopsies are well established as a diagnostic tool in the diagnostic workup of breast cancer and can be performed most accurately under stereotactic, sonographic and MR imaging control. The most appropriate method to choose for the localization is the imaging modality where the target lesion is most conspicuous and best visualized. If a suspect mammographic lesion can equally well be identified with ultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy will be more convenient, comfortable to the patient and cheaper. Microcalcification is to be biopsied under stereotactic control since stereotaxy provides the most accurate results in these cases. Lesions which are only delineated on MR imaging and do not show corresponding pathology on ultrasound or mammography should be biopsied under MR imaging guidance. To perform MR imaging guided biopsy, distinct technical equipment and a high level of operator expertise are required. MR imaging controlled interventions and stereotactic biopsies for microcalcifications should be performed as vacuum biopsies (VCB\u2264 11G). These interventional needles provide a higher output and a larger amount of diagnostically relevant tissue specimen for the histo-pathologic assessment. Ultrasound-guided interventions may be performed most precisely using large core biopsy needles (LCB\u2264 14G). As LCB are considerably cheaper than VCB, they are preferable for ultrasound-guided biopsies while VCB should be reserved for special cases.It is most recommendable to correlate all histo-pathologic results from minimally invasive needle biopsies with their respective imaging. If the imaging does not correspond to the histo-pathologic results, a second biopsy or even an open surgical biopsy are indispensable to avoid false negative results.Learning Objectives: 1.

To describe the diagnostic approach on percutaneous biopsies and management issues (ADH, lobular neoplasia, papillary lesions, radial scars and flat epithlieal atypia spectrum). Several interventional techniques can be used in the management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. CT and US are the modalities of choice for diagnostic needle aspirations and percutaneous drainage of fluid collections. Diagnostic needle aspiration is performed to distinguish infected from noninfected collections. A pancreatic abscess may be drained percutaneously, while infected necrosis often requires surgical debridement. Initially, pseudocysts can be left untreated since approximately 50-60% resolve spontaneously, while infected pseudocysts (abscesses) must be drained. Small, noninfected pseudocysts can be observed safely provided that they are monitored carefully and are not enlarging. Intervention is mandatory in the presence of symptoms or complications such as obstruction or infection. Drainage of pseudocysts can be accomplished by percutaneous pseudocysto-gastrostomy. Primary complications of percutaneous drainage include introduction of secondary infection, occlusion or displacement of the catheter, cellulitis at the site of entry, and accidental injury to other abdominal organs, such as the spleen. In chronic pancreatitis, image-guided biopsy may be performed to distinguish chronic inflammation from pancreatic cancer.

The differentiation of empyema from lung abscess can generally be accomplished by chest X-ray alone but in some cases CT is required to aid in this distinction. However chest X-ray and CT alone cannot definitely confirm the presence or absence of pleural infection. Clinical findings are important in raising the possibility of infection. Similar to any thoracic fluid collections, pleural infections can be aspirated or drained percutaneously under imaging guidance. Increased safety and effectiveness compared to blind techniques have been largely demonstrated. Diagnostic fluid aspiration includes cytological, bacteriological and chemical analyses. Confirmation of malignant cells, exudative fluid, blood, lymph, bile, amylase, clear fluid or gross pus give aetiological information. Indications for drainage depend on the evolutionary stage of empyema. Fluoroscopy, US and CT can be used as guidance modalities, either alone or in combination. The choice of imaging technique depends on technical characteristics, availability, location of the collection, and operator expertise.

MR imaging for the detection of bony metastases when compared to MDCT. The direct display of bone marrow components is the major advantage of MR imaging. Bone marrow infiltrates are imaged before osteoclastic or osteoblastic activities occur. The lower sensitivity of MDCT is worse in cases of homogeneous diffuse infiltration. However, both methods show a high specificity. The major advantage of MDCT is to show the extent of the ossesous destructions, the determination of fracture risk and planning of surgery. Indications for whole body MR imaging are multiple myeloma and other primaries with a suspicion of bony metastases. MDCT should be performed in multiple myeloma in cases with definite infiltrates in MR imaging to determine the bony destructions in order to plan further therapies such as radiation, vertebroplasty and surgery. X-ray diagnostics can be completely replaced in multiple myeloma. Due to the high sensitivity of MR imaging for the detection of bone marrow changes, the determination of benign differential diagnoses is utmost important. Learning Objectives:1.

Hypoxic, traumatic, toxic, or hypoglycaemic brain injuries, metabolic diseases, neuro degenerative diseases, or systemic diseases such as hepatic encephalopathy are typical pathologies with diffuse brain abnormalities calling for MRS. In focal brain diseases MRS should be considered in abscess versus cystic necrotic tumor, differential diagnosis of lesions in HIV+ patients, recurrent tumor versus necrosis, tumor classification, guide for tumor biopsies, and lesions of unknown etiology. Procedure Details: The concentrations of the metabolites which MRS can detect in the human brain are typically between 1mM and 20mM. N-acetylaspartate, total creatine, total choline, myo-inositol, glutamate, glutamine, lactate, glucose, and lipid are the most prominent detectable metabolites. It is possible to quantify the metabolites and obtain a coefficient of variance between 5% and 18%, this however requires attention to methodological detail. It is crucial to know how to obtain good S/N and high resolution. Positioning and size of the selected volume, shimming, TE and TR, and even minor patient movement become important factors. Conclusion: High quality and precise MRS results require a basic understanding of underlying methods including spatial selection methods, water suppression, shimming and how to acquire high S/N spectra. The rewards are low coefficient of variance, artefact-free spectra, and thereby the possibility to provide data that influences clinical decision making for individual patients.

Lammer; Vienna/AT Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) are most commonly due to atherosclerosis. Stentgrafts have a self expandable stent-structure covered by a polyester or eP-TFE fabric. For TAA tube grafts are used. Femoral arteriotomy is required. The stentgraft is placed under fluoroscopic control over an extrastiff guidewire in a LAO 60\u00b0 position.

Aortic dissection has a high mortality rate in the acute stage due to rupture. Medical and surgical therapy reduced the one-year mortality rate in Stanford A dissections to 48-68% and to 15-30 % in Stanford B dissections. Imaging must provide the following information:\u2022 Localization of entry tear \u2022 Distal extension \u2022 Classification \u2022 Side branch involvement, organ malperfusion In Stanford A dissections aortic regurgitation and coronary artery involvement has to be ruled out.

In interventional therapy of Stanford B dissections, the aim is occlusion of the entry tear with decompression, collapse, thrombosis of the false lumen and true lumen expansion.

Patel 2 ; 1 Cambridge, MA/US, 2 Philadelphia, PA/US Background: Radiology is poised to make the most innovative and important change in medical education since the establishment of residency and fellowship programs in the early 20 th century. For the first time, one specialty has the opportunity to revolutionize the way we learn and at the same time, make medical care safer for our patients. This change will come through the adoption of medical simulation during the early learning phase of every physician. In America, the RSNA, the American Board of Radiology, and the Society of Interventional Radiology have joined together to create a new educational framework for interventional training. The effort includes representation from CIRSE. This new curriculum will integrate medical simulators that include educational content, visual images, catheter-guidewire interaction with the vasculature, and therapeutic devices while simultaneously measuring performance during a variety of procedures. This lecture will present the background to this development, outline the available simulators and then focus on EVE, a new system for training all interventional radiologists in catheter-based stroke prevention and treatment. Conclusions: For the first time, an entire medical specialty has made a decision to integrate the most modern learning methods into its physician's lifelong practice. With input from American and European practicing radiologists, researchers, educators and the leaders of the specialty, we have the opportunity to set the standard that other specialties will follow. Learning Objectives:1. To understand the design requirements for effective medical simulation. 2. To learn the role being considered for simulation by American Board of Radiology, the RSNA, and the Society of Interventional Radiology. 3. To understand the role simulation can play in radiology education in new procedures.Interventional radiology -quo vadis? F.S. Keller; Portland, OR/US (kellerf@ohsu.edu)Interventional radiology (IR) as a subspecialty began in 1964. During IRs first four decades many new tools and techniques were developed and successfully introduced into clinical practice. Presently IR is a mature subspecialty of diagnostic radiology. CIRSE and SIR are strong societies in Europe and the United States. There is a close-knit worldwide IR community. IR procedures are used for diagnosis and intervention in virtually all body organs and systems. In addition, many new or recently developed therapies have potential to benefit large numbers of patients and augur a bright future for IR. Despite this encouraging picture, there are many combined threats to IR that, if not properly addressed and corrected, can lead to its demise. These include an increasing number of turf battles with other specialties resulting in loss of procedures, stagnant IR training, a profound lack of identity and public recognition of what IR is and poor support and representation for IR within diagnostic radiology departments, both academic and private. IR is at a crossroads; a critical juncture. Its future depends on the choices we make today. IR can either stay a viable strong subspecialty within diagnostic radiology or be swallowed up by other medical specialties. Actions to ensure IRs future include incorporation of clinical patient care into current IR practices, changing to a clinically oriented training program, improving public recognition of IR and modifying IRs relationship with diagnostic radiology.Learning Objectives: 1. To understand how IR developed; where IR is now and the current the current problems and challenges to IRs future growth and success. 2. To learn the importance of established IR practices becoming more clinically oriented and of changing IR training programs to incorporate more clinical training. 3. To comprehend the total lack of public perception and recognition of IR and what steps need to be taken to improve IRs public image. 4. To appreciate changes that need to be made in the relationship between diagnostic radiology and IR to ensure that IR remains a strong, viable subspecialty within diagnostic radiology.Radiology in Singapore: From gene to screen",

Accumulating evidence has documented the superiority of multimodal MR imaging (DW, PW and MRA) over CT for proper selection of hyperacute stroke patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapy. However, because of its availability and the time constraints involved in stroke evaluation, CT is still the first-imaging technique used in most centers. Advanced CT techniques such as perfusion-CT and CTA can provide important information that may help in therapeutic decision-making in a way similar to multimodal MR imaging, and should be considered an option when MR imaging is not available or cannot be performed.In recent years, there has been great interest in the use of noninvasive imaging modalities for diagnosing internal carotid artery stenosis. Although it is accepted that DUS should be the screening tool for detecting carotid stenosis, there is no consensus as to the need and type of additional confirmatory tests required.Although contrast-enhanced MRA is considered a better option than CTA for this purpose, CTA is counterattacking, mainly because of its higher resolution and the widespread accessibility of multislice CT units.",

            "text": "Although pulmonary infections are the commonest complications seen in nonpulmonary allograft recipients, other complications may also occur including perioperative complications, neoplastic disorders such as posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and other malignancies, drug induced lung disease, hepatopulmonary syndrome (liver transplantation) and pulmonary calcification (kidney transplantation). The aim of this lecture is to summarize the high-resolution CT findings of some of the most common infectious and non-infectious complications seen in this group of patients. Although accurate clinical information is essential to narrow the differential diagnosis, it is often still impossible to determine the cause of parenchymal abnormalities. Combination of pattern recogni-tion with knowledge of the clinical setting is the best diagnostic approach. A specific pattern of involvement can help suggest a likely diagnosis in many instances. Learning Objectives:1. To discuss some of the commonest complications associated with non-pulmonary allograft transplantation. 2. To emphasize the role of HRCT in the diagnosis of these complications. 3 . To understand the spectrum of CT manifestations according to different clinical and immune status of the recipients. Perfusion imaging by bolus tracking is carried out using dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging, recording passage of a rapidly injected paramagnetic Gd based chelate by a T 2 (spin echo-SE) or T 2 * weighted (gradient echo-GE) sequencemost often EPI. GE-EPI using 0.1 mmol/kg of standard Gd chelate is generally used. SE-EPI requires twice the contrast agent to create similar signal losses during first pass to GE EPI, with the advantage of less image distortion in e.g. frontal areas (cf. dementia). Upon rapid (5 ml/sec) injection into an antecubital vein (flushed immediately by 20 ml saline at the same rate), the bolus is followed for about 1 minute with high temporal resolution (TR = 1.5 second or faster) in 10-29 slices. Relative Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) is determined as the area under the tissue concentration time curves C (t) (C (t) \u221d -log (S (t)/S (t 0 )) where S (t) is the signal intensity at time t and S (t 0 ) the baseline signal intensity before the contrast bolus). C t depends on Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and the arterial concentration C a through the relation C t (t)=CBF C a (t)\u2297R (t), where R (t) is the residue function (describing the fractional retention of tracer in the vasculature) and \u2297 denotes convolution. CBF is determined from this equation by deconvolution, yielding CBF R (t) from the experimental data. CBF is the height of the resulting curve. Deconvolution by singular value decomposition (SVD) yields reasonably accurate CBF estimates even at the SNR of pixel-by-pixel clinical EPI measurements. Finally, blood Mean Transit Time is determined from the relation MTT=CBV/CBF. The major disadvantage of the original SVD approach is a tendency to underestimate flow when tissue tracer arrival is delayed or dispersed relative to the arterial input function. The talk will discuss approaches to address and partly circumvent these problems. Learning Objectives:1. To understand the problems and merits of the most common imaging techniques in perfusion imaging. 2. To discuss necessary features for imaging protocols. Livers may be obtained either from cadaveric donors or from living donors. Pretransplantation imaging assessment plays a crucial role both in patients on the waiting list and in liver donors. The role of imaging in patients on the waiting list is mainly to detect vascular abnormalities which can contraindicate the liver transplantation or change the surgical techniques. The most important is the presence of portal vein thrombosis or sclerosis which is observed in about 10 %. The role of imaging in liver donors in vascular and biliary assessment is to select the patients in order to minimize mortality and morbidity in both donors and recipients. Therefore knowledge of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy is mandatory. We will review the most common vascular and biliary variants, and discuss the one which are crucial for surgical planning. The role of the different imaging modalities: Doppler sonography, CT and MR imaging will be discussed as well as relative or absolute exclusion criteria which depend in part on the expertise and experience of the operating transplant surgeons. Although two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated short-term benefits of EVAR over open repair, the technique is not generally accepted. Adding to that problem, follow-up reports of the same two randomized trials do not show the same mid-term benefits. Nevertheless, the technique is evolving rapidly. Not only are stentgrafts becoming easier to use, but surgeons and radiologists have passed the learning curve of this technique. Therefore, results should improve and the number of late complications should diminish. It is clear that patient and graft selection is the key to success. The pre-operative work-up, including stent-graft choice tailored to the patients' anatomy, and preoperative measurement will be discussed. Choice of anesthesia should be made together with the anesthesist, based on the patients' risk profile and preference. Follow-up is mandatory! The different options will be discussed and our simple but effective follow-up scheme presented. Endoleaks and other potential complications such as migration should be detected at an early stage, and treated or carefully monitored. Finally we will discuss EVAR in emergency cases. This calls for well organized teamwork, but also for a regional approach. Logistical key-words are the availability of a spiral CT-scanner, an experienced on-call team and a stock of devices. Permissive hypotension and local anesthesia are the keys to success, to keep the patient stable enough to undergo the procedure. In our opinion, EVAR is a valid alternative to open surgery but the future will have to determine in which patients EVAR is the treatment of choice. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is an established treatment alternative to open surgery. However, standard EVAR requires a suitable aneurysm neck. This precludes the use of EVAR for juxtarenal AAAs with too short an aneurysm neck, i.e., less than 15 mm in length. Fenestrated stent-grafts (SG) are a further step in the development of EVAR by extending the SG across the renal arteries while preserving their patency, and thus achieving a haemostatic seal also in juxtarenal AAAs. Initial results applying this new technique have been encouraging. Operative mortality in these patients at high operative risk has been in an acceptable range of 3% to 6.5%. Immediate patency of target vessels has also been acceptable with a loss of arteries less than 3%. During follow-up there has been a tendency reported for development of stenoses in the stented renal arteries, which may necessitate PTA at a rate of 6%. The frequency of type I endoleaks has been 1%. The main limitations of fenestrated EVAR are anatomical, with unsuitable aneurysm necks, target arteries that are difficult to catheterize, and vessel tortuosity. Improvement of SG technology with reinforcement with nitinol rings around the fenestrations has facilitated catheterization and improved target vessel patency. Further improvements with indwelling catheters and guidewires are underway. Imaging planning using multislice CT is equally essential for the next step of development of this technique. This would include the use of fenestrated SG for an even higher number of AAAs, including thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Imaging of renal artery stenosis (RAS) requires a comprehensive assessment of the morphologic degree of stenosis, the impact on renal function and the differentiation of any underlying renoparenchymal disease. Conventionally, these diagnostic questions have been partially addressed by the use of a multi-step imaging algorithm including digital subtraction angiography (DSA), renal scintigraphy and duplex ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) holds the potentially to combine morphologic and functional information within a single exam using high-resolution 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography (3D-CE-MRA), phase-contrast flow measurements (PC-flow), time-resolved perfusion measurements (TR-perfusion), blood oxygen dependent measurements of R2* (BOLD-R2*) and diffusion weighted MR-imaging (DW-MRI). 3D-CE-MRA with isotropic sub-millimetre spatial resolution allows grading of the area stenosis with good correlation to intravascular ultrasound. PC-flow allows accurate assessment of the hemodynamic significance of a stenosis. TR-perfusion and DW-MRI can detect and differentiate various causes of underlying renal parenchymal disease. This is of particular importance in the case of impaired renal function without the presence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis. BOLD-R2* allows assessment of impairment of medullary blood flow in diabetic nephropathy under functional stress. The introduction of ultra small particle iron oxide contrast (USPIO) agents offers the possibility to directly image and differentiate inflammatory changes of the kidney, e.g. in the case of glomerulonephritis. Clinical examples for the use of this comprehensive MR imaging algorithm include assessment of RAS prior to intervention, differentiation between RAS and causes of primary parenchymal diseases such as chronic rejection in transplant patients, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the basic technical principles of renal flow and perfusion measurements using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. 2. To assess the value of a comprehensive morphologic und functional MR imaging exam for grading of renal artery stenosis and follow-up after interventional therapy. 3. To compare the functional MR imaging techniques to current reference methods such as scintigraphy, DSA and intravascular ultrasound. 4. To demonstrate the value of these MR imaging techniques for assessment of renal parenchymal disease in hypertensive patients.",

            "text": "B. Urinary obstruction J.-N. Dacher 1 , N. Marouteau 1 , C. Lefort 2 , C. Pfister 1 , P. Vera 1 ; 1 Rouen/FR, 2 Paris/FR (Jean-Nicolas.Dacher@chu-rouen.fr)Aim: This course is an overview of MR imaging capabilities in diagnosing urinary tract obstruction. We limited the field to congenital obstruction. Background: As compared with isotopic studies and X-ray techniques, MR offers several advantages. It is a radiation free technique, which uses a non toxic, low dose of gadolinium chelate. The main limitation of MR is the absence of linearity between gadolinium concentration and the amount of signal. This drawback can be limited by using low doses of contrast medium and diuretics. Procedure Details: MR capabilities in showing the anatomy of the kidneys, its vessels and the urinary tract have been extensively described and received validation. T2-weighted or enhanced 3D GE T1-weighted images can be used so that MR can now replace intravenous urography. The split renal function can be inferred from the R/L ratio of functional renal parenchyma volume, obtained by segmenting dynamic enhanced GE T1-weighted images covering the entire kidneys. Another possible approach is a comparative analysis of the area under the signal-time curve of the renal parenchyma. Absolute estimation of single kidney GFR is ongoing research. The analysis of the excretory function can be inferred from several regions of interest drawn around the whole kidney including the pelvis or the only excretory system. The time of transit on 3D imaging can also be an elegant means to evaluate the degree of obstruction.A B C D E F G Conclusion: MR imaging provides a non invasive approach of imaging congenital obstruction which offers the unique advantage of combining morphological and functional studies. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the advantages and limitations of functional MR in patients with urinary tract obstruction (as compared with nuclear medicine studies). 2. To understand how to optimize the linearity of the relationship between gadolinium concentration and signal intensity. 3. To know the optimal timing and dosage of lasix and gadolinium chelate. 4 . To know how to analyze the dynamic enhanced T1-weighted sequence (in terms of split renal function, in terms of excretion).A-322 C. Nephropathies N. Grenier; Bordeaux/FR (nicolas.grenier@chu-bordeaux.fr)Acute and chronic nephropathies are responsible for morphological and functional renal changes. However today radiological techniques play a minor role in imaging of parenchymal nephropathies, in native or in transplanted kidneys. On a morphological point of view, 3D magnetic resonance (MR) volumetric biomarkers of kidney function, as renal and cortical volume or cystic volume, for polycystic kidney diseases, play a growing role in nephrology practice, mainly for prognosis and for evaluation of new medical therapies. On a functional point of view, if scintigraphic techniques remain the major sources of renal performance assessment, new developments in MR imaging systems, providing higher signal-to-noise ratio and higher spatial and/or temporal resolution and in specific MR contrast agents for obtaining functional information on tissue characteristics relevant for various renal diseases. They both have the potential to drive new opportunities to provide significant developments, in the near future, in the evaluation of renal performance (assessment of differential renal function, quantification of glomerular filtration rate), in the search for prognostic factors (medullary hypoxia, intrarenal inflammation, tubular cell viability, degree of tubular dysfunction and development of interstitial fibrosis) and for monitoring new cell therapies. In this course, we will review the various presentations and the work-up of intestinal obstructions and pseudo-obstructions in the neonate. The importance of antenatal detection and transmission of obstetrical ultrasound findings will be stressed as well. A systematic approach to the differential diagnosis will be proposed. It is based on ultrasound, plain film of the abdomen and bowel opacification.Indications and contraindications of bowel opacifications will be detailed. The audience will be also familiarized with less frequent diagnosis of bowel obstruction and pseudo-obstruction in the neonate. Despite improvements in obstetric and paediatric practice and a major decline in neonatal death rate, neonatal asphyxia remains a significant problem. Hypoxia/ischaemia is a significant cause of neurological damage arising in the pre and perinatal periods. Term infants with hypoxia/ischaemic brain injury have a better prognosis than the preterm infant. The pattern of brain damage depends on the maturity of the brain at the time of the insult, the severity of the insult and the duration of the damaging event. Selective vulnerability occurs in different parts of the brain depending on the gestational age. MR imaging techniques allow accurate detection of the site of the lesion and pattern of damage. This is not only important for timing for the medico-legal environment but also for the understanding of the different aetiologies and future interventions.Large prospective studies with consecutive scans and post-mortem data if appropriate will allow assessment of the newer novel MR techniques. Close collaboration of clinicians and radiologists is essential to obtain an accurate clinical history and examination findings to ensure any patterns of damage are appropriately attributed to the suspected aetiology. The ongoing TOBY trial to look at the impact of cooling the asphyxiated neonate has allowed us to image more of these neonates than normal and the difference between the two groups -cooled or not cooled will also be discussed. Singapore is a small country of 4.2 million people with relatively few radiologists (25 per million). In this session our aim is to demonstrate the wide range of radiology techniques, procedures and services, as well as research provided in our country. By investing in technology we try to stay on the cutting edge of radiology, as well as improve the productivity of radiologists. The theme \"Gene to Screen\" includes lectures from our younger radiologists that range from benchtop scientific research, to include our experience with using the new developments available with 3 T MR imaging, interventional angiographic techniques for peripheral arterial disease, as well as our experience with starting a national breast screening programme using the best practices from different countries. Learning Objectives: 1. To introduce the wide range of radiological activities and procedures provided in a small Asian country. 2. To understand the quality and level of radiology practices in a country with a relative shortage of radiologists.",

It occurs in response to vessel injury after virtually any form of manipulation of a blood vessel, including angioplasty, stent placement or bypass graft insertion and is the main limiting factor of long term success of these therapies. Neo-intimal hyperplasia (NIH) is a major component of re-stenosis and results from vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation into the intima, followed by extracellular matrix formation. There has been extensive research to develop strategies to prevent re-stenosis. These include the use of radiation, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferation and anti-cancer drugs as well as gene therapy. Although there have been successful reports of using gene therapy to inhibit NIH in animal models, the genetics of NIH remain poorly understood. We have performed gene expression studies of NIH using the rat carotid artery re-stenosis model as well as in defunct human dialysis arteriovenous grafts using oligonucleotide microarray technology. Findings from these studies will be presented and potential applications of the genetic information gathered will be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1.

Lim; Singapore/SG (tchoyoson_lim@nni.com.sg)Despite the importance of cerebral tissue perfusion in human health and disease, the available methods of assessment are limited. Conventional X-ray angiography and ultrasonography do not adequately assess tissue microvascular perfusion, and stable xenon computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are disadvantaged by their lack of availability for widespread clinical use. Researchers in Singapore have developed and refined magnetic resonance (MR, including arterial spin labelling at 3 Tesla) and computed tomography (CT) techniques that hold promise as non-invasive methods to study functional cerebral perfusion. This presentation will focus on how these advanced techniques of physiological imaging are being developed and used in research and clinical practice in Singapore. It will include examples of ischemic perfusion in intracranial atherosclerotic occlusion, complex collateral perfusion and tumor vascularity. Physiological imaging using new CT and MR methods has the potential to be a quantitative method to stratify stroke risk and plan treatment in cerebral disease. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the role of CT and MR to measure functional cerebral tissue perfusion. 2. To comprehend the physiological parameters of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and mean transit time in research and clinical practice. 3.

Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) due to diabetic angiopathy is a common problem and almost invariably is a result of occlusive tibial arterial disease. With the application of coronary equipment and techniques to treat small vessel occlusions, limb salvage using endovascular techniques is now a viable treatment option. The aims of treatment have therefore evolved over recent years from primary major amputation to that of limb salvage using a combination of angioplasty, bypass surgery and medical treatment. Angioplasty, being less invasive and having few clinically significant sequelae in instances of failure, is now regarded as the first intervention of choice, rather than bypass surgery, whenever duplex ultrasound shows that arterial reconstruction is possible. In February 2005, a national registry was formed of all patients undergoing femoral-popliteal and infra-popliteal angioplasty for the purposes of limb salvage for critical limb ischemia. It is the intent of this paper to review the techniques used, short to medium clinical results and complications encountered using angioplasty for limb salvage in critical limb ischemia. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the role of interventional radiology in the treatment of critical limb ischemia. 2. To determine the short to medium efficacy of endoluminal techniques in terms of limb salvage for critical limb ischemia.",

Wang; Singapore/SG (dnrwsc@nus.edu.sg)Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in Singapore women, who have the highest incidence of breast cancer in Asia. In January 2002, the National Breast Screening Programme (BreastScreen Singapore, BSS) was launched. This is the only government-funded Asian breast screening programme. Women aged 50-64 are invited biannually, and women aged 40-49 may participate annually. Four-view film-screen mammograms are centrally dual-read with third reader arbitration. Screening is to the point of diagnosis.There are some unique aspects to BSS: 1. Singapore is an Asian island city-state with 4 million residents and 3 major racial groups. A national ID and Cancer Registry are in place. 2. BSS is the only co-payment breast screening programme in the world. 3. All data pertaining to BSS are entered live into a national web-based database by end-users. This enables better service and data analysis than a manual paper system. Imaging of articular cartilage has assumed increased importance because of the prevalence of cartilage injury and degeneration as well as the development of new surgical and pharmacologic techniques to treat damaged cartilage. This lecture will review relevant aspects of the structure and biochemistry of cartilage that are important for understanding imaging of cartilage and cartilage lesions, and describe optimal imaging techniques for its evaluation. Although plain radiography still has a role to play in advanced osteoarthritis, CT-arthrography and MR imaging are the most important techniques for preoperative evaluation of degenerative, traumatic and inflammatory cartilage lesions. The value of these techniques, including qualitative and quantitative post-processing techniques, will be discussed. Normal and pathologic imaging findings in cartilage and subchondral bone will be demonstrated and a grading system for assessment of cartilage lesions will be explained. Guidelines for optimal preoperative evaluation of cartilage will be proposed. Autologous osteochondral transplantation is an articular resurfacing technique in which cylinders of autologous bone with overlying hyaline cartilage are cored from non-weight-bearing areas of the knee (donor site) and transferred into similarly sized cored holes created within the cartilage defect to be treated (recipient site). It is a one-stage procedure performed in patients with a symptomatic fullthickness focal chondral or osteochondral defect between 1 and 2 cm. MR imaging as a non-invasive technique is the method of choice in the follow-up of patients with osteochondral autografts. MR should be performed with cartilage sensitive sequences such as fat-suppressed PD/T2-FSE or 3D GRE sequences, which provide good SNR and CNR. High spatial resolution is mandatory as it allows a better visualization of graft morphology, in particular for the evaluation of graft integration to the adjacent hyaline cartilage and bone. MR imaging also helps to evaluate the status of the subchondral bone, the thickness of the cartilage cover, the congruity of the articular surface as well as the status of the graft donor site. Osseous incorporation within 6-14 weeks, resolution of subchondral bone marrow edema and a persistent congruity of the articular surface at the repair site represent a normal development of the osteochondral autografts over time.A recent development of isotropic 3D sequences will further improve the visualization of osteochondral autografts from different planes and views including virtual arthroscopy. Recent advances in biochemical imaging such as contrastenhanced T1 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging allow a functional analysis of the graft cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is one of the comparatively new cartilage repair techniques. It is a two stage surgery process based on harvest of cartilage in a first session and subsequent chondrocyte culturing. In a second session, the defect is prepared by debridement and covered by e.g. a periosteal flap, and the chondrocyte suspension is injected into the defect.After an initial proliferative (6 weeks) and an transitional phase (6 months), the repair tissue undergoes remodelling (up to 3 years). The resulting repair tissue usually is a mixture of fibrous and cartilaginous components. Indications for the ACI procedure comprise cartilage defects of 3 to 12 cm\u00b2 size. Good clinical results are described, predominantly for patients without major concomitant degenerative changes, for follow-up periods of 1 to 3, sometimes up to 9 years. The main complications are repair tissue hypertrophy and graft delamination, mostly occurring within the first 3 to 12 months and graft failure (fragmentation). According to available data, outcome seems to be better for the femoral condyles, followed by the patella in contrast to less promising results for the tibiae. The role of pre-OP MR imaging is in demonstrating defect, defect size and concomitant alterations contributing to establish the indication for ACI. Post-OP, to date, MR imaging has mainly been used to identify complications. Criteria for evaluation are: Thickness, integration, smoothness of surface of the graft and graft signal intensity. Persistent BMEP in the surroundings of the graft and underlying, newly developed cysts are potentially indicative of a problematic graft. Until recently brain imaging had been used almost exclusively to aid in the diagnosis of individual patients in order to guide therapeutic decisions. However, in the past few years, we have experienced an ever increasing effort to broaden the scope of this technology to address issues of mental ill health. We are now making a concerted effort to refine many of these medical imaging techniques in order to improve the assessment and development of treatments for psychiatric disorders. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the major cornerstones of brain imaging, are both playing For most of the above mentioned complications typical findings on plain films and chest CTs will be demonstrated, especially with regard to differential diagnoses. This is important because the possible synchronous and metachronous permutations of multiple problems are myriad. Thus, careful attention to the combination of frequent radiographic, laboratory, and clinical data is mandatory. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss briefly different lung surgery procedures and their special peculiarities. 2. To summarize the radiological appearances of more or less typical side effects and complications. 3. To become familiar with differential diagnoses and diagnostic workflow.A-347 B. The irradiated lung G.R. Ferretti; Grenoble/FR (gferretti@chu-grenoble.fr) Radiation-induced lung injury is a frequent complication in the treatment of patients with malignancies of the lung, breast, or esophagus, lymphomas and mediastinal neoplasms. Thoracic changes are mainly related to the total dose, the radiation portals as well as the volume of irradiation. In the vast majority of cases, lung damage is limited to the field of irradiation. Lung injuries are divided into 3 pathologic phases: an exudative phase, an organizing or proliferative phase, and a chronic fibrotic phase. Radiation pneumonitis usually occurs 4-12 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Fibrous changes take 6-24 months to evolve but usually remain stable after 2 years. The differential diagnosis includes radiation pneumonitis, local recurrence, lymphangitic spread of tumor, and infections. CT is more sensitive than chest X-ray in demonstrating radiation-induced changes. Radiation therapy may also induce tracheobronchial disorders, thymic calcification, pericarditis, vessel thrombosis, and parietal changes. In this presentation, we discuss and illustrate the characteristic radiologic features of radiation-induced thoracic diseases and association with radiation methods. Learning Objectives:1. To correlate the pathologic findings with the imaging appearance in radiation pneumonitis. 2. To show the most familiar presentations of radiation lung injury according to the delay between imaging and radiation injury. 3. To present the unusual complications associated with radiation therapy of the lung.",

            "text": "C. Drug-induced lung diseases C. Schaefer-Prokop; Amsterdam/NL (c.m.schaefer@amc.uva.nl)Many cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drugs (e.g. antibiotics, anti-arrhythmic drugs, anti-rheumatic drugs, etc.) potentially induce lung disease. The prevalence of drug induced lung disease is likely to be considerably underestimated in clinical practice. Dependent on the pathological mechanism and course, acute and chronic lung diseases can be differentiated. Mostly, the diagnosis is rather difficult because clinical symptoms and morphologic findings are non-specific. They may simulate the findings seen in the lung after radiation, caused by an infection or mimic the pulmonary lesions of the underlying disease. Thus diagnosis must be multidisciplinary approach in which imaging play an important role. A prompt diagnosis is important, since continuation of the medication and thus of the lung injury may cause irreversible parenchymal damage with a fatal course at the worst. Cessation of the medication and appropriate therapy, however, mostly yield rapid improvement. Congenital lesions of the brain is a vast chapter, including: Congenital malformations, congenital infections, inborn errors of metabolism, brain destruction acquired in utero.Malformations are described by embryological timing and include neural tube defects, disorders of diverticulation (holoprosencephaly spectrum, cystic malformations of the posterior fossa), commissural agenesis, malformations of cortical development that can involve cellular multiplication, differentiation, migration and organization. Malformations also include extracerebral cysts and vascular malformations. Although brain malformations are characterized by specific anatomical features, MR imaging features can change across time along with brain maturational changes, especially in cases of malformation of cortical development, and in midline lipomas. The most common congenital infections are CMV and toxoplasmosis, resulting in malformations and destructive lesions. Neonatal herpes encephalitis is less frequent and highly destructive. Inborn errors of metabolism can be encountered in utero and in neonates, the most frequent seen being mitochondrial cytopathies that rarely display basal ganglia involvement (until the first year of life) compared to older children. Some metabolic disease are also known to give brain malformations (i.e. corpus callosum agenenis in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency). Other metabolic disease are known to lead to brain damage similar to cerebral lesions of hypoxic-ischemic origin. Brain destruction acquired in utero of hypoxic origin can be encountered postnatally, especially in the neonatal period as stroke, necrosis. Acute events one to several days before birth also happen leading to brain damage, sometimes difficult to differentiate from cerebral damage that has taken place pernatally. The management of major GI bleeding is problematic. A proportion of patients require emergency surgery which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous embolotherapy, previously considered a high risk procedure, may provide an alternative treatment in this group of patients. We will assess the safety and efficacy of embolotherapy in the treatment of life threatening GI haemorrhage and to consider indications and techniques. Detection of a bleeding site correlates with haemodynamic stability at the time of angiography (r = 1 for a systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg). Embolotherapy for life threatening haemorrhage is an effective, relatively safe procedure with a low incidence of major complications. Its use depends on the identification of a focal bleeding point or vascular abnormality, which in turn depends on the haemodynamic stability of the patient at the time of angiography. Interventional radiology plays in increasing role in the treatment of trauma related hemorrhage. Catheter based embolization is currently a first choice option in many large trauma centers. To treat these patients it is essential to have an opti-mal infrastructure, preferably with focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) and CT options in the trauma room and full hemodynamic monitoring. Trauma embolization is to treat acute hemorrhage and or prevent late hemorrhage. Indications for treatment are increasing hematoma, parenchymal organ trauma, false aneurysms and contrast extravasation (CE). CE especially has a high predictive value for failure of conservative treatment. Patients with CE, even if they are stable should always be sent for angiography with subsequent embolization. Both safety and efficacy of trauma embolization have been proved to be very high in the larger studies. Embolization materials used are coils, gelfoam or in special circumstances a covered stent. The main goal of a screening test for cancer is to reduce the cancer-related deaths. The cancer must be common and curable and the screening test must detect it in a preclinical stage. Many other conditions are required, including a low falsepositive rate, a low false-negative rate, being harmless and low cost. Currently, mammography remains the only screening test that has been shown to improve survival from breast cancer. Standardized mammographic techniques, quality assurance procedures and standardized interpretation criteria are applied in several countries. However, debates continue regarding the effectiveness of detecting ductal carcinoma in situ, especially in older women. In addition, sensitivity of mammography decreases dramatically in dense breasts, less to 48%.Recently, several studies reported the value of whole breast ultrasound, subsequent to mammography in dense breasts. More than 90% of cancers detected only with ultrasound, were invasive carcinoma with an average size less than 1 cm and have been stage 0 or 1. The benefit from a screening test is optimal in these cases. However, none of these studies had the sonographic operator blinded to the mammogram, so ultrasound should not be considered as an independent screening tool. A protocol developed by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network studying screening breast ultrasound in high-risk women is in progress. Sonograms and mammograms will be independently read. Ultrasound requires no ionizing radiation, no breast discomfort but depends on the operator and equipment, so that standardized technique and interpretation criteria are required. The histological heterogeneity of breast cancer is well recognised. Pathologically however lesions are categorised according to the predominance of histological features. In Tabar's series of breast cancers, distribution of tumours showed a predominance of invasive ductal -no special type (65%). The remaining 35% of breast cancers comprise.-DCIS 10-15% -Invasive lobular 10-13% -Tubular 68% -Medullary 2% -Mucinous (colloid) 2% -Other 2%Common indications for cardiovascular MR in children with congenital heart disease include: Complex congenital heart disease in neonates and infants (for three-dimensional overview of cardiac and vascular anatomy), Cyanotic defects with diminutive pulmonary arteries (for assessment of pulmonary artery anatomy and aorto-pulmonary collaterals), Anomalies of the aorta (coarctation, interrupted arch), before and after intervention, Patients with right ventricular conduits (for assessment of pulmonary valve regurgitation, pulmonary artery stenosis and right ventricular function).

To review the common indications for cardiac MR imaging in congenital heart disease. 3. To suggest a basic imaging protocol for morphologic and functional cardiovascular evaluation.",

Gassner; Innsbruck/AT (i.gassner@uibk.ac.at) Vascular rings (complete encirclement of the trachea and the esophagus) and slings (incomplete encirclement) may present with respiratory distress in the neonate or stridor and/or dysphagia in the older child. A wide variety of vascular rings and slings can occur, but the two groups of greatest clinical significance are those involving the aortic arch and the pulmonary artery sling. The aim of the lecture is to understand the embryology and pathology of these anomalies, to recognize their radiological presentations and to show how to exclude a vascular ring or sling reliably by ultrasound. When familiar with three important scans, one can definitely document normal anatomy and exclude malformations using sonographic examination only. First -document a left-sided aortic arch that gives rise to three main vessels and thus exclude a right aortic arch and a double aortic arch. Second -document a normal pulmonary artery bifurcation and thus exclude a pulmonary artery sling and anomalies of the proximal pulmonary arteries. Third -document either normal branching of the right innominate artery or three main vessels leaving the aortic arch with the first being the largest and thus exclude an aberrant right subclavian artery. This assessment won't take any longer than esophagography. CT or MR imaging should be reserved for imaging of a present anomaly. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the embryology and pathology of aortic arch and pulmonary artery anomalies. 2. To recognise the radiological presentations including plain chest X-ray of vascular rings as well as anomalies of the pulmonary arteries. 3. To get familiar with the ultrasound examination of these vascular anomalies. 4. To show the angiographic and MR imaging appearance of these anomalies. 5. To describe how to exclude in case of stridor a vascular ring or sling reliably by ultrasound. Early detection using mammography is the most effective diagnostic modality in breast cancer. Mammography has evolved from direct to digital X-ray in the past century; from chemicals to detectors. Moreover, the departments have had to change their configuration to face the new challenges. There are two methods to obtain mammography images: Indirect and direct. Indirect process includes all the methods using light as the intermediate step, to obtain the image: Screen-film, computed radiography and the indirect-conversion digital detector. Direct-conversion digital detectors use photoconductor amorphous selenium which absorbs X-ray photons and directly generates the signal, obtaining a digital image.The new scenario combines IT technologies and clinical skills. Daily work needs competences in networking, PACS and DICOM applications, RIS environment, CAD integration and pre and post-processing abilities to provide full advantages of digital imaging. These methods improve patient management, providing additional time for care during the examination. This is more evident in screening population. Radiographer's mechanical work is reduced technology as complexity increases, requiring ability in IT and an increase in their responsibility. Close work-up with the radiologist, understanding, evaluating and checking the images, is crucial in the diagnostic process. Take home points Digital mammography provides more information that can be processed by the human naked eye and represents a quantum leap in diagnostic imaging in breast diseases.The new technological environment is a reality today and radiographers should be ready for it. Emerging skills are necessary to face the new professional challenges. Processing of medical images has become a powerful tool for exploiting the full range of possibilities that the new imaging modalities offer, with ultimate goal to deliver high quality images to the observing physicians. The ability of imaging professionals to take advantage of this new digital environment is of crucial importance, since it has been shown that computerized processing of medical images essentially improves understanding, detection, and treatment of diseases. This course details the fundamental principles of digital image processing techniques (including image enhancement, and restoration), while explaining how imaging professionals can manipulate these techniques for desirable visualization results. The possibility of improving image interpretation by the combination of quantitative (using digital image analysis methods) and qualitative (observer evaluation) information will be discussed. Clinical applications, in which these methods have been introduced or might be useful, will be reported along with visual examples.

            "text": "A The potential benefit of multislice CT (MSCT) depends on the appropriate selection of patients. Benefits based on accurate detection or exclusion of disease are appropriate treatment decisions such as starting, continuing, discontinuing or even withholding specific treatment, or additional diagnostic procedures. Decisions on proper indications for MSCT are even more relevant considering the radiation risk factor. Because the accuracy of diagnostic tests is not perfect, the second type of risk is an erroneous treatment decision based on an erroneous test result. The third type of risk is direct complication of the test itself, for MSCT these are predominantly adverse effects related to contrast agents. The balance between benefits and risks of MSCT should be in favour of the benefits. Justification of MSCT deserves special attention since recent technical progress caused an increase of the number of MSCT examinations and an expansion of the clinical indications for MSCT. Differences between the volumes of imaging tests, including MSCT, in European countries is large. This reflects in differences in mortality attributable to diagnostic X-ray imaging and demonstrates that there is ample room for improving appropriate use of imaging, including MSCT. Appropriateness criteria such as those published by the American College of Radiologists and the Royal College of Radiologists in the U.K. serve as guidelines for the physician. Decision trees can be used to describe optimal patient flow through the diagnostic process. To resolve remaining problems further research, including meta-analysis and prospective studies, is required. As an introduction the technical basis of MSCT will be reviewed briefly. The most important component is the detector which typically allows simultaneous scanning of 4 to 64 slices in current MSCT scanners. In general, the geometric efficiency decreases and the collimation efficiency may increase as the detector pixel pitch becomes finer and the number of detector rows increases. The respective aspects are illustrated and discussed in detail. The X-ray source, the inherent and added filtration, the reconstruction algorithms can also influence dose efficiency; the respective factors will be reviewed. Patient dose levels in MSCT can be assessed quite accurately today based on tabulations or based on scanner-and patient-specific calculations. Typical values range between 1 to 20 mSv per examination. The parameters which affect patient dose are above all the scan volume, the chosen X-ray parameter settings, and to some degree the reconstruction algorithm. It is important to scan with parameters which allow maximum resolution, but to consider reconstructions with lower spatial resolution to limit pixel noise. The respective dependence of spatial resolution and image noise will be explained and demonstrated interactively. Low-contrast detectability and soft tissue differentiation, the prime objectives in most CT examinations, are affected by image noise and contrast characteristics. The influence of the spectrum on contrast and on low-contrast detectability will be explained and demonstrated. ",

            "text": "Since the introduction of the first MDCT system, the technology has been continuously refined. Work on 248-row detectors and other systems are in progress, which may improve scan speed and/or resolution. Both, speed and resolution are important factors in pediatric imaging. However, a major disadvantage of MDCT scanning is the high radiation. Using unfavourable scanning parameters, exposure dose is substantially increased compared to single-slice scanning. Using low-dose technique in children and slim patients is an excellent method to reduce radiation exposure. Individual dose modulation and overlapping reconstructions provide a so-called \"secondary raw-data set\" which can be used for further image reconstructions. This technique includes low examination dose, low image noise, and the possibilities of multiplanar reconstruction, CT angiography and even virtual bronchoscopy. New software programs have been introduced, which enable tube current modulation according a predefined noise level along the zaxis. With this software, a dose reduction is possible in adults and children. If the dose reduction software is not available, it is still possible to reduce radiation dose based on the parameters given by the scanner software and depending on the clinical questions. Furthermore, there are several programs available, which help to estimate the doses or the CTDI of different imaging protocols in different scanners. However, the most sufficient way to protect the patient from radiation exposure is to use radiation-free techniques. The use of CT should be restricted to those who really need it. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn how to develop low-dose protocols for pediatric MDCT of the chest and the abdomen. 2. To understand how image noise affects the image quality of low-dose scans. 3. To understand which impact the field of view has on image resolution. 4. To learn how to improve image quality of low-dose scans using to post processing techniques. 5. To learn how to reconstruct secondary raw data sets replacing original raw data sets which need large storage capacity in order to enable further 3D reformations.14:00 In some patients this technique may also be the final examination. The addition of colour and pulsed Doppler sonography has contributed to assessing tumour involvement of vascular structures such as the portal and mesenteric system. However, a sonographic diagnosis of suspected pancreatic disease depends on patient-related factors and is not always straightforward. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) eliminates the problem of overlying bowel gas and allows for focussed high-resolution imaging. This technique is well suited to detect vascular invasion and EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy can further increase the diagnostic accuracy in pancreatic cancer. When compared to US the performance of computed tomography (CT) is less operator-and patient-dependent. The value of helical CT in the management of acute pancreatitis and pre-operative staging of pancreatic neoplasms is well established. Moreover, multislice helical CT using narrow collimation and thin slices, provides excellent spatial resolution and three-dimensional reconstructions showing all relevant anatomical information.Due to the introduction of (ultra)-fast MR sequences and the development of new tissue specific contrast agents, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may currently be as accurate as spiral CT for depicting inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic disease. Moreover MR imaging has the advantage of allowing simultaneous investigation of the pancreatic duct, pancreatic parenchyma and peripancreatic vessels (\"all-in-one\"). In other words MR imaging can provide all information required to differentiate resectable from unresectable tumours. Exact pretherapeutical imaging is mandatory for optimal treatment of pancreatic malignancies. This course should provide information for staging and detecting of pancreatic disease. The focus will be on chronic inflammatory disease of the pancreas, which is sometimes difficult to differentiate from early pancreatic cancer and also on pancreatic tumors, that have very low attenuation difference to the normal pancreatic tissue. The course will also provide specific imaging features to identify these lesions on CT. Due to the development of treatment modalities based on thrombolysis, ischemic stroke is now accepted as a treatable medical emergency. In order to successfully begin therapy within the therapeutic window, neuroimaging can provide information based on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols. Once haemorrhage has been excluded, it is important to assess the extent of potentially reversible and/or irreversible tissue damage: CT will show areas of less attenuation whereas MR imaging with diffusion weighted imaging will demonstrate the presence of cytotoxic edema; additional information about the hemodynamics of the ischemic region can be provided by both perfusion-CT and MR imaging techniques; these can help to define the presence of a potential penumbra or tissue at risk that constitutes the target for therapy. Additionally it is important also to assess the status of the intra and extra-cranial vasculature; this can be done by both angio-CT and angio-MR techniques; one should be able to assess the vasculature from the aortic arch up to the circle of Willis in order to demonstrate the presence or absence of stenotic and/or occlusive lesions, both proximally and distally. These protocols must be very fast so as to allow treatment to be started within the therapeutic window with safety; at the moment CT technology allows the fastest imaging with perfusion and angiographic data sets being acquirable in a few minutes. The same protocols need to be repeated in order to assess the effect of therapy. Although hemorrhagic strokes account for only 10-15% of all strokes, they have a very high mortality rate. The main two subcategories of hemorrhagic stroke include intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The most common imaging modalities for diagnosing and determining the cause of hemorrhagic stroke are CT, MR imaging and conventional cerebral angiography. CT remains the modality of choice in the acute setting of stroke to confirm or exclude a recent intracranial bleed, in addition to its advantages of availability and relatively easy interpretation. The current advances in multislice CT also allow accurate visualization of the intracranial vessels by CT-angiography and a rather efficient assessment of cerebral perfusion state in ischemic changes. Continuous progress in MR imaging made some authors suggest that susceptibility-MR imaging sequences are more sensitive than CT in diagnosing cerebral parenchymal hemorrhage, especially microbleeds. Diffusion MR imaging has been reported to show diffusion changes in recent hematomas. Perfusion MR imaging measurements have been used in the search for a perihemorrhagic penumbra. In cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the FLAIR sequence was reported to have a similar or even higher sensitivity than CT in the acute setting, becoming clearly superior in the subacute phase of SAH. The main limitations for MR imaging remain the technical and logistical considerations. Although being an invasive technique, conventional cerebral angiography is still the gold standard for imaging the intracranial vessels, determining flow characteristics, assessing aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations and performing intravascular interventions. The pericardium has an outer fibrous layer and an inner serous layer which surrounds the heart and contains approximately 10-20 mls of serous fluid called the pericardial fluid. The presence of this fluid reduces the friction between the beating heart and other tissues. The pericardial attachments maintain the heart in its correct position in the thoracic cavity despite respiratory motion and body posture. Acute pericarditis may be a result of a variety of causes, the most common of which is viral pericarditis which accounts for more than 10% of cases; however pericarditis can be due to bacteria, uraemia, neoplasms, hypothyroidism and myocardial infarction and many other clinical syndromes. Acute pericarditis has a characteristic presentation resulting in chest pain which is relieved by sitting forward and made worse by lying down. The ECG changes in acute pericarditis are also characteristic with 'saddle shaped' ST changes. A pericardial rub can also commonly be heard. Pericardial effusion is diagnosed by a number of modalities; however the most common modality is ultrasound. Acute pericarditis can result in cardiac tamponade which is a cardiac emergency. This is best diagnosed on ultrasound where the appearance is characteristic with a collapsing right heart appearance, and is treated by pericardial drainage. Chronic pericarditis can be caused by acute pericarditis. The most serious effect of chronic pericarditis is pericardial constriction which may be caused by tuberculosis, rheumatoid disease, sarcoidosis and trauma. Chronic pericarditis is better diagnosed by CT and MR imaging where the appearance of thickened pericardium is characteristic. Normal pericardium is seen on advanced computed tomographic images as a thin line of soft tissue density between mediastinal and subepicardial fat from the pars diaphragmatica till the superior junction line. Because of its anatomy and functional tasks it appears in front of the right heart a little bit thicker than along the left heart. Similar appearance is visualized by MR using various sequences. Pericarditis: Any thickening of the pericardium above 2-3 mm suggest the presence of an acute inflammatory process if smooth and chronic if irregular. Pericardial effusion: In case of enlargement of the pericardial space above 5 mm it is possible by analysis of the CT values and/or of the MR signal intensities to distinguish between solid, liquid, semi-liquid and haemorrhagic processes. Constrictive pericardial disease: The term \"constrictive pericardial disease\" is applied to inflammatory or non-inflammatory disorders that involve one or both layers of the pericardium and lead to constriction and compression of the underlying cardiac chambers. It is characterized by scarring and/or calcification of the peri-and/or epicardium which thereby looses its compliance and restricts the diastolic filling of the heart. Morphologic diagnostic patterns: -Thickening and/or calcification of the periepicardium -Narrowing of one or both ventricles -Enlargement of one or both atria -Narrowing of one or both atrio-ventricular grooves -Enlargement of the diameters of the inferior and superior caval veins. Functional diagnostic patterns:-Restrictive filling of one or both ventricles -Decreased flow in the caval and pulmonary veins -Paradoxical septal movement. Learning Objectives:1. To review aetiological classification. 2. To review patho-physiology and clinical symptoms. 3. To discuss the diagnostic possibilities of CT and MR.Cardiac imaging has greatly improved over recent years. This has led to increased utility of advanced imaging methods, such as MR imaging and multidetector row CT. Primary cardiac neoplasms are rare, accounting for less than 0.3% of autopsies. Of the primary benign tumors, myxoma, myoma and fibroma are the most common. The primary malignant tumors are mostly sarcoma (a few lymphomas will primarily affect the heart). Metastases to the heart are 30-fold more common, with melanoma, lung cancer, breast cancer and leukemia the most frequent causes. Echocardiography is by far the most common test to detect a cardiac tumor. Often, this is sufficient for further management. However, CT and MR imaging offer approaches that include better tissue characterization, evaluation of surrounding structures and even functional information. This presentation will focus on the various aspects of neoplastic (peri) cardiac diseases, including occurrence, imaging findings and pathological correlation. The preliminary study of a patient with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is Doppler US. This technique enables the functional evaluation of the stenosis, thus allowing the determination of its hemodynamic significance. The morphologic assessment of the plaque, based on the gray scale evaluation, allows the identification of those symptomatic patients which, although they have normal peak systolic flow at US Doppler, have plaque with a high embolic risk. These patients are further evaluated using MR imaging with dedicated coils. All patients considered for endovascular treatment undergo an agio-MR imaging examination in order to confirm the morphologic results and to visualize the aortic arch to plan the procedure.In patients presenting with contraindications to MR imaging, these evaluations are performed with a VCT examination which also allows the use of post-processing programs like AVA and VR. The combined study of plaque morphology, using the gray scale method and MR imaging with dedicated coils, allows the selection of the most suitable protection device for each patient (block flow, filter device). Selective angiography is performed at the beginning and at the end of the procedure to visualize the intracranial vessels. The comparison of the images obtained may help in the identification of intraprocedural embolic events.In case of intraprocedural complications, a diffusion and a perfusion weighted MR imaging examination is performed to assess the presence of eventual ischemic lesions. Follow-up is performed with Doppler US, eventually integrated by agio-VCT examination in case of in-stent neointimal hyperplasia. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss which imaging is needed for patient selection. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is becoming accepted as a treatment option. The major concern expressed when comparing CAS with traditional carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been the generation of embolic particles during CAS.There are a number of methods for the prevention of emboli, including technique, case selection, drug therapy, dedicated stent systems and cerebral protection devices.There are three basic philosophies of cerebral protection device. The first was balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery. Subsequently internal carotid filters were developed, and more recently internal carotid artery blood flow stasis or reversal. Devices utilising all of these methods are available, with CE marks. The benefits and drawbacks will be discussed. Whichever device is selected for consideration, each adds a further step to the procedure. Evidence exists that indicates that the systems are all effective in vitro, and there is further evidence that such devices reduce the complications of CAS. However the introduction of these devices has occurred at the same time as other advances in CAS, it is not clear what are the relative contributions of each of these advances. In addition there are data which indicate that CAS, without the use of protection devices, carries an embolic risk profile similar to CEA. This raises the question as to whether they should always be used, and if they cannot should CAS not be attempted? Most practitioners routinely plan to use a cerebral protection device, but circumstances mitigating against their use does not necessarily mean that CAS should not be attempted. Magnetic rsonance agiography represents an attractive method for evaluating blood vessels without use of iodinated contrast material, ionizing radiation or catheterization. Current protocols rely on contrast-enhanced techniques almost exclusively. Although CEMRA adds a minor degree of invasiveness to the technique, the gadolinium-based contrast agents are not nephrotoxic, a substantial benefit over iodinated contrast agents and therefore also over CTA. With CE-MRA, spatial resolution remains suboptimal, however, published literature reports satisfactory accuracy compared to catheter angiography. Currently, virtually all medium-sized and large arteries can be evaluated with CE-MRA, more recently small arteries (e.g. spinal arteries and bronchial arteries) have been successfully imaged. The spatial limitation of poor head-foot coverage for the peripheral arteries has been overcome by moving-table technology (three overlapping coronal acquisitions for the peripheral arteries), more recently this has been extended to the whole body MRA (5 overlapping FOVs).With improved scanner speed, use of parallel imaging, superior coil technology and partial k-space sampling strategies both temporal resolution and spatial resolution can be markedly improved.Most of the artefacts and pitfalls are related to errors in technique and interpretation. A robust technique and strategies to minimize or eliminate errors will be presented.The role of new contrast agents, including blood pool agents will be discussed. This presentation will also discuss the role of non-contrast MRA (e.g. fresh blood and steady-state imaging) which has been the subject of renewed enthusiasm in recent years. Although offering benefit over CE methods, these approaches have not yet gained a foothold in clinical practice. A-392 C. Vascular sonography: New developments and directions T. Jargiello; Lublin/PL (tojarg@hotmail.com) Vascular Doppler US has improved its technical features and possible diagnostic applications through the last 5 years, until it became the most frequently used modality for vascular diagnosis in 1990s. Progress was achieved not only from an increased sensitivity of colour imaging techniques but also great improvement in B-mode scanning, particularly harmonic imaging and other software such as X-beam technique. In practice, this means that visualization of deeper placed vascular structures (for example in obese patients) is not impossible anymore. Introduction of US contrast agents was another forward step in Doppler diagnosis. Its use in evaluation of abdominal and peripheral vessels improved the diagnostic value of non-invasive Doppler examinations. Diagnostic specificity of celiac trunk, SMA and renal artery imaging rose respectively from 40% to 80%, from 60-100% and from 50 to 90%. In other peripheral vessels its role is not so distinctive but it is also helpful to assess problematic carotid, vertebral and lower limb vascular cases, especially in differential diagnosis between subtotal stenoses and occlusions. This is all to decrease the number of invasive or possibly harmful modalities and still have good diagnostic results. XXI century is a time for rapid development of interventional vascular procedures. Vascular ultrasound plays a major role in this. It is not only about non-invasive diagnosis, but mostly about cost-effective, reliable, and non-invasive follow-up assessment. Doppler US is now a basic technique for evaluation of carotid and peripheral stenting procedures and also a very helpful tool in primary diagnosis of AAA stentgrafting complications. Learning Objectives:1. To understand the uses of new ultrasound contrast agents in the evaluation of abdominal and peripheral vessels. Fetal ventriculomegaly is a frequent issue in prenatal diagnosis. It is defined as a transverse diameter of the ventricular atrium greater than 10 mm. It is called \"mild\" between 10 and 15 mm and \"severe\" above 15 mm. Sonography is the modality of choice for diagnosing ventriculomegaly. It can determine if ventriculomegaly is uni or bilateral, if the third ventricle is involved, and it can also look for extracerebral and intra-cerebral associated abnormalities: midline and/or posterior fossa abnormalities, gyration or migration abnormalities, haemorrhage and/or ischaemia. Indeed, the prognosis of ventriculomegaly largely depends on the presence of such anomalies. However, some of them (notably abnormalities of the white matter, heterotopias, some abnormalities of the posterior fossa) may be completely overlooked by sonography and MR may be very helpful in detecting such lesions. We will report the results of a large retrospective study about the contribution of US and MR in the diagnosis of abnormalities associated with ventriculomegaly.The prognosis of isolated mild ventriculomegaly is still debated and we will report the results of a prospective study concerning the postnatal follow-up of such ventriculomegaly. (2) were differentiated from enteric cysts (2). High anorectal malformations with (2) Fetal urinary tract malformations affect from 0.1 to 1% of all pregnancies, they are commonly detected by obstetrical sonography and account for 30% of all congenital anomalies. The spectrum of malformations is wide and the prognosis is significantly poorer in fetuses with bilateral anomalies and decreased amount of amniotic fluid. Imaging modalities are presently essential in fetal medicine. The routine follow-up of the fetuses is obtained by US which remains the predominant modality for evaluating disorders related to the fetus. The interest of the prenatal diagnosis is to optimise parents' counselling relative to the fetal prognosis and / or the postnatal follow-up of the newborn. Often, antenatal US is sufficient to establish the diagnosis of a urinary tract anomaly (renal dysplasia, renal duplication, hydronephrosis) but in some patients, the fetal anatomy may be difficult to analyse. We use MR imaging combined with sonography in the diagnosis of urinary tract anomalies in fetuses with equivocal or inconclusive sonographic data. This can be encountered: 1) in poor US conditions due to oligohydramnios which is commonly associated with urinary tract malformations (in cases of suspected bilateral renal agenesis or dysplasia); 2) in fetuses with huge urinary tract dilatation preventing proper visualization of the urinary tract anatomy; 3) in fetuses with renal masses; 4) in fetuses with complex genito-urinary tract malformation (cloacal malformation or bladder extrophy). MR imaging combined with US clarifies the diagnosis and helps in the establishment of the prognosis. Therefore, it entails a better management of the pregnancy and the newborn. Interventional rdiological procedures with which the radiographer is involved in the Department of Radiology at Odense University Hospital are varied. The character of the radiographer's job has developed and he now plays an important role in the treatment of patients. The radiographer's work during a neurointerventional radiology procedure start even before receiving the patient at the radiological unit, and the job is not finished until the patient returns to his unit. Sometimes the job even involves a follow-up days later.Radiologists and radiographers form a team in which the radiographer is a valued member because of his understanding of the procedures. The radiographer not only knows how to do the imaging but is also familiar with anatomy and the relevant radiological techniques. The radiographer is involved in the pre-and post-treatment of the patients and he is expected to be one step ahead of the radiologist all the time. He has to have a clear understanding of the clinical situation and to know about the advanced and changing technology within the field. The economy, the patient, the radiologist and the radiographer benefit equally from this teamwork. Learning Objectives: 1. To learn about a description of the interventional radiologic procedures at Odense University Hospital. 2. To give an overview of the radiographers work during a neurointerventional radiologic procedure. 3. To understand the benefits/advantages of the teamwork between the radiographer and the radiologist during a neurointerventional procedure.",

Azavedo; Stockholm/SE (edward.azavedo@karolinska.se)Calcifications may appear in breasts in different locations and in different forms. The ones that should not need any actions are for example those that are located in blood vessels, in fibroadenomas, in lobules, in fat necrosis etc. Differentiation of these do need experience in order to avoid intervention or follow-up. The lecture will give examples of topography of different types of calcifications that appear specially in multiple areas. Clusters of calcifications that appear in multifocal or multicentric ways can be within lobules in dense breasts, representing physiological calcium deposits, or represent residual products of tumor necrosis like in ductal carcinomas. Usually the shape, size and intensity of calcifications are good parameters to differentiate one from the other. Examples will be shown of clusters that need assessment including intervention. Aspects like interventional methods and modalities suitable for intervention will also be discussed in the lecture. The significance of tumor extent by analyzing the spread of microcalcifications is also essential to decide proper patient management. Knowledge of radiological tumour extent can change preferred surgery from breast conserving surgery to modified radical mastectomy and this will in the end prevent so called recurrences, that could in fact, be residual tumour due to insufficient surgery.

Kinkel; Ch\u00eane-Bougeries/CH (karen.kinkel@grangettes.ch) At screening mammography, multiple, bilateral, partially circumscribed masses with similar appearance at mammography are classified as benign. Their interval cancer rate of 0.14% does not justify additional recall imaging. In patients younger than age 35 with palpable lesions and in patients with multiple abnormal mammographic findings undergoing recall or diagnostic imaging for BI-RAD 3, 4 or 5 lesions, grayscale ultrasound and color Doppler imaging are used to identify and confirm the solid nature of the lesion. Although color Doppler imaging can identify intratumoral vessels within a solid mass, this sign is not sensitive enough to be of practical use. For suspected solid lesions combined mammographic and sonographic characterization is mandatory to indicate tissue sampling. Frequent and reproducible sonographic criteria for benignity include circumscribed margin with round, oval or moderately lobulated shape (less than 4 lobulations) and a width to anterior-posterior ratio > 1.4. Posterior echo intensity appears less useful due to overlapping characteristics in benign and malignant lesions. To avoid biopsy of too many benign lesions, a follow-up program is recommended for lesions with a probability of cancer between 1-2% (BI-RAD 3, probably benign lesions). Increase in lesion size at follow-up examination, indicates biopsy. Sonographically guided core biopsy for two indeterminate or suspicious lesions in the same breast requires triangulation of lesion position and skin entrance of the needle to allow local anesthesia and biopsy to be performed through a single skin incision. For three or more indeterminate unilateral lesions, MR imaging of the breast might modify the biopsy strategy. Learning Objectives:1.

Forrai; Budapest/HU (forrai@ogyik.hu) High risk patient group consists of gene mutation carriers, risk family members and patients with: previous history of breast cancer, biopsy proven LCIS/ADH/ ALH, history of ionizing radiation. The oncologist and/or the patient are usually very aware of breast cancer, therefore \"over-screening\" is frequently indicated (too often repeated mammography, US and MR). The consequences are; continuous fear, hyperestimation of the personal probability of breast cancer and lack of patience in establishing the diagnosis. Overtreatment is often observed by sometimes multiple, immediate surgeries with benign histologic results. Mammography screening has to be started in this patient group at an earlier age and it must be completed by ultrasound if the breast structure is not completely involutional. Attention has also to be paid to multifocality, bilaterality, during pregnancy or breast feeding. MR imaging was proven to be very useful in the last year's studies. Specificity is much higher than in the normal patient group. MR imaging has the highest sensitivity among our diagnostic imaging tools. Most of these carcinomas are only detectable by MR imaging. The detection rate of cancer is higher; the cost is lower than by mammography screening of the normal patient group. Biopsy must be indicated more frequently in this group and requires consideration even in benign morphology lesions. Core biopsy or VCB are preferred methods over FNAC, because these patients are younger on average. Appropriate indications and contra-indications for the creation of iv access for acute and chronic hemodialysis will be presented. Prerequisites for the procedure will be mentioned. The audience will learn potential access sites for iv insertion of hemodialysis catheters. Advantages and disadvantages of different access sites will be discussed. Various types of acute and chronic hemodialysis catheters will be shown; strengths and weaknesses of the different designs will be demonstrated. The focus of the workshop will be on the practical presentation of the interventional radiological technique for hemodialysis catheter placement. The audience will learn in a step-by-step fashion the appropriate technique for safe and complication-free insertion of catheters. The combination of ultrasound guidance and fluoroscopy guidance for placement of central venous catheters will be underscored. Potential complications, preventive measures and interventional solutions for complications will be shown. Finally, aspects of catheter maintenance and rules for catheter changes will be presented. The workshop will focus on technical and practical aspects rather than on indepth discussion of results. At the end of the workshop, attendees will be able to initiate a central venous hemodialysis catheter placement programme at their own institution. Although good dialysis line insertion and management are essential for patients undergoing haemodialysis, arteriovenous fistulas are the preferred method for chronic haemodialysis in most patients. Each fistula has a finite lifespan. The venous side of the fistula responds to a high pressure circulation by neo-intimal hyperplasia which causes stenosis. These may cause problems during haemodialysis or can be asymptomatic. In either case, progression to fistula occlusion is usually inevitable. Fistula surveillance programmes and prompt radiological or surgical interventions directed at these stenoses can prolong the life of the fistula and avoid more complex treatments that are required when occlusion occurs. Many approaches to fistula angioplasty are used. In this workshop a relatively straightforward method will be described applicable to almost all patients in an out-patient setting. The relative merits of standard balloon, cutting balloon and surgical venous patch angioplasty will be described. With such a service, treatment of fistula occlusion should be less often required. The principles of treatment of these patients will also be discussed. Learning Objectives: 1. To be familiar with the methods of assessment of the failing graft and fistula. 2. To understand the principle of when to intervene in the failing graft and fistula. 3. To understand the principles equipment and technique of fistula and graft intervention including -when to perform PTA and stent placement -when to use cutting balloons -when to perform thrombolysis, thrombo-aspiration and mechanical thrombectomy.",

Thrall; Boston, MA/US (jthrall@partners.org) Speech recognition systems translate spoken words into digital text. Commercial speech recognition systems are typically tailored for specific applications with respect to vocabulary and ancillary functions such as the ability to use pre-set macros and templates. For radiology, the systems are interfaced to radiology information systems to maintain the integrity of patient demographics and information about the radiological studies. The two most important advantages of using speech recognition are shortened cycle times for creating radiological reports and making them available for clinical use and significant cost reductions through reduced personnel requirements for transcription. The single biggest hurdle in implementing speech recognition is overcoming the perception on the part of some radiologists that speech recognition increases the time it takes them to accomplish the interpretation/reporting process. The keys to overcoming this issue are full education of system users, full use of macros and templates, comprehensive voice training and adequate system technical support for users. Vendors should also completely integrate speech recognition systems with RIS and PACS systems to reduce work process steps. Speech recognition reporting systems offer the rare opportunity of improving quality of care and quality of service while at the same time reducing cost. Departments of radiology that successfully implement this technology have significant quality and cost advantages compared with departments that do not. Learning Objectives: 1. To develop an understanding of how speech recognition works and how to incorporate speech recognition systems into the radiology interpretation workflow.2. To learn factors that are associated with successful implementation versus failed implementation of speech recognition systems. 3. To understand the potential positive operational impact associated with implementation of speech recognition dictation of radiology reports. Skeletal metastases are a common finding in cancer patients with a reported prevalence of 80% at autopsy. Skeletal metastases have a significant impact on the patient's outcome and on therapy options and so accurate tumour staging is mandatory. Most skeletal metastases stem from lung, prostate, breast, or renal cancer. Skeletal metastases occur primarily in bones with increased blood supply and in areas with red bone marrow. The clinical presentation of bone metastases is non specific and most skeletal metastases are incidental findings. The appearance of skeletal metastases is often manifold. Most commonly they present as osteolytic lesions, however, metastases with osteoblastic (sclerotic) or with mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic appearances may also be seen. Two main aspects have to be considered in diagnostic imaging:",

            "text": "1. Screening of patients with known primary tumours. Triphasic scintigraphy is still the imaging modality of choice for this purpose, however, whole-body MR imaging seems to be a potential alternative, because of its natural contrast on T1 weighted images when fatty bone marrow is replaced by tumor tissue. 2. Evaluation of incidentally found skeletal lesions, which is currently dominated by MR imaging. Recently new imaging techniques have been introduced such as multi-detector-CT, which opens new perspectives for preoperative staging and for reconstruction and implant surgery. Non-invasive techniques, such as diffusion weighted MR imaging which has the potential to exploit the microstructure of tumour tissue, and functional imaging, such as PET or PET-CT/MRI are now available. These techniques have potential for reliable tissue characterization, which is mandatory for planning and monitoring therapy. Detection of abdominal metastatic disease depends upon a number of factors including the location of metastatic spread, the imaging method used for detection, the technique used for evaluation, the histology of the metastatic lesion and factors altering the imaging characteristics of organs. The first part of this course will be focused on the liver, one of the organs most commonly involved in metastatic disease from a variety of cancers, in particular those of gastrointestinal tract, breast and lung. We will discuss the incidence of liver metastases, their prognostic significance and the role of imaging staging in the choice of therapeutic options. We will review the technical aspects and the advantages and drawbacks of ultrasonography, CT and MR imaging and common pitfalls associated with detecting hepatic metastatic disease. A rational approach of the use of ultrasound contrast agent and liver-specific MR contrast agents in the staging of liver metastases will be presented. We will also illustrate the imaging characteristics of liver metastases according to the histology of the lesion. In the second part we will discuss the imaging features of the most frequent extrahepatic abdominal metastases including peritoneal, spleen, pancreatic and gastrointestinal metastases. The growing role of metabolic imaging using FDG-PET in the staging of abdominal metastases will be discussed. Staging nodes is crucial for therapy and prognosis. Knowledge of the normal anatomy of nodes and the pathways of spread is important to recognize and to accurately localize them. This is extremely important for staging. In addition the imaging features of US, CT and MR imaging help differentiate benign from the malignant nodes which is very important. Conventional MR imaging and CT is using size and shape criteria, therefore, a node, especially when round with a diameter of 8 mm is suspicious to be malignant, but in this way many nodes will be missed by this these techniques. Also a cystic area is seen more often in malignant nodes. New techniques using \"node specific\" agents (PET tracers or USPIO MR particles) improve the characterization. Currently the threshold between benign and malignant nodes are not based on size and shape, but on morphology and signal. Thus 5 mm small nodes can reliably be recognized. New MR imaging techniques (like 3 T) and perhaps new PET-tracers will decrease this threshold even further. Chronic pelvic pain is one of the most common referral causes in gynaecology, it affects 15% of female patients between 18 and 50 years of age and represents 10-40% of consultations in gynaecologic practice. Nonetheless chronic pelvic pain remains a diagnostic puzzle in many cases given the multiplicity of possible causes. Causes are not only gynaecological, divided in acute and chronic pelvic pain, but also include digestive, muscular, urinary, neurological etc. We shall focus on chronic pelvic pain from gynaecological origin. Imaging modalities should not be undertaken before a thorough clinical examination, along with knowledge of clinical history, intensity, type, duration of symptoms, efficacy of previous treatments. A multidisciplinary approach, involving gynaecologists and imaging specialists, is compulsory in order to orientate examinations. As most of these patients are in the reproductive age, imaging should only consider non irradiating modalities: US and MR imaging. Assessment should always begin with US, and be completed with MR imaging when US is inconclusive or normal. Gynaecologic causes are dominated by endometriosis, adenomyosis, myomas, pelvic congestion syndrome, pelvic floor dysfunction, uterine malposition, dysovulation, chronic adnexal torsion, chronic infections. Specifically, identification and extent determination of endometriosis requires specially focused examinations in order to detect small deep lesions. Learning Objectives: 1. To review the common and less common causes of female pelvic pain. 2. To propose a logical step by step diagnostic assessment, given the frequency of the various causes and the clinical varieties of pain. 3. To review the diagnostic input of imaging modalities (clinical examination, ultrasound, MR imaging, CT and laparoscopy).",

Garcia-M\u00f3naco; Buenos Aires/AR (rgmonaco@fibertel.com.ar)Embolization of uterine myomata has largely developed in the last decade. The rationale of treatment is catheterization of the uterine arteries providing a safety route for fibroid embolization and infarction, that is usually followed by relief of a patient's symptoms. Uterine myomata are very common in young females, but treatment should only be directed to symptomatic patients. The commonest indications of embolization are heavy menstrual bleeding and bulk symptoms. Pelvic pain as an isolated symptom is uncommon, and in such a case sudden fibroid infarction or torsion of a pedunculated myomata should be suspected. Embolization should not be performed in asymptomatic patients or when bleeding is associated with small intramural fibroids that do not distort the endometrial cavity. Submucosal fibroids are best treated by hysteroscopic resection, and fibroids causing fertility problems usually referred for myomectomy. Hysterectomy is usually preferred for massively enlarged uterus or when there is a uterine mass that appears to be a sarcoma. Pre procedure gynecologic evaluation is mandatory, not just to confirm that symptoms are caused by the fibroids but to rule out malignancy or other infectious or concomitant diseases. The interventional radiologist is recommended to discuss with the patient the details of the procedure and potential complications as well as other therapeutic alternatives. Post procedural care includes pain control by NSAID or even morphine derivates. Clinical follow-up is essential not only to asses the clinical result but to rule out or obtain early diagnosis of delayed complications such as infection, expulsion of fibroids or others. ",

Pelage; Boulogne/FR (jean-pierre.pelage@apr.ap-hop-paris.fr)Adenomyosis is a benign uterine disease characterized by ectopic endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium. Adenomyosis is associated with myometrial hypertrophy and may be either focal or diffuse. This common gynecologic condition which affects premenopausal women is associated with clinical manifestations similar to those of uterine fibroids. Although adenomyosis and uterine fibroids can have the same presenting symptoms including infertility, abnormal uterine bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and pelvic pain, their treatment can differ. Traditionally, adenomyosis requires hysterectomy because of poor results of hormonal treatment or endometrial ablation. The use of uterine artery embolization to treat fibroid-related pain is well-accepted. In these studies, uterine fibroid embolization contributed to clinical improvement in approximately 80-90% of women and resulted in significant fibroid and uterine shrinkage. In centers where uterine fibroid embolization has been performed without a screening magnetic resonance imaging, failures has been attributed to the presence of undiagnosed adenomyosis. However, other centers have reported encouraging short and mid-term clinical results in women with adenomyosis-related pain. Intense postprocedure pain is usually observed after embolization in most patients with adenomyosis probably because of myometrial ischemia induced by the technique of embolization used. As initially reported with uterine fibroid embolization, the technique of embolization consists of complete occlusion of both uterine arteries to effect stasis or near stasis. Initial control of pain and bleeding symptoms can be expected after uterine artery embolization for adenomyosis. However, long-term results seem disappointing. Embolization should only be offered to women with realistic expectations regarding the duration of clinical improvement. Learning Objectives: 1. To understand the indications for uterine artery embolization for adenomyosis with special emphasis on pain. 2. To discuss the different embolization strategies. 3. To review the literature with available evidence with respect to published data on adenomyosis treated with uterine artery embolization.",

Machan; Vancouver, BC/CA (lmachan@vanhosp.bc.ca)There are two distinct patient groups to whom ovarian vein embolization can be applied. 1. Chronic pelvic pain. Pelvic congestion syndrome refers to chronic pelvic pain caused by pelvic varicose veins, almost always from reverse flow in the ovarian vein. Chronic pelvic pain is defined as \"pelvic pain that is present for at least 6 months\". It is one of the most frustrating and common problems encountered in gynecology. Laparoscopy is essential to exclude other causes of pelvic pain. Ovarian venography is the most frequent means of diagnosis, although some rely on duplex ultrasound. Treatment options include embolization, surgery, or hysterectomy. All means of treatment for chronic pelvic pain have at least a 20% failure rate. 2. A second patient group presents with varicose veins of the perineum or legs. This indication has become more important as endovascular treatments for lower limb varicosities have increased. Although these patients require less complicated clinical management, specific knowledge or shared clinical care with an expert in lower extremity venous disease is essential for good clinical results.

Autopsy rates have dropped during the last two decades, and religious arguments nearly suppress autopsy in several cultural areas. Postmortem imaging offers two major advantages over conventional autopsy. First, based on the non-destructive examination, there is usually no objection by the relatives, and three-dimensional topography is maintained in contrast to an open dissection; in complex trauma, imaging may be superior to autopsy in demonstrating the range of skeletal injuries. Second, the situation is frozen and easily distributed to all persons involved, avoiding the natural postmortem degradation of tissue. Forensic and non-forensic applications will be reviewed in this session. Learning Objectives: 1. To show the great potential of post mortem diagnostic CT and MR imaging. 2.

The Institute of Forensic Medicine and the Institute of Radiology, University of Berne are, in collaboration with a well selected national and international research team, evaluating and validating several cutting-edge technologies such as 3D optical and photogrammetric surface scanning, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy, micro-CT, micro-MR, post-mortem biopsy, and post-mortem angiography. Using these imaging methods it could be demonstrated that a real, full 3D data based individual documentation of body surface and internal structures is possible in a non-invasive and non-destructive manner. Using the data merging/fusing and animation possibilities, it is possible to answer reconstructive questions of the dynamic development of patterned injuries (morphologic imprints) and to evaluate the possibility, that they are matchable or linkable to suspected injury-causing instruments. Real 3D data based documentation opens a new horizon for scientific reconstruction and animation by bringing added value and a real quality improvement in forensic science. The paper will give an overview of the Virtopsy actual and future change process in forensic medicine. Learning Objectives: 1.

Persson; Link\u00f6ping/SE (anders.persson@cmiv.liu.se)A thorough understanding of underlying mechanisms and optimal technique is essential to fully exploit the diagnostic potential of new volume acquisition modalities. To obtain satisfactory 3D images for a virtual autopsy from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), several key parameters need to be optimized and new technologies need to be developed. It is important to understand the principles of postmortem CT and MR imaging to utilize the new capabilities and to be aware of its limitations. The field of visualization provides methods facilitating visual presentation of postmortem data that are difficult to immediately grasp such as large volume datasets. It includes software making the visual inspection of medical image data easier, faster or more efficient. Once a high quality postmortal dataset has been acquired, the rendering technique is the most important technical determinant of 3D image quality. The rendering technique is the computer algorithm used to transform the 3D datasets, available in the workstation or PACS, into 2D images, visible on a monitor or film. If this is properly performed, the rendered image may give the viewer a good understanding of the underlying 3D post mortal anatomy and the cause of death. The advantages and disadvantages of different rendering techniques of postmortal datasets will be discussed. We will also present some of the technical aspects of volume rendering such as novel data compression based on medical domain knowledge and high quality level of detail rendering.

            "text": "Virtual autopsy: Adjunct to or replacement of autopsy? P. MacMahon; Dublin/IEThe decline in usage of the traditional autopsy after hospital or community deaths has been recognised for some time. The probable reason behind this decline is a fear of disfigurement of the remains of the deceased. Additionally, certain groups have religious and cultural objections to traditional autopsy. In the event of autopsy refusal, whole body magnetic resonance imaging has been proposed as an alternative autopsy method. MR can be used as a non-invasive autopsy technique or as an adjunct to a minimally invasive autopsy. A major disadvantage of MR autopsy is that no tissue samples are obtained for cytogenic or histological analyses, however selective needle autopsies may compensate for this. A few small studies have evaluated the accuracy of MR autopsy in adults and neonates.In adults the main diagnostic difficulties were in assessing for coronary artery lesions, differentiating postmortem from premortem clot and evaluating the significance of postmortem pulmonary infiltrates. In neonates difficulty was found in examining for complex cardiac malformations and small anomalous anatomical connections. MR autopsy's advantages over conventional imaging modalities are that it is whole body and that it offers excellent tissue contrast by utilising different MR sequences, especially in evaluating intracranial or CNS pathology. With increased operator experience it is envisaged that diagnostic accuracy would increase. Full postmortem dissection remains the gold standard. In situations where relatives refuse a traditional postmortem, and if resources allow it, MR autopsy may be offered as a less invasive method of establishing the cause of death. Major advances in cardiac imaging have resulted in better diagnostic as well as prognostic workup of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Most recently multimodality imaging procedures have been introduced to combine high resolution characterization of cardiac morphology with functional parameters such as myocardial perfusion, metabolism and molecular signals. The combination of multidetector CT with PET or SPECT imaging allows the comprehensive evaluation of patients with cardiac disease. Early detection of coronary artery disease involves the identification of coronary calcification as well as the documentation of endothelial dysfunction. SPECT-CT allows the correlation of coronary calcification (CAL) with regional myocardial perfusion reserve. Future clinical investigations have to prove the incremental prognostic value by combining both modalities. In patients with advanced CAD the combination of noninvasive coronary angiography by CTA with SPECT and PET may identify functional abnormalities in relation to coronary artery stenosis. The simultaneous co-registration of various imaging parameters provides guidelines for regional therapy and for monitoring of interventions. Especially in patients with CAD and impaired left ventricular function the combination of CTA and PET may provide specific markers for the extent of viable tissue and helps to define the appropriate revascularization therapy. Future studies evaluating the cost efficacy of hybrid instrumentation is necessary in order to justify their use in clinical routine. However, with the advent of molecular imaging, the co-registration of molecular signals with morphologic characterization of cardiac and vascular tissue is extremely attractive for clinical translational research. Learning Objectives: 1. To discuss hybrid instrumentation. 2. To review the correlation of structural and biologic imaging. 3. To discuss potential clinical applications in cardiology.",

Ischemia is considered as an anemia of the heart in which there is a mismatch between oxygen supply and oxygen need.The clinical presentations of myocardial ischemia are 1. chronic stable angina, 2. unstable angina, 3. variant angina, myocardial infarct. In all these conditions Myocardial oxygen supply is inadequate compared to myocardial oxygen needs. In chronic stable angina, the symptoms appear during stress and MR imaging is adequate to evaluate perfusion or function before the angina and similarly left ventricular dysfunction and perfusion defects appear before the increase of cardiac enzymes in infarction. CMR is able in fact to delineate regional and functional dysfunction better than any other techniques. Echocardiography is limited in the evaluation of epicardial borders and apical region. Moreover with MR imaging, it is possible perform perfusion studies able to analyze the status of the micro circulation at rest and during stress by means of rapid sequences susceptible to gadolinium.

            "text": "Whole body imaging in oncology with PET/CT T.F. Hany; Z\u00fcrich/CH (thomas.hany@usz.ch)Over the last five years, PET-CT has grown because the PET portion shows information which is very different from that obtainable with other imaging modalities. However, the paucity of anatomic landmarks in PET makes a consistent \"hardware-fusion\" to anatomic cross-sectional data extremely useful. All clinical experience points to a single direction: addition of CT to PET improves foremost specificity, but also sensitivity and adding PET to CT adds sensitivity and specificity in tumor imaging: thus PET-CT is a more accurate test than either of its components and probably also than side-by-side viewing of both modalities. The synergistic advantage of adding CT is that the attenuation correction needed for PET data can also be derived from the CT data, an advantage not obtainable by integrating PET and MR imaging. This makes PET-CT 25-30% faster than PET alone using standard attenuation methods, leading to higher patient throughput and a more comfortable examination for patients typically lasting 30 minutes or less.Recently published results will be demonstrated and discussed in this lecture. FDG-PET-CT appears to provide relevant information on the staging and therapy monitoring of many tumors, such as bronchial carcinoma, mesothelioma, colorectal cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and many others with the notable exception of prostatic cancer. For this cancer, choline derivatives may possibly become useful radiopharmaceuticals. The published literature on the applications of FDG-PET-CT in oncology is still limited but several well designed studies have demonstrate the benefits of PET-CT. Purpose: Recently, multi-channel whole body MR imaging (WB MR imaging) systems have been introduced, which allow for coverage of the whole body and uncompromised image quality. Imaging protocols for the diagnostic work-up of oncologic patients and the diagnostic potential of this approach will be discussed. Methods: Parallel imaging techniques allow for substantial reduction of acquisition times and high spatial resolution. T1-weighted and STIR sequences proved sensitive and specific for assessment of tumor spread in the skeletal system and within soft tissues. With breath held single shot sequences, such as HASTE, high resolution imaging of the lung could be obtained. Static and dynamic contrastenhanced imaging is required for the examination of parenchymal organs and brain. Results: While PET/CT was superior in the detection of lymph node metastases, WB MR imaging was superior in the detection of skeletal, liver and brain metastases. Pulmonary metastases could be detected when they had a size of 7 mm and more. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) encompasses a broad spectrum of airway and lung diseases ranging from chronic bronchitis to end-stage emphysema. The main risk factor for developing COPD is smoking. Obstruction can be caused by bronchial wall thickening, hypersecretion of mucus, increased collapsibility of bronchial walls, and alveolar destruction with loss of elasticity. Besides obstruction detected by a loss of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and increased airway resistance, hyperinflation with increased total lung capacity and residual volume are hallmarks of the disease. Chest radiography will only pick up advanced disease when bronchial wall thickening becomes visible as tram lines or hyperinflation by hyperlucent lungs with vascular pruning, an enlarged retrosternal space and flattening or even inversion of the diaphragm. CT is capable of demonstrating early changes such as bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening and low attenuation areas representing emphysema. Segmentation of the lung and the emphysematous areas can be easily done by thresholding, and the relative volume occupied by emphysema can be calculated. Assessment of expiratory scans is worthwhile to detect air trapping as a functional sign of COPD and to separate reversible hyperinflation from fixed emphysematous destruction. Collapsibility of airways can be best visualized by dynamic cine CT or MR imaging. It is difficult to visualize airways and emphysema directly by MR imaging. However, MR imaging is can provide functional imaging, ventilation MR imaging, e.g. using hyperpolarized 3 He, MR angiography and perfusion MR imaging, to depict ventilation defects and the effects of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Learning Objectives: 1. To correlate the pathology of COPD and emphysema with the findings at projection radiography and CT. 2. To learn about the post-processing of CT images to quantitatively describe the severity of COPD and emphysema. 3. To discuss the impact of functional imaging using CT and MR imaging.",

Brillet; Bobigny/FR (pybrillet@yahoo.fr) Asthma and allergic lung diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of the airways, with additional alveolitis and granulomas in allergic lung diseases. These diseases are influenced by many factors, including genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental allergens. Their increasing prevalence and the new opportunities with computed tomography (CT) have led to a higher demand on imaging examinations for the diagnosis of disease and for the follow-up under treatment. In this review, we will highlight the key imaging appearance in asthma and associated conditions: foremost allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and Churg-Stauss syndrome, and extrinsic allergic alveolitis, also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Results of the main clinical studies will be discussed herein. Learning Objectives:1. To know the radiographic and CT abnormalities observed in asthma and associated conditions. 2.

One of the major characteristics of CNS infection and non-infectious inflammation is the increase in water content (gray matter: 80 to 90%, white matter: 70 to 85%), which can be visualized as a decrease of density on the CT (about 5 Hounsfield units) and an increase of signal intensity on T2 weighted MR imaging, due to prolongation of the T2 relaxation time, whereas T1 prolongation leads to a decrease of signal intensity on T1 weighted images. In white matter these changes in relaxation times are accentuated, because the amount of protein-lipid decreases as the myelin is destroyed. Some brain infections are more characterized by a cytotoxic edema and disorganisation/demyelination of white matter tracts (e.g. PML, SSPE, Herpes simplex encephalitis) which can be best detected by diffusion weighted (MR) imaging (DWI) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Corresponding to the neuropathological description of spongiform encephalopathy, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterized by small intra-extracellular cystic necrosis, leading to a restriction of water and a signal increase on DWI.The major pathological change in other CNS infections, e.g. early cerbritis and brain abscess, is the defect of the blood-brain-barrier, which can be detected by intravenously administering substances that normally do not cross the intact BBB. Cranial meninges may be involved in various pathological processes leading to infectious, carcinomatous, chemical/reactive, and inflammatory meningitis. Infection is a common cause of meningeal disease and may be caused by any of the common infectious agents including bacteria, fungi, viruses and granulomatous agents depending on the age of the patient and the status of their immune system. Imaging modalities are not employed for initial diagnosis of meningitis. The imaging features of meningitis are usually nonspecific and in most cases diagnosis relies on the history, and other clinical and laboratory findings, most importantly CSF analysis. MR imaging is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosis and the monitoring of treatment. Contrast is mandatory and has improved the sensitivity and specificity particularly in the early phase. Unenhanced MR examinations of patients with uncomplicated meningitis may be unremarkable. Postcontrast images demonstrate the abnormal meningeal enhancement and thickening. Obliteration and contrast enhancement of subarachnoid space are differentiating findings of advanced meningitis. Involvement of basal cisterns is a pathognomic sign of granulomatous meningitis, including tuberculous leptomeningitis, fungal and sarcoid meningitis. CSF locations, loss of outline of the spinal cord, thickened and clumped nerve roots, adhesions of spinal cord and roots to the thecal sac are the findings of spinal meningitis. Imaging has a major role to demonstrate and to diagnose the development of complications, including infarction, cerebritis, abscess, subdural empyema or effusion, hydrocephalus, ventriculitis, and myelitis. The introduction of diffusion-weighted imaging, FLAIR, magnetization transfer and magnetic resonance spectroscopy has led to a better understanding. Learning Objectives:1. To learn about the etiology of meningeal infections. Clinical manifestations of the infections of the spine and spinal canal are often protean and non specific. Plain films are usually negative in the early stages of the disease and CT and MR imaging allow both earlier diagnosis and greater specificity. Spinal dura mater is a rather efficient anatomical barrier, and extension of infections processes from extra to intradural space or vice versa is uncommon. Spondylitis is more common in adult and discitis is more common in childhood. Routes of contamination include: 1) Hematogeneous spread (mainly from urinary infection). 2) Contiguous spread, from adjacent suppurative focus.3) Direct contamination, traumatic or iatrogenic. Bone scanning (99mTc -HMDP) is more sensitive than plain films but non specific. CT still represents a good screening method. Disc hypodensity is an early sign of disc infection and spondylodiscitis; cortical endplate erosions are better demonstrated on CT than on MR imaging. MR imaging is the imaging modality of choice. STIR and T2WI with fat saturation are more sensitive for bone marrow oedema and epidural involvement. Post Gd T1WI with fat saturation better delineates the extent of epidural and paraspinal involvement. Epidural infection is commonly associated with vertebral osteomyelitis. In pyogenic spondylitis, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen (50% of cases). Tuberculous spondylitis has a rising incidence in the past two decades. Differential diagnoses of spondylitis include degenerative spondylosis, spinal metastases, and spondylarthropathies. Septic facet arthritis is rare (4%), most common in the lumbar spine and complicated by epidural abscess in 25% of cases. Percutaneous vertebral/abscess biopsy under CT guidance allows bacterial examination and appropriate treatment. MR imaging is the examination of choice for the follow-up of patients treated with antibiotics. Physiologic and pathologic calcifications in the face and neck usually do not play a major role during the evaluation and diagnosis of diseases in the face and neck. However, in certain circumstances, detection and correct interpretation of head and neck calcifications can be extremely helpful to find the correct diagnosis e.g. in retinoblastoma, fungal sinusitis, or labyrinthitis. Therefore, this course gives a systematic presentation of physiologic and pathologic calcifications in the face and neck and highlights those calcifications you do not want to miss. Learning Objectives: 1. To be aware of physiologic and pathologic processes leading to calcification in the face and neck. 2. To be able to recognise physiologic forms of calcification and distinguish these from pathological lesions. 3. To be able to recognise pathological forms of calcification and to relate these to differential diagnosis and therapeutic implications.Before starting endoscopic sinus surgery procedures the surgeon wants to have detailed information of the sinonasal anatomy to prevent major complications. Multislice, non contrast enhanced CT is the preferred technique to depict the paranasal sinuses. Thin axial slices provide high quality coronal and sagittal reconstructions.Radiologists should be familiar with normal variants which may lead to potential complications, such as hypoplasia of one or more paranasal sinuses, Onodi cells, asymmetry of the ethmoid roof and postoperative changes from previous operations. Extension of disease into adjacent compartments should be recognized including the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF), the anterior and central skull base, and orbit. On the other hand, sinonasal disease may result from extranasal disease of odontogenic, skull base or orbital origin. The most common pathologies in the nose and paranasal sinuses are polyposis and chronic sinusitis. Bilateral soft tissue masses are seen, sometimes accompanied by osseous thickening, so-called osteitis. Acute inflammatory disease often is treated without imaging. Only when involvement of the orbit or the cranium is suspected, is CT with intravenous contrast injection indicated to evaluate intraorbital extension and this finding necessitates acute surgical intervention.In immunocompromised patients the possibility of fungal disease should be considered in the cases of bone destruction and extension into the retromaxillary space, the PPF or the skull base.A unilateral mass within one paranasal sinus should arouse suspicion of a tumour, benign or malignant. An antrochoanal polyp may present in this way, but malignant tumour may as well. MR imaging has additional value for evaluating these tumours. It is the anatomic complexity of the soft tissues of the neck and their relations that creates interpretation difficulties when imaging these structures. But, most lesions in this area can be seen or are palpable. Data from clinical history and physical examination should come to the knowledge of the radiologist before imaging with CT or MR. The same applies to endoscopy, needle aspiration or even ultrasound when placed before CT or MR. If we know well were is the problem, the doubt or what lesion to stage, pitfalls are minimized, so are the difficulties and disadvantages of imaging cervical soft tissues \"in blind\". Of course, to image this area a solid knowledge of the anatomy, variations and pathology are mandatory, as it is a good connection with the related specialties like ENT, neck surgeons and radiotherapy. Daily practice and working together in a team with clinicians and surgeons are the top clues that help to understand imaging and give the best information for the best patient care. Complications with considerable clinical significance: Reported one-month mortality rate is from 0% to 5%; the metaanalysis of 24 articles performed by Leertower indicates a one-month mortality rate below 1%. Secondary nephrectomy either surgical or by embolization was necessary in less than 1%. Surgical salvage operation was performed in 2.5% in early nineties, but in later reported metaanalysis it was less than 1% (the lower incidence of rescue surgery is most probably due to treatment of occlusive renal artery dissection by stent implantation).Complications with minor clinical significance: Usually minor groin bleeding/haematoma, minor to mild allergo-toxic reaction. The incidence varies from 0%-21%. Technical complications: Events, occurring during procedure with clinical consequence, but increasing procedural time/cost (stent misplacement, balloon rupture, dissection requiring additional stent). They could sometimes (but rarely) have resulted in complications of clinical significance. The incidence is reported from 0% to 83%, but the true average incidence is unknown, as some authors do not report these complications at all.",

            "text": "The mean incidence of complications after PTRA is 5%-20%. The majority of them are not life threatening and do not result in loss of renal function, but they are dependant on patient selection and operator's experience. Even if the incidence of complications is low and the loss of life directly related to PTRA is rare, each case should be evaluated individually and the anticipated procedure benefit must outweigh the risks involved. The studies by Goldblatt in the 1930s have shown that renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the underlying cause of renovascular hypertension (RVH). RAS culminating in RVH is the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension with an estimated prevalence of 3-5% in the general population of hypertensive patients. Despite this low percentage, detection of RAS is important because it is a potentially curable cause of hypertension. In the majority of cases RVH is caused by either atherosclerotic RAS or fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Atherosclerosis accounts for 70-90 percent of cases of RAS and usually involves the ostium and proximal third of the renal artery. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a collection of vascular diseases that affects the intima, media and adventitia and is responsible for 10-30 percent of cases of RAS. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA) is traditionally regarded as the definitive test to diagnose RAS. However, both the invasive nature of IA-DSA and the difficulty in assessing the pathophysiological significance of stenotic lesions have encouraged the search for non-or minimally invasive diagnostic tests. In addition, IA-DSA is by no means a perfect test for the detection of RAS as it is subject to substantial interobserver variation.With the introduction of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA), multidetector row computed tomographic angiography (MD-CTA) and duplex ultrasonography, alternatives for IA-DSA are emerging. An overview of these techniques with their merits and shortcomings will be discussed. Diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of RAS will be evaluated in the context of these and other diagnostic tests. Indications for renal artery angioplasty still remain controversial, even 28 years after the first renal angioplasty done by Gr\u00fcntzig. It is mainly due to the lack of large, comparative studies and also due to the complexity of the physiopathology of the kidney and impairment of the cardiovascular system. However, there are some proven indications where renal angioplasty should be done such as refractory hypertension, rapid renal failure, flash pulmonary oedema, indication for some medicine, \u2026 The talk will focus first in the approach to the physiology of the kidney and physiopathology of renal artery stenosis. Then proven indications will be analysed with examples and remaining indications will be discussed. New indications will be also discussed such as pectoris angina. Renal artery stenosis should also be considered as a cardiovascular risk marker. The mortality rate of this population is very high, maybe more than patients with lower limb disease. Associated treatment of atherosclerosis should always occur to prevent cardiovascular events. Aortic dissection (AD) is the most emergent acute disease of the thoracic aorta. The mortality rate is up to 80% without treatment with a rate of 1-2% per hour after symptom onset for Stanford type A AD (ascending aorta). The first aim of a diagnostic strategy is to be highly efficient to prove the AD and to localise it. This is currently well done with transoesophageal echocardiography or CT scan. Type A AD will be operated on while type B is medically treated. Since the development of endovascular treatments of AD complications (i.e. malperfusion syndromes, aortic ruptures), another role of imaging tools will be a complete investigation of the aorta and its collaterals. To date, CT scan is the best imaging technique for doing that and thus, the radiologist will play a main role in the investigation of the dissected aorta. He must establish the diagnosis and consequently order a surgical repair if needed, look for signs of imminent rupture, say whether or not there is a risk of collateral ischemia and thus endovascular treatment to be initiated. The radiologist must also know the spectrum of akin thoracic aortic diseases that are sometimes merged with AD, such as intramural haematomas, ruptured aneurysms and penetrating aortic ulcers. These different faces of acute medical aortic diseases are brought together under the concept of acute aortic syndrome. This presentation will expose these different points of the imaging of dissection and acute aortic syndromes. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) has long been considered as the gold standard in the evaluation of the abdominal arteries. Nevertheless, it remains an invasive method carrying the risk of complications especially in the older population. CT angiography (CTA) and MR angiography (MRA) are considered the best noninvasive tests for the evaluation of the renal and visceral arteries and are gradually replacing DSA in this field. However, there is still some concern that CTA or MRA may overlook mild or distal abnormalities due to their relatively low spatial resolution. The dramatic recent developments of multidetector CT offer sub-millimeter resolution which is especially important considering the size and the course of the renal and visceral arteries. Still, new challenges appeared such as the adequate arterial opacification and the appearance of image noise. Traditional MRA examinations have been almost completely displaced by contrast enhanced techniques. By incorporating the new parallel acquisition techniques, MRA of the renal arteries is now feasible with isotropic sub-millimeter resolution. New tests such as MR renography can be combined with MRA providing information about the functional significance of stenoses. This review discusses the anatomy and the clinical significance of renal and visceral artery variants. It provides an overview of the indications and limitations of CTA and MRA in several clinical settings. It critically discusses the existing discrepancies between different studies that affect the widespread application of renal and visceral CTA and MRA. MRA and CTA are increasingly used for imaging peripheral arterial occlusive disease, they are non-invasive and MRA also avoids ionising radiation and contrast nephrotoxicity. Claudication and critical lower limb ischaemia (CLLI) are usually clinically distinct as are the techniques for their imaging. In claudication the problem lies in larger vessels in the pelvis/thighs whereas in CLLI the major problem usually lies in the crural vessels with or without remediable aortoiliac/ femoral disease. Hence in CLLI detail of the tibial vasculature is crucial yet this requires both high spatial resolution and speed as in CLLI, rapid arteriovenous shunting leads to obscuration of vessels through venous overlay. Fluoroscopy is still an important diagnostic procedure and represents about 10% of childhood radiographic exposures, whereby uroradiologic and gastroenterologic examinations dominate in frequency. In a Europe-wide survey on micturition cystourethrography (MCU) the radiation exposure varied by a factor of 1:500 depending on examination protocol and equipment technology. Pulsed digital fluoroscopy equipment, modern digital image management and specially adapted fluoroscopic automatic exposure control have been available for many years. The selection of the lowest possible system dose, use of high filtration, selective use of a grid and the right choice of image acquisition can considerably reduce the radiation exposure. In addition, an effective optimisation strategy for paediatric fluoroscopy requires standardisation of examination protocols, which will be shown in the example of MCU. As an example for gastroenterological procedures, the use of digital video loops for examining the swallowing act as part of a standardized protocol will be discussed. The potential for dosimetry and its interpretation will also be presented. All these measures contribute to truly optimised fluoroscopy in paediatrics. Image digitization and networking are entering the radiology departments and hospitals in a revolutionary way. Distances are shrinking, information flows broader and faster. With the aging and the substitution of radiological equipment a steadily growing number of hospitals opt for digital radiography and PACS. This refresher course is aimed at radiologists who are planning to digitize their department or who are facing certain questions or problems after having done so. Emphasis will be on pediatric imaging aspects like dose effectiveness and speed and quality of processing. It points out the main imaging modalities for plain X-ray imaging in pediatric radiology. In the center of the course will be the use of the flat panel technology. This necessarily includes CR systems which will be compared to DR. We will also focus on the use of standard and dual read CR systems as an alternative or supplement to DR. Another important issue will be the technical implications of optimizing the whole imaging-chain up to the final image and to keep up constant quality. The workflow changes substantially concerning internal organization and image distribution in a DR and digital imaging working field. Switching from plain film to digital means a transition to a whole new imaging concept -and it also means a lot of work and dedication to reach this aim. Radiation protection plays an increasing role in CT imaging. In particular, CT in young patients requires special attention to this matter. Besides limiting indications for CT to clinical questions that cannot be answered by ultrasound or MRI, several parameters should be considered as potential means for radiation reduction: kV, mAs, dose modulation modes. Other parameters such as beam filters, number of slices (4-slice, 16-slice, 64-slice CT), reconstruction filters, and patient positioning influence the radiation level as well. Several age-and body weightrelated protocol suggestions have been published and will be reviewed, including recommendations for the amount of intravenous contrast material, speed and site of injection, scanner and post-processing settings. Special focus will be set on lung disease patterns i.e. in sequestration syndrome including congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), intra-and extralobar lung sequestration (ILS, ELS), congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Clinical audits were introduced by the European Union in the Medical Exposure Directive (MED) in 1997. According to the MED directive, clinical audits are a systematic examination or review of medical radiological procedures which seek to improve the quality of patient care. The objective is to avoid unnecessary or excessive exposure to radiation and to improve the quality and effectiveness of medical use of radiation. Finland has been among the first countries to start clinical audits in Europe. According to the Finnish legislation clinical audits have to be carried out every five years in clinics where radiation is used for medical purposes. Clinical audits cover the whole radiological procedure. The auditors monitor agreed standards of good medical practise, legal requirements and safety aspects. Clinical audits are an evaluation of functions and documentation, and concentrate on work of health care professionals, who should be appropriately educated. The auditors produce an independent assessment, report on the findings and make recommendations. The clinic decides which actions it will take based on the recommendations of the clinical audit. Experiences on the first 104 clinical audits in Finland are summarized in a report which shows how the audits have started and the recommendations given to the X-ray departments. Reduction of ionising radiation is the most significant benefit of clinical audits. Clinical audits help to develop the quality system which suggests a mechanism to prevent mistakes. The benefits of clinical audit will be discussed in detail in the presentation. As the principal route whereby most breast carcinomas spread to distant tissues is via the lymphatics, the determination of nodal invasion is of particular importance.The sentinel node hypothesis is based on the fact that sentinel nodes are the first nodes draining a tumor and that their histological status predicts the status of the regional lymphatic basin. Sentinel node biopsy has a success rate of 88%, a sensitivity of 93% and an accuracy of 97%. Using sentinel node biopsy, costs and morbidity of an axillary lymph node dissection can be avoided in nodal negative patients. Lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye injection represent the current gold standard. Technical parameters for sentinel node biopsy vary. Studies differ with respect to many parameters, including the labelling agent (radioisotope, blue dye or both) used for preoperative lymphatic mapping, the volume and site (peritumoral, intradermal, periareolar or intratumoral) of injection, and the interval between injection and surgery. Moreover, recently published studies show serious potentials for PET, MR and even 3-dimensional multidetector-row computed tomography lymphography. Contrast agents allow perfusional studies that increase the sensitivity for small nodal metastases and allow useful monitoring in locally advanced breast cancer. Molecular imaging with optical and near infrared probes may be performed in the near future. Magnetic resonance imaging is one of the very few imaging techniques that require thorough understanding of the underlying physical principles. Without knowledge of these basics interpretation of images is extremely difficult or almost impossible. However, MR physics is complex and therefore difficult to understand for physicians. An expert panel of MR physicists will introduce basic principles of MR physics in a way that beginners but also more advanced users can get a comprehensive insight into the creation of an MR image. Learning Objective: 1. To learn why understanding of MR physics is important for radiologists.",

Speck; Freiburg/DE (oliver.speck@uniklinik-freiburg.de)The Fourier transform is the essential mathematical tool that allows reconstruction of the recorded MR signals into images. However, knowledge and intuition about the Fourier transformation (FT) are often limited among MR users.With simple examples and analogies the FT will be introduced. The acquisition of MR raw data and the reconstruction process are closely related to the concept of kspace. This concept allows to describe many aspects of MR imaging in an intuitive way without the need for exact mathematical formulations of the problem. Thus, the conceptual similarity between read and phase encoding can be explained and the common reconstruction by means of two-dimensional FT becomes clear. Many of the MR imaging properties are governed by the properties of the FT. Image field of view, resolution, fold-over, and motion artifacts are a consequence of the discrete data sampling in k-space and the reconstruction using FT. The processes of image encoding, acquisition and reconstruction will be described and simple, advanced and surprising examples of the role of the FT in MR imaging will be presented. ",

Bittoun; Le Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre/FR (jacques.bittoun@cierm.u-psud.fr)The purpose of this lecture is to introduce the basic physical phenomena driving T1 and T2 values in normal and pathologic tissues. In the presence of a magnetic field Bo, spins of hydrogen nuclei can only adopt two orientations: parallel or antiparallel. Moreover, they are not perfectly aligned but form a small angle with the magnetic field. At equilibrium, since parallel spins are a majority and since there is no preferred orientation in the transverse plane, the macroscopic magnetization in each voxel is parallel to the magnetic field. An RF pulse at resonance has 2 effects: 1) transition of spins from the parallel to the anti-parallel level, 2) relative phasing of spins in the transverse plane. These 2 effects flip the magnetisation from the Bo direction. The return towards equilibrium is similarly the result of 2 phenomena: 1) a return to the initial proportion of spins on the two levels by stimulated transition, resulting in a recovery of the longitudinal magnetization, with a characteristic time T1; 2) spin dephasing due to field heterogeneity at the molecular scale resulting in a decrease of the transverse magnetization with a characteristic time T2. Both phenomena are caused by molecular magnetic interactions depending on molecular mobility: the most mobile molecules have the longest T1 and T2. This explains why fatty tissues have the shortest relaxation times whereas water has the longest ones. Furthermore, pathologic tissues with increased water mobility (edema, water of malignant cells\u2026) have longer T1 and T2 values. ",

Scheffler; Basle/CH Steady state free precession: A steady state can only be reached for sequences with a: 1) fixed TR,2) constant flip angle, and 3) constant dephasing within TR. From point 3 it can be deduced that the phase encoding gradient, which changes from excitation to excitation has to be refocused. Sequences with non-refocused phase encode gradients do not establish a steady state. The steady state magnetization does not depend on the chosen gradient waveform that is switched between the excitation pulses. The steady state magnetization generated just before and after the excitation pulse (sometimes called S+ and S-, respectively) is thus identical for all types of gradient echo sequences. The type of the read-out gradient selects whether the S+ or the S-magnetization (or both) is used for imaging. A conventional bipolar read-out gradient selects the S + signal (refocused FLASH, GRASS, FAST, sometimes FISP, FFE), whereas the time reversed gradient waveform selects the S-signal (PSIF, CE-FAST, CE-FFE).
