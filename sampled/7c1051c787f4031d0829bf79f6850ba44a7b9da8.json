Molecular diagnostics represent an attractive approach for rapid identification of S. aureus and determination of its methicillin resistance. In direct comparison with other molecular assays (sa442 and mecA real time PCRs) and standard laboratory procedures, we evaluated the BD GeneOhm TM StaphSR assay for its use in the detection of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) staphylococci from spiked blood culture bottles (n=134). In case of detecting S. aureus (n=90; MSSA: n=45, MRSA: n=45), the BD GeneOhm TM StaphSR assay had a sensitivity and a specificity of 100% each [95%-confidence interval (CI): 96.0%-100% and 82.4%-100%, respectively]. For MRSA (n=45), the test was 95.6% (95%-CI: 84.9%-99.5%) sensitive and 95.3% (95%-CI: 86.9%-99.0%) specific. Overall, 5 discrepant results arose with this assay due to the presence of methicillin-susceptible, revertant MRSA strains (3/45) and MRSA strains undetected with the BD GeneOhm TM StaphSR assay (2/45). Compared to other real-time-PCR based molecular approaches and to conventional standard laboratory methods, the BD GeneOhm TM StaphSR turned out to be an appropriate diagnostic tool for a rapid (~1.5 hours), preliminary identification of S. aureus and MRSA from blood cultures.",

The detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates (PCs) has been implemented in several blood services as a routine quality control testing, but to date transfusion-transmitted bacterial sepsis has not been completely prevented. In the present study, a novel flow cytometry-based method was developed for the rapid point-of-issue screening of PCs for bacterial contamination. The BactiFlow flow cytometer was used to detect and count bacteria based on esterase activity in viable cells. A protocol for bacterial screening of PCs was established by enzymatic digestion and centrifiltration for the elimination of viable platelets and selective labeling of bacteria with a fluorescent esterase substrate. Results from the BactiFlow (Counts/mL) showed an excellent correlation to plate count results (CFU/mL). The lower detection limit of the assay was determined to 150 CFU/mL, whereas the time-to result was less than 1 hour. We investigated this new application in comparison to incubation (BacT/Alert culture system) and rapid nucleic acid-based or immunoassay detection methods (RT-PCR, Pan Genera Detection Technology). Our study demonstrates that the BactiFlow assay is most suitable for rapid bacterial screening of PCs and fulfils the requirements for a point-of-issuetesting of PCs with acceptable time-to-result, specificity, sensitivity and costs.",

The virus could be propagated in a series of different mammalian cell lines origin. Although SMRV was described to be non-pathogenic to humans or animals reports of its presence in a variety of cell lines led to the suggestion of the ZKBS (Zentrale Kommission f\u00fcr Biologische Sicherheit) that all laboratories in Germany using cell lines for genetic engineering should test them for the occurence of SMRV. We investigated 585 human and animal cell lines of the DSMZ cell bank but only six cell lines were found to be positive for SMRV. Thus, our results show a low abundance of SMRV in certified cell lines. This low infection rate indicates that SMRV is not transmitted by cross contamination comparable to the distribution of mycoplasma or cell line cross contaminations. Both of the latter are major problems for the reproducibility of research results and cell lines have to be controlled continuously. All of the contaminating agents mentioned above have in common that they are difficult to detect and do little harm to their host. Cultivation of obligat intracellular bacteria like Chlamydiaceae or Rickettsiaceae leads to similar problems, here, the curing is extremely difficult. Different contaminating agents as well as control measures against them will be presented and their importance will be discussed.",

Methods: The screening for MRSA by NAT was done only after consultation with the microbiologist. In the initial phase, standard microbiology swabs with amies medium were used. After 8 months, the swabs were changed to dry cotton swabs. Each sample was streaked on Columbia agar plates with 5% sheep blood before performing NAT. The culture was inspected for S. aureuscolonies after 24 and 48 hours and suspect cultures were identified. Both procedures were done from one swab intentionally, although the contact with blood agar could possibly interfere with the result of the NAT. Results: 184 test were evaluated. 14 test had an invalid result, judged by the expert system of the NAT-analyser. Using swabs with amies medium, 8 of 59 (13.5%) samples produced an invalid result. After changing to dry cotton swabs, 6 of 125 samples (4,8%) were invalid. 26 specimens were found MRSA positive. Of these, 22 were found positive by culture, too, 4 remained negative. 2 Patients with different results had been tested MRSA-positive before, so the positive NAT-test was plausible. 1 patient was completely screened after the initially positive result and all other specimens were negative by culture. 1 patient was lost to follow-up. All NAT-negative samples and samples with invalid results were negative by culture. Conclusion: The \"GeneXpert MRSA\"-System showed a good correlation of results to MRSA-screening by culture. Nevertheless, the number of invalid test procedures was relatively high with our sample processing scheme. Blood stream infection by microorganisms is a life-threatening condition accompanied with a high mortality rate especially in critically ill and neutropenic patients. Blood cultures are adviced for the identification of pathogens prior to initiation of antibiotic treatment. The major drawbacks of these diagnostic tools are high rates of false negative results due to inappropriate growth conditions or growth inhibition due to antibiotic treatment and the long time-to-result for detection and identification. Molecular methods including PCR are being discussed as promising tools for the rapid detection of pathogens. In this case report, a patient is reported in whom several repetitive blood cultures were drawn during initiation of antibiotic therapy while in parallel universal 16S rDNA Real-Time PCR was applied using a new test, SepsiTestTM (Molzym, Bremen). Adequate antibiotic treatment, as confirmed later by microbiological testing, was observed to be associated with decreasing bacterial DNA load in the blood samples over time. In conclusion, this case suggests that SepsiTestTM is able to correctly diagnose bacterial blood stream infection. Moreover, the effect of adequate antibiotic treatment can be monitored as decreasing relative bacterial DNA load over successive blood sampling.",

Medicine, Hamburg, Germany 4 Surgery, Hamburg, Germany 5 Microbiology, Institut for Clinical Microbiology, Hamburg, Germany Background: Culture ist the gold standard but time consuming method for detection of bacteria and small colony variants in synovial fluids. To compare a new commercially available real time PCR assay (SeptiFast ROCHE, Switzerland) normally used for blood culture to detect bacteria was used in synovial fluid (SF) . The aim of this study was the earlier and more sensitive detection of a small amount of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, to reduce time to detection and to differentiate between contamination and infection in a material to which this detection method has not been applied before. Methods: SF (30ml) was obtained and SeptiFast was performed according to standard operation procedures, culture was done with 10 ml of SF in aerobic and anaerobic growth media. In preliminary tests detection limit of SeptiFast was tested with Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli, Klebsiella spp. And Enterococci in spiked and culture negative samples of SF. Results: Detection limit of SeptiFast was lower than 10 CFU per ml SF. SF samples were collected from 50 patients. 47 were negative in SeptiFast, 43 in culture. Three isolates of gram negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in culture and SeptiFast. Two out of seven isolates detected by culture could not be recognized with the SeptiFast technique because of lacking in the SeptiFast database. One culture positive result might have been a contamination with Staphylococcus spp. One culture positive result with Staphylococcus epidermidis was not detected by SeptiFast. Conclusions: Synovial fluid is not the main focus for SeptiFast testing. However a fast and sensitive detection of gram negative strains and Staphylococcus aureus is possible within less than 8 hours. Therefore this method is a valuable add to culture in cases of joint infection with the need for an urging decision for therapy. Matrix-assisted laser desorption / ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is a modern technique to identify the species of microorganisms. The advantages of this method are fast reliable species identification, a simple workflow, and low consumable costs. Previously, this method has been successfully applied for scientific research analyses. Here it was examined if MALDI-TOF is a suitable tool for the identification of a broad range of pathogens (bacteria and yeasts) in clinical practice. In a six months period 2837 clinical isolates from routine diagnostic were investigated in parallel by MALDI-TOF anaylsis (microflex-BioTyper, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and by conventional standard methods (biochemical reactions (e.g. api system, oxidase, catalase, etc.), selective media, Gram staining, microscopy, etc.)). In case of contrasting results between MALDI-TOF and standard analysis methods, additional identification techniques (Phoenix \u00ae system and/ or PCR-16S rDNA sequencing) were performed for final differentiation of the isolates. In total, 207 (bacteria 192, yeast 15) species were identified. Almost 97% of the MALDI-TOF identification results corresponded to those of standard methods. Moreover, 71% of MALDI-TOF identification results (29 from 41) were confirmed by Phoenix and/or PCR analyses when MALDI-TOF and standard methods had yielded incongruent results. Therefore it was suggested, that about 98% of examined isolates were identified correctly by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In summary, MALDI-TOF -based identification provides faster and in the long run, more inexpensive bacterial species identification than conventional methods, with high accuracy. Further expansion of the MALDI-TOF database will even enhance the quality of MALDI-TOF identification results.",

Rohde 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Virologie und Hygiene, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a major cause of nosocomial infections. Early detection of potential nosocomial outbreaks and initiation of hospital infection control measures are important steps to limit MRSA dissemination. To reach this goal, timely determination of epidemiologic relatedness of clinical MRSA isolates is essential. Genetic typing methods like pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), spa-typing, or multilocus sequence typing (MLST)) have a high discriminatory power, however, these methods are time consuming and cost intensive, precluding short term typing and broad routine application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the general potential of whole cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) based finger printing for clonal discrimination of clinical MRSA isolates. A total of 32 isolates belonging to 16 spa types from five major clonal lineages (CC5, CC8, CC22, CC30 and CC45) were analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS and protein mass signature based dendrograms were created using the Biotyper software. At a distance level of 200 five major MALDI TOF clusters were distinguished, showing complete concordance with clonal relatedness deduced from spa-typing. To assess the stability of MALDI-TOF-MS spectra as a marker for strain identification, 19 sequential isolates collected from three persistently colonized patients (32, 45 and 48 months) were analyzed by spa-typing, PFGE and MALDI-TOF-MS. Typing results of the genetic methods demonstrated a close relatedness of the sequential isolates of each patient. Accordingly, MALDI-TOF-MS showed clustering of the consecutive isolates of each patient. Our results suggest that MALDI-TOF-MS has the potential to become a valuable tool for inexpensive and rapid typing of MRSA in hospital infection control.",

Different microparticle populations which are defined by varying ratios of two fluorophores are included in the PCR mastermix. Each microparticle population presents a unique gene specific capture probe on the surface. During PCR amplicons are labelled with a reporter dye. Directly after DNA amplification PCR products hybridize to their complementary capture probes on the respective microparticles. Hybridization and thus PCR success is automatically analysed by the VideoScan platform. Up to 96 samples can be analysed in parallel in a conventional 96-well plate format. Here we present data for the amplification of the genes chuA, TspE4C and yiaA which are used to classify E. coli into phylogenetic EcOR groups (Clermont et al. 2000) . The employed four different microparticle populations carry corresponding capture probes and a negative control with an unrelated sequence, respectively.

Speed and accuracy of classical biochemical tests for microbial identification are limited and in many cases not satisfactory. Thus, novel technologies for microorganism species identification have to be introduced into clinical routine. We present the comparison of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry fingerprinting for species identification with the current practice in a Russian clinical laboratory. Microbial species identification for clinical specimen was done in parallel by both traditional microbiological methods and by MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting. Colonies were transferred into 300 \u03bcl of water. After precipitation with ethanol (900 \u03bcl) and centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 10 \u021dL of pure acetonitrile, 10 \u03bcl 70% formic acid, and analyzed in a microflex TM (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) . Generally, 2-3 colonies were analyzed per culture plate. Species identification was done using the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonik, Germany) . In addition, 16S rRNA gene sequencing for discordant results was performed. Microbes from wounds, urine, genital tract, and pharynx of 168 patients were studied. In total, 716 colonies from 585 plates (228 primaries, 178 selective plates and 179 plates for susceptibility testing) were identified using the MALDI Biotyper technique. For 709 of 716 colonies (99%), species identification by both standard laboratory methods and MALDI BiotyperTM were concordant. In 6 cases (1%) discordance between mass spectrometry and microbiological ID was found, and the MALDI identification result could be confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. For only one microorganism, MALDI-TOF MS analysis gave no identification result. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS profiling using the MALDI Biotyper was found to be an excellent method for microbial species identification in a clinical setting.",

The detection of single bacteria cells by micro-Raman spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of approx. 1 \u03bcm provides a fast and sensitive analysis method. The principle of identification is due to the spectroscopic fingerprint of the molecular composition of each bacterium [1] . Compared to established microbiological and molecular-based approaches, one has a perceptible reduction of sample preparation and analysis time. This offers a direct examination of bacterial cells extracted from their natural habitat without pre-cultivation [2, 3] . The hygienically relevant microorganism Pseudomonas is a major cause of nosocomial infection, microbial spoilage of food and hazards in spas and drinking water. These opportunistic organisms are widespread in soil and water areas of the environment. Furthermore their presence often indicates the presence of other waterborne microbes. A fast and reliable screening tool for Pseudomonas is necessary for limiting the impact of a contamination. In this context, single bacteria cells of different Pseudomonas species are investigated. Species identification is preformed on a Raman spectroscopic database and by the usage of chemometric methods.

This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical use of different MRSA-screening protocols used in current diagnostic. Methods: A total of 3503 consecutive specimens from patients with suspected MRSA colonization or infection from routine screening in two laboratories were included. The gold standard was defined as the combination of culture on selective, chromogenic media (SCM), non-selective media (NSM) and enrichment broth (EB) for 48 hours with an aditional subculture on SCM from the EB after 24 hours. Comparison was made to 24-hour screening (SCM+NSM) , screening using one selective, chromogenic medium only (48 hours) and 48-hour screening (SCM+NSM) without EB. Results: A total of 376 MRSA were detected. Among those, 71 (19%) were detected only by subculture from EB on SCM after 24 hour incubation. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV in comparison to the gold standard were as follows: 6; 100, 0; 99, 5; 95, 0; 5; 100, 0; 99, 7; 97, 6; 1; 100, 0; 99, 7; 97, 8, respectively. Conclusion: Despite similar NPV values, sensitivity of culture based screening for MRSA is significantly lower if EB is not subcultured or incubation times of less than 48 hours are used. Using protocols that deviate from the gold standard in the routine microlab, 19% of MRSA positive patients would not have been detected in our study.",

Species and subspecies affiliation of all tested strains was confirmed by 16S rDNA-and 23S rDNA -sequence analysis. Of the 95 substrates belonging to this system, nine were oxidized by all Francisella-strains tested, 46 were oxidized by none of the strains tested, and 40 were oxidized differentially. Francisella tularensis and F. philomiragia as well as the F. tul. subspecies tularensis, subsp. holarctica, subsp. mediasiatica, and subsp. novicida could be distinguished by their respective patterns of reactions. This extended carbon source utilization method analysing different metabolic reactions may be used in the future as a method for the biochemical identification and differentiation of strains belonging to the genus Francisella within 24 hours. This method may further be used for the analysis and the characterization of new Francisella species and subspecies. In the last years Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for the analysis of single cells or even tissue. For in-vivo spectroscopy information about the cell components of living cells are analysed without destroying them. With the aid of micro-Raman spectroscopy it is possible to resolve textures up to the submicron range and to record Raman spectra within such a spatial resolution. The focus of our work lies in the identification of microorganisms without the need for any cultivation step. Micro-Raman spectroscopy reveals a spatial resolution of approx. 1 \u03bcm which is quite in the size range of bacteria.",

            "text": "[1] The combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy and different chemometric approaches allows for the identification of bacteria even on strain level. [2] However, for real samples a localization step is necessary prior to identification. The localization of microorganisms in complex sample matrixes like e.g. air or food samples is often complicated, since many particles exhibit similar size and shape compared to microorganisms. Therefore, a localization routine has to be established which allows for the differentiation of biotic and abiotic particle. One possible approach is the use of fluorescence staining. Since fluorescence is several orders of magnitude stronger than Raman spectroscopy the right combination of fluorescence imaging and Raman spectroscopic is necessary to identify microorganisms on a single cell level. [3] Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are part of the commensal microbiotia of humans and account for about one-third of the anaerobic isolates recoverd from clinical material. Lately, the taxonomy of GPAC has changed dramatically and the former genus Peptostreptococcus was divided into six phylogenetic groups and genera were proposed: Parvimonas, Finegoldia, Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Peptostreptococcus, and Gallicola. The phenotypic identification of GPAC is not always straightforward and some species cannot be easily differentiated from each other. Various molecular methods to identify GPAC have become available together with approaches based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For the present study GPAC strains were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS applying a simple, standardized preparation protocol. All strains proved to be accessible to mass spectral analysis without constraint, even after storage of the agar plates at aerobe conditions for 24 hours. The resulting mass spectra were evaluated for their taxonomic resolution with SARAMIS (Spectral Archive and Microbial Identification System). Mass spectral patterns were highly reproducible and specific. A dendrogram based on similarities in mass spectral patterns had a similar topology than a 16S rDNA gene sequence tree. GPAC species can thus be easily distinguished from each other by mass spectrometry. For one species complex, Peptoniphilus ivorii s.l., several distinct types could be discerned, questioning the coherence of this species. To test the identification performance, mass spectral data of 88 sequenced clinical isolates were fed to the SARAMIS database and applied to the analysis of 108 blinded samples. 97 were identified correctly while of the 11 remaining 7 could not be identified unambiguously by molecular methods. The high success rate underlines the high potential of MALDI/SARAMIS for the rapid identification of anaerobes within minutes.",

In Germany, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) is the responsible CA for most IVD (only few IVD (no analysers), specified in Annex II of the Directive are under the responsibility of the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI)). Until end of 2007 the BfArM received a total of 1471 reports regarding IVD. From these 70 related to laboratory analysers for infection diagnostics (54) and their general consumables (16) were analysed in respect to the type of risk caused by the reported product failure. In the analyser group 6 cases were characterised by direct harm for laboratory personnel and 48 cases by indirect harm for patients. In detail, the risks for direct harm caused by analysers were electrical shock and burn (3), infection (2), and mechanical hurts (1), whereas patients are at risk due to erroneous or delayed results. In consumables 4 cases were related to risk for direct harm (infection) and 12 to risks for indirect harm (erroneous or delayed results), respectively. As expected, product related analyses revealed infection risk especially in analysers and consumables for diagnostics based on cultural and molecular biological methods, i. e. methods based on analysis of fresh samples. Interestingly, 3 cases (30 %) of direct harm (analysers: 1, consumables: 2) were caused by user errors. However, even though there was a relevant risk for direct harm there were no reports of severe outcomes. Our results suggest that IVD for infection diagnostics not only bear a risk for patients by misdiagnosis but also bear a relevant risk for direct harm of users (lab personnel) which should be considered accordingly by users and manufacturers.",

However, the occurrence of other yeast species in dermatological samples has to be considered and rapid identification methods are required for reliable identification of these uncommon pathogens for adequate treatment. We analysed yeast specimen from dermatological samples by MALDI-TOF MS, a technology for microbiological identification that is currently replacing classical methodologies in medical mycology. Yeast cells were prepared in for mass spectrometry directly from agar plates applying a standardized protocol and analysed automatically. Mass spectra of samples were matched against the database of SARAMIS (Spectral Archiving And Microbial Identification System) containing mass spectral data of a high number of reference strains. Among 104 blinded isolates, 98 could be identified as common yeast species, consistent with results from ID 32 C analyses. For 80 these isolates, the mass spectral patterns showed similarities to those of frequently encountered Candida species, e.g. C. albicans and C. glabrata. Of the remaining isolates, several showed no similarity to Candida sp. in mass spectral patterns and could subsequently be identified unambiguously as species of the genera Pichia, Issatchenkia, Rhodotorula, and Trichosporon. For the remaining six isolates, mass spectral data of corresponding reference strains have not been available at the time of the first analyses but were collected consecutively. MALDI-TOF MS/SARAMIS has been successfully applied to the rapid and reliable identification of the majority of yeast isolates. The system further proved to be highly adaptive for the recognition and identification of rare fungal pathogens through directed database extension.",

M\u00fcller 1 , T. Fenner 1 1 Bakteriologie, Labor Dr. Fenner und Kollegen, Hamburg, Germany The application of the MALDI-TOF receives more and more interest in microbiological laboratory diagnostic. In comparison to classical automated identification systems the rapidity of bacterial identification is outstanding. However, the reliability of identification needs to be verified. Clinical culture sample isolates were tested in parallel using either one of the two automated systems (Vitek2, Biomerieux; MicroScan, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) or 16S rDNA sequencing and the MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics). We used the smear method for sample application on the MALDI-TOF target, no extraction protocol was performed. Two spots of each sample were applied on the MALDI-TOF target, one was covered with formic acid (80%) before adding the matrix. 137 isolates (92 gram+, 45 gram-) were tested using MALDI-TOF and Vitek2, 55 isolates (46 gram+, 9 gram-) using MALDI-TOF and 16S rDNA and 260 Isolates (25 gram+, 135 gram-) using MALDI-TOF and MicroScan. Identical identifications were found in 90% comparing MALDI-TOF and Vitek2, 50% comparing MALDI-TOF and 16S rDNA and 80% comparing MALDI-TOF and MicroScan. Almost all ambiguous results reported using the Vitek2 and 16S rDNA sequencing were due to Streptococcus sp. in the MALDI-TOF system. 18 results of the 16S rDNA showed no results in the MALDI-TOF, 9 of the unidentified bacteria were not included in the MALDI-TOF database. The identification results of the MALDI-TOF were superior for gram+ and gramaerobe bacteria compared to the MicoScan. The application of formic acid (80%) yielded better identification scores in gram+ bacteria. MALDI-TOF is a useful and rapid method to identify bacteria species in routine microbiological laboratory diagnostic and extends the identification spectra of automated systems. In general, all results of the MALDI-TOF should be reviewed, especially the identification results of uncommon bacteria and bacteria that are usually difficult to identify.",

The study criteria include performance time, accuracy and easy to use of the method. An answer shall be given to whether this novel system is a future alternative to the biochemical test systems. Methods: 200 yeast and 1100 bacterial isolates obtained form clinical samples were investigated in parallel on the MALDI-TOF system (Microflex/BioTyper, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and by using biochemical test system such as API \u00ae (bioM\u00e9rieux) and Phoenix (Becton Dickinson). In case of incongruent results in these systems, sequencing of 16S-rDNA genes was performed for final molecular differentiation of the isolates. Results: Bacterial isolates comprised of 400 isolates of different members of Enterobacteriaceae, 300 non-fermenting gram negative rods, 110 other gramnegative bacteria, 180 staphylococci, 80 streptococci and 40 gram-positive rods (e.g. corynebacteriae). The time for differentiation was less than 2 min for most isolates. In 92,9% identical results were obtained with both systems, in 3,2% the MALDI was inferior, in 3,9% superior to biochemical test. Conclusion: The MALDI-TOF enables bacterial and fungal differentiation yet does not provide substantial data on antibiotic resistance of the isolate. The bacteria culture on plate is required as it is not suitable for detection of bacteria directly from clinical sample. However, the MALDI-TOF based method for bacterial differentiation provides reliable results within minutes, it is easy to perform and enables genotyping to a certain extend. Enlargement of the MALDI-database will further improve this method. Even though the initial acquisition of the MALDI-TOF apparatus is expensive, there are essentially no costs for consumables, making this system especially interesting for large scale diagnostic laboratories. Identification of anaerobes requires often laborious and expensive methods. MALDI-TOF-MS offers the possibility for a rapid and cost-effective identification of microorganisms including anaerobic species. MALDI-TOF-MS identification is based on the comparison of a spectrum of mass signals of an isolate with a variety of spectra stored in a database (DB). Here we describe the amplification of the SARAMIS database (SDB, Anagnostec) for clinically relevant anaerobic species by spectra obtained with a MALDI-TOF-MS (Shimadzu). One of the key features of the SDB is the differentiation of spectra (SP) and SuperSpectra (SSP). A SSP contains characteristic mass signals of a certain species. Aligments with SSPs allows faster and more precise identifications compared to alignments with single spectra. The SDB comprises >60.000 spectra and >1600 SSP but less than 10% of both regarding anaerobic species. In order to establish MALDI-TOF-MS as the standard identification method for anaerobes, an influence of culture media, exposition to oxygen of the culture and of the matrix embedded sample was excluded by testing a set of 5 reference strains. In comparison to standard identification methods, 50 clinical isolates mainly belonging to Bacteroides species and Finegoldia magna could easily and accurately be identified by MALDI-TOF and SDB. In contrast, for identification of Porphyromonas, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species the SDB did not contain sufficient data. Therefore spectra from 20 different species from the a.m. genera were obtained and analysed. For creating a SSP it is essential that the spectra of strains belonging to a certain species cluster inside their species and show a clear difference to spectra of other species (e.g. Fusobacterium varium). In contrast, many Prevotella species showed larger heterogeneity. Some isolates showed marked differences to other strains within the same species requiring a re-identification concerning ongoing taxonomic developments.",

Autenrieth 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI-TOF) is increasingly used for identification of bacterial isolates. Here we describe the implementation of this methodology (Shimadzu/Anagnostec) in the workflow of our laboratory. In the beginning MALDI-TOF-MS analyses (MTA) were performed from Columbia-blood agar plates only. When influence of different culture media on MTA results has been excluded, the following analyses were performed in parallel to standard identification procedures from the same media. In case of discrepant results obtained by standard methods and MTA, additional identification assays or gene sequence analysis have been performed. After evaluation of 550 parallel tested isolates including 29 reference strains, incorrect MTA results were obtained in only 0.9%. 14 isolates could not be clearly identified by either MTA or reference methods. Mainly due to lacks in technical skills, in 9.5% of the tests no MTA results were obtained. Identification rate e.g. of Enterococcus faecium raised from 63.8% in the beginning up to 94.1% later on. As a consequence, MTA was accepted as the standard identification method when at least 14 of 15 different strains of a certain species were correctly identified. After four months application the identification of more than 80% of the clinical isolates (>1.500 strains) was based on MTA. In order to assess reproducibility, all MTA tests were performed in duplicates. At the beginning of the implementation discrepant results were found in 15% which declined rapidly to 5%. For quality control of the measuring system 2 spots of Escherichia coli ATCC8739 were applied at the beginning and the end of each sample target. Given an adequate technical training MTA is an accurate, rapid and cost-effective identification system suitable for most clinical relevant aerobic species. In contrast to other identification systems, the SARAMIS database (Anagnostec) allows amendments of additional species regarding to individual requirements. The identification of microorganisms from clinical samples by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is currently implemented in diagnostic laboratories as a rapid and cost-effective method. In March 2009, the \"Medizinische Laboratorien D\u00fcsseldorf\" received the official accreditation for the identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF MS/ SARAMIS (Spectral Archive and Microbial Identification System) from \"Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle Chemie\" (DACH). As a prerequisite, the performance of SARAMIS was tested rigorously by analysing sets of reference strains and clinical isolates. It could be shown that physico-chemical factors (e.g. cell number, matrix amount) and biotic factors (e.g. incubation time and temperature, growth media) had only limited effects on the performance and, most important, did not result in false identification results. Only when mixtures of two species were analysed, in one out of 84 analyses a false identification was obtained. Identical experiments were performed independently in two laboratories with nearly the same results, confirming the high reproducibility of the system. As a next step, 816 Enterobacteriaceae isolates from routine samples were identified both by biochemical methods and by SARAMIS. In summary, the SARAMIS system had a higher drop-out rate but a very low rate of false results compared to the biochemical identification systems. The latter showed incorrect identification of 5.5% of the strains after the first analysis, and by means of a second analysis the error rate could be reduced to 1.0%. In contrast, the error rate of MALDI-TOF MS was only 0.1% due to the identification of a single Citrobacter youngae strain as C. freundii. The SARAMIS identification of further groups of clinically relevant bacteria has also been validated and accredited. For these microorganisms routine identification is now performed mostly by MALDI-TOF MS.",

Splettstoesser 1 1 Abteilung f\u00fcr Immunologie und Epidemiologie, Institut f\u00fcr Mikrobiologie der Bundeswehr, M\u00fcnchen, Germany 2 Microbiological Applications, Bremen, Germany Aims: The bacterial species Francisella tularensis causes Tularemia and is regarded as a potential agent of bioterrorism. The phenotypic discrimination of closely related, but differently virulent Francisella tularensis subspecies with traditional phenotyping methods is difficult and time-consuming. To overcome these challenges, we tested the ability of Mass Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization -Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to identify and discriminate different strains of the genus Francisella at species and subspecies level. Methods: Reference spectra from representative strains of all clinically relevant Francisella species and subspecies were established and evaluated for their capability to correctly identify 55 blind-coded Francisella strains within a database including the Francisella reference spectra as well as spectra of 2506 other (mainly clinical relevant) microorganisms. As a reference method for identification of F. tularensis subspecies, 23S rDNA sequencing was used. Results: All blind-coded strains were correctly identified according to their designated species and subspecies, showing no cross identification with other microorganisms within the database. An evident discrimination on species and subspecies level was observed by cluster analysis and principle component analysis. The identification of Francisella strains was highly reproducible under different conditions. Conclusions: Proper identification of F. tularensis subspecies from clinical specimen or environmental samples is of major concern in the context of bioterrorism and the establishment of reliable prognostic measurements for the patient. This study proofed the ability of MALDI-TOF MS to reliably identify and distinguish F. tularensis subspecies, without the challenges related to other phenotyping methods. MALDI-TOF MS can provide subspecies identification within 30 minutes after obtaining an isolate.",

The standard method for laboratory diagnosis of Pneumocystis infection is based on the microscopic detection of Pneumocystis organisms in respiratory specimens. However this method has been established and evaluated primarily in HIV positive patients with suspected Pneumocystis infection. Therefore, only limited are data available for the accuracy of microscopy for the detection of Pneumocystis in immunocompromised patients without HIV. Because these patients usually present with a much lower amount of Pneumocystis organisms in respiratory specimens we evaluated the impact of quantitative real time PCR to provide higher sensitivity and specificity in addition to microscopy. We compared the results of immunofluorescent microscopy for P. jirovecii with a quantitative real-time PCR targeting the msg-gene of P. jirovecii in 382 patients. In 79% was microscopy was negative, while PCR was positive. Only in 21 % microscopy and PCR were both positive. In addition, no cases of negative PCR and positive microscopy were observed. The quantity of genomeequivalents per ml ranged between 10E1 and 10E7 in all samples analysed. To determine the applicability of a cut-off value for asymptomatic carriage we analysed 70 respiratory samples of non-immunocompromised patients for the presence of P. jirovecii by PCR as a control. However, all these samples proved to be negative for P. jirovecii. In our opinion quantitative real-time PCR is superior to conventional microscopy in the diagnosis of PcP in immunocompromised patients. In our study nearly 80% of PCR-positive patient would have been falsely classified as PcP negative by standard microscopy. In addition, we found no asymptomatic carriage of Pneumocystis in our non-immunocompromised control group which is in contrast to previous reports.",

Current microbiological and moleculargenetic methods are both limited due to false negative results. In the present study, a new moleculargenetic diagnostic strategy to improve the detection of pathogens in heart valves from patients with IE was evaluated. 357 heart valves (HV) surgically removed from 326 patients with proven IE, suspicious intra-operative morphological findings, or comorbidities associated with increased infectious risks, were examined by 16S rDNA PCR conventional PCR and HV cultures. Retained samples of 200 HV were analyzed by real-time PCR targeting bacterial 23S rDNA, fungal 28S rDNA, and mycoplasmal tuf gene. Patients were classified into four categories: active IE, IE with ambiguous infective status, healed IE and valve diseases but no IE. PCR and culture methods were retrospectively analyzed according to their predictive value. 16S rDNA PCR revealed 80.6% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value (PPV), and 71% negative predictive value (NPV), compared to cultivation with 33.4%, 96.6%, 95.5%, and 40.9%, respectively. Use of real-time PCR increased diagnostic sensitivity to 96.4%, and NPV to 92.5%. Bacterial load, C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cells (WBC) decreased during antibiotic treatment. Bacterial load showed no correlation to CRP or WBC, while CRP and WBC were significantly correlated. In conclusion, 23S rDNA real-time PCR of surgically removed HV improves the diagnosis of IE. For patients with culture negative IE, PCR assays of explanted heart valves are of high prognostic impact.",

Hoerauf 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Immunologie und Parasitologie (IMMIP), Universit\u00e4tsklinik Bonn, Bonn, Germany Introduction: In non endemic countries a steady rise in cases of imported schistosomiasis has been observed. Infection is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical data and laboratory assays. Screening by stool and urine microscopy for eggs is not sensitive enough to detect all infections but serology is accepted as the most appropriate diagnostic method. Among the various antibody techniques developed there exist only few which are sensitive enough for the diagnosis of both, acute and chronic schistosomiasis and cases of low worm burden. The IFAT which detects antibodies to gut-associated antigens (GAA) of adult S. mansoni worms meets all requirements but is not commercialized. Aim: Our study aimed to evaluate the antibody dynamics in patients with acute and chronic infection before and after specific treatment. The IFAT (GAA) with adult S. mansoni worms was used as reference test for a commercially available Western Blot assay (LDBio). The western Blot (WB) is described as a test with good sensitivity and excellent specificity for the detection or confirmation of schistosomiasis (Sulahian et al, 2005) . Patients (n= 13; 11 travellers, 2 immigrants) were preselected according to the following aspects: schistosoma-infection proven by seroconversion by IFAT (n= 8) or microscopy for eggs (n=5), treatment with Praziquantel (at least 40mg/kg BW as a single dose), follow up period 1 year. Three patients showed symptoms typical for Katayama fever at their first presentation. Altogether, 53 serum samples were tested in the IFAT and 35 in the WB. Result: None of the sera from patients with early acute infection and an IFATfluorescence pattern restricted to gut-associated antigens met the criteria for a positive WB result ( 5 specific bands). Only serum samples from chronically infected, eggs excreting immigrants showing an IFAT-fluorescence pattern equally distributed through the worm tissue produced a positive WB profile. Negative or non-specific WB profiles did not convert to positivity during or after treatment. Conclusion: The LDBio WB assay is not a suitable test system for the diagnosis of primary acute and chronic schistosomiasis in travellers originating from non endemic countries. The diagnostic value of different assays in different population groups is discussed.",

Thus, we applied Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) in the anodic potential range to suspensions of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans and of the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and obtained an oxidation peak at + 750 mV. The peak potential was independent on the respective yeast strain, but was shifted with peak scan rate indicating an irreversible electrochemical reaction. The peak current increased linearly with yeast cell numbers in the range from 0.33 to 1.6 x 107 cells / mL. To elucidate the electron transfer step, which underlies the electrochemical signal, we investigated the influence of the electron transport chain inhibitors rotenone, antimycin A and potassium cyanide on the signal. Only cyanide decreased the signal, pointing to cytochrome c oxidase (COX) as relevant protein complex. Thus, we further applied single gene deletion mutants of nuclear COX subunits of S. cerevisiae. Deletion of subunits COX5a or COX5b eliminated the signal almost totally. These subunits influence the accessibility of heme a3 for electron transfer from heme a, so that we suggest that the electrochemical signal is due to an electron shuttling mechanism from the heme a to heme a3 electron transfer step in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) to the outer parts of the cell wall to allow the interaction with electrodes. Therefore, this method is recommended as a diagnostic method for the mitochondrial disease and/or mitochondrial defects in eukaryotic microorganisms.",

Graeser 1 1 Institute for Microbiology and Hygiene, Charit\u00e9 -University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany During the last years an increasing number of studies have been published dealing with the development of molecular methods to detect dermatophytes from clinical specimens. The main advantages when compared to the gold standard (microscopy, culture) are the accurate species diagnosis and the saving of time. Here we describe a PCR-ELISA method for the diagnosis of seven dermatophyte species. The probes used for the assay were designed and their specificity and sensitivity were tested using DNA extracted from cultures. Both regions of the ribosomal DNA (ITS1 and ITS2) were amplified in the first round PCR because of the polymorphisms used to separate close related species. A second amplification step was implemented to increase the sensitivity because previous results have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the PCR ELISA is dropped down when long fragments are used. Therefore ITS1 and ITS2 regions were amplified separately with panfungal primers producing approx. 350 bp fragments. Eight specific probes were developed for the detection of Trichophyton rubrum, T. interdigitale, T. tonsurans, T. verrucosum, Microsporum canis, Epidermophyton floccosum and the Trichophyton species of Arthroderma benhamiae. The ELISA assay is also able to differentiate between zoophilic and anthropophilic T. interdigitale strains. The sensitivities of the probes were evaluated with dilutions of standard DNA. For M. canis and T. tonsurans, it was impossible to develop a specific probe. But a single nucleotide polymorphism was enough to differentiate between zoophilic and anthropophilic T. interdigitale strains. The sensitivity testing of the assay resulted in a detection limit of 10pg with most of the eight probes. As a conclusion, this is the first PCR assay which is able to differentiate among close related species that are not differentiated by other in house PCRs. Protozoan coccidial parasites of the genus Cryptosporidium cause cryptosporidiosis, an intestinal disease of humans and animals world wide. The prevalence in Ethiopia has been reported to range from 8.1% in children younger than five years to 25.9% in adult AIDS patients. However, no studies have molecularly characterized Cryptosporidium isolates in Ethiopia. In this study, 1034 faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea were screened for Cryptosporidium oocysts. Samples were collected from 9 different regions in Ethiopia. Of these, 79 samples (7.6%) were positive for Cryptosporidium by modified Ziehl-Neelson staining. DNA was extracted from all positive samples and PCR amplification of the COWP, SSU-rRNA and GP60 gene fragments was performed. A total of 41 samples (52 %) were positive in any of the three typing methods. Using Ase I-RFLP for the SSU-rRNA, Rsa I-RFLP for the COWP and/or sequencing of the GP60-PCR products, the majority of isolates (39 of 41) was identified as C. parvum, with one C. hominis and one mixed infection. Sequencing of the GP60 gene fragments of 13 isolates resulted in three different subgenotypes of C. parvum, all belonging to the zoonotic allele family IIa and one subgenotype of C. hominis (Ib) . This is the first study on the molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates associated with human cryptosporidiosis in Ethiopia. We identified C. parvum as the major cause of human cryptosporidiosis in Ethiopia which suggests a zoonotic source and transmission of the disease rather than anthroponotic transmission of C. hominis as reported from other developing countries.",

Schistosomes represent the only trematodes being dioecious, and they exhibit a nearly unique biological phenomenon -the pairing-dependent induction and maintenance of the sexual maturation of the female. During the constant pairing-contact the male induces the proliferation and differentiation of cells in the reproductive organs of the female. This is a prerequisite for egg production leading to the pathogenesis of this parasite. During the last years we have cloned genes encoding for signal transduction proteins. To elucidate their function we used a combination of standard and novel techniques. These included localization studies, the treatment of adult schistosomes cultured in vitro with chemical inhibitors, RNAi to posttranscriptionally silence gene function, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to study the morphological consequences of these experimental approaches. The application of these methods led to the identification of a Syk kinase as key molecule for gonad development and to the postulation of a first model of communicating signalling pathways including receptor tyrosine kinases, integrin-and G protein-coupled receptors, which are active in the ovary of females regulating mitogenic activity and differentiation. Some of these pathways are also active in the testes of males, probably fulfilling similar roles as in the ovary. These findings provide first evidence for the involvement of a Syk kinase during gonad development in eukaryotes. In addition, the elucidation of signalling processes controlling reproduction in schistosomes opens novel perspectives to fight this parasite.",

Not only HIV infection, but life-prolonging technologies -more invasive treatments, transplant therapy and anticancer drugs -have provided an opportunity for fungi to colonize and cause serious infections in humans. Treatment, especially of systemic infections, largely relies on chemotherapy, and is limited by the high cost of the most potent antifungals. As a consequence, infections by fungal pathogens represent a significant health problem and an economical burden for society. To identify novel compounds with antifungal activity we have developed an assay which allows not only for identifying tolerable and potent antimicrobial agents in compound libraries, but also covers all potential in vitro targets of both the pathogen and the host simultaneously. The assay mimics the smallest unit of a natural infection by incubation of host cells in the presence of the compounds and the pathogen, e.g. Candida albicans, the predominant cause of fungal infections. Host cell survival is determined to asses the efficiency and selectivity of the respective compound. In addition to the minimal inhibitory concentration for the pathogen, this test system simultaneously provides the tolerability of the active compound by the host cells, expressed as selectivity index. Using this assay system ~100 000 compound derived from pre-selected basic chemical structures have been screened. One of the hits identified in the compound library was investigated in more detail by chemical modification of the lead structure, target identification using transcriptional profiling of C. albicans and the use of tissue models derived from primary cells as second test system with the aim to block fungal infections. In addition the most effective compound identified is currently tested against other fungal species including Aspergillus spp and other Candida spp.",

Zellul\u00e4re Chemie, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany In Candida albicans mannosylation of inositol-phosphorylceramide by the CaMIT1 protein is an essential step in the formation of complex sphingolipids and of phosphomannan, a major PAMP (pathogen associated molecular pattern) of this fungal pathogen (Jouault et al. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188:165-72) . The genome of Aspergillus fumigatus harbours only one gene encoding a protein that is homologous to CaMIT1 and the orthologous SUR1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have deleted this gene and complemented the resulting \u01fbsurA mutant. As expected, isolation of hyphal glycolipids revealed a block in the first step of mannosyl-inositol-phosphorylceramide synthesis resulting in absence of complex glycolipids. However, the deletion mutant had no apparent growth or sporulation defect on different media and at different temperatures (20-48\u00baC) . In contrast to the Candida MIT1 or yeast SUR1 mutant, A. fumigatus \u01fbsurA was insensitive to moderate concentrations of Ca 2+ (25 mM), but exhibited an apparent growth defect at tenfold higher Ca 2+ concentration that could not be compensated by osmotic stabilization. Addition of copper has been shown to prevent growth inhibition by Ca 2+ in the S. cerevisiae SUR1 mutant. We observed a similar effect for the \u01fbsurA mutant and found that A. fumigatus is generally more sensitive to copper than S. cerevisiae. Finally, since phospholipomannan has been shown to be a major PAMP of C. albicans, we analyzed the importance of SurA for the interaction of A. fumigatus with the innate immune system by infecting primary murine macrophages with the mutant, parental and complemented strains. Analysis of the cytokine response revealed no significant differences. This demonstrates that in contrast to C. albicans, mannosyl-inositol-phosphorylceramide-derived glycolipids of A. fumigatus are not recognized by murine pattern recognition receptors.",

Zipfel 1 1 Department of Infection Biology, Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology (Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute) , Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus which causes diseases particularly in immunocompromised patients. Interaction of C. albicans with the human host is primarily mediated by components found on ist cell surface. It has been previously reported by our laboratory that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (Gpm1p) is a surface protein expressed by both yeast and hyphal forms of C. albicans. Surface Gpm1p binds Factor H, Factor H-like protein and plasminogen which helps the fungus to evade the innate immune system and degrade the extracellular matrix. This study aims to identify other roles of Gmp1p at the surface in the interaction of C. albicans with the human host. Recombinant Gpm1p was shown to bind vitronectin (Vn), a glycoprotein which is a constituent of the human serum and a component of the extracellular matrix. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Vn bound to the immobilized recombinant Gpm1p in a concentration-dependent manner. This binding was inhibited by heparin which suggests that Vn binds to Gpm1p through ist heparin-binding site. The role of surface Gpm1p in the binding of Vn from human serum was confirmed by blocking assays in whole-cell ELISA, flow cytometry and Western blotting. When heat-inactivated human serum was pre-incubated with an increasing amount of Gpm1p, a decreasing amount of acquired Vn was detected on the surface of C. albicans. This was also true when Gpm1p on cell surface was blocked with polyclonal antibody against the protein. In addition, recombinant Gpm1p bound to both endothelial and epithelial human cells. The concentration-dependent binding of Gpm1p to the cells was shown by flow cytometry. These results imply that Gpm1p has multiple roles on the surface of C. albicans and that it is used by the fungus to bind soluble host proteins and to directly bind and interact with human cells.",

Often called Aspf1, this protein is also known to trigger the maturation of immature dendritic cells. Mitogillin, with and without a C-terminal HA tag, was cloned into a yeast expression vector down stream of a secretion signal sequence and under the control of an alcohol oxidase promoter, regulated and induced by methanol, and transformed into Pichia pastoris. Mitogillin secreted into the medium was concentrated and, using this purified protein we intend to study its enzymatic activity and toxicity in several mammalian cell lines as well as in primary human macrophages.",

These yeasts are phenotypically and genetically highly similar. Phenotypic methods have failed to fulfill the expectations of required discriminative power for definite identification of these four yeasts and even molecular genetic based diagnostic tools may be impeded since sequences of respective gene regions differ only by one or two base pairs. Based on the internal transcribed spacer sequences (ITS1 and ITS2) an oligonucleotide array was developed for differentiation of these GFYs. Using an especially designed set of oligonucleotide probes in a commercially available chip based hybridization assay 76 GFYs strains predominantly obtained from culture collections were tested and identified as C. albicans (n = 9), C. dubliniensis (n = 5), C. africana (n = 33) and C. \"stellatoidea\" (n = 29). The obtained species assignment was confirmed by sequence analyses of the nuclear ITS1 and ITS2 region, which revealed a species-specific ITS2 barcode (alignment position 138-141 in U96719) for these four yeasts i.e. TACT, C. africana; CACC, C. albicans; GCCC, C. dubliniensis; TACC, C. \"stellatoidea\". Based on chip hybridization results and species confirmation by sequence analysis, of the 27 C. albicans strains obtained from culture collections 17 were reclassified as C. \"stellatoidea\". All of the slow growing and difficult-to-identify strains of C. africana were clearly separated from the other GFYs by the DNA chip.",

C. albicans strains that are homozygous at the mating type locus can reversibly switch from the normal yeast form (white) to an elongated cell form (opaque), which is the mating competent form of the fungus. Both cell types differ in their ability to colonize and infect various tissues; therefore, switching may allow C. albicans a better adaptation to different host niches. White-opaque switching occurs spontaneously at a low frequency and is controlled by several positively and negatively acting transcription factors, which form a transcriptional feedback loop that ensures the semi-stable maintenance of the two phases. However, white-opaque switching can also be induced by environmental signals, indicating that upstream regulators may control the activity of these transcription factors in response to such signals. In order to systematically search for such regulators, we expressed all putative protein kinases, phosphatases, and their regulators (123 kinases, 25 kinase regulators, 39 phosphatases, and 6 phosphatase regulators, which were identified in the C. albicans genome), as well as 31 predicted hyperactive or dominant-negative alleles of these genes from a tetracycline-inducible promoter in the whiteopaque switching-competent MTLalpha strain WO-1. Screening of this library of strains identified four protein kinases whose forced expression efficiently stimulated white cells to switch to the opaque phase. Results of the functional analysis of these kinases, their relationship to the known regulators of whiteopaque switching, and their importance in the transduction of environmental signals that influence switching will be presented.

Routine procedures for dermatophyte and mold identification rely on an examination of strain characteristics and microscopic morphology. Conventional methods used to identify dermatophytes and molds are often time-consuming and may be inconclusive because of atypical microscopic or colony morphology. The present study evaluates a promising alternative based on the analysis of clinical fungal isolates by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 63 isolates belonging to 27 species of dermatophytes and molds were analyzed. The isolates were obtained from reference samples (\"Ringversuchsproben\", INSTAND e.V., n= 17) as well as from reliable identified clinical isolates from a variety of specimens including skin, nail scrapings and hair fragments. The clinical isolates were obtained from the University Hospital of Zurich (Department of Dermatology, n= 30) and from the Synlab Laboratory Leinfelden (n=16). Because many fungi attached very strong to agar, sample harvesting without agar contamination was not possible. Therefore, the isolates were additionally inoculated in liquid culture media. Almost 93% (59 of 63) of the MALDI-TOF identification results matched to those of conventional methods respectively to the identity of the reference samples. Four mismatches were obtained from clinical isolates. Trichophyton mentagropytes var. Interdigitale was identified incorrectly as Trichophyton tonsurans (n= 4). However these mismatches arise from database discrepancy and could be eliminated by further development of the database.In Summary, MALDI-TOF analyses of common dermatophytes and molds resulted in reliable species identification. Furthermore, this procedure allowed very rapid identification results. The isolates could be identified already after a growth time of 4-14 days, when inoculated in liquid culture media.",

In immunocompromised patients it causes a usually fatal invasive disease. As could be shown in animal models a protective immune response can be established after survival of an invasive aspergillosis. This indicates that A. fumigatus expresses antigens during infection which may induce a protective immune reaction. Based on sera of rabbits of a sublethal model of invasive aspergillosis an A. fumigatus-cDNA-expression-library was screened for reactive antigen-clones. Altogether, 36 different cDNAs were identified (Denikus et al. Infect & Immun 2005, 73:4704) . As a proof of concept, among those were also Aspf3 and Aspf16, the only single antigens so far known, for which the induction of a protective immune response had been shown in animal vaccination trials. Based on the isolated cDNAs, expression plasmids were constructed and corresponding proteins were produced in a recombinant manner in E. coli. Among theose proteins were e.g.: Aminopeptidase, heat shock proteins, cell wall associated proteins, proteins involved in protein-binding in general, a cell surface antigen, and different conserved hypothetical proteins without known function. Secondary A. fumigatus knockout-mutants of genes of interest were created. The recently discovered ADAM-A and -B were chosen as target-genes as well as Aspf3. The ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) are related homologues to mammalian ADAMs which have important functions (e.g. as sheddases) while Aspf3 is involved in detoxifying reactive oxygene species. Most likely these mutants have crucial roles in infection processes. They were grown under several conditions like pH-value, temperature, oxidative stress. The obtained antigens together with the knockout-mutants will be tested in a mouse-model.",

Zipfel 1 1 Leibniz Institute for natural product research and infection biology/ infection biology, Friedrich Schiller university, Jena, Germany 2 Leibniz Institute for natural product research and infection biology/ Molecular and Applied Microbiology, Friedrich Schiller university, Jena, Germany Dermatophytes cause human cutaneous mycosis, which represent a prevalents worldwide health problem. Immune evasion of dermatophytes is important for virulence and pathogenicity, therefore it is of interest to understand immune escape strategies of these pathogens. Arthroderma benhamiae is investigated as a model organism for skin infections. The complement system forms the first line of immune defense against invading microorganisms in the human skin. Human complement regulator Factor H mediates degradation of complement C3b, a major opsonisin for phagocytosis. We demonstrate that Factor H is locally expressed by human keratinocytes, which is shown by Western Blot analysis of culture supernatants. Furthermore Factor H binds to the surface of A. benhamiae, as shown by direct binding assays, immunostaining and ELISA. Pathogen bound Factor H inhibits the deposition of C3b on the fungal surface. Thus, the dermatophyte avoids opsonization by host complement C3b and subsequent phagocytosis. In addition A. benhamiae uses a second independent strategy to block human complement. The fungus secretes proteases, which can degrade complement components as revealed by cleavage assays and haemolytic tests. This implies that A. benhamiae protects itself against complement attack by interfering with the complement activation. A kinetic study of C3b degradation shows, that it is essential for A. benhamiae survivial to bind host complement regulator Factor H in the first few minutes of infection to mediate C3b inactivation. At a later time point secreted fungal proteases take over the role of C3b degradation. These results suggest, that A. benhamiae uses two subsequently independent immune escape strategies. Overexpression of the MDR1 gene, encoding a multidrug efflux pump of the major facilitator superfamily, is a major cause of resistance to the widely used antimycotic agent fluconazole and other toxic compounds in Candida albicans. Mrr1, a zinc cluster transcription factor, controls MDR1 expression in response to inducing chemicals, and gain-of-function mutations in MRR1 are responsible for the constitutive MDR1 upregulation in all clinical and in vitro generated fluconazole-resistant C. albicans strains tested so far. In order to gain insight into the regulation of Mrr1 activity, we intended to identify the functional domains of this transcription factor. To delimit the minimal size of Mrr1 that is essential for its activity, MRR1 alleles with serial C-terminal deletions were expressed in a C. albicans mrr1\u01fb mutant containing a PMDR1-GFP reporter gene fusion. Their capability to induce the MDR1 promoter was analysed by FACS analysis. In addition, internal Mrr1 fragments were fused to the tetracycline repressor and tested for their ability to induce transcription from a tetR-dependent promoter. To investigate if the N-terminally located DNAbinding domain of Mrr1 was sufficient to specifically activate the MDR1 promoter and confer drug resistance, we fused Mrr1 fragments to the Gal4 transcription activation domain. Finally, the interdependence of Mrr1 and Cap1, a bZIP transcription factor that can also induce MDR1 expression, was studied by expressing a hyperactive MRR1 allele in a cap1\u01fb background and, vice versa, a hyperactive CAP1 allele in an mrr1\u01fb background. The results of these analyses contribute to a detailed understanding of the function of an important regulator of drug resistance in C. albicans.",

The advancement in molecular biology has provided TET controlled transcriptional activation system as a method of inducible gene expression where transcription is reversibly turned on or off in the presence of TET or of one of its derivatives like doxycycline. Recently, TET was introduced as an inducible promoter in Candida albicans. We controlled our expression construct by TET-induced GFP gene expression in C. albicans and screened the cells in presence and absence of TET. Surprisingly, we found that even wild type strain SC5314 treated with TET showed fluorescence in the FITC channel. For a systematic investigation, we transformed the pNIM1 vector containing caGFP under the control of the TET-inducible promoter into C. albicans SC5314 and screened for GFP expression in the presence or absence of TET. We observed that after the addition of TET, excitation with blue light at 450-490 nm had no effect on pNIM1-transformed C. albicans, suggesting a low degree of GFP expression. However, the same cells as well as wild type C. albicans SC5314 cells without GFP showed an ample green fluorescence in the presence of TET which was detectable in the FITC channel, but only after brief exposure to UV light of 340-380 nm, suggesting a UV-dependent activation of TET for fluorescence. The same phenomenon was observed in S. cerviseae and E. coli. UV-light supposedly modifies the calcium ion-bound TET molecule structure and causes additional absorbance at 450-490 nm. In summary, we can show that exposure to UV light (340-380 nm) generates artefacts during fluorescent imaging (450-490 nm) when TET-induced transcriptional activator systems are used for GFP expression.",

Rath 1 1 Insitute of Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany Backround: Voriconzaole (VRC) is a broad-spectrum triazole antigfungal agent which is recommended as first-line therapy in patients with invasive aspergillosis and a therapeutic option for treating candidiasis. Recent studies have shown that VRC drug monitoring in plasma improves efficacy and safety patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a bioassay for determination of VRC levels in plasma. Methods: Standard samples and pooled plasma containing different VRC levels were prepared as standard and control samples for both methods. The biological activity of VRC was measured by a plate diffusion assay using a VRChypersusceptible Candida kefyr strain (MIC of 0.004 mg/L [CSLI], 2.0 McF inocula). For comparison with the bioassay a HPLC system (Agilent 1100 series) with UV detection by using a solvent extraction with hexandichlormethan followed by a reverse phase HPLC on a C18 column with isocratic mobile phase of acetonitril/buffer/water was used. Results: The accuracy for low, medium and high VRC concentrations was 15% (bioassay) vs. 7% (HPLC). HPLC had a lower and higher detection limit than the bioassay (0.2\u021dg/L vs. 0.5\u021dg/L and 12\u021dg/L vs. 8\u021dg/L). The correlation coefficient between bioassay and HPLC method using regression analysis showed HPLC = 1.05 (bioassay) + 0.207, R 2 = 0.88, n =77. Patient results ranged from 0.5 to >8.0\u021dg/L (bioassay) and 0.26 to 10.1\u021dg/L (HPLC). Conclusion: Both methods are clinically useful for monitoring VRC plasma levels. The HPLC has improved accuracy and detection limit of VRC plasma level compared to the bioassay. The bioanalytical method is also a valuable tool for therapeutic drug monitoring, especially in laboratories without access to HPLC.",

Mikrobiologie, Universit\u00e4tsmedizin G\u00f6ttingen, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany Toxoplasma gondii is one of the most widespread intracellular parasites of humans. It can lead to life-threatening toxoplasmosis in immunodeficient individuals. The parasite is transmitted through the ingestion of tissue cysts contained in raw and undercooked meat from chronically infected livestock. Until now, however, little is known about the factors that sustain a chronic infection of muscular tissue of livestock. We have recently shown that spontaneous stage conversion from replicative tachyzoites of T. gondii to potentially persisting bradyzoites occurs in murine primary skeletal muscle cells (pSMC). In this study, we evaluated the effect of IFN\u0216 alone or in combination with TNF on the intracellular development of T. gondii in skeletal muscle cells. Using parasites expressing a \u00dfGal-reporter we show that IFN\u0216 considerably reduces the replication of T. gondii in permanent murine muscle cells (C2C12) and in pSMC, whereas this effect was clearly lower in murine fibroblasts. Costimulation with TNF further reduced Toxoplasma replication in C2C12 slightly, whereas such synergism was not evident in Toxoplasma-infected pSMC. A reduced replication of Toxoplasma in skeletal muscle cells treated with IFN\u0216 was confirmed by western blot analyses of lysates from C2C12 cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed strongly decreased infection rates of C2C12 and pSMC treated with IFN\u0216 as compared to untreated controls. The number of parasites per parasitophorous vacuole (PV) was also lower in IFN\u0216-treated skeletal muscle cells than in untreated controls. Remarkably, we show that stimulation with IFN\u0216 diminishes the stage conversion rate from tachyzoites to bradyzoites in C2C12 cells and to a lower extent in pSMC. Together, the results suggest that IFN\u0216 considerably reduces the development of T. gondii in skeletal muscle cells, but does not facilitate stage conversion to bradyzoites. Candida albicans is a ubiquitous saprophyte of mucous membranes, predominantly colonising the gastrointestinal tract. Complement is an important part of the innate immunity against infection by facilitating, among other effects, chemotaxis and opsonisation, sometimes followed by lysis of the intruder. This cascade system is tightly controlled by several fluid phase and cellular regulators. Factor H (FH), a soluble plasma protein, is the main fluid phase regulator of the complement alternative pathway, whereas C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is an important classical complement pathway regulator. Both proteins can be acquired onto the surface by a number of human pathogens conveying resistance to complement and thus contributing to their pathogenic potential. Here, we identify the high affinity glucose transporter 1 of C. albicans, CaHgt1 as a FH binding molecule by probing an expression library. Homozygous C. albicans hgt1\u01fb/hgt1\u01fb deletion mutants demonstrate ist function as FH-binding protein as these mutants, are showing a markedly decreased binding of FH and even of C4BP. This leads to an increased complement activity (enhanced terminal complement complex deposition) after incubation with human serum at 37\u00baC when compared to wild type and parental strains. The ability of mutants to form hyphae at 30\u00baC and at 37\u00baC is impaired in comparison to the wild type. This study shows that CaHgt1 is a multifunctional complement evasion molecule, as major FH-and even C4BPbinding molecule on the cell surface. In addition, the C. albicans HGT1 gene plays a role in modulating other virulence factors such as hyphae formation.",

In addition to growing as a budding yeast, C. albicans can also grow as filaments (hyphae and pseudohyphae) or form chlamydospores, depending on the environmental conditions. Strains that are homozygous at the mating type locus (MTL) can also switch from the normal yeast form (white) to an elongated cell type (opaque), which is the mating competent form of the fungus. Transcription factors play an important role in the regulation of all these developmental processes, and the expression of the regulators themselves is often modulated during morphogenesis. Therefore, morphogenesis can be stimulated under normally noninducing conditions by forced expression of activators. To identify novel regulators of filamentous growth, chlamydospore formation, and white-opaque switching, we have cloned more than 300 genes encoding confirmed or putative C. albicans transcription factors (www.candidagenome.org), including known hyperactive alleles of some of these genes, and placed them under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Park, YN, et al., (2005) , E.C. , 4, 1328). The inducible gene expression cassettes were introduced into the genomes of the C. albicans model strain SC5314 and the white-opaque switching-competent MTLalpha strain WO-1. The libraries are currently screened by growing the strains in the presence of doxycycline to induce gene expression under different conditions and identify novel regulators of morphogenesis. A screen of the WO-1 derived library indicated that several transcription factors with no known role in white-opaque switching can induce mass conversion from the white to the opaque state. This finding suggests their implication in the regulatory circuit governing the master regulator Wor1. The results of these screenings and the functional analysis of the identified regulators will be presented.",

In the present study we investigated the survival and death strategies of the pathogen under these stressed conditions and explored the molecular mechanisms of stress response by the pathogen. In response to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 the parasite was found to execute an apoptosis like cell death with most of the features of mammalian apoptosis like cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing and nuclear DNA fragmentation being well conserved. However the parasite responded differentially in response to heat shock at 43\u00baC and was found to survive the stress even after long exposures. A further investigation to reveal the molecular mechanisms yielded a critical role of the single typical MAPK family protein of E. histolytica. The differential phosphorylation and hence activation of the protein in response to these stressed conditions well correlated with the ultimate fate of the organism indicating a possible role of EhMAPK in mediating cell survival. Moreover in addition to MAPK the parasite genome also codes for five putative silent information regulator 2 (SIR2) genes which have been shown to be associated with cellular longevity in a number of different cell types especially yeasts. In the present study an RT-PCR analysis of these putative genes in response to oxidative stress revealed a massive down-regulation of one of the genes indicating a probable role of this particular SIR2 homologue in cell survival and ist down-regulation as an essential prerequisite for induction of cell death. Taken together our study attempts to light up some of the components of the as yet unknown molecular pathway associated with survival or death response of E. histolytica in response to a particular stress which in turn will provide suitable candidates that can be targeted to control amoebiasis.",

Especially in immunocompromised patients it turns into an opportunistic pathogen. Candida colonizes various host niches with significant differences in pH and nutrient availability including skin, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract. To reveal whether C. albicans is able to specifically respond to different host niches, we used transcriptional profiling in order to identify C. albicans genes differentially regulated during adhesion on plastic and a vaginal and intestinal tissue model. For further studies we focused on genes encoding for cell surface proteins. The cell surface is most critical for host-pathogen interaction as it is the site of direct interaction with the human host, mediating environmental sensing, adhesion and also interaction with the host immune system. Several genes have been identified as specifically upregulated on tissue. One gene encoding for a protein predicted to be localized in plasma membrane, carrying four transmembrane domains, was termed Adhesion Upregulated Factor -AUF8. Interestingly we identified six homologoues in the C. albicans genome for AUF8, of which five together with AUF8 are located on chromosome 5 in 10 kb gene-cluster. Deletion studies do not show any direct involvement of the AUF genes in the adhesion or invasion process, but we have indications about their role in cell fitness during stationary phase of growth. When expressed in S. cerevisiae Auf8p is localized to the plasma membrane. Other proteins encoded by genes upregulated during adhesion include two predicted GPI-proteins. Functional studies of PGA7, PGA23 and PRA1 with regard to adhesion and invasion as well as cell wall structure and stability were performed using deletion and overexpression strains.

PRR signalling pathways trigger subsequent inflammatory responses which are crucial for successful host defence against pathogens. The fungal cell wall is the major structure providing potential fungal PAMPs known to stimulate the innate immune response. First we examined the effect of different cell wall extractions from C. albicans and found an increase of TLR expression and cytokine secretion. However, we could not observe differences between the extractions. Analysis showed that all five fractions contain glycosylated cell wall proteins (CWPs). C.albicans CWPs have two potential glycosylation sides, the N-glycosylation known to be recognised by the mannose receptor (MR) and the TLR4 recognised Oglycosylation. Using blocking antibodies we could show that the CWF cytokine induction is TLR2, TLR4 and MR independent, whereas deglycosylation of CWPs abolished cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a strong growth inhibition of the CWF-stimulated oral epithelial cells after 24h. More detailed analysis showed that the cell cycle inhibition resulted in an increase of caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction analysed by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Both, proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction was independent of TLR2, TLR4 and MR signalling, but dependent on the TLR adapter protein MyD88, since growth of oral keratinocytes from MyD88 deficient mice was significantly increased compared to wild-type keratinocytes.",

In the opportunist Candida albicans, the \u0215-glucans are covered beneath a mannan layer, so that the pathogenic yeast is able to escape the immune attack. As the C. albicans histidine kinases CaSln1p, Chk1p, and Cos1p were reported to be involved in cell wall biosynthesis and in virulence, we investigated whether the deletion of the respective genes influences the activity of phagocytes against C. albicans. Fluorimetric phagocytosis assays revealed that among all histidine kinase genes, CHK1 plays a prominent role in phagocyte activation. Uptake of the null mutant strain \u00a8chk1 by macrophages and neutrophiles significantly increases compared to the parental strain. Furthermore, the lack of CHK1 is related to an enhanced acidification of phagosomes. Remarkably, levels of both phagocytosis and phagosome maturation equal those of the non-pathogenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These improved activities of phagocytes against \u00a8chk1 could be correlated to an altered accessibility of the \u0215-glucans for immune recognition. Staining of the \u0215-1,3-glucans with fluorescein-conjugated antibodies elucidated that the amount of accessible \u0215-1,3-glucans of the mutant is significantly increased. Further investigations showed that any inhibition of \u0215-1,3-glucan-mediated phagocytosis reduces the uptake of \u01fbchk1 while ingestion of the parental strain is hardly affected. Moreover, deletion of CHK1 results in an enhanced release of interleukin-6 and -10 by macrophages, which is a downstream reaction of the activation of the \u0215-1,3-glucan receptor dectin-1. In conclusion, the C. albicans histidine kinase Chk1p is likely to be involved in masking \u0215-1,3-glucans from immune recognition. As there are no homologues to fungal histidine kinases in mammals, Chk1p has to be considered as a promising target for new antifungal agents. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is one of the major life threatening fungal infections associated with hematological malignancies and solid organ transplantations. Dendritic cells are important components of the innate immune system in the defence against pathogenic fungi; they acquire antigens in the periphery, migrate into secondary lymphoid tissues, activate T cells, maturate and secrete cytokines and chemokines. Until now, most antigenic structures of Aspergillus fumigatus and their influence on the human innate immune system are uncharacterized. In our study, we characterized the interaction between the A. fumigatus antigens Aspf1 and Crf1 and monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (iDC); antigens were recombinantly expressed in the Pichia pastoris system. We quantified their capacity to induce DC cytokine and chemokine gene expression, cytokine and chemokine secretion, localization of the antigens and DC apoptosis. Furthermore, we investigated by performing mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR), if DCs loaded with the Aspf1 antigen are able to induce T-cell proliferation. Aspf1 showed a high ability, compared to Crf1, to stimulate DCs as demonstrated by an increased expression of genes encoding for proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12p35, TNF\u012e and IL-8) and chemokines (CXCL10, CCL20). By using germlings of a deletion mutant for Aspf1 (\u01fbaspf1) in confrontation assays with iDCs, decreased gene expression and protein secretion compared to stimulation with wild type morphologies were detectable. Apoptosis of DCs was induced after Aspf1 incubation, compared to DCs without stimuli. Furthermore, MLR revealed that DCs were not able to present Aspf1 to autologous T-cells.",

However, in immunocompetent individuals the disease is self-limiting. Data from human infections and animal models have demonstrated the major role of the cellular immune response with CD4 + T cells being the dominant players. In addition to CD4 + T cells, Th1 cytokines, especially interferon-gamma (IFN-\u0216) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) are required for protection. We investigated the possibility to transfer immunity from C. parvum-infected IFN-\u0216 (GKO) and IL-12p40 (IL-12KO) deficient C57BL/6 mice to naive mice by transfer of different lymphocyte preparations. Both strains of deficient mice are susceptible to infection but recover within two weeks. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and CD4 + T cells from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were prepared from donor mice at the peak of infection and after recovery. Three days after transfer recipients were infected with C. parvum. Transfer of IELs and CD4 + T cells isolated after resolution of infection (day 15) from both strains of donor mice reduced the parasite load in GKO and IL-12KO recipient mice significantly. Protection rates in GKO mice reached 46%, 64%, and 78% for the spleen and MLN CD4+ cells and IELs, respectively. In IL-12KO mice protection rates were 74%, 81%, and 93%, respectively. The protection by lymphocytes isolated from IL-12KO mice at the peak of infection (day 5) was significantly higher than that from GKO mice isolated at day 8, emphasizing the role of IFN-\u0216 in the host-parasite interaction. However, after resolution of infection, IFN-\u0216-independent mechanisms have evolved which render IELs and CD4 + T cells potent to protect mice from severe infection. Transfer of CD4 + plus CD8 + cells did not lead to increased protection rates indicating that CD8 + cells are not essential for protection from infection.",

During acute infection, T. gondii disseminates within the host via infection of various cell types including professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs). Inhibition of MHC class I and class II expression following infection of murine pAPCs with T. gondii has been established and is considered an important evasion strategy to dampen the anti-parasitic immune response. Here we formally prove that T. gondii also diminishes HLA expression in human-derived macrophages. IFN-\u0216-regulated expression of HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DR, DP, DQ molecules on human monocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was prominently inhibited following in vitro-infection with T. gondii. Although to lower extent, constitutive HLA expression was also inhibited by parasitic infection. Remarkably, constitutive as well as IFN-\u0216-induced HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DR, DP, DQ expression appeared to be higher in monocytes derived from blood donors with a chronic Toxoplasma infection than in seronegative controls. In contrast, the parasite-induced inhibition of HLA expression was similarly observed in monocytes derived from Toxoplasmapositive and -negative blood donors. The interference of T. gondii with constitutive and/or IFN-\u0216-induced HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DR, DP, DQ expression was confirmed using human-derived THP-1 monocytic cells. The parasite-mediated blockade of IFN-\u0216-induced HLA-expression was not abrogated by increased cytokine concentrations. HLA-DR\u012e and HLA-A mRNA were dose-dependently diminished following Toxoplasma infection. Similarly, the transcript levels of the transcription factors IRF-1 and CIITA were also reduced by T. gondii. These results indicate that the parasite-mediated inhibition of HLA expression in human-derived macrophages is partially mediated via parasite interference with an early step of IFN-\u0216-induced gene expression.",

These studies are undertaken within an ERA-Net consortium, FunPath. Genes coding for predicted proteins of the cell wall, known signalling pathways, membrane-bound receptors, transporters and transcription factors were identified by comparative genome analysis and subsequently deleted (about 500 deletion mutants at present). This library is screened with biological assays, e.g. for strains with altered cell wall stability, stress tolerance, or adhesion. Up to now, several strains were found in survival assays on plates to be more sensitive to congo red, osmotic stress or increased temperature. The genes deleted in these mutants are presumably involved in cell wall integrity and the MapK-pathways. The ability to adhere on a surface is tested by a series of tests with increasing complexity and approximation to the host environment. So far, the genes we identified to be important for adherence in simple assay systems were associated to the cell wall or involved in cytokinesis. To verify our screening results we investigate the adhesion and invasion behaviour of the promising mutant strains on human epithelial models. In addition to the primary screening we plan to analyse the adhesion ability of all mutant strains on epithelial models in a comparative approach with pools of mutants. All deletion strains are tagged with a specific barcode sequence that can be detected via an in-house barcode microarray. Experiments with in vivo models will be carried out by our project partners (FunPath). Using genome wide transcription profiles, it will be possible, for instance, to further characterize strains with reduced adhesion and invasion behaviour. The results generated will allow conclusions about basic pathogenicity mechanisms and possible targets for the therapy of fungal infections.",

Hyphal growth and the transcriptional regulation of adaptation to the host environment are key issues during the pathogenesis of C. albicans. Tec1p, a member of the TEA transcription factor family, has previously been shown to be involved in the signalling events that lead to hyphal formation and gene regulation. A tec1/tec1 deletion mutant does no longer form hyphae in vitro and is avirulent in vivo. Earlier studies showed that TEA transcription factors recognize and bind to the TEA consensus sequence (TCS) 5'-CATTCY-3'. Both the N-and the C-terminus of Tec1p have a major role in pseudohyphal development and mating in S. cerevisiae, suggesting the presence of cooperatively acting protein domains. We investigated whether C. albicans Tec1p has similar protein domains which might be differentially required for DNA binding and for cooperative interaction with DNA or proteins, respectively. We transformed several constructs with modified open reading frames of wildtype Tec1p containing N-or C-terminal deletions into the tec1 mutant strain CaAS12. To minimize the influence of environmental factors, we integrated the modified ORFs under the control of the C. albicansadapted reverse Tet-dependent transactivator (rtTA) and used Tet-induced hyphal formation as a read-out for Tec1p-activity. Transformation of ORF constructs with a C-terminal deletion induced hyphal growth in the tec1 mutant, while N-terminal deletions disrupted the transcriptional activity of Tec1p. The growth rate of transformants with N-terminal deletions was reduced, and the fewer hyphal elements displayed a shorter degree of polarized growth. In conclusion, we show that an N-terminal domain of Tec1p is essential for hyphal development, and cooperative interaction of the Tec1p C-terminus might play a limited role in C. albicans.",

The most significant difference in the organization of the respiratory chain from Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii compared to human mitochondria is the absence of a canconial complex I. Instead, these parasites express type II NADH dehydrogenases (NDH2s), which are in contrast to complex I single subunit, non-proton pumping enzymes. We recently identified 1-hydroxy-2-dodecyl-4(1)quinolone (HDQ) as a high affinity inhibitor for the T. gondii NDH2s. HDQ and derivatives are potent inhibitors of T. gondii replication with IC50s in the nanomolar range, which probably interfere with the ubiquinol binding site of NDH2s. The physiological consequences of HDQ treatment on intracellular parasites are a fast depolarization of the parasite\u00b4s mitochondrial membrane potential, as shown by live cell imaging using cationic fluorescent probes, and a strong reduction of the intracellular ATP level. Ongoing studies include the determination of the orientation of the two T. gondii NDH2 isoforms towards the inner mitochondrial membrane as internal or external enzymes using a split GFP approach and functional studies on conditional knock-out mutants.",

Pradel 1 1 Research Center for Infectious Diseases, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany 2 Global Health Institute, Station 19, Lausanne, Switzerland Protein kinases (PKs) play crucial roles in most eukaryotic cellular processes. The Plasmodium falciparum kinome comprises representatives of most (but not all) eukaryotic PK groups, including the CMGC (CDK, MAPK, GSK3 and CDK-like) group that encompasses PKs, which regulate proliferation and differentiation processes. Up to date, very little information is available regarding the 4th family in the CMGC group, the CDK-like kinases (Cyclin Dependent Kinases Like Kinases, CLKs). In other eukaryotes, CLKs are major regulators of mRNA splicing, through phosphorylation of Serine/Arginine-rich (SR) proteins, which function in the splicing pathway. Thus, CLKs participate in the control of gene expression, and may be particularly important in Plasmodium, in view of the established importance of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in malaria parasites. This study aims at characterising the four PfCLKs (Lammer kinase PF14_0431, PF14_0408, PF11_0156 and PFC0105w) at the biochemical and functional levels, with main focus on the LAMMER kinase. We show that the four CLK genes are transcribed throughout the asexual blood stages and in gametocytes. The Lammer kinase possesses two nuclear localization signals upstream to the C-terminal catalytic domain. In order to experimentally verify the stage-specific expression pattern at protein level, a polyclonal mouse antibody was generated. Both indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot data are indicative of localization of the kinase in the parasite nucleus. Co-localization with the parasite nucleus is further confirmed via Immunoelectron microscopy. Reverse genetics and gene tagging studies via single-crossover homologous recombination reflect the essentiality of this kinase for completion of the asexual parasite cycle. Kinase activity assays on native Lammer kinase immunoprecipitated from parasite extracts indicate phosphorylation of commonly used kinase substrates (Histone H1, MBP, and Casein). Investigation of kinase interaction partners via co-immunoprecipitation is presently under progress.",

The Src-like tyrosine-kinase SmTK3 of Schistosoma mansoni is expressed in the gonads, and ist pharmacological inhibition reduces mitogenic activity and egg production in paired females in vitro. Since Src kinases are important signal transduction proteins it is of interest to unravel the signaling cascades SmTK3 is involved in to understand ist cellular role in the gonads. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library of adult S. mansoni was screened employing a bait construct encoding the SH3 domain and unique site of SmTK3.

SmDia is a single-copy gene transcribed throughout development with a bias towards male transcription. Its deduced amino acid sequence reveals all diaphanous-characteristic functional domains. Binding studies with truncated SmDia clones identified SmTK3 interaction sites demonstrating that maximal binding efficiency depends on the N-terminal part of the FH1 formin homology domain and the inter-domain region of SmDia located upstream of FH1 in combination with the unique site and the SH3 domain of SmTK3, respectively. SmDia also directly interacted with the GTPase SmRho1 of S. mansoni. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that SmDia and SmRho1 colocalize with SmTK3 in the gonads of both genders.

A crucial function for saprophytism resides in secreted proteases that allow assimilation of proteinaceous substrates. The impact of extracellular proteolytic activities on the pathogenesis of aspergillosis, however, remains controversial. In order to address this issue, characterisation of a conserved regulatory factor, PrtT, that acts on expression of secreted proteases was pursued. Expression of PrtT appears to be regulated post-transcriptionally, and the existence of an mRNA leader sequence implies translational control via eIF2\u012e kinase signalling. Phenotypic classification of a prtT\u01fb deletion mutant revealed that expression of several major extracellular proteases is PrtT-dependent, resulting in the inability to utilise protein as nutritional source. Certain genes encoding secreted proteases are not regulated by PrtT. Most strikingly, the deletant strain is not attenuated in virulence when tested in a leukopenic mouse model, which makes a strong case for reconsidering any impact of secreted proteases in pulmonary aspergillosis.",

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 50: 1449-1457. Lantibiotics are small microbial peptide antibiotics that are produced by a variety of grampositive bacteria. These antibiotics differ from other bacteriocins by the presence of the non-proteinogenic thioether amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Lantibiotics are gene encoded and ribosomally synthesized as prepeptides containing a leader cleavage site that separates the C-terminal propeptide from the N-terminal leader. During maturation the inactive prepeptide undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications including the introduction of the unique amino acids as well as the proteolytic removal of the leader.The structural gene (lanA) as well as the other genes which are involved in lantibiotic biosynthesis, modification (lanM, lanP), regulation (lanR, lanK), export (lanT(P)) and immunity (lanEFG) are organized in biosynthetic gene clusters. B. licheniformis DSM13 harbours a putative lantibiotic gene cluster, encoding a new two-peptide lantibiotic named lichenicidin (McClerren et al., 2006) . This gene cluster comprises two structural genes (licA1, licA2) and two modification enzymes (licM1, licM2) in addition to 10 ORFs that show sequence similarities to proteins involved in lantibiotic production. We were able to detect an antimicrobial activity in the culture supernantant as well as in an isopropanol cell wash extract of B. licheniformis DSM13. In agar well diffusion assays these antimicrobial substances exhibited an activity against grampositive bacteria but were inactive against gramnegatives and C. albicans. Two B. licheniformis mutant strains which harbour insertions in the modification enzymes LicM1 or LicM2 were characterized by a decrease or loss of the activity in the isopropanol extract. These results indicate that the activity of the isopropanol extract represents lichenicidin. By substractive Maldi-TOF analysis, we predict a mass of 3021 Da for the active LicA1 peptide and a mass of 3251 Da for the active LicA2 peptide.",

GAS is equipped with many virulence factors allowing the bacteria to infect and persist within the host cell. During infection GAS are exposed to different host environments with changing nutritional conditions potentially affecting the central metabolism of the bacteria. In order to understand the central metabolism of S. pyogenes better and in order to be able to compare it to other lactic acid bacteria, we set up a detailed, quantitative model of glycolysis in this organism. The model was based on literature, data as found in the SABIO RK database, and on experimental data. Experimental data were measured in glucose limited continuous cultures as well as glucose pulse experiments. Moreover, individual glycolytic enzymes of S. pyogenes M49 were cloned and kinetic parameters (Km values, allosteric regulation) were measured for these in vitro. It turned out that the allosteric regulation of glycolysis differs in S. pyogenes in comparison to other lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis). Especially the role of inorganic phosphate in allosteric regulation of lactate-dehydrogenase activity is contrary to the situation in L. lactis. In summary, kinetic models of S. pyogenes as human pathogen allow us to further define the similarities and differences between pathogenic and non-pathogenic lactic acid bacteria and may uncover existing links between central metabolism and virulence.",

The removal of heavy metals ions from wastewater has received a great attention in recent decade years for global awareness of the underlying detriment of heavy metals in the environment. One of these polluting elements is lead which contaminates the environment as a result of various industrial activities, causing severe poisoning in human beings and other living creatures. Application traditional treatment techniques need enormous cost and continuous input of chemicals, witch become uneconomical and cause further environment damage. There is a tendency to use biological method to purify lead waste pollutants since they are more economical than chemical methods. In this research a lead-absorbing strain, Delftia sp., isolated from wastewater, was immobilized onto sawdust and investigated as potential biosorbent for the removal lead from aqueous solution. The metal removing capacity of sawdust immobilized biomass was tested in the continuous flow fixed-bed column and was found to be highly effective in removing lead from wastewater. Immobilization has enhanced the biosorption of lead as compared to free biomass. The aim of this study is to develop a new and cheap technology for the removal lead pollutions from wastewater.",

GC/MS was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard 5973 MSD instrument interfaced directly to a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph. The structural analysis revealed that the compounds represent alkenes (C21 -C26) with an iso-and anteiso-structure corresponding to the fatty acid precursors. The double bond is located between C10 and C11. These alkenes are excellent taxonomic markers. The biological function and the mechanism of formation of the rare bacterial alkenes (Micrococcus, Stenotrophomonas, Arthrobacter) have not yet been elucidated (Frias et al. 2009, Appl. Environ.

It is caused most often by ingestion of feed contaminated with botulinum toxin. Especially in silage and haylage, produced under anaerobic conditions, there may be a favorable environment for toxin producing Clostridium botulinum also like contamination of feed through cadavers. When there is an outbreak of botulism, it is important to recognize the first symptoms in the animals, to avoid further ingestion of possibly contaminated feed to prevent other animals being affected by the disease. Depending on the amount of the ingested toxin, the course of the disease may be peracute or prolonged for several days or even weeks. Therapy in affected animals is limited by availability of antitoxin for some types of botulinum toxin only. Treatment with antitoxine is very expensive and therapy is often unsuccessful. Special attention must be payed to prevention. Especially the process of producing silage and haylage also the control of the quality of feed as soon as the daily visual control for whole or parts of cadavers, ahead of feeding the animals are important. This case report describes the course of botulism type C in a cohort of 92 dairy cows with partial advanced pregnancy from which 86 adults and 5 calfs died or had to be euthanized within a period of a few hours to 18 days. Clinical symptoms were typical stumble and paralysis of hind extremities with subsequent downing, temporary aggressivity, no fever and no limited appetite. The animals died from respiratory paralysis. In excrements, intestine, liver and feed was botulinum type C detected.

However, some evidence on cost containment by sequential therapy with CIP is shown but a decisive conclusion on its quantitative aspect cannot be provided at present. For intracellular bacteria, there is no need to maintain osmotic stabilization by means of a cell wall and peptidoglycan has not been reliably detected in the obligate intracellular genus Chlamydia so far. Nevertheless, chlamydiae are susceptible to antibiotics that target cell wall biosynthesis. This paradox is known as the chlamydial anomaly. A genome-wide search within Chlamydia resulted in the identification of a nearly complete pathway for peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We started to investigate the fundamental membrane associated steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis which lead to the formation of the lipid-bound precursors lipid I and lipid II. Therefore, the integral membrane protein MraY and the membrane associated protein MurG from C. pneumoniae were overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified. We previously demonstrated in vitro activity of MraY and MurG and here present further data on kinetics, structural features, substrate specificities and coupled assays. Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that lipid II is synthesized and a functional peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway is present in chlamydiae. Additionally, our results suggest that the pathway may be exploited for antibiotic therapy of chlamydial infections.",

Dobrindt 1 1 Institute for Molecular Infection Biology, University of W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany For a long time, protein glycosylation has been considered to be restricted to eukaryotes. Through advances in analytical methods and genome sequencing, the evidence for N-and O-glycosylated bacterial proteins is constantly increasing (Szymanski & Wren, 2005) . It is widely accepted now that at least some eubacteria express glycoproteins, but detailed information about glycosylation and structure-function relationships is available for only a few eubacterial proteins. Protein glycosylation in bacteria has been shown to contribute to different aspects of host-pathogen interaction, e.g., adhesion, protection against proteolytic cleavage, antigenic variation and protective immunity. In Escherichia coli, several autotransporter proteins, i.e. AIDA-I, TibA, and antigen 43 (Ag43), display O-glycosylated surface proteins (Sherlock et al., 2006) . Ag43 represents the most abundant phase-variable outer membrane protein of E. coli and belongs to the AIDA autotransporter family (Henderson et al., 2004) . It has been described to confer aggregation and fluffing of cells, to promote biofilm formation, uptake and survival in macrophages as well as long-term persistence of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) in the murine urinary tract. AIDA-I and TibA require O-glycosylation for functionality and the corresponding heptosyl transferases have been identified. However, the enzyme responsible for O-glycosylation of Ag43 is still unknown. Hence, we characterize protein glycosylation in uropathogenic E. coli strain 536 in order to elucidate glycoprotein biosynthetic pathways with a particular focus on Ag43. These studies include the comparative genomic analysis and functional characterization of putative glycosyl transferase-encoding open reading frames in E. coli strain 536.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of gallium curcumin (Ga(CUR)3) and gallium diacetylcurcumin (Ga(DAC)3) compared with curcumin. These agents were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Psudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and broth dilution method was applied to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Both Ga(CUR)3 and Ga(DAC)3 exhibited antibacterial activity on S. aureus and S. epidermidis, whereas they did not show effect against P. aeruginosa and E. coli (similar to the curcumin). The MIC of Ga(CUR)3 and Ga(DAC)3 was 46.9 \u03bcg/ml for S. epidermidis that was equal to the MIC of curcumin for this bacterium. The MIC of Ga(DAC)3 for S. aureus was 375 \u03bcg/ml. However, the MIC of Ga(CUR)3 for S. aureus was 46.9 \u03bcg/ml that was lower than the MIC of curcumin (187.5 \u03bcg/ml) for this bacterial strain. Therefore, Ga(CUR)3 was found to have more antibacterial activity against S. aureus than curcumin itself and could be a good candidate for further in vivo studies. The opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa can contaminate drinking water systems where it then poses a threat to human health. The basis of the present study was the observation that exposure of P. aeruginosa to copper-containing drinking water from domestic plumbing systems resulted in a loss of culturability. Copper ions were supposed to be involved in this effect, since (i) no inactivation of the bacteria occurred in drinking water without detectable copper levels, and (ii) addition of the copper chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) to copper-containing water prevented the loss of culturability. Laboratory experiments were performed to study the effect of copper on the viability of P. aeruginosa by exposing the bacteria (106 cells/mL) to cupric sulfate in deionized water at 20\u00baC for 24 h. Microscopic fluorescent staining techniques and cultural determination of colony counts were used to assess the proportion of viable cells. Upon exposure to 10 \u03bcM copper, culturability decreased by more than 6 log units, while total cell numbers (DAPI-stained cells representing intact DNA-containing bacteria) and membrane integrity of the cells, determined with the LIVE/DEAD BacLight kit, remained unchanged. The number of respiring cells, determined by reduction of 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride, decreased by approximately 2 log units, but was still more than 4 log units higher compared with the colony counts. When the chelator DDTC was added to copper-stressed bacteria, complete restoration of culturability was observed after several days.",

This is due to a number of reasons specific for this area: Lack of information and poor access to medical care on one hand and a number of behavioural factors on the other hand (e.g. frequent change of sexual partners, unprotected sex, prostitution, concomitant STD). Despite many efforts undertaken by governments as well NGOs, only little success could be achieved in the fight against the spread of HIV. In order to analyse the reason for this and to possibly give some hints on how to overcome this unsatisfying situation a mathematical model was developed which is able to simulate the spread of the infection taking into account various influencing parameters like prevalence at time zero, availability of therapy and protection including a (still hypothetical) vaccination, sexual behaviour of different groups of persons, etc.. The simulation covers a region of up to 2500 subregions which may have different characteristics and being populated with up to one million individuals \"living\" there. This population is monitored daily for a period of up to one hundred years while parameters like HIV incidence, HIV prevalence and age distribution are being calculated for the different groups of persons. The most important results of the simulations performed are: -Consequent therapy of infected individuals as well as protection of individuals at risk has to be performed by at least 70% in order to lower the incidence and prevalence of the infection. -These measures have to be kept effective for decades: Neglecting of measures once established will result in failure. -A change in sexual behaviour is effective, too, but does not seem to be applicable.",

The specimens were tested with the C. DIFF CHEKTM-60-EIA (Techlab) for the detection of the GDH-antigen. Stool specimens positive with the GDH antigen-test were analyzed with an EIA for the detection of toxin A & B (Meridian). Culture on Cycloserin-Cefoxitin-Fructose (CCFA)-agar (bioM\u00e9rieux) was performed for stool specimens with a positive GDH-antigen-EIA result and a negative toxin A&B-EIA result. Cultured C. difficile isolates were tested with the toxin A&B-EIA. In addition 69 GDH-negative and 129 GDH-positive and toxins A&B-EIA negative stool specimens were collected for the analysis with the Xpert C. difficile-PCR-assay (Cepheid) and culture on CCFA-agar. Of 2720 stool specimens, 1911 were negative with the GDH-test, 792 positive and 17 showed an indeterminate result. Of the 792 GDH-test positive specimens, 425 (52,8%) revealed a positive result with the toxin-EIA and 367 (47,2%) were negative. Of these toxin-EIA negative specimens, 142 (17,8%) showed growth of C. difficile-toxin positive isolates, and 43 (5,4%) of C. difficile-toxin negative isolates. 182 specimens showed no growth of C. difficile. Concerning PCR-test, 2 of 69 GDH-negative specimens were positive with the Xpert-assay. Of 129 specimens positive for the GDH-test and negative for the direct toxin A&B-EIA, 73 showed a toxin positive result with the Xpert C. difficile-assay. 66 of these results were confirmed by culture. The above described procedure for the detection of C. difficile showed a good performance in the routine laboratory. The Xpert C. difficile real-time PCRassay showed high sensitivity and reduced the time to result.",

Our study was prompted to uncover the occurrence and genetic variability of EPEC strains in diarrheic pigs. Therefore 2,853 E. coli isolates from 2,167 pigs on 738 farms in Germany were screened for the intimin gene (eae) by PCR. Eae-positive isolates were further assessed for their eae-type and 20 other virulence and fitness associated genes. At least one representative isolate of each detected eae-type was analyzed for adhesion properties and the induction of A/E lesions on porcine IPEC-J2 and human HEp-2 epithelial cells in vitro. One hundred and seventeen isolates (4 %) from 116 pigs (5 %) of 86 farms (12 %) were detected eae-positive. Most of these isolates encoded for intimin type \u02151 (71) or \u02162\u0219(25), while types \u021f, \u0130, \u02161, \u021b/\u012f, and \u012e1 occurred less frequent. In addition to eae, the isolates possessed various virulence and fitness associated genes that have been described previously in porcine and human E. coli isolates: fyuA/irp2 (51 isolates), paa (35), ehxA (23), astA (12), rfbO157 (4), espI (3), stx1 (2), and bfpA (1). Overall we found 40 different gene patterns each represented by 1 to 23 isolates. Representatives of all but one eae-type (\u02162/\u0219) caused A/E lesions on epithelial cells in vitro. However, A/E patterns of the isolates varied dependent of the cells used: 64 % induced A/E lesions on both, 18 % on IPEC-J2 only, and 18 % neither on IPEC-J2 nor on HEp-2 cells.

Forty-one C. difficile isolates were subjected to further microbiological analysis and PCR ribotyping. PCR ribotype (RT) 027 was the most prevalent strain accounting for 24 (59%) of all typed isolates, followed by RT 001 in eight (19.5%) isolates, RT 017 and 042 in each two (4.8%) cases, and RT 003, 042, 078 and 081 in each one isolate. A total of 18 (25%) patients, of whom the clinical outcome was known, had died within 30 days after admission. C. difficile was reported as the underlying cause of or contributing to death in 14 patients, indicating a case fatality rate of 19.4%. The patients with lethal C. difficile infection were from 59 to 89 years old (median age, 78 years). Ribotyping results were available for seven isolates associated with lethal outcome and revealed RT 027 in three cases, and RT 001 and 017 in each two cases. Our data suggest that, firstly, the RT 027 strain has emerged and is prevalent in Hessen, and, secondly, along with the possibly more virulent C. difficile RT 027, other toxigenic C. difficile strains like RT 001 and 017 are also associated with lethal C. difficile infections in this region.

A new highly virulent strain, ribotype (RT027) is responsible for severe epidemic outbreaks. Mutations of the toxin repressor gene tcdC cause increased toxin production. RT027 strain is also characterized by increased antibiotic resistance. C. difficile typing is generally performed only in specialized laboratories; however, easy applicable typing methods are now urgently needed. In our trial, prospective study stool samples of patients with suspected CDAD were analyzed by Toxin A/B ELISA and by standard anaerobic culture (CCF agar). C. difficile clinical isolates were characterized by sequence typing of the surface layer protein A (slpAST), of tcdC and by antibiotic resistance testing for moxifloxacin and clarithromycin. Over one year 326 isolates were collected. SlpAST proved to be a highly reproducible, easy applicable method for C. difficile typing. The most prevalent ribotypes could be identified by databank search whereas slpA sequence data of some rare sporadic isolates are still missing. In our cohort of patients from Saarland hospitals, 44.9% of all isolates were identified as RT027 outbreak strain which was confirmed by the detection of the 18bp tcdC deletion and antibiotic resistance to moxifloxacin and clarithromycin. 32.3% of cases were more sporadic strains. The RT078 strains show similarities to strains causing porcine CDAD as was demonstrated by the characteristic 39bp tcdC gene deletion. The endemic RT001 strain (22.8%) was resistant to both moxifloxacin and clarithromycin, but tcdC sequence analysis revealed wild-type sequences. We established slpA sequence typing for fast and reliable typing of C. difficile clinical isolates. The severe cases of CDAD were found both after infections with RT027 and also after infections with other ribotypes.",

The treatment of choice is the so called triple therapy, including a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics. The main reason for failure of H. pylori therapy is resistance to one of the antibiotics used. First-line therapies to treat H. pylori are Clarithromycin and Fluorochinolone. The previous consumption of macrolides represents a potential risk factor for developing Clarithromycin resistance. The golden standard to get information about possible resistances against antibiotics are culture and following antibiogram, which require gastric endoscopy. Although culture represents the most specific method for detection of H. pylori sometimes it seems to be a problem to grow this bacterium. PCR is suitable for detection of organisms which are slowgrowing and present in low numbers. Because of the fact that PCR provides results with high sensitivity, specificity and rapidity it could be an attractive alternative. Since stool can be obtained by totally non-invasive methods, these materials could easily be used for PCR and hence reduce the need of gastric endoscopy. The aim of the present study was to compare results of culture and PCR from biopsies and to develop a H. pylori DNA-extraction protocol to be able to detect H. pylori and resistances against Clarithromycin and Fluorochinolone in stool samples. Therefore we obtained 76 biopsies for PCR and culture. In 55 cases PCR was positive, in culture 25 samples were positive, a following antibiogram was possible in 14 cases. Compliance between results of PCR and antibiogram was good. 14 stool samples were available for PCR, 9 of the 14 samples were analyzable and showed good compliance to the results of biopsy-PCR.",

During Schistosoma mansoni infection the immune response characteristically switches from an initial Th1 immune response (IFN-\u0216) to a strong Th2 response (IL-4, IL-13), that is eventually controlled by strong regulatory mechanisms. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that MyD88, a central adaptor molecule for innate immune responses, is necessary to initiate an antigen-specific Th1 response. Interestingly,various schistosomal antigens fail to stimulate dendritic cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that additional stimuli are required to initiate antigen-specific Th1 responses. Schistosome eggs penetrate into the lumen of the gut and we hypothezised that during this process the epithelial barrier is disrupted to allow the commensal bacteria to enter into the Lamina propria. Therefore, bacterial PAMPs could locally act as necessary \"adjuvants\" to instigate a Th1 response. Thus, we investigated whether Schistosoma parasites manipulate the host's bacterial repertoire and analysed the parasitolgical, microbiological and immunological responses of infected mice that were simultaneously depleted of bacteria using broad spectrum antibiotics and antimycotics. After bacterial depletion, we found significantly less inflammation in the intestine wand this was accompanied by a significant decrease in egg load, intestinal granuloma frequency and development. Interestingly, mesenteric lymph-node Th1 cell responses were dampened in infected-depleted mice; however, liver granuloma development was normal indicating that the immune responses were only affected in bacteria-residing areas. This study demonstrates for the first time, that commensal, host derived, bacteria are necessary to perpetuate the life-cycle of a helminth, by supporting egg-penetration into the lumen via Th1-induced immune responses.",

Two colonies each from antral and corpus tissue of the infected gerbils were conserved for genetic characterization of the gene expression of the H. pylori virulence factors.

The H. pylori reisolation rates ranged from 66% to 100%. After eight weeks of infection we obtained a significant increase of active and chronic gastritis in antrum and corpus only of wild type-infected gerbils. The expression analysis revealed a genetic stability of the cag-PAI gene cagY, whereas the effector protein CagA was stably expressed only at the beginning of the time course, but blocked by one third of the reisolates after 64 weeks of WT-infection. In parallel, the tyrosine phosphorylation of CagA was reduced, too. The IL-8 induction ability was missing in about 20% of reisolates starting at 8 weeks, and further reduced after 64 weeks of WT-infection. In contrast, the expression of BabA and OipA showed a gradual decrease over time up to 30% and 60% reduction, respectively. Through the passage of the gerbil stomach the expression pattern of virulence factors of WT-but not those of mutant-infected animals were reduced. Therefore we conclude that the analyzed changes are due to an early severe inflammation in antrum and corpus mucosa leading to histopathological changes over time.

Haas 1 1 Max-von-Pettenkofer Institut, LMU, M\u00fcnchen, Germany Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a gram-negative spiral-shaped bacterium, colonizing persistently the human stomach, thus leading to gastric diseases, like gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Today an infection with this pathogen affects at least 50 % of the world population. Translocation of the cytotoxin-associated antigen A (CagA) via the Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) into the host cell is a major risk factor for gastric diseases. The immunodominant protein CagA is encoded, together with the cag-T4SS, on the cag -pathogenicity island, which comprises 27 genes. After getting in direct contact with the human epithelial cell, Hp is able to translocate the effector protein CagA via the T4SS into the host cells. CagA subsequently is tyrosine-phosphorylated and interacts with several eukaryotic signalling pathways in phosphorylation-dependent and independent ways. A hallmark of CagA is its potential to induce Interleukin-8 secretion, but it also effects the cytoskeleton, tight junctions and several transduction pathways of the cell. CagA is considered as a bacterial oncoprotein. Recently we were able to show that several components of the pilus-like cag-T4SS, CagY and CagI, as well as the translocated effector protein CagA, are interacting with the \u02151-Integrin (ITGB1) on the host cell. Integrins are a family of \u012e\u0215 heterodimeric cell surface adhesion molecules, which mediate cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix and cell-pathogen interactions. We attempt to localize the distinct binding regions of CagA, CagY and CagI within the ITGB1. To identify these regions a Yeast Two Hybrid Assay was performed, generating preliminary data. The biochemical confirmation of these data is going to be accomplished by a Mammalian Two Hybrid System. We propose a new model of interaction between the pathogenic Hp and the eukaryotic cell, mediated by specific interactions of the cag-T4SS and the ITGB1 of the host cell.",

Haas 1 1 Max-von-Pettenkofer Institut, LMU, M\u00fcnchen, Germany Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomachs of more than 50% of the world's population, making it one of the most successful human pathogens. Due to the fact that its genome is subject to rapid mutation and frequent recombination events, H. pylori is one of the most diverse bacterial species. The basic mechanisms underlying this intra-species sequence variation are not well understood, but it is known that natural transformation competence and a conjugation-like mechanism contribute to horizontal gene transfer processes. Indications that conjugative plasmid transfer might occur in H. pylori came from the sequence determination of the cryptic plasmid pHel4. Many H. pylori strains contain such cryptic plasmids. The sequences of these plasmids suggest that there is extensive gene shuffling during evolution and spread of these plasmids. In contrast to other naturally competent bacteria, H. pylori uses a Type IV Secretion System (T4SS), named ComB-T4SS, for DNA uptake. Besides the ComB-T4SS H. pylori strain P12 possesses the Cag-T4SS, the tfs3 and a recently by our lab identified novel T4SS, named tfs4. In this project we are interested in elucidating DNA transfer between H. pylori bacteria and to study the underlying mechanism(s). We expect to identify the machinery that mediates DNA transfer between H. pylori bacteria. To achieve this we sequentially deleted the genes encoding T4SSs in H. pylori strain P12, which are possible candidates for DNA transfer. We could demonstrate transfer of chromosomal DNA and for the first time transfer of an indigenous plasmid of H. pylori between strains. We could show that tfs4 plays a role in plasmid transfer. The data suggest that several diverse mechanisms contribute to horizontal gene transfer of H. pylori.",

            "text": "The complete genome sequence of Helicobacter pylori strain P12: Insights into gene transfer and genome evolution The availability of multiple complete genome sequences for individual bacterial species has revealed a surprising extent of intraspecies genome variability, and the respective core genomes often represent only a small fraction of the entire gene repertoire in a given species. The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known as a species with an enormous sequence diversity in housekeeping genes. Although H. pylori is a highly adapted species with a comparably reduced genome size, previous data suggest that a considerable variability exists in gene content as well, and that adaptive evolution may lead to strain divergence. Genomic comparison of several strains is therefore required to obtain a full view of the host adaptation capabilities of H. pylori. Here, we present the complete genome sequence of the duodenal ulcer strain P12. With a chromosome size of 1,673,813 bp and the presence of an additional 10,225 bp plasmid, P12 possesses the most comprehensive H. pylori genome so far. A comparison with other complete H. pylori genome sequences revealed that two individual H. pylori strains may differ in up to 12% of their gene content, and the amount of genes specific to each genome indicates that H. pylori possesses an open pan-genome. Strain-specific genes are often located at potential genome rearrangement sites, but most of them are clustered in three distinct genome plasticity regions. Two of these plasticity zones are integrated into restriction/ modification genes and are likely to represent genomic islands. Moreover, both encode complete type IV secretion systems, which are related but clearly distinct. Microarray analysis was used to determine the distribution of these type IV secretion systems in different H. pylori strains, and mutational analysis indicated their involvement in horizontal gene transfer. Together with the ComB and Cag systems, H. pylori P12 contains thus four distinct type IV secretion systems.",

Rieder 1 1 Max von Pettenkofer-Institute; Bacteriology, LMU-Munich, Munich, Germany 2 Institute of Pathology, LMU-Munich, Munich, Germany H. pylori persistently colonizes the stomach of about 50 % of the human population. Epidemiological studies have shown that a H. pylori-associated corpus dominant atrophic gastritis is a risk factor to develop gastric cancer. Therefore H. pylori has been classified as type I carcinogen by the WHO. Aim: Based on this, we investigated the precancerous process starting with a H. pylori-associated gastritis, followed by an atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia, and finally leading to a gastric adenocarcinoma using the Mongolian gerbil model. Methods: The animals (n = 170) were infected with H. pylori B128 (WT) or an isogenic \u01fbcagY-mutant for two to 64 weeks. Paraffin sections of antrum and corpus mucosa were graded and histological changes verified by immunohistochemistry. Physiological and inflammatory markers were measured by RIA and qRT-PCR, respectively. Results: In comparison to the \u01fbcagY-mutant, the WT-infected corpus mucosa revealed already a severe atrophic inflammation after eight weeks, accompanied by a significant up-rise of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1-\u0215, TNF-\u012e, IFN-\u0216, and KC. Physiological markers (pH, gastrin) and histological changes of the mucosa towards atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia were occurring during late infection. Interestingly, the colonization density of WT-infected gerbils is uprising in the corpus continuously over the time period. After 14 months of WT-infection we found severe histological changes of the corpus showing typical precancerous markers and prominent gastritis cystica profunda. There was only one WT-infected gerbil developing gastric cancer. Conclusion: Our data reveal that an intact cagPAI is responsible for an early severe inflammation inducing later physiological and histopathological changes. Each step of the cancer pathway (atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia) could be shown, even up to developing gastric cancer. Therefore, we conclude that the gerbil model is one of the best models mimicking the human situation. Thoracic, Transplant and Vascular Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany Objectives: Surgical site infections are a very expensive complication in cardiac surgery. The total costs for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery followed by deep sternal wound infection (DSWI) are estimated to be much higher than for normal, caused by expanded length of stay, reoperations and special treatment such as vacuum-assisted closure therapy and antibiotic therapy. This study compares the length of stay and the total costs of patients undergoing CABG and developing a DSWI or not. Methods: A case-control study was performed. The total costs were analyzed and compared to patients undergoing CABG without DSWI. Inclusion criterion for cases was the development of a deep sternal wound infection according to CDC-criteria during the hospital stay with CABG. Controls were matched by having the same type of surgery (DRG), age +/-five years, gender, same duration of preoperative stay +/-two days. The time until the development of the infection was taken as the minimum length of stay for the controls. Controls showing sings of infection during the hospital stay were excluded. Results: 17 CABG patients with DSWI, between January 2006 and December 2007, were included in the study. The cases were matched to 34 controls. The average cost of CABG procedure plus treatment of DSWI was 39544 Euro per patient and almost two times higher than the mean cost of CABG alone (19258 Euro, p<0 .05) The average length of stay (LOS) in hospital was more than two times longer (34.4 days vs. 16.5 days) the average LOS on ICU was also longer (6.2 days vs. 5.3 days, no significance). The controls represented the basic population. Conclusion: DSWI is a devasting complication for surgeons and patients but it is also an important economic factor for the hospital. In average 4326 \u20ac were lost for a single case of DSWI during the study period. Measures for the reduction of DSWI will be cost-effective. Therefore a bundle of infection control measures will be essential.",

Moreover intensified advice and support given by our Institute of Hospital Hygiene was checked on its effect and acceptance. For that purpose continous visits to every newly identified MRSA-patient were carried out with a check list of reliable defaults. Within the scope of active surveillance a patient-individual capture of MRSA-relevant data was made and the corresponding ward got written information when deviation from procedure instruction for handling with MRSA was discovered. After the end of the observation period an examination of achieved medical records was finally carried out in order to get a full survey about documentation of the individual MRSA-case. From 397 visits on different wards in 278 of these visits mistakes could be found in realization of hygienic guidelines and/or therapy of the corresponding MRSA-patient. The percentage of visits where deficits could be found was between a minimum of 37.5% and a maximum of 100%, depending on the ward. It could be shown over and over again that an unauthorized gradation of the importance of particular hygienic measures was committed by several individuals involved. A promising control of MRSA needs administrative and scientific guidance and sufficient financial and personnel resources. Periodical visits by hygienic personnel on wards with MRSApatients will support compliance, lead to a better control and help find out and eliminate mistakes. In addition to these measures, medical staff involved in caring for patients must be informed and trained more adequately in dealing with MRSA.",

Six epidemic clones are regarded as common in Rostock: \"Norddeutscher\", \"S\u00fcddeutscher\", \"Hannoverscher\", \"Berliner\", \"Barnim\" and \"Rhein-Hessen\". The analysis intended to monitor the distribution of the different clones at the University hospital Rostock and possible changes in the course of five years. MRSA isolates were analysed using the restriction enzyme SmaI. Reference strains of the epidemic clones mentioned above were used as controls on every single gel to allow the direct comparison. Analysis was performed both manually and with the help of the software GelCompar-II (Applied Maths). We analysed 127 distinct isolates in 2004 , 97 in 2006 and 176 in 2008 . In the years 2004 , 2006 and 2008 the clinical isolates clustered with the epidemic clones as follows (in percent, absolute count in brackets): \"Norddeutscher\" 2% (3), 1% (1), 1% (2); \"S\u00fcddeutscher\" 12% (15), 7% (7), 3% (6); \"Hannoverscher\" 1% (1), 1% (1); 0% (0); \"Berliner\" 5% (6), 1% (1), 2% (4); \"Barnim\" 15% (19), 13% (12), 35% (62); \"Rhein-Hessen\" 65% (83), 77% (74), 58% (102). One isolate in 2006 that could not be assigned to the six clones was subsequently identified as belonging to the \"Wiener\" epidemic clone by the National Reference Centre for staphylococci (RKI Wernigerode). While the epidemic clones \"Berliner\", \"Hannoverscher\" and \"Norddeutscher\" were and remained nearly absent at our hospital and the clone \"Rhein-Hessen\" was the predominant isolate over the years, we detected a relative decrease of the clone \"S\u00fcddeutscher\"and a marked increase of the clone \"Barnim\" between the years 2004 and 2008. The results suggest that regularly repeated PFGE analysis is a suitable method to detect local shifts in the distribution of the epidemic clones over the years. Typing intervals of two years appear to be sufficient for a general survey.",

Methods: We developed and maintain a software application for outbreak article processing and analysis. We used the freely accessible outbreak database (http://www.outbreak-database.com) to determine the quality of outbreak publications in the literature over time. A structured questionnaire was used to extract specific information. The following categories were used: reference, type of study, application of epidemiologic or fingerprinting methods, type of microorganism, setting, number of patients and personnel involved, type of infection, source of infection, mode of transmission, risk factors, and preventive measures. We performed an analysis restricted to the study type applied to investigate the outbreaks and the percentage of outbreaks without any source identified for the Actual question for prevention of hospital infections is development of new chemical preparations, able to kill bacterial spores, which are highly resistant to disinfectants and antiseptics. The operated skin area, nurses', surgeon's, obstetrician, medical personal hands are to be free from microbial contamination, including agents of clostridial infections. The purpose of this work is to prove sporocidal activity of new polyhexamethilenguanidine chloride derivate -\"Teflex A\". Teflex A is new water soluble skin disinfectant preparation of PHMG-HCl derivate, registered in Russian Federation in 2007 and produced by company \"Soft Protector\" in Saint Petersbrug. Sporocidal activity against bacterial spores of Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile was investigated in vitro by 3 independent microbiological expert laboratories with suspension method. It was established that Teflex A in concentration 0,4% expresses high sporocidal action against Bacillus and Clostridium species with reduction 10-4 -10-6. Antimicrobial and sporocidal properties allows it put Teflex A in the list of \"high level disinfectants\" and use it for skin and mucosal disinfection.",

Therefore silver compounds are used as antimicrobial agents in medicine, for treatments of burns, for coating of catheters and the production of sport clothing or socks. The antimicrobial effect of silver coated textiles was tested in different practical applications with circulating water. In some of these equipments a reduction of the microorganisms was detected, but in some there was no significant effect, although there was an adequacy concentration of silver detected with the AAS (atom absorption spectrometry). To get an idea how many of the detected silver is microbicidal active and not bound to organic material or in complexes (e.g. silver-thiosulfate or silverrhodanide) a specific bio-assay was developed. Therefore different bacterial strains were tested with different calculated silverconcentrations in Aqua dest. We used Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella pneumophila as indicator strains. The reducing effect was allegorized graphically and the regressions were determined. Following the concentration of microbicidal active silver in a water sample can be calculated. The results show, that there might be a discrepancy between the concentration of silver, determined with the AAS and the concentration of biocidal silver determined in the bio-assay. This established bio-assay is a well adapted procedure to assign the concentration of silver in the different tested water systems considering the different aspects like complexation and the fixation of silver ions on organic matrix.",

Flavimonas, L. pneumophila MTZ (serogroup 1), Hartmanella sp. This microcosm was stable for several months when fresh tap water was added on a weekly basis. L. pneumophila expresses a 16kDa protein Pad (L. pneumophila amoebal adhesin) which is involved in the adherence/uptake of the bacterium into the amoebal host. It is a Legionella pneumophila-specific fitness factor exposed at the surface of the bacterial cell with a length of 136 amino acids. To investigate the function of this adhesin in more detail we constructed knockout mutants from the natural L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strain by electroporation and transformation. The mutations were confirmed by western blotting using specific monoclonal antibodies and PCR-analysis. These mutants showed no defect adhesion in the Acanthamoeba castellanii ATCC 30234 strain, but were reduced in the uptake within the Hartmanella vermiformis strain ATCC. Further the behaviour of the wild-type and the mutant strains were studies under natural condition within the microcosms. These studies are under way.

Regardless of the proportion of new MRSA patients causes the cumulative proportion of non-eradicated and readmitted MRSA patients, the \"MRSA patient-pool\", a significant and often decisive trend in the annual MRSA burden for the institution. To avoid a blending of these two important determinants of the epidemiology of MRSA, the proportion of new MRSA-positive patients and the proportion of known MRSA-positive patients must be described and evaluated separately. For these purposes we have developed the epimetric model. It allows us, unlike the previous, mostly static and only in closed periods evaluated statistics, to estimate the emergence of MRSA as a dynamic event. Based on the three basic vectors: 1) new MRSA patients, 2) readmitted MRSA patients, 3) consisting of 1) + 2) compounded MRSA patient-pool, the following dynamics were arranged and grouped as follows: -development and history of MRSA situation over variable periods, -the effectiveness of surveillance, -simulation of various scenarios by changing the basic vectors. This process model presented here can also be used for other nosocomial and nonnosocomial disease entities.

A rectal swab was taken from every patient on admission, transferred into a VRE selective enrichment broth containing vancomycin (6mg/L) and incubated at 36\u00baC for at least 24 hours. When growth of VRE was suspected real-time Lightcycler PCR was performed to detect the presence of vanA-and vanB-genes. A total of 205 swabs were processed. In 48% (99/205) a color change of the broth indicated a possible growth of enterococci after 24 hrs. However, subsequent PCR analysis confirmed the presence of vanA or vanB only in 8.2% (17/205). A total of 52% (106/205) of the inoculated broths showed no bacterial growth even after 48 hrs incubation. The combination of culture-and PCR-based methods is a very useful tool for the cost-effective and rapid detection of VRE from screening samples and proved to be a valuable means to control the further spread of VRE in hospital.",

M\u00f6ller 1 1 DWI an der RWTH Aachen e.V., Aachen, Germany A switchable controlled release system is presented which is able to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis on textile material. Nisin, an antimicrobial drug was encapsulated together with sodium chloride in silicone microspheres. Getting into contact with water the microspheres imbibe a small amount of water and the encapsulated sodium chloride is dissolved. Due to the osmotic pressure of the dissolution more water is imbibed in the microspheres and as a result the silicone microspheres swell and a network of crazes occurs. Due to this nisin and some part of sodium chloride are released. If not wetted, the encapsulated nisin and sodium chloride are conserved in the microspheres for a long time. The nisin-loaded microspheres were produced by using the solvent evaporation process. The particle size of the microspheres is averaged 650 \u03bcm. The release behaviour of sodium chloride was proved using an ion sensitive electrode and the effect of the released nisin was shown by monitoring growth curves of Bacillus subtilis. A minimum concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM nisin was found to be effective inhibiting the growth of Bacillus subtilis. The repeated release of nisin from the microspheres was also confirmed. It was shown that nisin is better available under acidic conditions and thus more effective. The mechanism of the swelling-controlled release of antimicrobial effective peptides opens up perspectives for the development of a new finishing for technical textiles. A release of peptides only takes place, if the condition for a microbial infestation is given.",

Jahn *1 1 Hygiene und Umweltmedizin, HSK, Dr. Horst Schmidt Klinik, Wiesbaden, Wiesbaden, Germany Drinking water supply by dispensing systems has evolved as an alternative to bottled water, minimizing need for storage and in house logistics. With bottled water, the patient is supplied with a new receptacle by every change of bottle. Using dispensing systems the patient must be provided with a receptacle that allows the dispensed water to be available at the bed side. To obtain criteria for the replacement frequency of these receptacles, the microbial contamination of residual volumes was analyzed and related to the duration of use, i. e. the length of the patient's hospital stay. Single use PET bottles with 1000 ml volumes to be filled at the dispensing systems were supplied to the patient at the beginning of hospital stay. Drinking glasses were provided ad libitum. At the end of stay, the bottles were collected and bottles with a residual volume 20 ml were included in the study. For controls, freshly dispensed aliquots were obtained from the respective dispensing system. Microbiological analysis was performed according to standard procedures for drinking water quality assessment. Additionally, aliquots were plated on Columbia agar for further analysis of contaminating bacterial species. Overall 132 bottles were examined and compared to 30 control samples. Duration of use corresponding to length of stay (LOS) ranged between 1 and 13 days. Linear regression analysis of LOS and colony counts after incubation at 36 \u00b11\u00baC for 44\u00b14h showed no correlation (R 2 = 0,16 for cfu 20-100/ml and R 2 =0,12 for cfu > 100ml).

Natami 1 1 Department of Microbiology, Hormozgan university of medical sciences, Bandar Abbas, Iran Staphylococcus aureus has longley been recognized as an important pathogen in human infections, specially in hospitalized patients. Treatment of infections due to Methicillin-Resistant S.aureus (MRSA), which now are most often multi-resistant, has become problematic. Screening of health care workers, allow early detection of nasal carriers for prevention of subsequent transmissions. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of nasal carriers of MRSA among Shahid Mohammadi Hospital staff. In this cross-sectional study a total of 200 nasal samples were cultured on Manitol-Salt agar plates and incubated at 37 C for 24-48 hours. Identification of the suspicious colonies were carried out by Coagulase and Dnase tests. MRSA strains were detected by Oxacillin disk diffusion method. An oxacillin (MIC) > 4 \u03bcg/ml was considered as methicillin resistance. S.aureus carriage state was detected in 48 (%24) of members which 4(%2) out of them were MRSA. Prevalence of S.aureus and MRSA in relation to age, sex, ward, occupation, duration of working in hospital and cigarette smoking was described. There was no rational relation between job and carrier state of MRSA in this study, But a direct relation was observed between duration of presence in hospital and nasal carriage of MRSA. The highest rate of MRSA carriage was seen in operation room staff. Since nasal carriage of S.aureus appears to play a key role in the epidemiology and pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections, detection and eradication of MRSA carriage is recommended. Background: Numerous studies demonstrated that nosocomial infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are attended by increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore they present a high financial burden for hospitals and community. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate attributable costs for nosocomial MRSA-pneumonia inside the German DRG-System. Methods: We conducted a case-control study including all patients (pts.) with nosocomial pneumonia caused by MRSA and by meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) admitted between January 2005 and December 2007. Pneumonia was defined using CDC criteria. Nosocomial cases with MRSA-pneumonia were matched to control patients with MSSA-pneumonia in a ratio 1:1 using following matching criteria: admission in the same year, minimum length of stay corresponding to time at risk of the case, Charlson Comorbidity-Index \u00b11, occurrence of pneumonia at intensive care unit (ICU). Results: Our analysis includes 82 patients (41 cases : 41 controls). The median overall costs for patients with nosocomial MRSA-pneumonia were significant higher than for control patients (60,684\u20ac vs. 38,731\u20ac; p=0,011). Furthermore we detected a significant difference in the median financial loss for cases and controls (11,704\u20ac vs. 2,662\u20ac; p=0,002). The attributable costs for MRSApneumonia were 17,282\u20ac in median (p<0,001). The acquisition of MRSA-pneumonia on ICU (ME=2,6; p<0,001), ventilation >500h (ME=2,6; p<0,001), liver disease (ME=1,5; p=0,021) and MRSApneumonia (ME=1,8; p=0,01) were predictive for increased costs in multivariate regression analysis. Conclusion: This study pointed out that nosocomial MRSA-pneumonia is associated with high costs for healthcare systems compared with MSSA-Pneumonia. Appropriate infection control measures will be cost-effective and therefore essential.",

In many countries official guidelines recommend alkaline treatment and/or steam sterilization to prevent cross infection via contaminated invasive devices. We report an animal model using steel wires contaminated with the 263K scrapie strain to evaluate decontamination processes for prions. Contaminated wires were subjected to different cleaning, disinfection and sterilization processes prior to implantation in hamsters. The surviving time of the animals was used as a parameter for infectivity. In previous studies we could demonstrate that alkaline cleaning at 70\u00baC is effective against 263K dried on steel surface. Data from the current study indicate that low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization alone or in combination with alkaline detergents are highly effective against prions. The results are relevant for processing of thermolabile critical devices such as electric, electronic or optical modules or delicate mechanical parts of surgical instruments. Results: A total of 1,280,331 patients with 4,519,338 patient-days were included and 21,608 nosocomial infections were recorded. In lower respiratory tract infections, the five most common pathogens were S. aureus (21.3/100 NI), P. aeruginosa (18.1/100 NI), Klebsiella spp. (12.6/100 NI), E. coli (11.7/100 NI), and Enterobacter spp. (8.6/100 NI) in declining order. Primary bloodstream infections were diagnosed with coagulase-negative staphylococcus (33.5/100 NI) most frequently, followed by S. aureus (13.8/100 NI), Enterococcus spp. (13.7/100 NI), Klebsiella spp. (4.5/100 NI), and C. albicans (4.4/100 NI). After stratification for the type of ICU, differences in the distribution of pathogens could be shown. Overall 35.3% of all S. aureus isolates were MRSA, ranging from 31.1% in 2003 to 36.5% in 2007. The ratio of VRE in susceptible Enterococci was 2.7% overall. The proportion of ESBL producing bacteria was 6.4% for infections caused by E. coli and 11.2% for infections with Klebsiella spp. Conclusions: The KISS data present an overview of the most important pathogens associated with nosocomial infections and show current trends in antimicrobial resistance in ICU in Germany.",

Extended-spectrum \u0215-lactamases (ESBL) are enzymes produced by gram-negative bacteria that have the ability to inactivate \u0215-lactam antibiotics containing an oxyimino group. Between July and December 2007 a colonization with ESBL -producing Escherichia coli was observed in 26 neonates from the neonatal intensive care unit of a 800-bed teaching hospital in Oldenburg, Germany. Infection control measures were implemented but failed to interrupt the outbreak. The outbreak investigation included case identification, review of medical records, environmental cultures, patient surveillance cultures, personnel stool cultures, Multiplex PCR for blaCTX-M and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Genotypical analysis of all the clinical isolates and 2 isolates from the staff indicated that cases were not due to a single clone. 22 neonates and the two staff members were colonized by CTX-M-15 beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli strains clonally related in PFGE-analysis.

Reichardt 1 , P. Gastmeier 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene und Umweltmedizin, Charit\u00e9, Berlin, Germany Background: It is known that hand disinfection (HD) is often not sufficiently realized and there is a wide variance of hand hygiene compliance between comparable wards. Alcoholic handrub consumption (AHC) is widely accepted as a surrogate parameter for hand hygiene compliance. In the framework of the German campaign \"Aktion saubere H\u00e4nde\" the component \"HAND-KISS\" was established to measure the AHC in the participating hospitals and wards and to create benchmark data. Objective: To investigate if there is a correlation between AHC in intensive care units (ICUs) and peripheral wards belonging to one department with a focus on paediatric wards. Method: The AHC data from 2007 were used for analysis. The data from paediatric ICUs and peripheral wards were recorded separately. The correlation of AHC in both groups was investigated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results: A total of 13 departments provided data. In paediatric ICUs a mean of AHC of 87 ml per patient day was recorded with a wide range between the ICUs(Interquantilerange (IQR) 46 to 138 ml per patient day). In peripheral wards a median AHC of 32 per patient day (IQR 19 to 49 ml per patient day) was found. A significant correlation (correlation coefficient=0,588, p=0,035) of AHC between intensive and peripheral wards within a paediatric department was shown. Conclusion: The infection control climate in the department (and probable the role model of the head of the department) may have a major impact on the AHC and hand hygiene compliance in a given department.",

Daily number of indications for HH (HHI) and performed HH activities (HHA) for patients on specific isolation precautions are unknown. Therefore we investigated HHI, HHA and Compliance rates (CRs) and glove usage (GU) for MRSA positive patients based on direct observation. Material and Methods: The observation period lasted 192 hours and was done evenly throughout the day (00:00 to 24:00) at a surgical intensive care unit (ICU) and a surgical intermediate care unit (IMCU) at the University Hospital Aachen. Analysis was performed according to the WHO indications; performance and usage of gloves were documented. Results: 233 and 198 HHI/patient-day (PD), 110 and 79 HHA/PD were documented, thus resulting in CRs of 47% for ICU and 40% for IMCU, respectively. Most HHI/shift occurred in early shift (ICU: 104.75 ; IMCU: 92.25), followed by late shift, and significantly less HHI occurred during night shift (64.25, p=0.02; 41.25, p=0.006) . Despite this fact, CR during early shift was highest for ICU (51%) and median for IMCU (40%). CR was highest after patient contact (ICU: 79%, IMCU: 57%), significant lower before aseptic task (ICU: 13%; IMCU: 14%; p=0.02; figure 1) compared to the other indications. When HHA before patient contact and before aseptic task was missed, gloves were used instead of in 83% and 38% (ICU) and in 79% and 47% (IMCU). Performance of nearly all documented HHA was adequate. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge we present the first data on HHI, HHA and CR in MRSA-positive patients including a shift-and indicationspecific analysis. Even for patients under special isolation precautions CRs have not turned out satisfactory. Additional effort seems to be necessary to improve CR especially before aseptic task, the indication associated with the most important impact on the prevention of HCAI. Background: Substantial progress in radiology was made by the use of highpressure injectors of contrast media.

In the context of hospital infections errors in treatment are still rare. We performed a study in corporation with ECCLESIA Insurance to evaluate claimed hygiene failures (HF) and their impact for errors in treatment from the view of a panel of experts (PE). Method: To systematically analyse the notifications of claim due to HF the data of 254 hospitals, supported by ECCLESIA from 1996 to 2006, were surveyed. 450 cases were reported as \"HF\" by the insurance. Only cases with a minimal payment of \u20ac 700 were included.

Results: The PE found that in 40 cases (45%, Group1) the proceeding based on HF. In 17 cases (19%, Group2) originally a HF was complained, but in the end the proceeding was exclusively based on errors in therapy or diagnostic. In 9 cases (11%) initially a HF was designated, though not precisely described any further. 21 cases (24%) could not be classified as HF from the perspective of the PE. Furthermore the experts made up their professional opinion if the loss occurrence was really based on HF. 19 cases were evaluated as a likely HF, 10 cases as unlikely, and 39 could not be classified retrospectively. 57% of the entire cases appeared in surgery, 22% have been reported from gynaecology. Most types of infection were wound infections (41 cases), followed by gastroenteritis and sepsis. The most frequently described HF was non-sterile surgery. Errors in treatment in Group1 and Group2 lead to mean costs of about \u20ac 10.000 per case. Conclusion: The evaluation showed that HF had a minor impact for notification of claims. Furthermore only a low rate of claimed HF could be assessed as really HF retrospectively. Often detailed information for determining a HF could not be collected retrospectively.",

There is an urgent necessity to implement prevention and control strategies of MDR. To elucidate the efficacy of measures taken to control outbreaks with MDR we performed a systematic review. Methods: Outbreak reports and emergence of MDR were identified through searching PubMed and the Outbreak Database using the mesh-terms Acinetobacter, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas aeruginosa/ multiresistant/ outbreak/ control. Over the period from 2000-2009, only studies describing infection control measures were included. No experimental studies investigating the effectiveness of prevention measures were detected. Results: Overall, 27 papers were analyzed reporting on 25 outbreaks that involved 2273 patients (pts) (median 60pts), with 157 fatal cases. Mean mortality was 31%. 67% of the pts were infected, the others colonized. Mean duration of the outbreaks were 12.6 months (1-72 months). Acinetobacter baumanii and Klebsiella ESBL both accounted for 37% of the outbreaks. Control measures included environmental decontamination of ICUs (56%), active surveillance for colonization (67%), educational programs for the staff (37%), single or cohort isolation (59%) and antimicrobial use recommendations (11%). In 3 reports wards were closed to control the outbreak (11%). From all control measures only the active surveillance for colonization was associated to outbreaks comprising less patients than the median (p=0.04). Conclusions: No studies compared different control measures to prove efficacy. Immediate implementation of control measures may prevent the temporary closure of wards and limits the outbreak. In high-risk areas for MDR screening on admission and interval screening has to be discussed. Controlled studies investigating the effectiveness of different control measures are needed. Aims: Recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to sites of inflammation plays an essential role in immune defence. The \u02152-integrins LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) are important for PMN migration into tissue and for phagocytosis of invading microorganisms. Activation of human PMN with an LFA-1-specific antibody induces upregulation of Mac-1 expression. However, the enzymes involved in this signalling pathway are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the possible participation of tyrosine kinases in this signalling cascade. Methods: The effect of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors on CD11b expression was analysed after stimulation with the LFA-1-specific activating antibody TS1/22. These inhibitors were genistein, a broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and compound 56, a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor. Six to eight whole blood samples of different healthy volunteers were incubated with the inhibitors at different concentrations for 10 min at 37\u00baC. After adding the TS1/22 antibody (130 \u03bcg/mL, final concentration) samples were taken at several intervals (3 to 30 min). CD11b expression was analysed by flow cytometry using a specific PE-labelled anti-CD11b antibody. PMN were distinguished from other leukocytes by means of forward and sideward scatter. The statistical analysis was based on Wilcoxon tests using SPSS 17.0. Results: LFA-1-induced CD11b expression was inhibited by genistein and compound 56 in a concentration-dependent manner. Genistein decreased LFA-1-induced CD11b expression by up to 34 %, compound 56 decreased expression by up to 18 % (p<0.001 in each case). Conclusions: A major part of the signalling pathway activated by TS1/22 and leading to CD11b expression depends on the activity of different tyrosine kinases. Further experiments will show if inhibition of CD11b expression after TS1/22 activation also occurs with tyrosine kinase inhibitors licensed for treatment of e.g. chronic myelogenous leukemia. The isoflavone genistein is found in food and is considered to be phytoestrogen and a broad-range tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Most investigations are related to possible applications for cancer treatment. We investigated ist influence on the function of macrophages, in particular with respect to interactions with Candida albicans. Whereas treatment of macrophages with genistein did not influence phagocytosis of C. albicans , pretreatment of C. albicans with genistein significantly increased the phagocytosis activity of the murine cell line RAW264.7. In addition, we could show that genistein treated C. albicans increased the production of the cytokines IL-10 and TNF\u012e. As \u0215-1,3-glucans of the cell wall are mainly responsible for the activation of C. albicans phagocytosis, the exposure of cell wall \u0215-1,3-glucans was analyzed by flow cytometry. However, no increased exposure due to genistein treatment was observed. We supposed that genistein could target one of the histidine kinases (chk1p, casln1p, cos1p) in C. albicans, which are involved in cell wall integrity, virulence, and stress response. As inhibition of casln1p and cos1p by osmotic stress leads to enhanced glycerol production, we determined glycerol concentrations after genistein treatment of C. albicans and found a slightly increase. Thus, genistein influenced C. albicans so that it enhanced immune defence mechanisms of murine macrophages. This effect could at least partly be due to a histidine kinase inhibitory effect. Filarial parasites are transmitted by insect vectors and therefore enter the host\u00b4s body through the skin. However, only a minor proportion of infective larvae is able to develop into adults. Thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17 can be produced by a variety of cells, among them dendritic cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Some of them are ideally placed to be the first cells that interact with filarial worms, as it enters via an insect vector through the skin, initiating innate and adaptive immune responses. However, little is known about the mechanism of these early, local events in filarial infections. We have determined that deficiency of CCL17 leads to a 3-4fold higher parasite burden compared to heterozygote controls at day 30 post infection with the rodent filariae Litomosoides sigmodontis. We could not detect differences in the cellular influx and cytokine response in the pleural cavity, the final destination of the filariae. Differences in parasite loads were present already at day 10, pointing out that very early responses are responsible for parasite survival. The parasitological phenotype was associated with a greater influx and degranulation of mast cells in the skin. Additionally, a higher vascular permeability and expression of lymphangiogenesis factors were found. Parasitological outcome and vascular permeability could be reversed by inhibition of mast cell degranulation with cromolyn. Our findings reveal that mast cell migration is inhibited by CCL17 and thereby aggravating larval establishment probably by reduction of vascular permeability of the skin vessels.",

Grauling-Halama 1 , G. Geginat *1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Medizin Mannheim der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany Rapid antigen degradation is the prerequisite for MHC class I-restricted presentation and the recognition of infected cells by pathogen-specific CD8 T cells. Instable viral and bacterial translation products have been implicated as substrates for the rapid processing and presentation of antigenic peptides in the context of MHC class I molecules. Instable translation products can either be structurally altered e.g. by premature C-terminal truncation or structurally intact but misfolded. In contrast to truncated translation products misfolded translation products can not be easily differentiated from properly folded proteins. Due to theses experimental limitations we applied a mathematical model of antigen processing (Janda & Geginat, J Theor Biol, 250:532) to estimate the relative contribution of instable versus stable variants of the Listeria monocytogenes-derived T cell antigen p60 to the processing of the p60derived CD8 T cell epitopes p60 217-225 and p60 449-457. Non-linear regression analysis of published experimental data suggests that both antigenic peptides are derived from a putative instable form of p60 with an intracellular half-live of approximately one minute that accounts for roughly 30% of all p60 molecules. Remarkably, the quantitative analysis also indicates that the majority of stable p60 molecules with an intracellular half-live of 300 minutes do not play any role as substrate for the processing of p60-derived antigenic peptides. To explore the function of PKC-\u0219 in toxoplasmosis, BALB/c PKC-\u0219 -/and wildtype (WT) mice were infected with T. gondii cysts. Whereas 80% of PKC\u0219 -/mice succumbed to the infection until day 28 post infection, 90 % of WT mice survived up to day 60 post infection. A histopathological examination revealed that PKC-\u0219 -/mice had a significantly increased parasite load as compared to WT animals. The impaired parasite control of PKC-\u0219 -/mice resulted in a necrotizing Toxoplasma encephalitis. Both, uninfected PKC-\u0219 -/and WT mice harboured equally low numbers of CD4 and CD8 T-cells, B cells, macrophages, and granulocytes in their brains. Upon infection with T. gondii all leukocyte populations increased in the brains of both strains of mice. However, numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells were higher in WT animals. In addition, the number of T. gondii-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were initially reduced in spleen and brain of PKC-\u0219 -/mice and only reached comparable numbers to WT animals shortly before death of PKC-\u0219 -/mice. Numbers of B cells were also reduced in brain of infected PKC-\u0219 -/-. This and the reduced GATA3 expression of PKC-\u0219 -/-CD4 T cells was paralleled by a reduced production of T. gondiispecific IgG and IgM antibodies in serum and cerebro-spinal fluid of PKC-\u0219 -/mice. A further analysis of signalling pathways in T cells of T. gondii-infected mice revealed an impaired activation of the NF-\u021bB pathway as indicated by reduced expression of p-IKK \u012e/\u0215, p-I\u021bB, and Rel A in PKC-\u0219 -/mice. The activation of MAPK pathway was significantly affected with reduced expression of pERK and pjun, although there was an increased expression of pfos in PKC-\u0219 -/mice. These findings show that PKC-\u0219 is important for survival, efficient parasite control as well as protective T and B cell responses in toxoplasmosis.",

Staphylococcus (S.) aureus superantigens (SAgs) are highly potent T cell mitogens and the causative agents of toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning. Most S. aureus strains have SAgs and patterns are highly variable. To date, the role of SAgs in bacteremia is not well defined. To analyze whether Sags play a role in bacteremia, we investigated S. aureus strains and anti-Sag antibody responses in 44 cases of S. aureus bacteremia in iv drug users and 44 age-and sex-matched nonaddicts. All S. aureus isolates were analyzed for spa-genotype and Sag gene pattern. Neutralizing capacity of sera from diagnosis (day 0) and four weeks thereafter (day 28) was tested against the Sag cocktail produced by the respective infecting strain as well as a panel of representative recombinant Sags. A rise in neutralizing antibody titers indicates that Sags are produced during infection. Genetic analysis confirmed our previous observation that most strains harbor Sag genes, which are linked to staphylococcal lineages. Isolates from iv drug users and nonaddicts did not differ in their Sag gene pattern. Interestingly, the staphylococcal lineage ST59 (spa-type t172, agr 1, and sea, seb, sek and seq) was much more prevalent among bacteremia strains from iv drug users than from nonaddicts (p=0.01). Most iv drug users had neutralizing antibodies against Sags already at onset of bacteremia, likely due to previous encounters with the infecting strain. We frequently observed a rise in antibody titers during infection. Surprisingly patients with ST59 strains did not show any elevations in neutralizing antibody levels.",

In a previous study, we could show that expression of gp130 on astrocytes in mice is critical for survival of TE. In the present study, we analyzed the function of neuronal gp130 in TE. After infection with T. gondii, mice lacking neuronal gp130 (Synapsin-Cre gp130 fl/fl) died significantly earlier in the chronic phase of infection than control gp130fl/fl mice. Death of Synapsin-Cre cre gp130 fl/fl was due to a severe encephalitis with larger inflammatory lesions and higher numbers of inflammatory leukocytes. Additionally, TE of Synapsin-Cre gp130 fl/fl mice resulted in a substantial apoptosis of neurons both in the vicinity of inflammatory lesions and also in brain areas without inflammation. In vitro, apoptosis of gp130-deficient neurons was also significantly increased upon infection with T. gondii or stimulation with TNF as compared to gp130 expressing neurons. Interestingly, the intracerebral parasitic burden was not increased in Synapsin-Cre gp130 fl/fl mice indicating that the immunoregulatory role of neurons is more important than their anti-parasitic function.",

Recently, vaccination against tumors became more and more attractive as an alternative preventative and therapeutical strategy. For protection against viruses, intracellular bacteria and also tumors, an MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation is crucial to induce a CD8 T-cell response. Characteristically, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is able to invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. The internalized gram-negative bacteria then remain confined to a Salmonella-containing vesicle (SCV) and thus are isolated from the cytosolic environment of the host cell. Recently we have developed a new vaccination strategy by using the Salmonella type III secretion system (T3SS) to translocate proteins directly into the cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells and macrophages), which results in the efficient induction of specific CD8 T-cells. As a first step towards a new immunotherapy of malignant cells, we evaluated the potential of Salmonella`s T3SS to induce a prophylactic CD8 T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity against a highly aggressive murine fibrosarcoma. In vivo protection studies revealed that 80% of these mice remained cancer-free after challenge. In another approach we constructed Salmonella strains that translocate immunogenic epitopes of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) via their T3SS. Other groups already have shown the anti-tumor effect of DNA vaccination against VEGFR2 by preventing effective angiogenesis and inhibiting tumor growth. VEGFR2 is a member of the tyrosine protein kinase family and is upregulated on proliferating endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature. It plays a major role in tumor neoangiogenesis. The induction of a specific Salmonella-induced CD8 T cell immune response against VEGFR2 prevents tumor angiogenesis and reduces lung metastasis in an artificial metastasis model in the mouse. Helicobacter pylori is a recognized cancerogenic bacterial agent in humans, which is associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Immunoevasive and immunomodulatory mechanisms underlie the chronic persistence of the bacterium and the active proinflammatory effect of life-long H. pylori infection, which, in susceptible hosts, may trigger and drive cancerogenesis. In contrast to tumorigenic viruses, which frequently possess factors to influence the host ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) for the purpose of subverting immune responses, nothing is yet known about potential effects of H. pylori in this respect. The majority of H. pylori isolates worldwide possess a pathogenicity island (PAI), cagPAI, which is involved in IL-8 production and chronic inflammation in the context of the infection. We hypothesized that the cagPAI may have an influence on host cell ubiquitin pathways. The influence of H. pylori wild type and isogenic mutants lacking the complete cagPAI (or single PAI proteins) on host deubiqutinating enzymes was tested in coincubation experiments with various human gastric epithelial cell lines. Known deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) were identified to be active in human gastric cell lines. An influence of the H. pylori infection on the expression and activity of defined cellular UPS proteins, namely the DUB USP7 (HAUSP), was clearly determined. cag-dependent as well as cag-independent effects on the activity and expression of deubiquitinating enyzmes were observed in infected cells. These results are a basis for further investigations into potential H. pylori modulators of cellular UPS functions.",

            "text": "Flagellins of the chronic gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori and related bacteria have been shown to deploy only low potential to activate proinflammatory signalling in gastric and intestinal epithelial cells, which possess active TOLL-like receptor 5 (TLR5). Flagellins of numerous other pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species are potent activators of the human innate immune system and of proinflammatory responses by binding to TLR5. Evasion of TLR5-mediated responses appears to be a potent strategy for persistent bacteria such as H. pylori to evade the human innate and adaptive immune reaction, and to possibly downmodulate cancer-protective responses. The mechanism of the flagellar immune evasion by H. pylori was not known. We show here by co-precipitation and binding assays that both H. pylori flagellins, FlaA and FlaB, which both have low activity to induce NF-\u021bB activation and IL-8 release via TLR5, do evade stable physical binding to TLR5, but still bind to human and mouse cells. Moreover, H. pylori flagellins can induce extensive signalling in gastric epithelial cells as assessed by microarray hybridisation and RT PCR. In order to assess the contribution of TLR5 to these signalling events, primary mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEF) of TLR5 -/mice were employed. Activation assays of primary MEF and comparative microarray hybridisation showed that regulation events induced by H. pylori flagellins are predominantly independent of TLR5. These results, which will be discussed further in the context of novel proposed intracellular flagellin sensors (Nod-like receptors), show that cellular signalling induced by Helicobacter flagellins can function independently of TLR5. Lyme borreliosis is a systematic disease caused by the infection with spirochetes of the genus Borrelia burgdorferi that are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick, in Europe mainly Ixodes ricinus. Four human pathogenic B. burgdorferi species are currently recognised in Europe -B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii and B. spielmanii. Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease with predominant involvement of skin, joints and nervous system. Due to the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, the challenge of Lyme borreliosis serodiagnosis is based on the supportive clarification of a clinical suspicion. In accordance with MIQ 12/2000 and DIN 58969-44 July 2005, it is recommended to perform Lyme borreliosis serology in two steps. A sensitive screening assay is followed by a confirmatory test to examine borderline and positive sera. Lyme borreliosis serodiagnosis is characterized by several difficulties due to false negative results in early Lyme borreliosis cases, antibody persistence and cross-reactive antibodies against other microorganisms. The latter has been described for example for Herpes virus infections (particularly EBV) and some bacterial infections, like syphilis. Lyme borreliosis MiQ 12/2000 recommends performing a syphilis screening test (e.g. TPHA) to exclude false positives due to cross reacting antibodies against Treponema pallidum. We developed a line immunoassay based on DIN-and MIQ-relevant Lyme borreliosis antigens plus markers for primary EBV (VCA gp125) and syphilis infections (TpN17). Together with the National Reference Center for Borreliae we evaluated this product called Borrelia Europe LINE plus TpN17. The evaluation comprised sensitivity aspects as well as specificity of the product with special focus on syphilis sera. Sensitivity for serum antibodies against Borrelia was 87.5% for early manifestations (n=16) and 100% for sera of neuroborreliosis patients (n=45). Specificity in healthy blood donors was 97.9% (n=101). Specificity for syphilis sera (n=29) increased significantly from 82.4% to 96.2% due to the implementation of TpN17. For primary EBV sera (n=14) specificity could be improved from 77.8% to 100% using VCA gp125. Both antigens offer a useful improvement and quality insurance of serological diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.",

Molecular analysis using several truncated versions of YopM revealed that the N-terminal \u012e-helices of YopM mediate translocation into the host cell.

Most interestingly, we found that after cell penetration, YopM downregulates the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u012e, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 etc.), while the mRNA level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 is not significantly altered. Analysis of a potential interference of YopM with signal transduction pathways involved in inflammatory responses revealed an inhibitory effect on NF-\u021bB signaling. We found that YopM inhibits phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF-\u021bB \u012e (I\u021bB\u012e) in HeLa cells. Consequently proteasomal degradation of I\u021bB\u012e and phosphorylation of the NF-\u021bB subunit p65 is decreased. Moreover, to investigate potential therapeutic abilities of the anti-inflammatory effector protein, YopM was applied in an in vitro model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). For this, HIMEC (human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells) were preincubated with YopM and subsequently stimulated with poly (I:C). Analysis by qRT-PCR revealed a strong reduction in poly (I:C) induced VCAM-1, IL-1\u0215 and IL-12p35 transcription due to YopM. These findings strongly suggest potential therapeutic applications of YopM in inflammatory conditions.",

Investigations of chemotaxis, both for scientific and diagnostic reasons, are hampered by methodological problems. According to Heit et al. (2003) the most suitable assay for quantitative and qualitative examination of chemotaxis is the under-agarose cell migration assay. However, this assay is frequently associated with a complete lack of or a small amount of migrating cells. As activation of PMN is crucial for their migration, we combined a very effective but gentle PMN isolation method with some modifications to the protocol of Heit et al. Method: A combination of Dextran (2%) sedimentation and subsequent Percoll centrifugation (66 and 76% Percoll gradients) was used for PMN isolation of heparinized blood. Purity of PMN (> 95%) and activation of PMN via determination of CD11b-expression was measured using flow-cytometry. Compared to Heit et al. Percentage of agarose was decreased from 1.6 to 1.0% and cell number was decreased from 1 x 105 to 5 x 104 cells per assay. Counting of migrated cells and measurement of the \"walked\" distance of each cell was done by using the AxioVision Software (Zeiss). Results: This migration assay leads to a reproducible and clear positive result for the fMLP positive control and a clear negative result for the negative control in 100% of the assays conducted (n = 20). Compared to Heit et al. We observed a five-fold increase of migrating cells which provides a sufficient cell number for an adequate statistical analysis.",

This may contribute to an increased knowledge and understanding of this very important function of PMN. Neutrophil granulocytes are the first line of cellular defense against pathogenic microorganisms, playing a crucial role in innate immunity. It is known that Francisella (F.) tularensis (t.), the causative agent of Tularemia, is able to evade killing by human neutrophils. By infection of human granulocytes with F. t. strains of different virulence we aimed to identify processes within the granulocytes which are interfered by infection and to identify those interferences exclusively mediated by virulent strains of F. t.. Human neutrophils were isolated from heparinized venous blood. These neutrophils were infected with five different F. t. strains (including highly and moderate virulent as well as attenuated and avirulent strains) respectively. RNA isolated 30 and 120 minutes post infection was employed for gene expression profiling using Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) according to standard protocols. The microarray data was validated by quantification of several rRNAs from these experiments by qPCR. Cytokine release was measured in culture supernatants using Luminex-based bead array technology. In general, the host-pathogen interaction resulted in modulation of transcriptional maschinery, host immune responses and cell death processes. Differences in neutrophil gene expression induced by distinct strains could also be observed. The most striking difference was the lack of increased levels of IL-6 and TNF mRNA in neutrophils infected with the virulent strains of F. t. tularensis and F. t. holarctica respectively, compared to the increased levels in the lesser or avirulent F. t. strains (0 versus 1.7 to 6.45 fold change). Cytokine levels in cell culture supernatants support the micro array results. The lack of increased levels of IL-6 and TNF suggests that virulent F. t. strains interfere with the inflammatory response of neutrophils, thereby possibly dysregulating processes as chemoattraction of neutrophils, respiratory response and apoptosis.",

Evidence is emerging that these cells are critical components of host defense against pathogens by supporting a variety of intra-and extracellular antimicrobial functions. However, the detailed cellular signalling events mediating this process during an infection are still not completely understood. The transcriptional regulator hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF)-1\u012e has recently been discovered to play a critical role in modulating the bactericidal capacity of phagocytes such as macrophages and neutrophils. We sought to investigate the role of HIF-1\u012e in the antimicrobial activity of MCs, using as models the leading human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Treatment of the human MC line HMC-1 or murine bone-marrow-derived MCs with the HIF-1\u012e agonist AKB-4924, an iron chelator which allows posttranslational stabilization and accumulation of HIF, significantly increased antimicrobial activity of human and murine MCs. Corroborating this observation, treatment of cells with the HIF-antagonist echinomycin was able to abolish this effect. To differentiate whether induction of HIF by AKB-4924 promoted extracellular versus intracellular MC antimicrobial activity, cytochalasin D was used to inhibit MC bacterial phagocytosis. Cytochalasin D did not reduce the HIF-1\u012e-induced antimicrobial activity, indicating that HIF-1\u012e is important in inducing the extracellular antimicrobial activity of this particular cell type. These data shed new light on the role of MCs in host defense against bacterial infections, and provide new therapeutic opportunities to harness the unique characteristics of this cell type to enhance the local innate immune response. CMV viremia and disease is amongst the most deleterious complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation with increased morbidity and mortality. Control of CMV after transplantation is attributed to functionally competent CMV specific T cells. Although CMV specific T cells reconstitute within several weeks after stem cell transplantation, their origin remains so far unclear as de novo T cell generation via the thymus takes place no earlier than six months post transplantation. We studied 40 haematological patients undergoing allogeneic and 7 patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. In addition to routinely performed weekly screening for CMV DNA, we performed a weekly screening of CMV specific CD4 T cells by flow cytometry (IFN-\u0216 cytokine release assay). Compared to patients after autologous transplantation, patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a prolonged time to detection of CMV specific CD4 T cells (2.4 versus 4.0 weeks, p=0.006). In the 40 allogeneic transplanted patients, no influence of CMV serological status, incidence of GvHD, conditioning regimen (myeloablative vesus reduced intensity conditioning) or CMV viremia could be identified (p= n.s. for all comparisons). Phenotyping of CMV specific CD4 T cells before stem cell transplantation indicated that the pool of CMV specific CD4 T cells is comprised of terminally differentiated, CD27 negative lymphocytes (p<0.001, compared to non-CMV specific CD4 T cells). On follow up analysis after stem cell transplantation, the reconstitution of CMV specific CD4 T cells was mainly attributable to an expansion of terminally differentiated CD27 negative lymphocytes. In contrast, the expansion of the remaining non-CMV specific CD4 T cells after stem cell transplantation was dominated by CD27 positive lymphocytes (p<0.001).",

Aims: Natural regulatory T cells are essential for immune homeostasis an infection control. GARP (LRRC32) represents a key receptor of human CD4 + CD25 hi -derived regulatory T (Treg) cells that controls FOXP3 via a positive feedback-loop (Probst-Kepper et al. JCMM 2009 in press ). Since microRNA-dependent regulation has been identified as component of Treg cell function (JEM 2008; 205: 1983 -1991 , 1993 -2004 , and 2005 -2017 EMBO Rep. 2009 ; 10: 180-185), we ask whether miRNA is critically involved in regulation of the GARP-FOXP3 feedback loop. Methods: We analyzed expression of PDZ-mutant and wt GARP ectopically expressed in antigen-specific Th cells together with FOXP3 in comparison to Treg cells. miRNA expression profiles of GARP-reprogrammed Th cells were compared with Th control and Treg cells. Hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated miRNAs was used to identify similarities between miRNA profiles. Differentially expressed miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: Analysis of wt and PDZ-mutant GARP in transduced Th cells revealed higher levels of GARP protein expression of mutant GARP, although both induced similar levels of FOXP3. Hierarchical clustering of significantly regulated miRNAs revealed that the micoRNAome of the GARP transduced Th cells was more similar to Treg cells compared to that of control and parental Th cells. These results established a GARP-FOXP3 dependent miRNAome. Differential expression of selected miRNAs was confirmed by qPCR. Conclusions: Both wt and PDZ-mutant GARP reprogram Th cells towards Treg-like constitutive FOXP3 expression that is associated with induction of a miRNA-signature similar to the miRNAome of Treg cells. Our date reveal new insights into the regulation of the GARP-FOXP3 feedback loop and potential novel miRNA biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of Treg cells for infection control. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has become standard treatment for various haematological cancers. However, the intensive conditioning with chemotherapy and irradiation leads regularly to a long phase of immunosuppression, which can be aggravated by concomitant depletion of potentially alloreactive donor T cells. In those situations, reactivation with Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpes virus family, is a frequent and life-threatening complication. Treatment with antiviral agents is limited and cost extensive because of the induction of drug resistances and partially severe side effects, making new therapeutic approaches highly desirable. The development of reversible MHC-class I multimers (\"streptamers\") allows the direct ex vivo isolation of CMV-specific CD8 T cells from CMV-positive stem cell donors. Donor-derived PBMCs are stained with bead-coated streptamers followed by magnetic cell separation using CliniMACS \u00a9 . Subsequently, the reversible multimer binding can be resolved resulting in a reagent-free CMV-specific T cell product. Those highly enriched cells can be immediately transferred -usually even the same day-into the patient. We describe here our first experiences with the clinical testing of this technology. Most remarkably, even from few transferred cells (approx. 30.000) readily detectable cell populations can be detected after short in vivo proliferation, indicating a high proliferative capacity of directly isolated and minimally manipulated cells. Low dose transfer of streptamer-isolated CD8 T cells might combine the benefit of an induced functional CMV-specific immune response with a minimal risk of potentially fatal GVHD.",

Zuerich, Zuerich, Switzerland Helicobacter pylori is a gram negative bacterium colonizing approx. half of the world's population. Chronic infection with H. pylori is associated with gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. We study the mechanisms that underlie persistent infection vs. vaccine-induced clearance, as well as the mechanisms leading to Helicobacter-induced gastric disease including gastric cancer. By monitoring gastritis and gastric cancer precursor lesions over time in experimentally infected mice we find that (a) preneoplastic changes are the result of immunopathology driven by Th1-polarized CD4 + effector T-cells in wild type and also in adoptively transferred Rag-1 -/and TCRa/b -/mice; (b) the same subset of T-cells is required for clearance of the infection upon vaccination and subsequent challenge and (c) IFN-g production is required for both. Depletion of Treg in the FoxP3-GFP-DTR mouse induces spontaneous clearance, suggesting that Treg facilitate persistent gastric infection. Our data suggest that additional (non-T) regulatory cell types are induced to produce IL-10 upon TLR-2 ligation, which also contributes to persistent infection in vivo. We further find that the age at the time of infection determines Helicobacter colonization levels as well the extent of gastric pathology. Mice that are infected during the neonatal period develop tolerance to the infection, are colonized by several orders of magnitude higher than mice infected as adults, but remain free of preneoplastic pathology. Tolerance is permanent and maintained into adulthood in the sustained presence of the antigen. Intervening antibiotic therapy breaks tolerance, as does depletion of Treg in the FoxP3-GFP-DTR model. We propose that age at infection in conjunction with genetic and environmental factors influencing Th1/Th2 polarization determine gastric cancer risk. Staphylococcus aureus is a prominent human pathogen which can establish persistent infections within the host despite antibiotic treatment. Cystic fibrosis patients are especially affected by staphylococcal persistent infections. The ability of S. aureus to persist in the host is a complex process where the host as well as the bacterium adopt various mechanisms which bring about an \"immune equilibrium\". Defining the factors that contribute to bacterial persistence will help in the identification of alternative therapeutic drug targets that achieve bacterial clearance in affected patients. A substantial drawback in our understanding of these factors is the lack of in vivo models that can recapitulate the different aspects of the persistence process. In this study, we developed a murine model of S. aureus persistent infection where S. aureus strain SH1000 persisted for up to 2 months in the kidneys of C57BL/6 mice after intravenous inoculation. The infection was local rather than systemic as shown by the low serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u012e). Chronically infected mice developed an antigen-specific immune response against S. aureus evident by the proliferative response of splenic T and B cells after antigen-specific stimulation. However, the fact that B-, T-, and NK cellsdeficient Rag2-IL2R\u0216 -/mice developed a persistent infection but allowed higher levels of bacterial replication than wild-type animals indicated that adaptive immune responses partially contributed to the containment of the infection. Histological examination of kidney tissue isolated from chronically infected mice showed that persistent staphylococci may survive these defence mechanisms by residing within abscesses which are not fully-accessible to the immune system. To further understand the role that these abscesses play, microarray analysis of kidney tissue was performed and the gene expression profile analysed. More than 150 million humans in tropical countries are infected by filarial nematodes which harbor intracellular bacterial endosymbionts of the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). As previously shown, depletion of Wolbachia leads to a higher percentage of adult worm death compared to ivermectin, which is primarily microfilaricidal. This study examined the development of Onchocerca volvulus-specific immune responses before and after antiwolbachial treatment in onchocerciasis patients in Ghana, West Africa. We provide evidence that cellular immune responses increase after a 6-weeks treatment course with doxycycline. In detail, levels of IL-5 in whole blood assays after stimulation with Onchocerca volvulus crude extract were elevated after macrofilaricidal therapy compared to microfilaricidal treatment. This was underscored by a higher IL-5/IL-10 ratio as observed locally at the mRNA level in onchocercomas from doxycycline treated patients. Interestingly, patients with doxycycline therapy displayed significantly fewer new onchocercomas after 14 months than those treated with ivermectin. These data are in line with the current hypothesis that macrofilaricidal therapy removes the source of immunosuppressive molecules.",

Medina 1 1 Infektionsimmunologie, Helmholtz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Infektionsforschung, Braunschweig, Germany Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of infection worldwide. Upon invasion, S. aureus is first confronted with the sophisticated innate defense mechanisms of the host. Dendritic cells (DC) are central mediators between the innate and cognate immune system. These cells can have several roles during the early stage of an infection including controlling bacterial replication and producing cytokines and chemokines that activate and recruit additional cells. In this study, we have investigated the relevance of DCs for host defense against S. aureus. The in vitro studies demonstrated that S. aureus induced maturation of bone marrow-derived DCs, as shown by the up-regulation of costimulatory molecules such CD40 and the release of cytokines such IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-\u012e. The active participation of DCs in the innate immune response to S. aureus was demonstrated by the time-dependent recruitment of DCs observed in the spleen of mice after intravenous infection with S. aureus. DCs isolated from the spleen of systemically infected mice harbored viable S. aureus microorganisms indicating a direct interaction between S. aureus and DCs during in vivo infection. The contribution of DCs to host defenses against this pathogen was investigated using CD11c-diphteria toxin receptor (DTR) transgenic mice, in which DCs can be transiently depleted in vivo by treatment with low doses of DT. Ablation of DCs resulted in early mortality and lower capacity to control bacterial growth in the lungs. Furthermore, acute ablation of DCs completely abolished IL-12 production indicating that production of this cytokine during infection is limited to DCs. Further evidence that DCs contribute to host defenses against S. aureus was provided by the improved resistance to infection exhibited by mice after adoptive transfers of in vitromatured DCs. The results presented here contribute to the understanding of the early events of infection and the onset of protection against S. aureus. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis employs a type III secretion system (T3SS) for targeting of several virulence factors (Yersinia outer proteins, Yops) directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. This protein translocation machinery mediates the ability of Yersinia to resist phagocytosis and is required for sustained extracellular bacterial replication. In a recent publication, our laboratory used YopE as a carrier molecule for T3SS-dependent secretion and translocation of listeriolysin O (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. We demonstrated that translocation of chimeric YopE/LLO into the cytosol of macrophages by Y. pseudotuberculosis results in the induction of a codominant antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell response in orally immunized mice. Therefore, we addressed the requirements for processing and MHC class II presentation of chimeric YopE proteins translocated into the cytosol of macrophages by Yersinia\u00b4s T3SS. Our data demonstrate Yersinia`s ability to counteract exogenous MHC class II antigen presentation of secreted hybrid YopE by the action of wild-type YopE and YopH. In the absence of exogenous MHC class II antigen presentation, an alternative pathway was identified for YopE fusion proteins originating in the cytosol. This endogenous antigen processing pathway was sensitive to inhibitors of phagolysosomal acidification and macroautophagy, but it neither required the function of the proteasome nor of the transporter associated with antigen presentation. Thus, by an autophagydependent mechanism, macrophages are able to compensate for the YopE/YopH-mediated inhibition of the endosomal MHC class II antigen presentation pathway for exogenous antigens. This is the first report demonstrating that autophagy might enable the host to mount an MHC class IIrestricted CD4 T cell response against translocated bacterial virulence factors.",

We aimed at studying morphology and functions of immune cells infiltrating TB-infected lung in humans. Cells of the infiltrates in the infected lung were identified in sections using monoclonal antibodies. Mycobacterial load and infiltrating inflammatory cell load to the lung were studied. We show that in patients with tuberculoma, cultivable M. tuberculosis could hardly be detected, while RT-PCR results always showed DNA-presence in the tissue. Macrophage numbers correlated directly, while their phagocytic capacity correlated inversely with M. tuberculosis load to the lung. We show that infiltrating lymphocytes of different phenotypes as well as macrophages and antigen presenting cells place themselves not in a chaotical, but rather organized manner within the granulomatous tissue. They bear markers of activation and differentiation and are capable of proliferation, cytokine production and synthesis of specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies. Patients with high mycobacterial load produce IgG1 instead of IgG2 in their local immune response. Lymphoid follicle-like structures in the lung tissue were associated with the diagnosis of tuberculoma, but not active cavitary tuberculosis, which indicates their active roles. At the same time, the results suggest that mycobacterial infection induces organization of immune cells in morphologically discernable follicle-like structures bearing features of a tertiary lymphoid organ analogous to that found in autoimmunityaffected tissue. We propose that these tertiary lymphoid organs orchestrate the local immune response to mycobacteria in humans and that B cells play an important role in regulating the local containment of mycobacteria.",

Dalpke 1 1 Dept. of Hygiene and Medical Microbiology, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany 2 Dept. of Parasitology, University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that has to cope with the microbicidal actions of IFN\u0216. Previously we reported that parasite-mediated induction of suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) contributes to inhibition of IFN\u0216 signaling. We now show that only virulent type I but not type II strains induce SOCS1 and inhibit nitric oxide production by IFN\u0216. These effects were independent of stimulation of Toll-like receptors as they were not altered in MyD88 or TRIF deficient mice. However, blocking cell invasion by use of Mic8 deficient parasites completely abolished SOCS1 induction and nitric oxide suppression. SOCS1 induction has been reported to be dependent on egr transcription factors and indeed we found that type I but not type II strains induced egr1 and egr2 in a manner dependent on p38 MAP kinase. When we analyzed additional effects of IFN\u0216 in macrophages we surprisingly observed that both type I and II strains inhibited IFN\u0216 mediated secretion of CXCL9 and upregulation of MHC-class II and ICAM1. These effects could be observed in infected as well as uninfected cells and were not affected when using invasion defective Mic8 knockout parasites. To interfere with CXCL9 induction and antigen presentation viable parasites and direct cell contact were necessary. Adding soluble excreted and secreted antigens (ESA) from Toxoplasma gondii reproduced the latter inhibitory effects but did not induce SOCS1. The results prove that Toxoplasma gondii make use of two different modes to escape from IFN\u0216 activity: one mode is strain dependent and relies on active cell invasion and SOCS1 induction, the other one is induced by microneme secretion upon contacting a cell. The pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important inducer of T-cell differentiation towards the TH1 phenotype. Mice lacking IL-12 have a strong defect in cell-mediated immune responses resulting in a high susceptibility to infections with intracellular pathogens including Leishmania major, Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii. In the present work we show that various TLR agonists induce IL-12 expression in bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) to differing extents with high IL-12 induction observed after TLR9 stimulation, intermediate IL-12 induction after TLR4 stimulation and weak IL-12 induction observed after TLR2/6/1 stimulation. In in vivo experiments using the IL-12 dependent model of murine subcutaneous Leishmaniasis treatment of the mice with the TLR2 and TLR4 ligands LPS and LTA showed no significant influence on the course of infection. In contrast, CpG-DNA application in a similar scheme deviated the immune response and resulted in containment of infection as indicated by missing footpad swelling. Using pharmacological inhibitors and different knock-out models the MAP kinase, PI3 kinase and IRF signaling pathways could be ruled out to be the cause for the differences in TLR induced IL-12p40 expression in BMDC. Stimulation of BMDC using different TLR ligands resulted in striking differences in kinetics of NF\u021bB activation. LPS induced a rapid but short-lived activation of Rel-A whereas CpG stimulation resulted in prolonged Rel-A activity at the IL-12p40 promoter. Evidence will be given that differences in activation of NF\u021bB are involved in the differential IL-12p40 induction after stimulation with the various TLR agonists.",

In spite of all progress in antimycotic therapy cerebral aspergillosis is still associated with a lethality of nearby 100%. The incapacity of the cerebral immune system to limit fungal replication indicates that Aspergillus dispose of efficient mechanisms to escape from the immune attack. Since complement is a central player of the cerebral immunity we aimed to elucidate the fungal complement evasion mechanisms and to develop strategies for undermining these processes. When growing in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathogenic species of Aspergillus were shown to interfere with an antifungal complement attack by secretion of proteases that degrade various complement proteins. Soluble proteins of all three complement activation pathways were eliminated; furthermore complement receptor CR3 on the surface of immune cells were affected. Consequences of fungal protease secretion included a strong reduction of any new opsonization of fungal hyphae as well as the removal of already deposited complement factor C3. Furthermore the phagocytosis of Aspergillus conidia by microglia was less efficiently after secretion of the fungal protease. In the future, inhibition or suppression of these proteases may hopefully act as a supportive therapeutic measure. For that reason diverse nutrient supplements were tested for their ability to prevent the secretion of fungal proteases. Distinct carbohydrates, phosphate and iron compounds showed no effect, but various inorganic and organic nitrogen sources can down-regulate the proteolytic activity. Amino acids were of particular interest as putative therapeutics since they represent endogenous substances in the CNS. They turned out to be very effective; the number of the nitrogen atoms within the molecules seems to be crucial for the relevant concentration. Glutamine and arginine fulfil various functions in the brain; they act in comparatively low concentrations and appear therefore as the most promising candidates for a therapy.",

            "text": "A G protein-coupled receptor senses bacterial peptide toxins and directs neutrophils towards higly pathogenic Virulence of the emerging Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) and other highly pathogenic S. aureus depends on the recently discovered Phenol-Soluble Modulin (PSM) peptide toxins, which combine the capacities to attract and lyse neutrophils. The molecular basis of PSM-stimulated neutrophil recruitment has remained unknown. We demonstrate that a human G protein-coupled receptor, whose function has previously remained elusive, senses PSMs at nanomolar concentrations and initiates the exuberant proinflammatory neutrophil responses to CA-MRSA. Specific blocking of this receptor or deletion of PSM genes in CA-MRSA led to severely diminished capacities of neutrophils to detect CA-MRSA. Thus, the innate immune system uses a previously unrecognized mechanism to sense highly virulent bacterial pathogens. This G protein-coupled receptor represents an attractive target for new anti-infective or anti-inflammatory strategies. The acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) hydrolyses sphingomyelin, a major lipid component of the non-cytoplasmic membrane leaflet of endosomes, phagosomes and lysosomes, which are essential sites of antimicrobial activity of macrophages. In contrast to wild type (wt) macrophages, macrophages of ASMase -/mice cannot inactivate phagocytosed Listeria monocytogenes (L.m.) despite normal activity of oxidative bactericidal effector mechanisms. Thus, we analysed the role of the ASMase in non-oxidative bactericidal effector mechanisms of macrophages. In ASMase -/macrophages, phagosomes containing L.m. remained positive for the late phagosomal markers M6PR and Rab7 but acquired significantly less of the lysosomal marker Lamp1. This was paralleled by significantly reduced transfer of fluid phase markers and bactericidal cathepsins D, B and L from lysosomes into phagosomes containing L.m. in ASMase -/macrophages. As a consequence, L.m. were not rapidly inactivated in ASMase -/macrophages, escaped from phagosomes, recruited actin and massively proliferated in the cytosol. We next asked whether L.m. are secondarily sequestered by autophagy in ASMase -/macrophages. Infection of ASMase -/and wt macrophages with L.m. induced a similar shift from inactive LC3I to active LC3II indicating a similar induction of autophagy. Additionally, about 30 % of intracellular L.m. colocalised with LC3 in both ASMase -/and wt macrophages by 30 min p.i. However, the percentage of L.m. colocalising with LC3 significantly dropped in ASMase -/macrophages by 60 min p.i. indicating that L.m. escape from autophagosomes in ASMase -/but not wt macrophages. L.m. double-positive for LC3 and Lamp1 were significantly less frequent in ASMase -/than in wt macrophages indicating impaired maturation of autophagosomes into autolysosomes. In conclusion, the ASMase contributes to the antimicrobial activity of macrophages by facilitating the fusion of phagosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes. Introduction: Intestinal Graft-versus-host-disease (iGvHD) is a major cause for morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Acute inflammatory responses and tissue destruction in the colon are aggravated by gut bacterial sensing via toll-like-receptors (TLR), but the underlying mechanisms are yet poorly understood. Methods: Prior to transplantation (day 0), C57BL/6-wildtype (wt) and isogenic TLR9-deficient mice received Treosulfan 2000mg/kg on day -3 to -1 and Cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg on day-1. Mice were transplanted with 5x10 6 bone marrow cells and 3x10 6 splenocytes of Balb/c-origin. To specifically inhibit TLR9 activation, mice were injected with 200 \u03bcg/mouse of the inhibitory oligonucleotide (iODN) 2088 i.p. on day +2. GvHD-Scores and intestinal immune cell populations were assessed according to a macroscopic score and by histopathological investigation of colon sections, respectively. Results: The investigation of iGvHD revealed that transplantation of C57Bl/6 Wild-type (wt) mice with stem cells from Balb/c mice resulted in severe iGvHD as indicated by apoptosis, tissue damage and inflammation in the colon. In contrast, iGvHD was significantly ameliorated in TLR9 -/and MyD88 -/mice. In these mice the numbers of T-cells, neutrophils and apoptotic cells in the colon were significantly reduced as compared to wt mice. In addition TLR9 -/mice showed improved survival. Most importantly, intestinal apoptosis and inflammatory responses were effectively suppressed by treatment of wt mice with the TLR9 antagonist iODN2088 i.p.. Conclusion: In summary, these results underline the pivotal role of TLR9 sensing in iGvHD and may offer options for molecular treatment or prevention strategies for this devastating disease. The formation of extracellular traps (ETs) by phagocytic cells has been recently recognized as a novel and important mechanism of the host immune response against infections. These structures consist of a nuclear DNA backbone associated with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that entrap and kill various microbes. The aim of our study is to determine whether augmentation of phagocyte ETs may serve as a novel therapeutic approach against bacterial infections.Recently we were able to demonstrate that statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, efficiently induce the formation of ETs in different phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages in vitro. Statin-treated phagocytes showed enhanced killing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, as well as Salmonella typhimurium. Cytochalasin D treatment to inhibit phagocytosis did not inhibit bacterial killing by statin-treated cells, indicating an extracellular site of action. To determine if statin-treatment is able to enhance the production of ETs in vivo, we investigated the effect of statin therapy on bacterial clearance using a mouse model of S. aureus-induced pneumonia. Mice were fed standard chow or standard chow supplemented with simvastatin and challenged intranasally with a sub-lethal dose of S. aureus strain Newman. In agreement with the in vitro data, significantly more AMP-containing ETs were found in the airways and alveolar space of S. aureus-infected mice treated with simvastatin compared to the control group. Furthermore, simvastatin-treated mice exhibited significantly reduced bacterial load and histological organ damage in lung tissue compared to control mice 48 h after infection. These data raise the exciting possibility that stimulation of ETs can be used as novel therapeutic approach to enhance bacterial clearance of invading pathogens.",

The observation that thrombospondin-1-(TSP-1)deficient mice suffered from extensive acute and organizing pneumonia, prompted us to study whether TSP-1 might be involved in host defence. Methods: The effect of TSP-1-peptides and scrambeled control peptides on S. aureus and Candida albicans growth and cell wall permeability was tested by quantitative culture and enumeration of colony forming units, by flow cytometry and by electron microscopy on freeze-fracture replicas. Results: Exposure of an eight aminoacid peptide (8AS-TSP-1-peptide) from the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1 yielded in significant reductions in the viability of both microorganisms, while a control peptide with glycin instead of valine had no effect. Freeze fracture replicas revealed pore formation by the 8AS-TSP-1-peptide. Flow cytometric analysis showed that 8AS-TSP-1-peptide treatment promoted the accumulation of the membrane-impermeable nucleic acid stain propidium iodide (PI), indicating the loss of membrane potential and permeability. Conclusions: The 8AS-TSP-1-peptide showed antimicrobial activity in different test systems against both microorganisms, S. aureus and C. albicans, while the control peptide did not.

Patients & Methods: 38 outpatients with MRSA colonization (at least 4 weeks) of a leg ulcer were included in the survey and retrospective data analysis. Therapy of the leg ulcer was carried out with silver-containing wound dressings. All patients were recommended to apply antiseptic eradication measures in accordance with the recommendations for in-patient treatment. Since reimbursement of the costs of the antiseptics by the health insurance funds is impossible in Germany, implementation of the recommendation was left to the patients. MRSA was considered to be persistent, if it was detectable after at least one month of recommended eradication therapy. Results: In 16 patients the MRSA could be successfully eradicated (MRSA-E), in 22 it could not (MRSA-P). Results showed a significant benefit of antiseptic body washes during the decontamination (MRSA-E 62.5%, MRSA-P 22.8%; p=0.013) and a disadvantage of regular contact with pets (MRSA-E 8.3%, MRSA-P 61.6%, p=0.043). A tendency to longer persistence of the ulcer (78.06 vs. 89.77 months, p=0.051) and MRSA colonization of other areas of the body (50% vs. 90%, p=0.051) as possible risk factors was seen. Conclusion: The study indicates the importance of antiseptic measures extending beyond the wound in the eradication of MRSA in outpatients. Further placebo-controlled studies with larger study populations are necessary.",

Since results of antibiotic testing may be available only after 24-48 h, the clinician's decision depends on data generated from the permanent survey of the antibiotic susceptibility of a local setting. We analysed the dynamic of E. coli resistance since 1996 in respect to different clinical settings, patient's age and sex and infection sites. Methods: Out of 7.2 million records 500.000 were selected representing the anaesthetic (A) and medical (I) intensive care units, 2 neurological (N), 2 urological wards (U), 4 paediatric (P) and 2 geriatric (G) departments. Copy strains were not excluded. Results: The number of isolated E. coli strains per year grew in the anaesthetic ICU from n = 75 (2002) to n = 305 (2008) but showed no trend in other settings (I: ~ 80/a, P: ~60/a). Ciprofloxacin (Cip) resistance rate (RR) raised from less than 10% in 1997 to almost 50% in 2008 in A, 5% to 29% in I, 7% to 55% in U, but was less dynamic in P (< 10%), N (< 22%) and G (<38%). Ampicillin (Amp)-RR (2008) was highest in A (82%), followed by U (78%), G (75%), I (63%), P (57%) and N (55%). BLI improved the Amp-RR in 2008 as follows: A: 72%, U: 53%, G: 53%, I: 54%, P and N: 38%. Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Pip-Taz) was more sensitive compared to Amp in 2008 (RR: A: 52%, I: 24%, U: 23%, G: 32%, N: 17%, P: 12%, but showed an increase over the past 12 years (baseline A: 15%, I: 6%, U: 5%) as did RR for Ceftriaxon, Ceftazidime, Cefepime and Cotrim, but not RR for Amp, Carbapenems, Doxycyclin and Aminoglycosides. E. coli was more frequently isolated from men in A and U, from women in G and I. RR for Cip and Pip-Taz were higher in E. coli from men in U, G and N. (delta 5 to 15%). Cip-RR were lower in samples from peripher sites (sputum: A: 12%) vs. Blood culture (A: 24%). Conclusion: Monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility is essential to guide locally adapted calculated chemotherapy. We present a case report of a patient with a probably simultaneous acquired Hepatitis B, HIV and lues infection. Under HAART therapy, the HIV1 viral load significantly was reduced. Laboratory studies in this situation showed atypical kinetics of HBV specific parameters. The HBs-Ag was detectable all the time, the HBV viral load at the the first testing was low (408 IU/ml). In further samples all other HBV-specific parameters including PCR were negative. Conclusion: The RT-inhibitors of HAART also supress the HBV replication. Under HAART, the anti-HBc can be false negative. If a HIVpatient under HAART requires HBV diagnostics, not only anti-HBc, but also HBs-Ag should be included. Prion diseases as the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD are characterized by a neuronal accumulation of a pathological protein (PrPSc ) which is believed to be the infectious agent. During pathogenesis the host encoded cellular prion protein (PrPC) is converted into PrPSc which is remarkable resistant to standard inactivation procedures. Efficient decontamination requires harsh conditions, but many medical devices will be damaged under these conditions. In the prevention of disease transmissions there is great demand for product friendly decontamination procedures relating to medical instruments as well product and food safety. Preserving methods have been described, mostly combined of pre-denaturation and proteolysis. In this study we pursued these techniques and report on a PrPSc decontamination method consisting of enzymatic treatment with commercially available and purified proteases. We systematically followed proteolyses, and the degradation efficiency was appraised on immunoblots and ELISAs with applications of sensitive precipitation techniques. Unlike other studies we evaluated the application of the PrPSc degradation method with different prion proteins, because isolates and strains derived from different species may considerably vary in stability and resistance. Our results emphasize that a combination predenaturation followed by serial enzymatic treatment is a promising tool for prion decontamination.",

These proteinaceous agents, known as PrPSc, cause transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) such as the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and ist variant form (vCJD) in humans. PrPSc which derive from the host encoded cellular prion (PrPC) are notably resistant to standard decontamination procedures and remain infectious. The risk of iatrogenic transmission is emphasized by actuality of PrPSc detection in skeletal muscles of CJD patients and the presence in blood during preclinical phases of vCJD incubation. Thus, removal of all proteinaceous materials from surgical devices is of great importance for effective reprocessing. This elimination can however be severely hampered if e.g. the contaminant is allowed to dry onto the instrument surface. In this study we analysed two different effects, firstly the protein binding on hollow needle surfaces contaminated with brain tissue suspensions by means of drying time and temperature and secondly the protein removal in absence and presence of detergents. Effaced PrPC as indicator proteins were detected by a novel highly sensitive immuno-PCR assay which achieved a sensitivity enhancement of at least two orders of magnitude compared with ELISA procedures carried out under identical conditions.

In order to determine the microbial barrier properties we developed an exposure chamber method with periodic atmospheric pressure changes by 0-70 hPa and with an exposure to airborne microorganisms (Micrococcus luteus). The barrier property is specified as a logarithmic reduction value, LRV. For the calculation of the microbiological challenge from transport and packaging a computer program was developed (www.microbial-evaluation-of-sterile-barrier-systems.com).

The logarithmic reduction value (LRV) of the sterile barrier system was compared with the LRV required for the microbial challenges from transport and storage.

Assuming that the containers cool down from 60 to 20\u00baC once, that the atmospheric pressure changes periodically by 15 hPa 20 times due to weather and that they are stored at a constant temperature, a volume of air entering the container of 6669 cm 3 is the result. Considering the probability of 1:1000000 for the acceptable risk of insterility a LRV required of 5,83 is the result. Only 2 containers had an experimentally confirmed LRV of > 5.

In Germany C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 has been described only in the south-west. Methods: C. difficile was cultured from stool samples of hospitalized patients using selective media. C. difficile isolates were tested for the presence of tcdB by PCR. Susceptibility testing for erythromycin and moxifloxacin was used to screen for ribotype 027 and all isolates resistant to erythromycin or moxifloxacin were further characterized. A duplex PCR for cdtA and cdtB was performed. Isolates with positive results were typed by PCR ribotyping according to Stubbs et al. If results suggested ribotype 027 we performed slpA and tcdC sequencing to confirm the results. Results: Of 130 tcdB positive C. difficile isolates resistant to erythromycin and moxifloxacin collected between April and December 2008 we could demonstrate the genes for the binary toxins cdtA and cdtB in 47 (36.2%) isolates. PCR ribotyping gave the same banding patterns as in a ribotype 027 reference strain in 9 isolates. All those isolates showed slpA sequences typical of ribotype 027 and deletions at position 117 and 330 to 347 of the tcdC gene. Three cases of C. difficile ribotype 027 occured in the same hospital ward. The remaining cases were found in different hospitals. The mean age of cases was 68.6 years (range 12 to 90). Conclusion: For the first time cases of C. difficile ribotype 027 could be demonstrated in our area. All isolates carried the genes for the binary toxins cdtA and cdtB and deletions in the gene for the negative regulator of toxin production tcdC. Exoproteomes of bacterial pathogens represent a key reservoir of virulence factors. Genome sequencing has shown that different isolates of particular species, including the dangerous human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, display significant variations in the gene repertoire for potentially secreted virulence factors. Notably, such comparative genome analyses have, so far, overlooked any possible differences in the actual biogenesis of virulence factors.",

Methods: Strains were isolated from various types of patient specimens and different clinical departments over a one-year period. They were identified as S. lugdunensis by the VITEK2 during routine laboratory diagnostic. Phenotypic profiles were also determined by a panel of selected tests, e.g. including enzymatic reactions and antibiotic resistance. Isolates were also screened for the presence of the tannase-gene (tanA). For estimation of the genotypic diversity PFGE after SmaI-digestion of the chromosomal DNA was performed. Results: Out of 43 isolates identified as S. lugdunensis by VITEK2, 8 isolates belonged to other CoNS species by using the reference centres panel of selected characters. This panel also revealed various genotypic patterns for the 35 S. lugdunensis-isolates. The 8 CoNS, other than S. lugdunensis, were negative for tanA. However, tanA was detected in 94% of the S. lugdunensis isolates. Sma I PFGE revealed six pulsotypes, with one predominant pulsotype. Conclusions: A phenotypic diversity between S.lugdunensis isolates was found. Automated identification systems are often incorrect, so complementary laboratory tests are needed. The tanA-gene as a marker for S. lugdunensis requires further investigations. PFGE showed a low degree of genomic diversity for S. lugdunensis. This may indicate that PFGE is not reliable for epidemiological investigations concerning this species. Furthermore the comparably relatedness of the patterns suggests a rather clonal structure of S. lugdunensis. This study describes the evaluation of two commercial real -time PCR assays, Duplica Legionella pneumophila and Duplica Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Euroclone, distributed by Virotech GmbH, Germany) which allows the detection of both respiratory pathogens as well as PCR inhibitors in respiratory samples by using the SMART cycler apparatus. These results were compared to two in-house TaqMan PCRs (Dumke et al J. Clin. Microbiol.2007: 41, 4448-4452) . The sensitivities of these assays were 10 genomic equivalents (g.e.) for M. pneumoniae and 20 g.e. for L. pneumophila. A cohort of 44 clinical samples from patients with documented respiratory infections was analyzed, including 13 samples from patients with M. pneumoniae infection, 15 samples from patients with Legionella species infection, and 16 samples from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. All the positive specimens were correctly detected and identified by the respective Duplica kits, and no false-positive result was observed with the negative samples as documented with the inhouse assays and the standard microbiological methods. One sample positive for Legionella bozemanii was correctly identified as negative for the L. pneumophila Euroclone PCR. Our results demonstrate that the Euroclone assays are sensitive, specific, and convenient for the rapid detection and identification of M. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila in clinical samples from patients with respiratory infections.",

Meyer *1 1 Institute of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine, Charit\u00e9 University Medicine, Berlin, Germany Objectives: To look for an association with season or temperature and incidence densities of pathogens in intensive care units (ICU) participating in SARI (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Use and Antimicrobial Resistance in Intensive Care Units). Methods: We conducted a prospective unit based surveillance in 49 German ICUs from July 2000 to June 2008. Incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for seasons (winter: January-March, spring: April-June, summer: July-September and autumn: October-December). Additionally time-series analyses with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and dynamic regressor was used to estimate the association of the incidence densities of pathogens with seasons and temperature. Results: 49 ITS reported data on 1,292,600 patient days (pd) and 118, 490 pathogens (63, . Incidence densities i.e. the number of pathogens per 1000 pd of Gram-negative pathogens showed a significant seasonal variation. Incidence densities for P.aeruginosa (PAE), E. coli (ECO) and A.baumannii (ACI) were significantly higher in autumn than in winter. E.g. the incidence density of ACI was 46% higher in summer than in winter. The incidence densities of PAE, ECO, ACI and KPN followed the changes in temperature one or two months before. Conclusion: Significant higher incidence densities of Gram-negative pathogens were observed during summer and autumn. These findings may have implications for infection control and the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy. We describe a case of hyperinfection syndrome in an HIV-infected patient, the therapy concept and also review the relevant literature. Strongyloides stercoralis is an intestinal nematode that causes human infections with a specific life cycle. Among intestinal nematodes S. stercoralis is unique in its ability to complete its life cycle inside the host through an asexual autoinfective cycle. S. stercoralis infections may be asymptomatic for years, owing to a low parasite load. Diagnostic methods are microscopical examination of bronchial alveolar lavage and stool. Ivermectin is a new antihelminthic drug, which seems to be promising in the treatment of S. stercoralis. Nevertheless, more research and evaluation is necessary. In immunocompromised hosts, the autoinfective cycle can result in a potentially fatal hyperinfection syndrome. Malta has one of the highest incidences of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Europe. However, there is only limited typing data available. In order to analyse the local situation, forty-five isolates from the Mater Die Hospital in Msida, Malta, were characterised using diagnostic microarrays. The most common strain was ST22-MRSA-IV, also known as UK-EMRSA-15 (30 isolates). Sporadic strains included ST36/39-MRSA-II (UK-EMRSA-16, two isolates), PVL-positive ST80-MRSA-IV (European Clone, one isolate), ST228-MRSA-I (Italian Clone/South German Epidemic Strain, one isolate) and ST239-MRSA-III (Vienna/Hungarian/Brazilian Epidemic Strain, one isolate). Ten isolates belonged to a novel clonal complex 5, spa-type t002 strain. This strain carries genes from a SCCmec IV element (mecA, delta mecR, ugpQ, dcs, ccrA2 and ccrB2) as well as novel alleles of ccrA/B and a fusidic acid resistance element Q6GD50 (BX571857.1:SAS0043). It also harboured the gene for enterotoxin A (sea) and the egc enterotoxin locus, as well as (in nine out of ten isolates) genes encoding the toxic shock syndrome toxin (tst1) and enterotoxins C and L (sec, sel). While the presence of the other MRSA strains suggests foreign importation because of intense travel activities between Malta and various European countries, this strain appears to be restricted to Malta yet.",

            "text": "The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) maintains the homeostasis of the CNS and is a critical line of defense against pathogens that potentially inflict damage on the host. Encephalopathies leading to neurological disorders can be associated with the respiratory tract infection whooping cough caused by Bordetella pertussis. The decisive virulence factor of B. pertussis, Pertussis Toxin (PT), exclusively disrupts the integrity of the BBB and, therefore, might play a role in the onset of secondary complications. To analyze whether the PT-induced transient disruption of barrier integrity of endothelial cells enhances the translocation of bacteria, we have used human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) in an in vitro two-compartment tissue culture model. In this surrogate model for the BBB the permeability for Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) substantially increased while the transendothelial resistance (TER) decreased upon incubation with PT. Treatment with PT greatly enhanced the traversal of the meningitis-causing pathogens Escherichia coli K1 (O1:K1), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae across the HBMEC barrier. Adhesion assays demonstrated an enhanced attachment of the bacteria to PTtreated HBMEC. The investigation of the responsible adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface showed an increased concentration of these proteins in immunofluorescence studies and Western blots upon incubation with PT. Invasion and translocation assays demonstrated the survival of E. coli K1 in monocytes and macrophages and translocation of bacteria-containing macrophages that was enhanced by PT. These findings are in favour of the \"Trojan horse\" mechanism as a possible additional route also for the translocation in vivo. Thus, E. coli K1 avoid host defense mechanisms and proliferate in the blood or in the tissue to maintain a high level of bacteremia. Therefore, this study points to a possible additional effect of PT in enhancing cerebral infections. Recently Matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was introduced as a new method for bacterial identification. This method is straightforward, faster and cheaper compared to many other methods. Nevertheless, only little data was published yet concerning clinical important strains of S. aureus. The aim of this study was to evaluate this new identification method and compare it to the molecular reference method. The species identifications of 239 consecutively collected clinical non-copy isolates of methicillin-susceptible and 240 methicillin-resistant S. aureus were examined with MALDI-TOF-MS. Flexcontrol 3.0 and Biotyper software 2.0 and database (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) were used to calculate and process the analytical data. Methicillin susceptible S. aureus strains were characterized using SA442 / mecA PCR. OrfX PCR (Hagen et al.) confirmed species diagnosis in methicillin-resistant isolates. Doubtful or negative results in OrfX PCR were confirmed with SA442 / mecA PCR. The diagnostic specificity of MALDI-TOF MS was high, all strains were identified as S. aureus, regardless of their mecA status. An average score value of 2.32 (SD 0.072) was achieved for the isolates. According to manufacturer's instructions, this indicates a good species identification. Bacterial differentiation of staphylococci using MALDI-TOF MS technology is highly specific and indicates that S. aureus identification using MALDI-TOF MS is an excellent alternative to the more expensive and time consuming molecular biological gold-standard (SA442 PCR). Furthermore time to identification is dramatically reduced compared to biochemical identification. Risk of Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) of preterm infants can be reduced by probiotic feeding. However, the protective mechanisms presumably associated with changes in the gut flora are still unknown. In the present prospective randomized cross-over study we analyzed bacterial genomes of preterm infants in stool samples for the initial 6 weeks. Probiotic supplementation (Infloran: Lactobacillus acidophilum and Bifidobacterium infantis) was given daily for a total of three weeks (group 1: week 1 to 3; group 2: week 4 to 6). 21 preterm infants (gestational age <32 weeks) with very low birth-weight (<1500g) were included and clinical data were monitored as e.g. antibiotic treatment, feeding volume, weight gain and complications. Fortunately, no case of NEC was found in any study patient. Bacterial population in stool samples were analyzed in 10 patients (5 of each group) by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) following universal 16S PCR using a modified forward primer (GC-clamp). In total >300 samples were analyzed. Thereby, we were able to detect changes of the dominant bacterial populations for each patient. Bacterial typing was performed by sequence analysis of the specific bands. As expected, bacterial DNA could not be amplified in the initial stool samples, with few exceptions. In the following weeks an individual pattern of various bacterial populations evolved, however with intermittent changes. Although specific bands for Lactobacillus acidophilum and Bifidobacterium infantis were rarely detected, we found significant changes of bacterial populations in stool samples with or without probiotic supplementation. This observation may indicate that the protective effect of probiotic supplementation can be associated with indirect effects on the gut flora composition.",

The formyl group can be subsequently split off by deformylase (Def), which is an essential bacterial protein. Inhibition of Def by antibiotics such as actinonin or related antibiotics is regarded as an attractive new approach for antimicrobial therapy of Staphylococcus aureus and other bacterial pathogens. Of note, bacterial formylated peptides (FPs) represent pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) for the human innate immune system. Neutrophils sense FPs by the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) and respond by chemotactic migration and mediator release. It has remained unclear whether treatment of S. aureus with actinonin affects the release of FPs. Our study demonstrates that subinhibitory concentrations of actinonin lead to a considerable increase in the proinflammatory capacity of S. aureus. Human PMN responded with higher levels of IL-8 release, chemotactic migration, and intracellular calcium ion fluxes to supernatants of actinonin-treated S. aureus cultures compared to non-treated cultures. Using a FPR-transfected cell line and a Fmt-deficient S. aureus mutant we confirm that the increased leukocyte response to actinonin-treated S. aureus depends on FPR-mediated sensing of FPs. These data underscore the role of FPs as important PAMPs and indicate that inhibition of basic bacterial processes by antibiotics can have critical side effects on innate immunity and inflammation.",

Pathogenesis is determined by both bacterial virulence factors and innate cellular immunity factors. We developed an SA-whole blood (WB) adhesion and phagocytosis assay based upon coincubation of viable SA cells constitutively expressing green fluorescent protein (SA/GFP) with heparin anticoagulated WB. Performance of this in vitro test proved to be straightforward, and to closely mimic the physiologic situation of bacterial phagocytosis in the presence of natural opsonins (i.e., antibodies and complement). In order to distinguish between adherence and internalization, following WB-SA/GFP co-incubation (60', 37\u00baC, shaking) lysostaphin digestion was applied (20 \u03bcg/ml, 30'). Quantitative analysis of SA adhesion to various white blood cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Based on cell morphology, we discriminated between SA/GFP adhesion and internalizations to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), monocytes (Mo), and lymphocytes (LC), respectively. Additional distinction between B-and T-cell subsets was achieved by using specific antibodies (CD4-PerCP, CD8-PerCP, and CD19-PerCP). As expected, the highest adhesion and internalization rates were obtained for professional phagocytic cells (adhesion to PMN: 95-100%, internalization by PMN: 75-90%; adhesion to Mo: 40-75%, internalization by Mo: 30-55%). Interestingly, adhesion and uptake was also observed for certain LC B-cell subsets (CD19+, internalization: 15%) but not for CD4 + or CD8 + T-cells. Upon comparison of different GFP+ clinical and laboratory SA isolates, strains with elevated (LS1, RN4220) and reduced (Newman, M\u00f6ckli) adherence/internalization capacity could be identified. These results were donor independent as demonstrated by using WB from 20 different healthy volunteers.",

Application of this test using WB as well as SA isolates from patients with various conditions such as acute or chronic SA disease is currently ongoing. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most abundant causes of infections of bone as well as of prosthetic implants such as total knee arthroplasty (TKE) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). These infections result in protracted ailment as well as in the need to amputate the affected limb or to remove the implant. In order to determine if any S. aureus strain was able to cause bone infections, or if a specialised clonal complex or a certain combination of virulence or adhesion factors was associated to these conditions, 91 isolates from patients with bone infections were characterised using microarrays detecting ca. 180 genes. Genotyping data were compared to a previously characterised sample population from healthy carriers (EJCMID 2009). Isolates belonged to 18 different clonal complexes (CC) with CC45 (19%) CC8 (16%) and CC30 (13%) being dominant. CC8 and CC30 were also common in healthy controls. CC45 was overrepresented in bone compared to carriage isolates (9%). In contrast, CC15 (which is common among healthy carriers, 17%) was rare among patient isolates (4%). No clear differences between carriage and patient isolates were found with regard to MSCRAMMs, capsule types or superantigenic toxins. For instance, the gene encoding toxic shock syndrome toxin was found in 13% of patients and 15% of controls. Capsule type 5 was noted in 35% of both, patient and carriage isolates. In contrast, staphylokinase was found in 92% of patient isolates but only in 68% of controls (OR=5.7). PVL was detected in 4% of patient isolates but only in 0.7% of carriers (OR=7.1). Data show that there was no specialised \"bone clone\", essentially all S. aureus can cause bone infections. However, CC15 appeared to be less invasive, while CC45 was overrepresented in bone infections. The underlying reasons still need to be clarified.",

The matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionisation time-of-flight mass spectometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has shown to be a rapid method for bacterial identification. In this study direct identification of the BacT/ALERT (Biomerieux, France) blood culture system by MALDI-TOF MS was evaluated for 296 clinical isolates. Isolates grown overnight on agar media and identified by Vitek-2 (Biomerieux, France) served as the standard. Overall, 296 culture positive samples were included. 57 samples showed a biotyper-score between 1.5 to 2.0 and 33 samples had a score of above 2. 206 samples were nontypeable due to low scores (70% of all isolates). In 80/90 typeable samples the identification by MALDI-TOF was the same as the standard; in 9 blood culture samples MALDI-TOF identification was correct but missed a coinfection with an additional bacterial species (9%). In one sample an E.coli was predicted by MALDI-TOF but S. aureus was cultured. In 36 of 90 MALDI-results (40%) the rapid identification was relevant for therapeutic recommendations. The rapid identification of bacteria in the MALDI-TOF MS using BacT/ALERT system was succesfull in only 30% of all samples but resulted in initiation or modification of therapy in 40% of identified bacteria. Despite the high rate of nontypeable samples, the MALDI-TOF MS seems to be applicable in BacT/ALERT blood culture system for scores above 1.5 with a specificity of 88%. These data indicate that for the BacT/ALERT system direct identification by MALDI-TOF MS should only be used in addition to cultural methods but can sometimes expedite therapeutic recommendations.",

Should amplification techniques be applied, the amplified DNA fragments of already successfully destroyed organisms may be of misleading clinical relevance. As the precision and utility of FISH technology utilizing DNA-Beacons in identifying pathogens directly from positive blood cultures has been established and does not require an enzymatic reaction, it was intriguing to apply DNA-beacons in the identification of bacterial pathogens directly from stool samples. We report the successful design and application of DNA-beacons for the prompt identification of bacteria causing enteritis. A novel approach to the design of beacons was made enabling the controlled opening and closing of hair-pin loops. It was found that target sequences could be from 18-to 26-mers, allowing the venture into AT-rich regions of the rRNA and the finding of novel specific sequences. Beacons were designed to detect E. coli, EHEC, shigella, thermophilic campylobacter, salmonella, Yersinia enterocolytica, and Clostridium difficile. Novel sequences were found providing the required specificity with one exception. While the E. coli sequence was specific for E. coli, the shigella sequence detected E. coli in addition. As the assay utilizes all beacons simultaneously on the same slide, it is easy to distinguish between double positive shigella and single positive E. coli specimens. The new beacon design also enabled the generation of an EHEC-specific probe directed at a sequence in the 23S rRNA. The procedural simplicity of the assay allowed the routine screening of all relevant stool samples for the presence or absence of the respective organisms. After a brief centrifugation of suspended stool samples to remove the bulk of the debris the assay was completed in 30 min. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was >95% respectively.",

Petersen 1 1 Microbiology, MVZ Labor Dr. Fenner und Kollegen, Hamburg, Germany Gold standard in the diagnosis of C. difficile is detection of toxigenic C. difficile in culture (besides cytotoxicity testing). However culturing C. difficile and toxin testing from culture is time consuming. Considering that 30 % of toxin testing of stool specimens is false negative this is not a reliable criteria with it being the only test for diagnosing toxigenic C. difficile. Supporting the negative predictive value the detection of the antigen glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of C. difficile is a reliable tool. Detecting toxin genes of C. difficile from stool specimens using PCR is not etablished yet but allows a fast result to establish an appropriate therapy. Method:194 stool samples were tested for C. difficile toxin A/B ELISA and C.diff-specific enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH).Culture was performed on C. difficile-Agar and the tcdB gene of C. difficile was detected using PCR.The PCR method was adapted as realtime PCR on a LightCycler. Results:All samples with positive C. difficile toxin A/B from stool and toxigenic C. difficile culture yielded positive PCR results (n=30).All 32 samples with negative results in toxin and antigen tests in stool and no growth in culture showed negative PCR results.95 samples with negative C. difficile toxin A/B and positive C. difficile antigen (GDH) from stool specimens and toxigenic C. difficile in culture showed positive PCR results, 4 samples with this result combination were PCR negative). One sample showing negative results in toxin and antigen tests in the stool, no growth in culture but a positive PCR result.Another sample showed negative results in toxin and antigen tests in the stool,a toxigenic C. difficile culture and a positive PCR result. Conclusion: Results obtained using PCR for tcdB gene of C. difficile show almost exact same results as established methods detecting toxigenic C. difficile and are available within two and a half hours sample preparation included. PCR can replace reliably time consuming methods and the high detection limit verifies toxigenic C. difficile with clinical significance.

Publications in the last few years suggested that serum measurement of BG could be a promising new tool for the diagnosis of PCP. Unfortunately, most of these publications were either case reports or had only a very limited number of patients examined. For that reason, we performed a retrospective study on 50 patients which were diagnosed with PCP in the last 5 years by clinical presentation, immunofluorescence, Giemsa staining and PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BAL). One or more serum samples per patient were examined for the presence of BG (Fungitell \u00ae -assay) and Pneumocystis-DNA (nested PCR). While the nested PCR from serum was positive in only 6 out of 50 patients (sensitivity 12%), a BG level greater than the cutoff (80 pg/ml) was found in the serum of 48 patients. Only two patients with a positive immunofluorescence in the BAL were negative for BG (sensitivity 96%, specificity 85%, negative predictive value 92%, positive predictive value 92%). Furthermore, in most cases BG levels were positive before BAL was performed, indicating that the diagnosis could have been made earlier. Almost all of the patients showed very high levels of BG (68% were above 500 pg/ml). Peak levels of up to 140 000 pg/ml were observed with a median concentration of 1262 pg/ml. There was no correlation between the concentration of BG and a positive PCR in the serum. In summary, serum BG measurement is a reliable indicator for PCP and could be used as an early diagnostic test for patients at risk of having a PCP before a BAL is performed.",

This study aimed at improving the hygiene situation of the cutting process-unit for cooked ham with UVCradiation of the knife surface and the cabinet of the slicing-machine. The total bacteria count of sliced and packaged cook ham samples as well as grit samples was determined by spatula rub out method on plate count agar. Air borne bacteria in 1m3 air of the slicing room were analysed by RCS Plus air sampler and Hycon Contact Slides, Biotest. Bacteria species were determined with API-System, Biomerieux. UVC radiation was performed with an UVC tube form type AQT2000, total output in [W254nm] = max 15, intensity at 1m in [\u03bcW/cm2] = max 145; ambient temperature limit: -20 to +50\u00baC; power dissipation [W] 36-18; current flow [mA] 160-80; supply voltage 230V. Compared to the total bacteria count of cooked ham after cooking which was 100 cfu/g, the count (61 tests) after slicing indicated that ham grit which accumulates in the cutting area mainly cause microbial contamination within the slicing process. Samples from ham sliced near to the grit (one the right side of the slicer machine) revealed a contamination rate between 100 and 5600 cfu/g.This grit itself exposed a total bacteria count higher than 4000 cfu/g dominated by Lactobacillus fermentum, L. curvatus, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Air borne bacterial contamination with counts (7 tests) of 64 cfu/m3 could be excluded. In order to reduce this bacterial load an UVC-radiation was implemented into the slicing machine. To avoid soiling of the lamp with grid by optimal area radiation the UVC-lamp was located in the cabinet above the rotating knife. Cooked ham sliced while radiated indicated a reduced bacterial count (20 tests) of 500 cfu/g compared to sliced ham without. In conclusion, UVC radiation reduces ham-grid related bacterial contamination of sliced pre-packaged cooked ham. Advanced effectiveness might be accessible combining UVC-radiation and process integrated cleaning systems.",

Beermann *1 1 Food Technology, University of Applied Science Fulda, Fulda, Germany 2 Quality Assurance, W. Brandenburg GmbH & Co. oHG, Dreieich, Germany Microbial food spoilage of pre-packaged acidic delicatessen salads is predominantly due to yeasts contamination. The study aimed at establishing lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria with probiotic characteristics in order to protect egg and coleslaw salad culture against pichia contamination. Microbial contamination experiments were performed by incubating the products with 106 cfu/g Lactobacillus reuteri or 106 cfu/g Bifidobacterium bifidum together with a challenge of 102 -103 cfu/g Pichia etchellsii. The count of aerobic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria and yeasts as well as the pHvalue, aw-value and content of acetic acid were examined in 7-days-intervalls from production to the expiry date. The salads were stored at 4-7\u00baC. The total count and species specific counts were performed by the pour plate method. The aw-value was measured using an electric hygrometer and the acetic acid content was enzymatically determined. In egg salad with a pH-value of 4.5 all inoculated bacteria species could be established with counts of 104 cfu/g. After 14 days cultivation the pH-value increased 0.2, while the acetic acid content decreased 0.3-0.4 from 3.0 to 2.6-2.7 g/kg. The aw-value, sensory and texture of the product remained constant. The yeast proliferation rate with significant gas-production could not be influenced. In coleslaw salad with a pH-value of 3.90 Bifidobacterium bifidum could only be co-cultured together with Lactobacillus reuteri. After 21 days cultivation the pHvalue increased from 3.9 to 4.2 while the acetic acid content decreased from 2.75 to 2,60-2,65 g/kg. The aw-value, sensory and texture of the product remained constant. Independent on any protection-culture the yeast proliferation could be inhibited after 7 days (end-count < 100 cfu/g). In conclusion, the establishment of probiotic bacteria in acidic delicatessen salads is dependent on the pH-value and is improvable by co-culturing different species. Although product characteristics could be influenced, the product-protective potential of probiotic bacteria against yeasts is limited and needs further investigation. Objectives: Soda fountains (SF) producing cooled and carbonated water from the tap water supply, are a convenient way to provide patients and employees with drinking water. Use of SF can reduce storage space, waste and transport-related emissions compared to the supply with bottled water. However, microbial contamination of water from SF can occur and may endanger immunocompromised patients. At the University Medical Center Freiburg, 51 SF are currently in use. Methods: Water samples were obtained after start-up and biannually thereafter. Results were evaluated according to the German drinking water regulation (GDWR). If the acceptable number of colony forming units (CFU) was exceeded (>100/>20 CFU/ml at 22\u00baC/36\u00baC), analysis was repeated with a new sample. If a 2nd sample was still positive, or if pathogenic bacteria or high colony counts were detected in the 1st sample, the SF was put out of service until a negative sample was obtained after maintenance and disinfection. Results: From 2004 to 2008, 358 samples from 51 SF were analysed. 309 (86%) met the criteria of the GDWR, the remaining 49 (14%) did not. Of the latter, 43 samples (88%) exceeded the acceptable number of CFU, 5 (10%) were positive for coliform bacteria (3) or P. aeruginosa (2), 1 (2%) was both positive for coliforms and had excessive CFU counts. No enterococci or E. coli were found. Pathogens not listed in the GDWR were identified in 5 samples. The rate of nonconform samples dropped steadily from 25% (2004) to 3% (2008). Conclusions: State-of-the-art soda fountains are a feasible alternative or addition to bottled water. However, standard cleaning, disinfection and maintenance procedures and continuous surveillance should be implemented to ensure safe operation. Use in high-risk areas is not recommended since identified pathogens may endanger susceptible patients. Replacing activated carbon filters with particle filters (done 2005/2006) may have contributed to the decrease of non-conform samples.",

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are a pathogenic subgroup of STEC that cause watery or bloody diarrhea and the hemolytic uremic syndrome in human beings after consumption of raw or undercooked foods. Little is known about the behavior of EHEC in ground beef. The aim of this work is the identification and characterization of genes that offer the ability to survive through the processing and storage of this high risk food. By using an antibiotic based in vivo expression technology (IVET), we want to detect genes expressed in vivo as an adaption of bacteria to environmental conditions, in this case in a meat model at 42\u00baC, but not under standard laboratory conditions. Therefore a genomic library of E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933, a representative of one of the most critical serotypes worldwide, was constructed in the vector pKK232-8 containing a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene for selection of promoters active under experimental conditions. The resulting plasmids were cloned into a nalidixic acid resistant mutant of the laboratory strain E. coli HB101 for a better reisolation of the clones from ground beef. The library consists of 4,6 x 10 4 clones with an average insert size of 600 bp, representing an approximate 10fold redundancy of the genome. Furthermore a ground beef model with a low background microbiota (1,6 x 102 cfu/g) for the IVET screening is established. The system is suitable for analysis of in vivo expressed genes.

L. monocytogenes positive samples were confirmed by a cultural method. The samples analysed were obtained from seven different slaughterhouses from southern Germany. Listeria spp. was found in 15.5% of the samples, while 2.3 % of the samples contained L. monocytogenes. Samples from kidneys and lungs were all negative for L. monocytogenes. The highest occurrence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes was obtained in rumen samples, with 33.3% and 26.7 % positive results, respectively. The highest contamination rates of Listeria spp. were found in bovine samples. Porcine samples showed the highest rates of L. monocytogenes contamination. In this study, the presence of Listeria spp. And L. monocytogenes in raw meat was lower than reported in other studies. It is known that products which support growth of L. monocytogenes pose a potential risk to consumers. On the other hand, the consumption of meat and meat products should not cause concern because mostly meat is consumed after undergoing a treatment that has supposedly eradicated all Listeria. Infection with enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is considered an important and severe bacterial disease worldwide. The VIDAS \u00ae UP ECPT is a new method, based on the specific phage capture technique for the detection of E. coli O157:H7. The applicability of this method was examined. 24 minced beef samples artificial contaminated with a non-virulent E. coli O157 strain at 3 contamination levels (0, ~5, ~45 cells/25 g; 8 samples per level) were provided by the Institute Pasteur de Lille. A control sample was used for the enumeration of the total material count. The samples were incubated at 42\u00baC for 6 h buffered peptone water (BPW). Prior to performing VIDAS \u00ae UP ECPT assay 2 ml of each sample was heated (99\u00baC, 5 min). Positive results were confirmed from non heated BPW by isolation on CT-SMAC and the chromogenic CT O157:H7 ID plates followed by agglutination with O157 latex and API 20E tests. The ISO 16654 method was used as a reference method. Total bacterial count was 9.1 x 109 cfu/g. The VIDAS \u00ae UP ECPT gave 15 positive results, which were confirmed on selective agar plates and 8 definitely negative results. One negative sample showed a distinctly higher relative fluorescence value than the other negative results. This sample was confirmed as positive on selective agar plates. The reference method detected, despite application of immunomagnetic separation after 24 h incubation, only 3 samples as definitely negative and 3 as clearly positive. Although the accompanying flora in the samples was very high the VIDAS \u00ae UP ECPT method was shown to be an efficient screening instrument for the detection of EHEC O157:H7 bearing the advantage of a reduced analysis time. Arcobacter spp., aerotolerant Campylobacter-like organisms, have been isolated from animals and humans. A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii are the three most common species associated with human gastroenteritis. These species have frequently been found on poultry carcasses, thus posing a possible risk for human infection via consumption of contaminated meat products. The isolation methods used are time-consuming and therefore, species differentiation by phenotypic tests gives frequently incorrect results. In this study Arcobacter spp. Were detected and identified by genotypic methods (PCR) in poultry samples from Southern Germany. A total of 209 samples of raw poultry meat (146) and poultry products (63) were studied. The samples were enriched (1:4) in a selective bouillon under microaerophilic conditions at 30\u00baC for 16 h prior to DNA extraction (PrepMan). Arcobacter spp. Were detected using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA [1] . Arcobacter spp. Associated with human diseases were identified by multiplex PCR based on five primers targeting the 16S and 23S rRNA sequences [2] . The products were detected using gel-electrophoresis. Arcobacter was detected in 54% (79/146) of the samples. All processed samples were negative. A. butzleri, A. cryaerophilus and A. skirrowii were identified in 48%, 8% and 4% of the samples, respectively. Duck and goose samples were contaminated only with A. buzleri. A. skirrowii was found only in chicken samples. In five chicken samples, both A. buzleri and A. cryaerophilus were detected. The prevalence of Arcobacter spp. Was high in raw chicken, turkey and duck samples but low in raw goose samples. A. butzleri was the most frequently identified species. Undercooked poultry products could be an important source for human A. buzleri infections, which has to be further evaluated using genotypic methods. The increasing relevance of enteropathogenic B. cereus particularly in largescale catering facilities, leads to a growing demand for fast and reliable detection methods. In addition to frequently applied cellular and immunological tests for B. cereus toxins, more recently molecular biological methods for the detection of the underlying toxin genes have been implemented in routine analysis. To date, conventional singleplex and multiplex PCR methods for the genes of all potentially enteropathogenic toxins (Nhe, Hbl, CytK1, cereulide) as well as two singleplex Real-time PCRs specific for Nhe (nheB) and cereulide (ces) have been published. Compared to conventional PCR systems, the faster and more sensitive Real-time PCR represents an advantageous technology with the possibility of easy automation and the omission of cumbersome post-PCR detection procedures (e.g. gel electrophoresis). The present study deals with the development of a multiplex Real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of B. cereus toxin genes hblD, nheA, ces and cytK1. For this purpose a PCR protocol based on SYBR Green I with subsequent melting temperature (Tm) analysis was designed. This novel method was established using well characterized B. cereus strains previously tested with immunological, cellular and biomolecular assays. The developed PCR was shown to be a facile, fast and reliable method. Contract-Research-Project for the Bundeswehr Medical Service.",

Beside the production of Shiga toxins (Stx) STEC express a number of accessory virulence factors, whose distribution vary among different STEC strains. In this study, we wanted to assess the spectrum and virulence profiles of foodborne STEC. We determined the prevalence of STEC in 504 samples of different high risk foods like minced meat and raw sausages from local retailers and supermarkets, as well as raw milk from a dairy and a milk collection plant. In addition, STEC strains from analytical authorities were obtained. In 78 STEC strains the serotypes, stx-subtypes, and the presence of the virulence genes eae, iha, cdt-V, subAB, ehxA, espP, nleA, cif and efa1 were determined. Besides stx, iha, ehxA, subAB, and espP were detected most frequently. Only five out of 78 strains were eae-positive. Three of the latter strains belonged to the enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) serogroups O157, O26, and O103 and contained virulence gene compositions typical for EHEC.

            "text": "Host cell invasion of Campylobacter jejuni has been reported as one of the primary reasons of tissue damage in humans but molecular mechanisms are widely unclear. We have shown that C. jejuni triggers membrane ruffling in the eukaryotic cell followed by invasion in a very specific manner first with its tip followed by the flagellar end. Binding of C. jejuni to host fibronectin is important in this process and mediated by CadF. Infection assays revealed that C. jejuni bound to and invaded INT-407 cells more efficiently than isogenic cadF mutants. This suggests that binding of CadF to extracellular fibronectin may trigger intracellular signalling to facilitate host cell entry. In order to verify this hypothesis, we used mouse knockout fibroblasts derived from fibronectin -/-, focal adhesion kinase -/or Src/Yes/Fyn -/mice, to study C. jejuni-induced signalling during invasion. We found that each of these host cell factors is indeed required for maximal invasion of this pathogen. Using specific GTPasemodifying toxins, inhibitors, silencing RNA (siRNA) and GTPase expression constructs we further show that the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, are involved in C. jejuni invasion. In agreement with these observations, we observed a time-dependent activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 by C. jejuni. Finally, we demonstrate that the activation of these GTPases involves CadF as one of the bacterial factors, but was independent of other pathogenicity factors including CDT, plasmid pVir, capsular genes or adhesin pEB1. Thus, CadF is a bifunctional protein which triggers bacterial binding to host cells as well as signalling leading to GTPase activation for efficient host cell invasion. Collectively, our results suggest that C. jejuni invade host target cells by a unique mechanism and the activation of the Rho GTPase members Rac1 and Cdc42 by CadF-binding to fibronectin plays a crucial role in this entry process. Despite progress in adjuvant chemotherapy in the recent decades, pancreatic cancer remains a common cause of death worldwide. Bacterial toxins, which specifically bind to cell surface-exposed glycosphingolipids (GSLs), are a potential novel therapy. We determined the expression of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer/CD77), the Shiga toxin receptor, in human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Tissue lipid extracts of matched pairs of cancerous and adjacent normal tissue from 21 pancreatic cancer patients were investigated with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) overlay assay combined with a novel mass spectrometry approach. Gb3Cer/CD77 was localized by immunofluorescence microscopy of cryosections from malignant and corresponding healthy tissue samples. 62% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed increased Gb3Cer/CD77 expression, whereas 38% of malignant pancreas did not, indicating an association of this marker with neoplastic transformation. Also, Gb3Cer/CD77 was associated with poor differentiation (G > 2) in cancer tissue (P = 0.039). Mass spectrometric analysis evidenced enhanced expression of Gb3Cer/CD77 with long (C24) and short chain fatty acids (C16) in malignant tissues and pointed to the presence of hydroxylated fatty acids, which are proposed to be important for receptor targeting. They could be detected in 86% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Immunohistology of tissue cryosections indicated tumor-and neovascular-association of these receptors. These results prompt consideration of Shiga toxin, ist B-subunit or B-subunitderivatives as novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this challenging malignancy.",

They are thoroughly studied in Escherichia coli, but only very few of them are known in Gram positive bacteria so far. sRNAs mostly display their effects posttranscriptionally either by acting via RNA-protein-interference or via direct base pairing with their target mRNAs. Some non-coding RNAs also exhibit an intrinsic catalytic activity. Here we describe a putative sRNA, which is transcribed in different pathogenic S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. It was detected in a genomewide search for transcripts in large intergenic regions. The transcript was verified by Northern blot analysis, RT-PCR and quantitative Real-time PCR. Polarity and 5'-transcription-end were experimentally determined and bioinformatic analysis revealed two putative promoters and a strong Rho-independent transcription terminator. Neither a ribosomal binding site nor an open reading frame were detectable. The element precedes genes for methionine-biosynthesis, and analysis of the met-sRNA sequence identified a highly conserved T-box motif. T-box regulatory systems are RNA-based transcription termination control systems of Gram-positive bacteria often governing tRNA synthetase and amino acid biosynthesis genes. Experiments with different S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains indicated that the met-sRNA is conserved in these species, while transcription levels vary among strains and in response to environmental conditions. The role of the met-sRNA in metabolic adaptation of staphylococci to different ecological niches and its possible suitability as a novel antibiotic target are discussed. Virulence of the human and animal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is multifactorial depending on expression of specific pathogenicity factors including toxins, adhesins, digestive toxins, and fitness factors. Recent analysis of complete genome sequences as well as comparative transcriptome and proteome studies indicate a high degree of variability between different S. aureus strains. To understand pathogenicity of S. aureus as complex process and to analyze particular virulence determinants it is essential to apply relevant in vivo models. Although several animal models have been described it is still unknown which model is most relevant to evaluate a particular virulence determinant or the virulence potential of a laboratory or clinical strain. In this study, different in vivo models were used to establish a new in vivo imaging technique, based on a S. aureus strain (Xen29) expressing the lux operon. We are now able to show the dynamics of S. aureus infection in subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous infections noninvasively and in real time. Several virulence-related factors have been evaluated using this technique including deletion mutants in global regulators such as agrA, arlS, sarA, virulence factors such as spa, hla, fnbA, fnbB and metabolic factors such as purH and putP. In general, the virulence potential of the isogenic mutants is dependent of the particularly used infection model. Interestingly, strong reduction of virulence has been detected in the purH mutant suggesting an essential role of purine de novo biosynthesis in vivo. Thus, it can be concluded that essential metabolic factors provide a powerful target for possibly more effective anti-staphylococcal treatments than single virulence factors or regulators.",

Here, we show that activation of HIF-1 is a general phenomenon in infections with human pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa as HIF-1 activation was detectable (i) in vitro in cell-culture infection models, (ii) ex vivo using biopsies of human patients suffering from skin infections and (iii) in vivo using peritoneal and intravenous S. aureus infection models. HIF-1 activation by human pathogens was caused by oxygen-dependent mechanisms. Small colony variants (SCVs) of S. aureus did not lead to cellular hypoxia nor to HIF-1 activation. Finally, pharmaceutical inhibition of HIF-1 activation resulted in increased survival rates in a murine S. aureus peritonitis model. Taken together, this study reveals that HIF-1 activation is a general phenomenon in infections with human pathogens and that HIF-1 pathways might be an attractive target to modulate in the course of infections.",

Virulent H. pylori strains harbor a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the cag pathogenicity island. This T4SS injects the CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells leading to actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements followed by cell elongation and scattering. Here we report that PMA (4\u0215-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), a well-known cell-permeable activator of protein kinase C (PKC), induces a remarkably similar cellular phenotype as compared to infection with H. pylori. PKCs comprise a large family of serine/threonine kinases which are important for multiple physiological processes of host cells. We therefore investigated the role of individual PKC members and the signaling pathways involved in phenotypical outcome. Using isoform-specific silencing RNAs and pharmacological inhibitors we found that two isoforms, PKC-\u012e and PKC-\u012f, were essential for both PMA-and H. pylori-induced elongation phenotype. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PKC-\u012f activity is profoundly stimulated during the course of infection using activation-specific antibodies against PKC phosphorylated at threonine residue 505 or serine residue 660. Infection with H. pylori wild-type and mutants showed that at least two bacterial factors activate PKC-\u012f in a time-dependent manner, one of which is CagA. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies further demonstrated that phosphorylated PKC-\u012f is accumulated and recruited to dynamic actin-structures at the cell membrane. Finally, we show that PKC-\u012f specifically targets Raf kinase to stimulate the Erk1/2 kinase pathway, which is also crucial for phenotypical outcome. Thus, PKC-\u012f is another important mediator of H. pyloriinduced pathogenesis.",

Heesemann *1 1 Max-von-Pettenkofer Institut, Bakteriologie, LMU, M\u00fcnchen, Germany Yersinia enterocolitica is pathogenic for humans and rodents. As Gramnegative pathogen, Yersinia releases typical pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-proteins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan fragments (PG), lipoprotein (LP) and the Yersinia V antigen (LcrV), which are recognized by the host PAMP-receptors (PRRs). The family of PRRs comprises surface receptors such as TLR2, CD14, cytosolic receptors such as NOD1/2 and signal transduction adaptor proteins such as MyD88 and RIP2. Moreover, PRR signalling leads to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiinflammatory proteins such as IL-10 and IL-1Ra (Sing et al. 2005 ), (Hoffmann et al. 2006 . This prompted us to investigate ko-mice with defined defects in innate immunity (IL10 -/-, Rip2 -/-, IL1-Ra -/-, MyD88 -/-, TLR2 -/-, CD14 -/-, NOD1 -/-) for susceptibility towards Yersinia (10E4 CFU intraperitoneally). The bacterial load in infected mice was determined by counting CFU in spleens, whereas the cellular immune response of the infected mice was studied by FACS analysis and immunohistochemistry respectively. We found, that MyD88 -/mice were highly susceptible, TLR2 -/and Nod1 -/mice were moderately susceptible, and IL10 -/-, Rip2 -/-, IL1-Ra -/were highly resistant against Y. enterocolitica. Histologic analysis of spleen cryosections revealed that Yersinia abscesses are surrounded by neutrophils (PMNs) and this cell population is increased in the resistant mice (data also supported by FACS analysis). Thus, neutrophils seem to play a decisive part in eliminating the Yersinia abscess formation. In perspective we are going to compare neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection and neutrophil bactericidal activity of the different ko-mice. It has been previously reported that Toxoplasma gondii infected mice loose their natural fear of cat urine. However, it is unclear whether these behavioural changes are due to (i) infection of specific areas of the brain, especially areas important for behaviour e.g. amygdala (ii) active alteration of neuronal functions by the parasite or (iii) ensuing immune response. To address these questions we analyzed BALB/c mice infected with Toxoplasma gondii cysts at day 30 and 60 for behavioural changes, MRI scans, PET scans, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo thallium uptake experiment. In addition live cell calcium imaging of infected primary neurons was also performed. MRI depicted large randomly distributed inflammatory lesions in the infected mice. A correlation of the MRI data with histological findings suggests that an anatomical foci of infection does not occur and therefore is not responsible for the change in behaviour. Immunhistochemistry showed T. gondii infected mainly glial cells and neurons. Some neurons were positively stained with toxoplasma antibody without any signs if intracellular parasite invasion. A frequent axonal contact of these neurons with a neuron hosting a cyst was also observed. This suggests a possible influencing modulation on the neuronal physiology by the cyst and indicates that the parasite had actively modified the neuronal activity. Live cell calcium imaging of primary neuronal cultures infected with toxoplasma showed decreased calcium signalling upon excitation with glutamate. Furthermore in the thallium uptake experiment there were no signs of electrically active neurons hosting a cyst, as there was no dynamic influx of potassium, which is required for neuronal activity. This might contribute to the changes in the behaviour of an animal carrying chronic toxoplasma infection.",

The molecular determinants contributing to increased pathogenicity and invasiveness of specific S. aureus strains are not clear. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of specific virulence traits in selected invasive (blood cultures, n=34; wound infections, n=31) and commensal (n=29) MRSA isolates. All isolates were characterized using staphylococcal protein A (spa) and multilocus sequence typing. Strains belonging to the deduced clonal complexes were evenly distributed between invasive and commensal isolates. Most strains carried the accessory gene regulator type I (84 %) and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec type 4 (80 %), independent from the origin of the isolates. Similarly, genes encoding adhesive molecules (fnbA, clfA, clfB, sdrC, sdrD, sdrE, emp) were present in over 80 % of invasive and commensal strains. Almost no toxin genes (tst, edin-B, eta, etb, hla, luk) could be detected. Interestingly, the extracellular fibringogen binding protein efb showed a strong association to CC5 independent from the origin of the isolate. In contrast, the extracellular adhesive protein gene eap was found in 91 % of the blood culture isolates, but only in 30% of the commensal strains, without being associated with a specific clonal complex. Moreover, mean quantitative biofilm production of blood culture isolates was significantly higher compared to the nasal strains. Apparently, irrespective of the genetic background specific virulence determinants are associated with invasive MRSA isolates. Our findings highlight the importance of eap for endovascular MRSA infections and indicate that biofilm formation capacity is linked to increased invasiveness. Further studies using high throughput typing technologies are warranted in order to gain insight into the evolution of MRSA virulence.",

We observed that most patients are infected with the same S. aureus clone over many years. S. aureus expresses a variety of virulence factors, like toxin superantigens, cytotoxins, proteases, and MSCRAMMS (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules). The chronic suppurative airway infections lead to lung-insufficiency and preterm death. S. aureus has an enhanced ability to bind to the CF airway epithelium because of the altered CF mucus, higher mucus osmolarity, or altered glycoconjugate composition of the airway cells and the bacterium has developed different mechanisms to escape the normal host immune response. A unique collection of S. aureus isolates, which were collected over 14 years from over 100 cystic fibrosis patients, allows us to investigate the adaptive mechanism of S. aureus to the hostile environment. With next generation sequencing we will sequence the whole genome of the first and the latest S. aureus isolate of 3 cystic fibrosis patients to analyze genomic changes which occurred during long term persistence.

            "text": "Helicobacter pylori is a highly successful human-specific gastric pathogen inducing pathologies ranging from chronic gastritis to peptic ulcers and cancer. Virulent isolates encode a type-IV secretion system (T4SS). This T4SS forms a extracellular needle-like pilus which is composed of 11 VirB proteins (called VirB1-VirB11) and some accessory proteins (VirD4 and others). These proteins assemble in the inner and outer membranes of the Gram-negative bacterium and presumably form a channel used to inject bacterial virulence molecules into target cells such as the CagA effector protein. This is accomplished by a specialised adhesin of the pilus surface, the CagL protein, which is a functional VirB5 ortholog. The T4SS-needles are induced upon contact with the host cell membrane and CagL is transported to the pilus surface by a yet unknown mechanism. Interestingly, CagL carries a classical RGD-motif that binds to host cell integrin beta-1 receptor. Here we purified wild-type and mutant CagL proteins and studied their interaction with host cells. We demonstrate that purified CagL alone is able to permit binding and to induce signaling both in RGD-dependent and RGD-independent fashion. We further show that CagL can activate well-known host cell oncoproteins of the Src and Abl families, which are the tyrosine kinases of injected CagA. Intracellular CagA mimics a cellular host protein in binding and activation of numerous eukaryotic factors and induces various phosphorylation-dependent and phosphorylationindependent signalling cascades. The latter include the induction of membrane dynamics, actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and the disruption of cell-to-cell junctions as well as proliferative, pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic nuclear responses. Thus, CagA and CagL are remarkable bacterial T4SS proteins capable of affecting multiple host cell signalling activities. The contribution of this signalling to H. pylori pathogenesis is discussed.",

Thereby, we identified several Campylobacter jejuni mutants with a strongly decreased invasiveness. Sequencing of genomic DNA of the respective clones detected insertion of a transposon in the gene cj0952c, which, together with the adjacent gene cj0951c, is supposed to serve as a single chemoreceptor via translation of both genes into one functional protein by a read-through mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that insertion of the transposon neither effects transcription of upstream gene cj0953c nor of downstream gene cj0951c. Furthermore, we could restore the capability of the mutant to invade host cells almost effective as the wild-type by introducing cj0952c together with cj0951c but not by introducing cj0952c alone. Since also the motility of the mutant was decreased compared to the wild type, we analyzed the alteration of motility by complementing the mutant with cj0952c-cj0951c and cj0952c, respectively. Thereby wild type motility could be completely reconstituted only by the introduction of both genes. Altogether, these results are supporting the idea that the C. jejuni genes cj0952c and cj0951c are pseudogenes and that a read through from upstream cj0952c into downstream cj0951c gene creates one functional protein. Type II secretion systems (T2SS) are multi-protein complexes spanning the envelope of gram-negative bacteria dedicated to the export of proteins. We previously identified a transcriptional regulator, PypC, which is associated with the Yts2 T2SS in the highly pathogenic Y. enterocolitica O8 strain 8081. We show that pypC is autoregulated and organized as an operon with the downstream yts2 genes. Furthermore, the operon is repressed by H-NS and activated by the virulence regulator RovA. While Yts2 is conserved in all pathogenic Yersinia species including Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, only highly pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica possess a second T2SS gene cluster termed Yts1. Interestingly, Yts1 is also associated with a transcriptional regulator we termed PclR, which is not autoregulated. Furthermore, there is only marginal cross-regulation between Yts1 and Yts2 via PypC or PclR. We show that growth of bacteria at 26\u00baC in Ca2 + -depleted media results in Yts1 activation and secretion of substrates. PclR activates transcription of the chiY gene coding for a predicted N-acetlyglucosamine binding protein that is located downstream of Yts1. Using Y. enterocolitica strains with mutated Yts1 and/or Yts2 systems, we show that Yts1 but not Yts2 mediates secretion of ChiY. In addition, our data indicate that further proteins are secreted specifically via the Yts1 T2SS of Y. enterocolitica. Others have previously shown a role for Yts1 during late stages of a Y. enterocolitica infection in the mouse model of infection, indicating that the T2SS substrates have a specific function in virulence. In summary, we identify a unique association of the Yts T2SS of Yersinia with transcriptional regulators and identify the first type II-secreted proteins of Y. enterocolitica. [GAS] ) is an important human pathogen, which causes diseases ranging from mild superficial infections of the skin and mucous membranes of the naso-pharynxs to severe toxic and invasive diseases. GAS is equipped with many virulence factors which allow this human pathogen to infect and survive in the host. Regulation of virulence factor expression is fine tuned by two-component sytems and stand alone regulators. Transcriptome analysis of a serotype M49 GAS strain and its isogenic Nra knock out mutant revealed the transcriptional control of a new RALP family regulator, Ralp3 (Spy0735; RofA-like protein regulator type 3). Ralp3 is linked with a gene encoding Epf (extracellular protein factor from Streptococcus suis), a plasminogen-binding protein in GAS. To characterize the functional and virulence associated roles of Ralp3 and Epf encoded by the ERES region of the M49 serotype GAS strain, ralp3 deletion and epf insertion mutants were studied in several pathogenesis-related assays. The impact of Ralp3 and Epf on the adherence to and internalization into human keratinocytes was characterized, the ability of the mutants to survive in different media was tested, hyaluronic acid capsule production was determined and plasminogen binding assays with intact bacteria were performed. Ralp3 inactivation significantly reduced adherence of GAS to human keratinocytes. The Epf mutant showed a decreased adherence and internalization. Survival assays in different media showed that the Ralp3 mutant is unable to survive in human plasma, blood, and serum, whereas Epf mutation exclusively affected whole blood survival. We also demonstrated that the hyaluronic acid capsule of the Ralp3 mutant is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the inactivation of both genes influence the plasminogen binding in GAS. In summary, our results provide the importance of Ralp3 as transcriptional regulator in GAS pathogenesis. Pathogenic Yersinia species engage a plasmid-encoded type III protein secretion system that injects Yop virulence proteins into host cells to establish disease. Six effector Yops cooperatively modulate host immune responses enabling survival and extracellular dissemination of the bacteria in the host lymphoid tissue. YopE is a cytotoxin that manipulates the activity of Rho-GTPases, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton structure and contributes to phagocytosis resistance of Yersinia. We have previously shown that YopE of the Y. enterocolitica serogroup O8 is modified by polyubiqitination and degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of the host cell. Here, we investigated the role of YopE degradation for Yersinia virulence and pathogenesis. The lysine polyubiquitin acceptor sites of wild type YopE K62 and K75 were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting YopE mutant delta-YopE-K62/75 escaped ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by infected host cells and displayed stabilized YopE levels. The lack of YopE inactivation was accompanied by a pronounced cytotoxic effect on infected cells. Interestingly, strain delta-YopE-K62/75 with stabilized YopE showed reduced pathogenicity in a mouse model of infection in comparison to wild type yersiniae. The colonization of liver and spleen was delayed and diminished after enteral infection of mice with strain delta-YopE-K62/75. Importantly, the stabilization of YopE was associated with reduced translocation of other Yops into cultured, Yersinia-infected cells. YopE is known to regulate and minimize the size of the Yersinia translocation pore. We propose that the increase of intracellular YopE impairs efficient translocation of other Yop effectors. This indicates that Y. enterocolitica O8 exploits the host ubiquitin proteasome system to destabilize YopE and to increase anti-host activities of other Yops and concomitantly Yersinia virulence. Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci, GAS) is an important human pathogen, which causes a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from mild superficial infections to invasive illnesses with high mortality and morbidity rate. The ability of GAS to cause different diseases in a variety of human tissues relies upon a highly regulated expression of various virulence genes in response to different host environments during an infection. In search for novel virulence determinants, we have generated a mutant library in GAS M49 serotype. Thus, different random mutagenesis systems were applied and compared. The most efficient one, the TnSpc-based mutagenesis system, was further used for generation of GAS M49 mutant bank. Highthroughput screening of the constructed library together with 184 clinical isolates derived in University Hospital of Rostock and 60 targeted mutant strains was carried out for identification of surface antigens with changed expression level. Polyclonal antibodies, directed against virulence factors coded by FCT (for fibronectin-collagen-T-antigen) and Mga genomic regions were used for the screening. After analysis of the clone arrays and processing of the data, 24 mutants with modified signals were selected for further genetic studies. Direct sequencing on genomic DNA carried out for identification of the TnSpc integration site, led to the identification of 8 interesting candidates. Among them are strains deficient in signalling proteins as well as proteins involved in cell envelope biogenesis and DNA/protein synthesis. Further studies will reveal how these proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of S. pyogenes. Moreover, we detected 30 clinical isolates with unregulated expression of fibronectin-binding protein PrtF2. Interestingly, 64 % of them were associated with skin infections, even though that the skin isolates were not the most prevalent in the collection. Intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli are important etiological agents worldwide and can cause a broad spectrum of diseases. Especially in developing countries, diarrhoea represents a major public health problem, mainly affecting children under the age of five. Diarrhoeagenic E. coli can be classified into seven major pathotypes due to their virulence factor profiles and pathogenesis, including enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (ATEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). We have developed a specific one-step multiplex PCR (MPCR) for the differential identification of intestinal pathogenic E. coli isolates. This technique has proven to be a reliable tool to examine virulence factor profiles of potentially diarrhoeagenic E. coli strains isolated from patients living in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. In total, 702 isolates of 304 patients were investigated via MPCR. The majority of strains harbouring virulence factor-encoding genes can be assigned to the EAEC pathotype. In addition, we identified members of almost all other pathogroups. All these isolates are currently characterized further in terms of their virulence factor expression profiles, their effect on tissue culture cells with focus on the actin cytoskeleton, invasiveness, and secretion of locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) effector proteins. Our group has performed transcriptional profiling for different types and models of infection with Candida albicans. Samples from the oral cavity of HIV-positive patients, a model based on reconstituted human oral epithelium, infected human blood and infected liver from mice were analysed for genomewide gene expression of C. albicans. Analysis of the obtained transcriptome data revealed a high number of upregulated genes during the infection process. Besides some previously described and now well characterized infectionassociated genes, a large number of genes encoded proteins with unknown functions. We hypothesised that these upregulated genes might play an important role in the initiation and persistence of C. albicans infections. In silico analysis identified a set of 50 candidate genes associated with the infection process. These were chosen for further characterisation and we have begun to systematically disrupt each of these genes. 44 homozygote mutants have already been obtained. A number of the mutants generated were shown to have altered host-pathogen interaction properties. In particular, deletion of a gene which was highly upregulated during interaction with blood cells and tissue invasion displayed significantly reduced damage of oral epithelial and endothelial cells and reduced survival in the presence of human immune effector cells.

Y. enterocolitica serogroup O:3 is the most prevalent serogroup in raw pork and reported cases in Europe, with rising global relevance. The genome of the highly-virulent American serogroup O:8 (biotype 1B) is already sequenced. Using the available draft genomes of European isolates serogroup O:3, biotype 4, and O:5,27, biotype 2, genome comparisons reveal biotype and serogroup specific differences and sequences which can be used as biotype/serotype markers. Our goal is to identify the reasons for the stronger niche adaptation but nevertheless also higher ability to emerge as a worldwide pathogen of Y. enterocolitica serogroup O:3. Main differences concern the presence of prophages, the lipopolysaccharide gene cluster and the absence of a complete plasticity zone in O:3 strains. However, even single genes absent in either European or American strains may define the virulence pattern of the respective biotypes, including autotransporters and toxins as well as hypothetical proteins. We now focus on the development of a Pan-Yersinia pathoarray for diagnostical purposes. The final version of the pathoarray will include bio-and serogroup specific sequences and also those to distinguish the two other highly pathogenic Yersinia, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis. Moreover, sequences of virulence-associated genes will be added for further characterization of pathogenic isolates. The human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes is responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from mild superficial infections of skin and mucose membrane of the pharynx to severe invasive and/or toxic infections. An orchestral expression of subsets of different virulence factors is responsible for the pathogenicity. To identify novel virulence factors, mutant libraries of serotype M18 and M49 were generated by the use of the transposon-based mutagenesis system TnSpc. The system is characterized by a modified version of IS256 within the suicide vector pMGC57. Experiments for transposition efficiency revealed a high frequency of integration and random insertion events. So far 7500 mutants of serotype M18 and 6700 of serotype M49 were generated. To screen for mutants with relevant phenotypes for virulence we established a system based on solid media plates supplemented with sublethal dosages of oxidative stress substances (H2O2 and MSBS (menadionesodiumbisulfit)) and 7 % defibrinated sheep blood. For serotype M18 we could show that 0.04 % were sensitive to H2O2, 0.81 % did not grow on MSBSagar, 0.09 % revealed susceptibility to both substances and 0.09 % were \u0215-haemolysis negative. In the case of M49 we observed 0.73 % of TnSpc mutants to be sensitive to H2O2, 0.1 % to MSBS, 0.07 % to H2O2 and MSBS and for 0.09 % haemolytic activity was missing. A second round of screen was performed with selected \u0215-haemolytic negative mutants and H2O2 and/or MSBS sensitive mutants to confirm the phenotypes. Additionally, agar plates with increasing concentrations of colistinsulphate, an antimicrobial peptide, were included. Interestingly, we observed for M18 a correlation between \u0216-haemolysis and resistance to colistinsulphate. Furthermore, we found one M49 mutant resistant to high concentrations of colistinsulphate, MSBS and H2O2. Sequencing of TnSpc insertion sites is currently underway to identify affected genes.",

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a normal constituent of the healthy human skin microflora, but also a leading cause of severe infections in hospitalized preterm newborns and other immunocompromised patients. Disease-associated isolates were shown previously to be capable of forming biofilms on medical devices, mostly mediated by presence of the icaADBC operon, and to carry multiple copies of the staphylococcal IS element IS256 as well as different types of SCCmec cassettes conferring resistance to oxacillin. MLST analysis revealed that the majority of these isolates belong to a limited number of closely related ica-positive S. epidermidis clones which are obviously widespread in various hospital settings. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and molecular epidemiology of putative pathogenic S. epidermidis clones in a neonatal intensive care unit and to understand the skin colonisation process of newborns by such multiresistant biofilm-forming isolates. The present study confirmed our prior results that ica-and mecA-positive S. epidermidis clonal lineages spread among patients and staff. Moreover, we found a great variety of novel SCC types among CoNS, suggesting a role of these bacteria in the evolution of novel resistance traits in staphylococci. These findings indicate that healthcare associated S. epidermidis infections are mainly caused by a range of successful epidemic clonal lineages with multiple selective factors, including virulence and antibiotic resistance capacity. The detection of a broad variety of SCCmec cassettes suggests that CoNS represent the genetic reservoir and background for the ongoing evolution of novel resistance determinants.",

The establishment of bacterial biofilms on surfaces is a complex process that requires various factors for each consecutive developmental step. Here we report the screen of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 nonredundant transposon insertion mutant library for mutants exhibiting an altered biofilm phenotype. We analysed the capability of all mutants to form late-stage biofilms at the bottom of a 96-well plate by the use of an automated confocal laser scanning microscope and uncovered 394 and 285 genetic determinants of reduced and enhanced biofilm production, respectively. Overall, 70 % of the identified mutants were affected within genes encoding for hypothetical proteins indicating that novel developmental pathways are likely to be dissected in the future. Nevertheless, a common theme that emerged from the analysis of the genes with a predicted function is that the establishment of a biofilm requires regulatory components that are involved in survival under microaerophilic growth conditions, arginine metabolism, pH homeostasis and the DNA repair system. The trimeric autotransporter adhesinBartonella adhesin A (BadA) plays a decisive role in infections with B. henselae. BadA is constructed modularly consisting of a head domain, a long and repetitive neck-stalk module and a membrane anchor domain. To analyze the function of particular BadA domains in detail, the generation of BadA deletion mutants is highly desirable. However, because of the slow growth of B. henselae and limited tools for genetic manipulation, we established a recombinant expression system for BadA mutants in E. coli to allow a functional analysis of certain BadA domains. Therefore, we used (i) a truncated BadA mutant lacking the neck-stalk module (BadA HN23) and exchanged additionally (ii) the BadA HN23 signal sequence with the E. coli OmpA signal sequence, (iii) the BadA HN23 membrane anchor with the Yersinia adhesin A (YadA) membrane anchor or (iv) exchanged both of these modules. Using a set of expression vectors, these constructs were cloned in several E. coli expression strains to analyze the biological functions of such BadA-hybrid proteins. Expression of these hybrid proteins (forming monomers and trimers) was detected via immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. All herein used E. coli strains expressed BadA-hybrid proteins on their cell surface although quantitative differences were detected. A first functional analysis revealed that E. coli expressing BadA hybrid-proteins adhered to endothelial cells (less than B. henselae wildtype); however no differences in collagen-binding were visible compared to E. coli control strains. Further experiments using recombinantly expressed BadA-mutants should allow to investigate BadA-mediated bacteria-host cell interactions in greater detail.",

They are secreted as water-soluble monomers, bind to target cells and oligomerize to form membrane-penetrating pores. However, PFTs are a heterogeneous group made up of several distinct structural classes. Mammalian cells have evolved survival programs to cope with the potentially lethal threat of membrane perforation. Among these defense processes MAPK p38 assumes a pivotal role in promoting cell survival. Activation of p38 by PFT has been attributed to osmotic stress, but as membrane pore formation also disturbs ion-homeostasis, we have reinvestigated the issue. Indeed, prevention of potassium efflux strongly inhibited activation of p38 in cells attacked by S. aureus \u012e-toxin, Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (both members of the \u0215-barrel family), S. pyogenes streptolysin O (CDC-family) and E. coli HlyA (RTX-family). It is known that HlyA and SLO membrane pore formation induce calcium-influx which provokes different cellular responses like cytokine synthesis and apoptosis. We demonstrate that influx of calcium is not required for p38 activation by any of these toxins. Furthermore, activation of p38 in response to SLO was independent of TLR4. These data suggest that loss of potassium is the decisive trigger for activation of p38 in response to PFT. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a leading cause of implant-associated infections. Surface colonization crucially depends on biofilm formation, representing the key virulence mechanism of S. epidermidis. The 220 kDa accumulation associated protein (Aap) mediates intercellular adhesion and biofilm formation after proteolytic processing and exposure of repetitive domain B. In order to function as an intercellular adhesin, Aap domain B must interact with surface structures on neighbouring cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify Aap domain B ligands involved in intercellular adhesion. To this end we used recombinant Aap domain B to affinity purify binding partners from crude preparations of S. epidermidis surface proteins. Amongst other candidates mass spectrometry identified a protein with so far unknown function which we refer to as the Aap associated Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesin (AaStrA). AaStrA is a 20 kDa protein which possesses an N-terminal export motive, but lacks homologies to other proteins with known function. Analysis of interactions using recombinant proteins in solid phase ELISA and ligand blotting experiments validated specificity of Aap domain B -AaStrA interactions. In addition, independent from Aap, AaStrA bound to the staphylococcal cell surface, induced bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. These data suggest that AaStrA itself is a bona fide intercellular adhesin. aastra is widespread in clinical significant S. epidermidis isolates from catheter-related blood stream and prosthetic joint infections. Moreover, AaStrA-specific antibodies were detected in sera from patients with infections related to aastra-positive S. epidermidis isolates, indicating that AaStrA is produced in vivo. In conclusion we here identified a novel cell surface protein involved in S. epidermidis biofilm formation potentially contributing to implant associated infections. The Gram-negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila is a major cause of both community-and hospital-acquired pneumonia. It infects lung macrophages as well as epithelial cells and multiplies intracellularly, called the replicative stage, and then switches to the transmissive form, capable of host cell damage and prepared for a new infection cycle. Factors contributing to the first steps of host cell infection, i.e. adhesion and invasion, are to a high extent unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the nature of a novel Legionella adhesion / invasion factor, designated LafA, of which expression is highly upregulated during transmissive phase of the bacteria. However, it does not show any significant protein homology and therefore seems to be a Legionella-specific protein. L. pneumophila LafA-knockout mutants showed 70% reduction in invasion into and adhesion to macrophages and epithelial cells. We recombinantly expressed and purified the protein and raised a polyclonal antibody. First, location of the protein was investigated and was present both in supernatants and cell pellets. Interestingly, the size of the cell-associated form (51 kDa) correlated to its gene size, but the LafA protein in the culture supernatants, however, showed only a 46 kDa protein, suggesting its processing after or during translocation out of the bacterial cell. No known type I (Lss), type II (Lsp), type IVA (Lvh) or type IVB (Dot/Icm) L. pneumophila secretion system was responsible for export. Therefore, a screen for mutants with reduced LafA secretion, potentially uncovering determinants important for export and regulation, is underway.",

Frosch 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene und Mikrobiologie, Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany A crucial step in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis is the interaction with endothelial cells underlying the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study we analyzed the physiological and morphological properties of the human brain microvascular endothelial cell line HBMEC after exposure to N. meningitidis. Infection of HBMEC with N. meningitidis resulted in increased permeability at prolonged time of infection. In parallel N. meningitidis induced a progressive detachment of HBMEC from the underlying matrix. Detachment was triggered in a caspase-independent manner and resembled anoikis, a special mode of apoptosis induction in which adherent cells lose contact with the extracellular matrix. Strikingly, endothelial detachment was accompanied by an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in supernatants collected from infected cells. Injury of the HBMEC monolayer and increase in MMP activity required direct cell contact because no detachment and no increase in MMP activity was seen when bacteria were placed above a transwell membrane. In addition, infected cells released cell-cell-contacts. A detailed analysis revealed disappearance of the tight junction protein occludin from the cell periphery. This was the result of cleavage to a lower-sized 50-kDa protein in infected HBMEC. Occludin cleavage was attributable to proteolysis mediated by MMP-8 activity. Abrogation of MMP-8 activity abolished production of the occludin cleavage fragment and remained occludin location at the cell periphery. Moreover, inhibition of MMP activity could partially prevent detachment of infected HBMEC and restore BBB permeability. Together, our data highlight that MMPs play a crucial role in BBB pathophysiology during meningococcal meningitis not solely by targeting the subendothelial basement membrane ECM, but also by altering tight junction components.",

In this study, we aimed to identify novel virulence determinants capable of host cell damage and related secretion or regulation factors. Therefore, we screened two transposon mutagenized clone libraries of L. pneumophila strains JR32 and Corby for mutants with differing hemolytic, lipolytic, and proteolytic activities. A total number of 1246 clones of strain JR32 were screened and we detected 27 mutants with differing hydrolytic activities. For strain Corby we found 24 clones with altered hydrolytic properties out of 1051 screened mutants. One of the mutants with strongly impaired hemolytic, lipolytic and proteolytic activities was identified as a knock-out mutant of the zinc metalloprotease known for its contribution to hemolysis and proteolysis but also lipolysis via enzyme activation. Further insertion analysis located the transposon in novel potentially virulenceassociated genes, for example in a protein involved in aromatic amino acid synthesis. A selection of mutants was further analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze lipids as well as for intracellular infection of human and environmental host cells to evaluate impacts of the affected genes on virulence of L. pneumophila. Twenty years after its discovery bis-(3'-5') cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) has come to be recognized as an ubiquitous second messenger in bacteria. C-di-GMP regulates a number of cellular functions like motility, the expression of virulence factors and biofilm formation. The cellular c-di-GMP level is tightly regulated by controlled synthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP, mediated by diguanylate cyclases containing a conserved GGDEF domain and by phosphodiesterases containing a conserved EAL domain, respectively. GGDEF and EAL domains are often fused to transmembrane and/or signal input domains. Thereby, c-di-GMP links environmental stimuli to an adaptive answer of the bacterial cell. However, little is known about the molecular details of the c-di-GMP signaling network. Up to date, only few types of c-di-GMP effector molecules are known. Among them are PilZ domain proteins and proteins containing a RXXD motif, which was first identified as an allosteric site of product feedback inhibition (I-site) in many diguanylate cyclases. The aim of our work is the identification and characterization of c-di-GMP binding proteins in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By using c-di-GMP coupled sepharose we have isolated PAO1 c-di-GMP binding proteins which were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Seven putative candidates have been identified, among others one protein with a PilZ domain and one containing a degenerated GGDEF-motif and the I-site motif RXXD. One further identified protein is a GGDEF-EAL domain protein that is currently over-expressed and purified to test the enzyme activity in vitro. In addition, the phenotype of the corresponding mutant is analyzed in order to reveal the cellular function of this protein.",

In the closely related Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N.g.), FarR is responsible for bacterial resistance to long-chained fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, enabling N.g. to survive on mucosal surfaces rich of those harmful components. Though the meningococcal FarR-homologue shows high structural accordance, experiments with \u01fbfarR-mutants illustrated that meningococcal resistance to fatty acids is not dependent on FarR-regulated mechanisms. We analysed the growth behaviour of N.m. MC58, capsule knockout MC58\u01fbsiaD, MC58\u01fbfarR and the complemented mutant strain and performed western blot analysis with whole cell lysates. We observed similar growth behaviour and a significantly higher expression of FarR in the late exponential phase. The level of PorA, which is a continuously expressed protein, was determined for comparison. One of the properties of FarR in N.m. is the direct binding to the promoter region of both the adhesin nadA and the farAB-encoded efflux pump. Based on these results, we generated a minimal binding sequence and screened the MC58 genome for possible binding patterns. To ascertain whether these genes are under the direct control of FarR, we accomplished EMSAs (Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays). However, no further direct protein-DNA-interactions were observed, leading to the conclusion that the binding of FarR to its regulatory sites is a very specific process. In summary we can say that FarR in N.m. is a growth phase dependent transcriptional regulator. It is not responsible for fatty acid resistance as it is in N.g., but has gained control over other genes, which are regulated very specifically.",

This research therefore aimed to describe an ABU strain collection in terms of virulence traits, colonization mechanisms and host interactions through genotypic and phenotypic experiments. This study revealed that the majority of ABU isolates belong to major phylogenetic lineages B2 and D and carry many virulence-associated genes of uropathogenic E. coli. Some strains, however, resemble commensal E. coli. This suggests that the majority of ABU strains evolved from former pathogenic variants and lost the ability to induce a significant mucosal immune response. Nevertheless, a considerable fraction of ABU isolates represents nonpathogenic commensal E. coli. Thus, alternative bacterial colonization strategies and differences in host susceptibility seem to exist that enable these variants to efficiently colonize the bladder without symptoms. Although many ABU isolates carry genes coding for virulence traits that contribute to symptomatic infection they do not trigger host response. They lost the ability to functionally express these virulence-associated genes due to genomic deletions, point mutations and DNA rearrangements.",

Wessler 1 1 Junior Research Group 3, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany 2 Institute of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany The gastric epithelium represents an important barrier against pathogens. One architectural key player is the E-cadherin-mediated adherence junction, responsible for epithelial strength. Adherence junctions connect the actin cytoskeleton of neighbouring epithelial cells via homophilic interactions of transmembrane protein E-cadherin. However, Helicobacter pylori (Hp) has developed strategies to destroy the epithelial barrier, which can support gastritis, ulceration, lymphoma and gastric cancer. However, the detailed mechanism of epithelial layer disruption is not well understood. In our experiments we demonstrated that an infection with Hp induced a drastic loss of E-cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion of infected cells. Further, we detected the Hp-mediated inhibition of intercellular adhesion in aggregation assays using polarized MKN-28 cells. These findings were further underlined by the determination of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), monitoring decreased epithelial barrier functions of Hp-infected cells. Within 24 hours post-infection, we observed a statistically significant decrease of TER, which was strongly declined after 46 hours infection with Hp. Functionally, we detected shedding of the E-cadherin ectodomain into the supernatant of infected cells in Western blot analyses, which led to the disruption of intercellular adhesion. In fact, we observed Hp entering the intercellular space of MKN-28 cells in confocal microscopy studies. In summary, we conclude that E-cadherin cleavage is an important step in the Hp pathogenesis allowing Hp to pass the epithelial layer and to reach a new niche in the gastric tract.",

As the inclusion membrane defines the interface between pathogen and host cell during intracellular replication, it is critical to learn more about the composition of the inclusion membrane and ist formation during chlamydial growth in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of early Cpn infection. We therefore developed a novel technique to investigate direct protein interactions between chlamydiae and host cells. Recently, a novel technique for the isolation of endocytic vesicles containing magnetically labeled receptor-ligand complexes was reported. Key characteristics of this technique are gentle mechanical homogenization of the plasma membrane, followed by a magnetic separation of labelled organelles, which subsequently allows the biochemical detection of compartment-containing proteins. We now adapted this method to analyze direct protein-protein interactions in Cpn-infected host cells. Using FACS analysis, we could show that Cpn were successfully labeled with a biotinylated lipid. Further, efficient infection in epithelial cells was investigated by confocal microscopy. Co-localization of chlamydial LPS and lipid-labeled Cpn were confirmed 3h p.i.. In a first attempt to seperate \"chlamydial\" from \"cytoplasmic\" fractions by using streptavidin magnetic beads, we were able to isolate labeled Cpn by using a magnetic chamber 3h p.i. Rab5 as an early endosomal marker could be detected strongly in the magnetic \"chlamydial\" fraction but not in the non-magnetic \"cytoplasmic\" fraction. In conclusion, our data indicate that chlamydial-host interactions can be appropriately analyzed by use of the novel \"Immunomagnetic Chlamydia isolation method\".

A further analysis of the membrane microdomains, particularly of their characteristic GSL constituents, will help us to better understand the initial Stx-receptor-interaction and the molecular mechanisms that may underly Stx-mediated endothelial cell injury. Type IV pili are filamentous appendages that can be found in a large number of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, where they play important roles in processes such as microcolony formation, adherence to eukaryotic cells, biofilm formation and DNA uptake. So far, type IV pili have not been described in the human enteropathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. Previously, we identified the transmembrane transcriptional regulator PypB that controls the expression of the virulence-associated HreP protease in Y. enterocolitica. The pypB gene is located directly upstream of the flp/tad operon coding for type-IV pili mediating tight adherence in other bacteria. We could show that PypB induces the transcription of the flp operon responsible for type IV-like pilus production. A regulator located directly upstream of the flp/tad operon is specific for Y. enterocolitica, as in other bacteria harboring this operon a similar regulator could not be detected. Using RT-PCR, we could show that the genes composing the flp operon are arranged as one transcriptional unit including pypB. Northern blot analysis together with flp-lacZ transcriptional fusions identified an additional promotor upstream of flp and indicate the presence of a transcriptional terminator directly downstream of flp. To study pili biosynthesis, we used Western Blot analysis and were able to proof Flp expression after PypB overproduction in whole cell extracts and detected processed Flp in supernatants. PypB overproduction also leads to a flp-dependent microcolony formation and type IV pili production. However, detection of pili by electron microscopy is difficult, which might correspond with a varied mature Flp N-terminus in Y. enterocolitica compared to pili in other bacteria. Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) cause diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis in humans, sometimes followed by potentially fatal complications like neurologic damage and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Stx is produced in the intestine, but causes vascular damage in specific target tissues such as brain and kidney, resulting in systemic complications. The way Stx enters the circulation and is transported from the gut to the target organs is not clarified yet. Stx binding and transport through the circulation by blood cells is currently discussed. Therefore, we investigated the expression of the Stx glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptors globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer) and globotetraosylceramide (Gb4Cer) on four leukocyte-derived cell lines, representing monocytes, granulocytes, T and B lymphocytes. Stx-receptors were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and immunodetection. Subsequently sensitivity towards Stx was investigated using a commercially available cytotoxicity assay. The monocytic cell line expressed both Gb3Cer and Gb4Cer, and presence of Gb3Cer but lack of Gb4Cer were characteristic features of the B cell descendant. Importantly, T cell and granulocyte descendants lacked any globo-series GSLs. Results of the cytotoxicity assay were consistent with these findings: viability of both the monocytic cell line and the B cell descendant were decreased after treatment with Stx, whereas the granulocyte and T cell lines remained resistant upon Stx exposure. Due to the lack of Stx-receptors Gb3Cer and Gb4Cer in the granulocyte-and T cell derived cell lines, it seems rather unlikely that granulocytes or T cells could act as \"transporters\" of Stx to target endothelial cells of the human vasculature.

The interaction of S. aureus fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs) with \u012e5\u02151 integrins seems to represent the predominant S. aureus internalization mechanism by non-professional phagocytes. However, S. aureus strains lacking functional FnBPs are still internalized to a certain degree.

By means of ELISA-based adherence assays, we observed that recombinant Atl very efficiently binds to immobilized human fibronectin (Fn) and EA.hy 926 cells. Furthermore, it is sufficient to inhibit S. aureus internalization by EA.hy 926 cells by 24,3% \u00b1 5,6% in a dose-dependent manner, as revealed by flow cytometry.

Surface-localized Hsc70 has been shown to be involved in virus cell entry, virus tissue-spreading, as well as Brucella abortus internalization. Preincubation of EA.hy 926 cells with an antibody raised against Hsc70 leads to a reduction of S. aureus internalization by 17% \u00b1 6,4%, whereas S. aureus adhesion to the cells is not affected.

SA is the leading cause of superficial and deep skin infections, and is frequently associated with non-healing wounds. The initial attachment of SA to the skin is mediated by a number of wall-bound adhesins as well as secreted proteins of the \"secretable expanded repertoire adhesive molecules\" (SERAM) family including the \"extracellular adherence protein\" (EAP). EAP has been shown to exhibit a particularly broad spectrum of activities including immunomodulating and antiangiogenic functions by interfering with the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Recent observations demonstrate that EAP is internalized by endothelial cells, and mediates uptake of SA. In order to find out whether EAP has similar effects on skin cells, we investigated ist impact on ERK-phosphorylation and SA internalization in keratinocytes. We observed that extracellular EAP is effectively internalized by HaCaT keratinocytes. Cell fractionations and proteinase protection assays indicate that upon release from endosomal compartments the protein is localized freely within the cytosol. Moreover, incubation of HaCaT cells with EAP suppresses the growth factor stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MEK1/2, indicating that EAP might interfere with proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes. Interestingly, preincubation of HaCaT cells with EAP was found to substantially increase the internalization of S. aureus into keratinocytes, signaling that extracellular Eap might promote spreading of the pathogen within the host. In conclusion, these findings of EAP uptake by keratinocytes in conjunction with ist proved effect on epithelial cell signaling and internalization of SA provides new aspects on pathomechanisms intimately involved in the etiology of SA dermal infection. EAP targeted interventions may therefore provide novel avenues for prevention or treatment of staphylococcal skin disease.",

This lysinylation is mediated by MprF (Peschel et al., J. Exp.Med, 2001) , a transmembrane protein predicted to consist of 14 transmembrane helices and a C-terminal cytosolic part. Inactivation of mprF results in the loss of lysylphosphatidylglycerol (L-PG), increased inactivation by CAMPproducing neutrophils (Kristian et al, Infection and Immunity, 2003) , and attenuated virulence. The production of L-PG is dependent on phosphatidylglycerol and lysyl-tRNA (Staubitz et al, FEMS, 2004 ) but the precise mechanism of L-PG biosynthesis is unknown. By analyzing strains expressing MprF truncations and point mutations in highly conserved amino acids, we show that MprF is a bifunctional protein consisting of a synthase domain mediating phospholipid lysinylation and a flippase domain conferring antimicrobial peptide resistance, as well as daptomycin resistance. The analysis of these and other variants of MprF might lead to new insights in the mechanism of L-PG synthesis and transport to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane and could also be helpful for understanding daptomycin resistance. Ultimately, the characterization of MprF may help find inhibitors of MprF, which would render a great number of bacterial pathogens susceptible to human host defenses and could help combat multiple resistant, L-PG producing bacteria such as S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. Detailed studies have shown that intermediate resistance to vancomycin is caused by the accumulation of mutations, each of which confers an incremental increase in resistance. Interestingly, the presence of antibiotics themselves seems to create an environmental stress for the bacteria, that may lead to an induction of mutational mechanisms, e. g. the bacterial SOS response. In E. coli the induction of the SOS response by cell wall inhibitors has been demonstrated and is known to trigger delocalisation of IS elements and to favour expression of error-prone polymerases. We have studied the resistance mechanisms of an intermediately vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VISA) strain pair. In the strain that displays higher resistance, a part of the decreased susceptibility to vancomycin is caused by insertion of IS256 into the gene tcaA. In order to test whether the presence of antibiotics leads to the mobilisation of IS elements in S. aureus, a test system that measures the transposition frequency of IS256 is employed [1]. This system comprises an IS256 element that is tagged with an erythromycin marker (IS256r). Treatment with subinhibitory concentrations of clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and vancomycin) resulted in an up to 6-fold increased transposition frequency of IS256r in S. aureus RN1-HG (restored rsbU) in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Currently, the transposition frequency of IS256 in a rsbU-mutant strain strain, that shows lower SigmaB activity is under investigation. In conclusion, there seems to be a correlation between antibiotic stress and mobilisation of IS256. ",

Further work is ongoing to analyze the underlying mechanisms, and particularly the role of sae, in close detail. Pathogenic bacteria of the genus Yersinia modulate cell functions by translocating six effector proteins (YopH, -O, -P, -E, -M and -T) into host cells via a type III secretion system. Here we assessed the effect of each individual Yop on migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) employing modular built Yersinia monosecretion mutants. We found that each single Yop inhibited endothelial cell migration to a significant degree as determined by reduction of the velocity and covered distance of the infected cells. Consequently, fully virulent Yersinia translocating all Yops highly effectively blocked endothelial cell migration at low bacteria to cell ratios (approximately 10 bacteria per cell). Whereas the effects of the Rho GTPase modulating YopE, and -T and the tyrosine phosphatase YopH was expected, the effects of YopM and YopP on cell migration were surprising. In order to independently confirm their activity, recombinant YopM and YopP protein was microinjected into cells. Furthermore, to obtain an activity profile of each Yop we determined the expression values of three specific actin structures (microspikes, lamellopodia and stress fibres) in infected and uninfected cells 10 min and 2 h after initiation of migration, giving rise to six parameters. Each Yop displayed a specific activity profile, whereby YopE, -T and -H had strong effects on many ( 4) parameters and YopO, -M and -P had moderate effects on some ( 3) parameters. Finally, although they clearly modulated cell migration and at least some actin reorganisation, YopM and YopP (in contrast to YopE, -T, -H) did not inhibit phagocytosis of Yersinia, excluding general effects on the cytoskeleton. It can be concluded that all Yops influence cell migration on 2-dimensional substrates by potentially different mechanisms. The cooperation of Yops on the molecular level which causes an extremely effective block in cell migration needs to elaborated in future studies.",

Sakinc 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene und Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the only species of the staphylococci that is uropathogenic. The genome of S. saprophyticus is the only one of all sequenced staphylococci which posseses a D-serine deaminase, an enzyme which converts D-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. The amino acid D-serine is present in relatively high concentrations in human urine and is toxic or bacteriostatic to several non-uropathogenic bacteria. That means, the uncommon ability to degrade D-serine may play an important role for the virulence of uropathogens. It was shown that S. saprophyticus grows in media supplemented with D-serine whereas other staphylococci, lacking the gene for the D-serine deaminase, like S. aureus, S. epiderminis or S. carnosus, do not. To test the wild type and a dsdA-knock-out-mutant generated by allelic replacement in co-culture experiments we introduced a tet plasmid into the wild type to allow for positive selection of this strain. The wild type, the specific dsdA mutant and the complemented mutant were tested in co-cultures with equal cell densities (inoculation 103 cfu/ml) in the presence and absence of D-serine (2,5-10 mg/ml). Every 24 hours (approximately 20 generations) the mixed populations were diluted 1:100 into fresh media. Growth was checked by cfu every 48 hours (approximately 40 generations). Experiments proceeded for at least two weeks (about 280 generations). In addition, generation times were determined for the 3 strains. In the absence of D-serine the mutant outcompetes the wild type, whereas in the presence of D-serine the wild type had an advantage compared to the mutant. This effect is specific for D-serine, when L-serine is used the mutant outcompetes the wild type again. These experiments indicate that the D-serine deaminase confers a growth advantage in the presence of Dserine whereas in its absence the mutant had an advantage.",

Sakinc 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Hygiene und Mikrobiologie, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a gram positive and coagulase-negative pathogenic staphylococcus causing urinary tract infections in young women. It is hydrophobic, able to bind fibronectin, laminin and collagen and hemagglutinates sheep erythrocytes. Some of its surface proteins have been characterised in the early past. The serine-aspartate repeat protein I (SdrI), contains the longest SD repeat region described so far (854 aa) and a LPXTGmotif for cell wall anchoring. It is a member of the MSCRAMM protein family and shows a typical ABB domain structure. SdrI is believed to mediate collagen binding and hydrophobicity, because a sdrI knock out mutant showed decreased collagen binding and reduced hydrophobicity. Cell surface hydrophobicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of S. saprophyticus infections. To localize the domains responsible for collagen binding and hydrophobicity within SdrI we complemented the knock out mutant with different constructs of SdrI lacking either the A domain, the B domain, the N domain or the SD domain. The complemented strains of S. saprophyticus have already been tested using an ELISA with collagen type I-coated microtiter plates and still showed collagen binding comparable to the wildtype, except for the SD mutant. It is therefore necessary to conduct further tests for collagen binding with the recombinant which contains only the SD region since our preliminary results indicate that ths SD repeat region is involved in binding to collagen. This would be the first describtion of an involvement of binding of the SD repeat region of a Sdr protein. Recently, we have found that S. aureus \u012e-toxin can be internalized by target cells, and that this is likely to be an important step to cellular survival of membrane-perforation. Here we have focused on the fate of internalized toxin. Fluorescence microscopy at various time points after toxin internalization revealed that \u012e-toxin slowly disappears from cells. By using internally labelled \u012e-toxin, it was demonstrated that pore-complexes and a fraction of monomers/unstable oligomers were returned by target cells to the extracellular environment. Density gradient centrifugation followed by immune electron microscopy, mass spectroscopy and Western-blot analyses led to the conclusion that \u012e-toxin is regurgitated in the context of exosomal-like structures, which we term toxosomes. To our knowledge, this is the first account of disposal by target cells of a bacterial toxin by sequential uptake and exocytosis. Objective: We previously have shown that in Staphylococcus aureus (SA) latestationary growth and survival critically depends on ClpC, a major molecular chaperone, and that ClpC provides a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-mediated profound effect on global gene and protein expression patterns (Chatterjee et al., Proteomics 2009) . A reduced TCA cycle activity is evidenced in the thymidine-dependent small colony variants by elevated acetate levels in the medium due to loss of acetate consumption (Chatterjee et al., J. Bacteriol. 2007) . We now hypothesize that acetic acid metabolism in clinical staphylococcal isolates may accompany late stationary survival and persistence patterns. Methods: A phenol-red dye-based screening O/N cultures for acetate utilization was performed. Select strains were further characterized for viability as well as stationary growth, acetate, and gene-expression profiling. Results: We screened 873 staphylococcal clinical isolates. While >99% SA isolates displayed high pH (indicating regular acetate consumption), within the group of the CoNS, a substantial proportion of low pH and elevated acetateassociated Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) isolates (21%) were observed. These strains displayed reduced growth and viability. Conclusions: Non acetate-catabolizing clinical strains are frequent in SE indicating a large proportion of SE with impaired TCA cycle and prolonged survival. This finding has potential major implications for our understanding of staphylococcal persistent infection. The oral cavity with its aerobic area and anaerobic niches, constant temperature and wet conditions represents a perfect habitat for a multitude of bacterial species growing in biofilm structures. Beside the physiological flora these biofilms contain several pathogens responsible for chronic inflammatory diseases. The major goal of this project is to elucidate the complexity of cohabitating in such biofilms. We selected S. mutans, S. mitis, S. intermedius, S. sanguinis, S. salivarius, P. micra, P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans representing an assortment of oral streptococci and anaerobic oral pathogens. To study the architecture of mixed species biofilms by CLSM and to determine the actual bacterial numbers by FACS analysis we recently constructed fluorescence protein expression vectors inserted into our investigated bacteria.",

In a time laps movie we could show the growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans pAT18-PrecA-DsRM with a stable red fluorescence over time. Another approach of our study is the elucidation of quorum sensing via AI-2 in such biofilms. For this task luxS-mutants are currently under construction. With those mutants we will clarify the interspecies communication by AI-2 and its connection to the development of multi-species biofilms, as our studies revealed a growth phase and species dependent AI-2 release. This might correlate with our findings in transwell analysis, where we could show a changed biofilm mass for several bacteria under S. mitis. To obtain new luxSmutants, we successfully sequenced the luxS-region of S. mitis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius. The complete setup will allow us to study 3D structures and the temporal development of such oral biofilm communities. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a versatile and harmful pathogen in both hospital-and community-acquired infections. Intracellular persistence is an important strategy for immune escape of SA and chronic infections, however, adhesion and internalisation of SA may differ in various cell types and between SA strains. Assays addressing these phenomena tended to be cumbersome; for facilitated analysis, we here report on a new flow cytometric assay for analysis of SA adhesion and internalisation.",

            "text": "Results: FACS analysis yielded substantial differences of SA-GFP adherence and internalisation to HFF, EA.hy and CaCo2; however, differences were also found between low and high cell passages, especially for primary cells. Elevated adherence values were always associated with augmented internalisation rates, suggesting that adherence is the crucial step for subsequent internalisation. Prolonged incubation times (7 days) in the presence of gentamicin (100 \u021dg/ml) demonstrated time-dependent SA elimination; however, intracellular long-term persisters were detected in all cell types analysed thus far. Conclusion: A novel FACS assay proved SA adhesion and internalization to depend on the type of the non-professional phagocyte investigated. This method will allow to investigate the impact of specific SA factors on adhesion and internalization by use of mutant libraries. Introduction: The ROS mediated carbonylation of proteins is indicative for protein \"ageing\" as known from bacterial species other than Staphylococcus aureus (SA). Moreover, in Escherichia coli carbonylated proteins (CP) are thought to be detectable only in a degradation-resistant aggregate state. In SA we have shown that late-stationary growth and survival critically depends on the chaperone ClpC which provides a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-mediated profound effect on global gene and protein expression (Chatterjee et al., Proteomics 2009 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that during the late-stationary growth in SA, protein carbonylation may also be modified as a function of ClpC (and TCA cycle) activity. Methods: For protein preparation, SA cells were harvested at 2 h and 72 h. Protein carbonylation assay was monitored using the (carbonylation-indicating) 2,4-dinitrophenol hydrazone (DNP) method. The assay was coupled with proteomics analysis to identify specific CP using LC nano-ESI MS/MS. Results: In contrast to E. coli, exponentially (2 h) and late-phase (72 h) grown SA contained mainly soluble CP. Furthermore, carbonyl contents in both strains increased with time of culture. Interestingly, a clpC mutant exhibited a lower level of carbonyl content compared to WT albeit similar amounts of total aggregate protein. In addition, 1-D and 2-D gel electrophoresis indicated difference in carbonylation (higher in WT and lower in clpC mutant) with specific CP bands detected only in the clpC mutant. Proteomic analysis confirmed one major CP to be Mqo2 an important TCA-cycle enzyme.",

            "text": "Conclusion: This is the first study confirming that ClpC ATPase is specifically involved in SA oxidative carbonylation regulation and protein quality control, and that ClpC may be a key element for staphylococcal senescence, particularly during prolonged times of bacterial life such as encountered in sessile and/or persistent staphylococcal populations. First shown for Streptomyces coelicolor, Rex senses the redox state of cells via binding of NADH or NAD + resulting in activation/repression of this regulator leading to a changed expression profile of genes involved in respiration and virulence. While a site-directed mutation of the hemB gene in Staphylococcus aureus has been shown to result in an electron-deficient mutant displaying the small-colony variant (SCV) phenotype, only limited data are available on the significance of Rex in S. aureus. Therefore, a rex (AK1) and a rex hemB double mutant were constructed in an S. aureus SH1000 background. We characterized the strains in a phenotypic and transcritpomic approach as well as in a murine abscess model. Both mutants showed no haemolysis and pigmentation on blood agar compared to the parent strain. AK1 significantly differed in expression of 170 genes compared to SH1000, with 125 genes being significantly down-and 45 genes being upregulated. Two important global regulators of virulence, agr and SarA, were found to be significantly downregulated in AK1, resulting in a decreased expression of virulence factors including fibronectin-binding proteins A and B, and extracellular proteases. In contrast, the repressor of toxins, Rot, was found to be slightly upregulated in AK1. Only the double mutant showed a slight downregulation of agr. Lesions in the abscess model evoked by SH1000 or AK1 differed significantly in appearance and size. In conclusion, a profound interaction between the regulation of anaerobic genes and virulence regulators such as agr and SarA was observed. In addition, changes in the ability to coordinate the regulation of switching from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism also impaired the ability of the rex mutant to form abscesses in a murine model. Finally, the deletion of rex in S. aureus attenuates virulence and might represent a therapeutical target. In vitro infection studies are traditionally conducted with cell culture monolayers (two dimensional systems). Infection is simulated by challenging these systems with the respective pathogenic microorganisms. A limitation of this model is the restricted dimensionality which contrasts a three dimensional (3D) host tissue environment. Differences in overall cell morphology, mode of migration or adhesion as a result of 3D conditions have been published for various eukaryotic cell types. Using similar conditions, it has been shown that Yersinia enterocolitica as a prototype of an extracellularly replicating pathogen exhibits unique growth behaviour in 3D collagen gels, resembling in vivo colony formation in infected tissues. Thus, establishment of a 3D model for infection studies will shed new light on the interpretation of insights obtained from 2D models. We set up a highly flexible model for analysis of infectious processes in a three dimensional collagen gel. It allows for dynamic imaging of interactions of pathogenic bacteria with eukaryotic cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy. This model can be adapted to diverse cell sources providing professional phagocytes (cell lines, leukocytes isolated from the blood, precision-cut tissue slices) and even serves to live cell imaging of infected tissue from the spleen, liver or intestine. Preliminary studies were performed using diverse Y. enterocolitica, E. coli and S. aureus strains. The role of Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) and adhesins in infectious key events could be successfully visualised. Here we present first results on the contribution of different growth states of Y. enterocolitica to phagocytosis, migratory behaviour and cell death of primary immune cells. Taken together, this model is a valuable tool for revealing cellular processes in the course of interactions of immune cells with bacterial colonies. Pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a major virulence factor and adhesin of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) interacting with the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR). We have recently shown that the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, PI3K, and Akt play critical roles in pIgR-mediated pneumococcal uptake. Here, we studied the relationship of pneumococcal ingestion by host cells via the PspC-initiated mechanism and intracellular calcium signalling. Calcium ions (Ca 2+ ), which are present in high concentrations in lung fluids, play a major role in maintaining host cell homeostasis. The levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2+ ]i) was measured by loading the pIgR-expressing epithelial cells with Indo-AM dye followed by incubation with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed pneumococci during the recovery phase. Incubation with PFA-fixed wild-type but not PspC-deficient pneumococci significantly increased [Ca 2+ ]i in host cells. This PspC-pIgR mediated increase in [Ca 2+ ]i was independent of phospholipase C as pre-treatment of cells with U73122 (a phospholipase Cinhibitor) did not affect the increase in [Ca 2+ ]i. The use of additional pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that high intracellular calcium levels negatively regulate pneumococcal ingestion by host cells. Pre-treatment of epithelial cells with BAPTA-AM, a cell permeable calcium chelator, or EGTA, a Ca 2+ -chelating agent, significantly increased pneumococcal uptake by epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, host cells pre-treated with thapsigargin, which increases [Ca 2+ ]i by inhibiting the -Ca 2+ -ATPase in the ER-membrane, demonstrated a significant reduction in uptake. Importantly, all the used inhibitors did not alter the adherence of pneumococci to host cells. Taken together, these data suggest a putative defense mechanism employed by host cells by increasing their intracellular calcium levels in response to pneumococcal infections. As an important human pathogen, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) can cause a spectrum of food-borne intestinal diseases ranging from watery diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis. In 5 -15% of the cases infection is followed by the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Similar to a number of enteric bacteria, EHEC translocate effector proteins into host cells via a type III secretion system (TTSS). Both, effector proteins and TTSS, are encoded on a pathogenicity island, termed the \"locus of enterocyte effacement\" (LEE) and are essential for the characteristic attaching and effacing lesions on the intestinal mucosa during EHEC infection. Additionally, a large number of non-LEE encoded type III effectors have been identified. One of these is NleA (non-LEE encoded effector A),encoded on cryptic or inducible prophages and widely distributed among pathogenic E. coli. The aim of this study was to characterize the regulation of the phage-encoded nleA-variant nleA4795 in EHEC O84:H4 strain 4795/97. In order to visualize the activity of the nleA-promoter, we replaced the gene nleA4795 with a luciferase (luc) reporter by site-directed mutagenesis. Based on the resulting mutant 4795/95\u01fbnleA::luc, we constructed deletion mutants, lacking genes for proteins with possible regulatory function in the expression of nleA. Thereby, we found a significant decrease in nleA-expression in mutants with deletions in the ler and grlA genes. In contrast, a significant increase in nleA-expression was shown by complementation of the deletion mutants with the respective wildtype genes. To analyze the mode of regulation by Ler and other regulators, gelshift assays were established to show the direct binding to the promoter region of nleA. In summary, the results obtained in this study support our thesis that nleA4795 is integrated into the Ler-mediated regulatory circuit of type III effector genes. ",

S. mutans has been shown to bind human plasminogen via surface-bound enolase. The benefits to S. mutans of binding host plasminogen were investigated by quantifying host protein degradation and fibrin dissolution by activated host plasmin. Bound to the bacterial surface, plasmin promotes the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibrinogen and fibronectin as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis. Surface associated plasmin in S. mutans, moreover, efficiently degrades in vitro generated fibrin aggregates significantly enhancing bacterial transmigration through a fibrin matrix as studied in a two chamber infection model.

In our project we study the dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus infections by using non-invasive in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques at very high field. These MRI methods allow for (1) the identification and characterization of inflammation [1], and (2) the monitoring of staphylococcal infections in animals in a longitudinal fashion, by providing full 3-dimensional data sets with high spatial resolution and with excellent soft tissue contrast. For our first investigations we have established a muscle abscess mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus, since the local infection with high bacterial numbers was optimal for our MRI protocol optimization. For the visualization of the localization and size of infection we established T2-parameter MRI, since T2 is rather sensitive to early tissue changes caused by infection. With this approach we were able to detect oedema formation even at the very early stages of infection. In addition, we have developed a new imaging platform, 19 F-MRI, which shows the potential for a \"background-free\" identification and imaging of the immune cells involved in the inflammation process [2] . 19 F-MRI is performed by in vivo labeling the immune cells with perfluorinated carbons (PFC) by exploiting the mechanism of phagocytosis, and tracking the cells hosting and migration via 19 F MRI. With this approach we were able to detect the accumulation of 19 F MR signal at the side of infection, which supports strong evidence for macrophage activity. In summary, even at this very early stage of development it seems that MRI has the potential (1) to provide new insights into the processes of host-pathogen interaction and (2) to deliver important information for the evaluation of future anti-infective agents.",

In search for novel Legionella virulence factors, we employed a new screening technique allowing fast screening of several thousand clones of a transposon mutagenized Legionella library. Thereby we isolated a clone harbouring a resistance cassette within the bdhA/patD operon. By analyzing the locus genetically and functionally, we recognized ist role in Legionella lipid metabolism and virulence towards amoebae and macrophages (Aurass et al., 2009) . The operon encodes two enzymes, one shows homology to the Sinorhizobium meliloti 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) dehydrogenase BdhA, the other is PatD, a patatin-like phospholipase (PLP) family protein. We present data showing that L. pneumophila BdhA possesses 3-HB dehydrogenase activity. Lipid granule staining and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments further showed that bdhA/patD knock out mutants contain increased amounts of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules and therefore the operon is involved in utilization of the storage compound. Remarkably, L. pneumophila Philadelphia-1 bdhA/patD mutants infected A. castellanii amoebae and U937 macrophages unefficiently and showed a dramatically reduced replication in the host cell models. We conclude that the bdhA/patD operon is important for L. pneumophila virulence and show for the first time a direct link between lipid metabolism and virulence of L. pneumophila.",

Since YadA allows invasion in invasin mutant strains and BadA mediates adherence to extracellular matrix proteins. We wanted to know whether SadA is expressed and functional in S. Typhimurium. and what might be the effect of SadA overexpression. To address these questions, mutants and reporter strains were constructed from S. Typhimurium NCTC 12023: Luciferase reporter fusions for STM3690-sadA and sadA were made as previously published and expression kinetics were recorded in wild-type (WT) background as well as in strains deficient for ompR, hilA, sirA and rpoS. In order to overexpress sadA, the putative promoter was substituted for the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 4 (SPI4)-or invFpromoters by recombination in a SPI4 mutant strain. The resulting strains were analyzed through western blot (WB) and immuno-fluorescence (IF) microscopy using a SadA-polyclonal serum. Invasion assays were carried out as previously described in polarized MDCK, CaCo2 BBe1 and T84 cell lines.Expression analysis showed that the average expression of the STM3690-sadA luciferase fusion was 6.75 fold higher than the sadA::luc construct, suggesting that STM3690-STM3691 forms an operon. Compared with a luciferase fusion within SPI4 (siiE::luc), promoter activity of STM3690-sadA was still 142.32 fold lower in late logarithmic growth phase. Deletions in the mentioned regulator molecules resulted in 4.939-fold higher reporter activity compared to the WT background at 90 min in LB culture. Using the SPI4-or the invF-promoter for expression of sadA, a band of ~150 KDa was detected in WB which likely corresponds to the SadA monomer.Focal points at the bacterial surface could be detected in IF microscopy. These structures were not present in SPI4 background, SadA mutant or WT control strains. However, overexpression of SadA was not sufficient to compensate for a loss of SiiE in invasion assays. The inactivation of sadA resulted in a significant reduction of the ability to invade the cell lines.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that SadA is not expressed under similar conditions like SPI1 and SPI4. STM3690 encodes for a putative lipoprotein which could play a role during SadA secretion. It is still unclear why the SadA-overexpressing strains were non-invasive, in spite of the sadA mutant strain showing reduced invasion rates. One could interpret these results that SiiE could requires for initial contact and SadA could be requiered for later steps of the invasion process Background: The role of the pore-forming Staphylococcus aureus toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) in severe necrotizing diseases is clouded due to conflicting data from epidemiological studies of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections and murine diseasemodels. Methods: Here, we used neutrophils from different species to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of PVL in comparison to other staphylococcal cytolytic components. Furthermore, we studied the impact of PVL production by expressing PVL heterologously in a non-virulent staphylococcal species and by applying clinical isolates, including the strain USA300 and its PVL-negative mutant. Findings: We demonstrate that PVL induces rapid activation and cytolysis in human and rabbit neutrophils, but not in murine or simian cells. By contrast, the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), a newly identified group of cytolytic staphylococcal components, lack species-specificity. The production of PVL by staphylococcal strains causes rapid and premature cell death in human neutrophils, which is different from the physiological (and programmed) cell death of neutrophils following phagocytosis and degradation of virulent bacteria. Interpretation: Taken together, our results query infection-models in mice and non-human primates to elucidate the impact of PVL. Our data clearly demonstrate that PVL has an important cytolytic role in susceptible species, including human neutrophils, which has major implications for the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA infections. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 strains expressing the \"virulenceassociated\" epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody MAb 3/1 of the \"Dresden Panel\" have a high endemic relevance for Legionnaire's disease. In its airborne transmission cooling towers and showers are involved. Large bacterial clusters that are growing or packed inside protozoan host cells e.g. Acanthamoebae castellani are the matter of our study. Between five strains we explored distinctions in their complex LPS architecture using conventional and confocal laser scanning microscopy. We focussed primarily on differences between a 3/1-positive strain and 3/1-negative strains of four different serogroups. To characterize the used antibodies we investigated the growth-phasedependence of the examined LPS-epitopes by quantitative ELISA. For four of ten LPS-epitopes in three different strains we found a significant growth-phase dependent change of LPS-density on bacterial surfaces. According to our aims we did not find any differences. All examined strains were able to build \"large particles\" that had a complex spherical LPSarchitecture. Furthermore we observed large bacterial particles with this particular LPS-structure appearing inside of cyst-forming amoebae that have not been described before. Different LPS-types on bacterial surfaces seem to have various functions. Among the used strains there were no indices for differences in quantity or quality of the formed \"large particles\". Therefore, we suggest the ability to form clusters does not account for high infectious potency of 3/1-positive strains. Maybe high hydrophobic properties of MAb 3/1 recognized epitopes enhance airborne transmission. We assume that \"large clusters\" packed into encysted natural host cells have a very high biocide resistance. Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) represent a slow-growing subpopulation frequently involved in chronic infections. Recently, non-proteincoding RNAs (npcRNAs) have been found to act as key regulatory players in response to environmental changes. So far, only few npcRNAs have been identified in staphylococci and those were detected mostly by computational based approaches. Since growth rate-specific expression was observed for bacterial npcRNAs, identification of npcRNA candidates was performed applying total S. aureus RNA isolated from different growth phases of an isogenic clinical strain pair displaying the normal and the SCV phenotype. Two separate cDNA libraries were constructed. A total of 10,000 cDNA clones were randomly sequenced and analysed by BLASTN database search. The expression of 33 novel npcRNAs was experimentally validated and confirmed by Northern blot analyses. S. aureus phenotype-specific expression of four npcRNAs was found: Three of the identified novel npcRNAs were specifically expressed only in the normal phenotype. One of these npcRNA candidates originated from the antisense strand of the alkaline phosphatase precursor III (PhoB) encoding gene involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism. One small npcRNA candidate, originated from the antisense strand of the open reading frame of a hypothetical protein-coding gene, was shown to be specifically expressed in the SCV phenotype. Most of the novel npcRNAs were growth phase-specific regulated in SCVs with the majority being downregulated at the late growth phase. For the first time, a classification of npcRNAs based on their differential expression between the normal and the SCV phenotype of S. aureus was established. Thus, a role of npcRNAs might be assumed in the regulation of the divergent phenotype-associated behaviour and metabolism of S. aureus. The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila has a very complex life style. After uptake by natural host cells or monocytes followed by the \"pregnant pause\" inside the phagosomes the transmissive, infective phenotype switches to the replicative, non-infective type. After several multiplication steps bacteria are motile again, lyse the host cells and are able to start the next infection cycle. Responsible genomic elements were described almost in detail. The aim of our study was to investigate, if deletion mutants of regulatory elements differ in their LPS expression compared to the wild type. For this we have tested strain Lp02 and its csrA-, flaA-, fliA-, letA-, milX-, and rpoS-mutant. Strains were cultivated in liquid media until exponential or post-exponential growth phase representing the replicative, non-infective phase and the transmissible, infectious phase inside host cells, respectively. Cell-wall bound and shed LPS were tested by ELISA for quantification of six different LPSepitopes. The expression of the serogroup 1-specific epitope recognized by MAb 8/5 as well as the MAb 88/3-epitope are not influenced in any mutant, neither as cellwall bound nor as shed LPS. Phase variability is also not valid. It is to assume that these structures are essential for the bacteria. LPS carrying the epitopes of MAbs 3/1, 8/4, 12/2 and 88/1 were phase variably expressed. With exception of MAb 3/1-positive LPS all other components were not shed, which demonstrates their failed influence on modulation of the early host cell phagosomes. Nevertheless, MAb 8/4-epitope is over-expressed in the post-exponential growth phase. The \"virulence-associated\" MAb 3/1-epitope is phase variably expressed and shed. Compared to the wild type, the concentration of this LPS is up to fivefold higher in the released LPS fractions. Taken together, LPS expression is influenced by known regulatory genes and its favourites the Legionella-LPS as a co-factor of virulence development. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen of endovascular diseases, which can take an acute and destructive course and/or develop in a chronic infection with a high relapsing rate. Despite good activity of the antimicrobial substances in vitro, these infections are often difficult to treat, which might be due to the complex infection process of endovascular tissue. In this work, we used endothelial cells to investigate the impact of different S. aureus strains, two highly virulent isolates (6850, ST239) and the laboratory strain Cowan I with a defect in the agr-system. All strains were equally invasive in endothelial cells and were found intracellularly, but they largely differed in their ability to induce inflammatory responses. Microarray analysis revealed that wild-type isolates 6850 and ST239 upregulated a huge number of genes including many genes involved in innate immunity. By contrast, Cowan I, which failed to express important virulence factors related to the agr-system, such as toxins and enzymes, did not induce these dramatic changes in endothelial gene expression. As agr-defective strains were commonly recovered during colonization and infection, this might represent a strategy of S. aureus to hide intracellularly without provoking the host immune system and resulting in relapsing infections.

The complex is composed of the essential integral outer membrane protein BamA (formerly YaeT/Omp85) and four accessory lipoproteins BamB-E; only BamA and BamD are essential. The Yersinia Adhesin A (YadA) is the prototype of a new class of non-fimbrial adhesins, the trimeric auotransporter adhesins, consisting of a head, stalk and a \u0215 barrel membrane anchor, and plays a major role in pathogenicity of the enteric pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. In order to investigate the role of BamA in biogenesis of TAA, we expressed YadA in a BamA-depleted strain of E. coli, which resulted in degradation of YadA indicating that BamA is essential for expression and biogenesis of YadA. As BamA was demonstrated to recognize the C-terminus of OMPs, we exchanged the nine most C-terminal amino acids of YadA by glycine using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of the position 1 (W422), 3 (I420) and 5 (F418) from the C-terminus of YadA resulted in YadA degradation in E. coli wildtype while degradation was rescued in an E. coli mutant strain deficient in DegP. Preparation of outer membrane fractions, trypsin degradation assays, immunofluorescence and autoagglutination studies demonstrated that in all YadA mutants assembly takes place in the outer membrane despite action of DegP, reduced BamA recognition and protein expression. We conclude that BamA is essential in the biogenesis of the YadA and recognizes hydrophobic residues especially at the positions 1 and 5, but also at position 3 of the YadA C-terminus; however, in TAAs obviously different recognition patterns for BamA exist compared with OMPs such as PhoE. In 2006 monophasic multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar 4,[5],12:i:-strains became a novel serotype in Germany associated with some large diffuse outbreaks and increased need for hospitalization. Congenerous strains were observed in outbreaks in Luxembourg, Austria and single cases in France, too. These 4,[5],12:i:-strains harbour Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2 and ST64B prophages and belong mainly to phage type DT193 according to the Anderson phage typing scheme. Finally the extensive similarity to the STM LT2 genome and the specific size of the fliA-fliB intergenic region based on the PCR method described by Echeita et. Al. 2001, prompted us to classify them as a monophasic variant of S. typhimurium. In 2008 this variant represented 43.4 % of all isolated S. typhimurium strains in Germany. Searching for genomic differences between monophasic 4,[5],12:i:-strains and the closely related biphasic S. typhimurium strain LT2 resulted in the detection of a novel 18.65 kb genomic island within the thrW t-RNA locus exhibiting a lower G+C content compared to the LT2 genome (47.4 % vs. 52.2 %). A multiplex PCR that discriminates between free, prophage occupied and island containing thrW locus revealed the presence of the island in 70 % of 262 tested 4,[5],12:i:strains. Sequence analysis identified 17 potential Open Reading Frames. Some of them show high DNA similarities to enterobacterial phage sequences and sequences from Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae and avian pathogenic E. coli. On the protein level several high similarities were found, too including integrases, putative membrane and DNA transfer proteins as well as a putative transcriptional activator of E. coli, furthermore a helicase domain, a 2polyprenylphenol-hydroxylase and a acetylcholine receptor subunit of Sh. dysenteriae, a phage injection protein of avian pathogenic E.coli and other phage related proteins. The biological function of this novel island with respect to virulence is under investigation.",

The expression of virulence factors is genetically linked to the expression of the flagellum in Legionella pneumophila. We showed that flagellin (FlaA) and the alternative sigma factor FliA are involved in invasion and replication of Legionella in host cells. We identified most of the yet known regulators and genes of the flagellar regulon. In silico analysis show high homology of all genes which are involved in the flagellar regulon between the known Legionella pneumophila strains and non-pneumophila strains. To get further insight into the regulation cascade at the level of gene and protein expression over time, we analyzed selected genes via Reverse Transcription-PCR and via Western Blotting. FliA is also involved in the expression of some virulence traits. In preliminary studies we analysed genes of the FliA regulon. In addition, we started to identify and to analyse regulators involved in the expression of fliA. By creating mutants of FliA-dependent genes and comparing with the fliA mutant phenotype more virulence factors are further analysed. Urinary tract infections (UTI) represent a major health problem in industrialized countries. The majority of community-acquired and nosocomial UTIs in humans are caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The crucial step for initiating a (persistent) infection requires attachment and colonization of microbes on a surface such as uroepithelial tissues or medical devices (e. g. catheters). Antigen 43 (Ag43), a surface-displayed autotransporter protein frequently expressed in non-pathogenic and pathogenic E. coli, has been described to mediate autoaggregation of bacterial cells and biofilm formation. However, in contrast to other virulence factors of (uro-)pathogenic E. coli, the role of Ag43 in pathogenesis is not well understood. Hence, we characterized different Ag43 variants of E. coli K-12, commensal, and UPEC isolates. We compared their structure, analyzed their transcriptional regulation, and studied their contribution to host-bacterium interaction. Multiple agn43 alleles can be frequently found in pathogenic E. coli. The nucleotide sequence and expression of these alleles may be variable. This indicates that the encoded proteins differ in their function. Ag43 contributes to adhesion to eukaryotic cells and components of the extracellular matrix and although many Ag43 variants of UPEC promote autoaggregation and biofilm formation, their role during (uro-) virulence still remains to be further elucidated. Facing iron-deficient conditions in the host bacteria have evolved a multifactorial strategy to scavenge effectively the growth limiting factor iron. The secretion of low -molecular-weight compounds, so called siderophores, able to bind ferric iron with highest affinity constitute a crucial virulence factor in host pathogen interaction. Since UPEC synthesize up to four siderophores with different characteristics we performed transcriptional analysis to investigate the regulatory interplay between these siderophore systems for the three UPEC role model strains 536, CFT073 and NU14. By the means of realtime PCR assays of UPECs grown in different environmental conditions, we obtained transcriptional profiles of all relevant iron uptake systems as represented by genes encoding iron receptors. Feeding assays and manipulation of single iron uptake systems revealed new cooperative and compensatory activities. Interestingly, on the transcriptional level the catecholate siderophores were linked to heme uptake, whereas the yersiniabactin system was strongly connected to ferric citrate transport. Stimulation of one single siderophore system resulted in a strong downregulation of all alternative iron uptake systems. We further applied conditions mimicking in vivo effects specific for the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection, e.g. biofilm formation. Here we discovered a strong upregulation of both fyuA and iroN coding for the yersiniabactin and salmochelin receptor, respectively. Mutants for these genes lead to a significant reduction in biofilm formation. In vitro and in vivo analysis of UPEC in intracellular bacterial communities showed an upregulation of iron uptake systems and different transcriptional profiles for each strain. This work highlights the heterogeneity and the complex regulatory interplay of iron uptake systems of UPEC and discovered additional functions of siderophores relevant for the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection apart from iron acquisition.",

Here we describe a novel gene cluster which seems to be involved in LTA biosynthesis. Analysis of column-purified LTA revealed different binding characteristics compared to wild type LTA.

Recently, a YadA-related adhesin was identified in about 50% of Neisseria meningitidis isolates and was called NadA. It was also demonstrated that NadA mediates cell adhesion and invasion. However, host receptors have not been identified for NadA, yet. As N. meningitidis is endowed with several adhesins and is not pathogenic for mice, we used Y. enterocolitica to study the role of NadA in host cell interaction and mouse pathogenicity. Using recombinant NadAaa25-212 protein lacking the membrane anchor and a human \u02151 integrin expressing cell line we have identified human \u02151 integrins as key receptor for NadA. FAR-Westernblots and inhibition assays with \u02151 integrin blocking antibodies demonstrated that recombinant NadAaa25-212 protein binds directly and specifically to the beta subunit of human \u02151 integrins. Adherence assays with encapsulated NadA-positive and NadA-negative N. meningitidis strains and \u02151 integrin expressing cells revealed similar cellassociation, indicating the involvement of additional meningococcal adherence factors. In contrast, full length NadA expressed in its trimeric form on the surface of Y. enterocolitica (\u01fbinv mutant) was shown to mediate interaction with human \u02151 integrin expressing cells resulting in adherence and internalization of Yersinia.

Our work is focused mainly on one class of adhesins from gram-negative bacteria, known as trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs). The general structure of TAAs follows a head-stalk-anchor architecture, where the heads are the primary mediators of attachment and autoagglutination. The stalks of TAAs seem to serve as spacers, allowing the head to protrude far from the bacterial cell surface. The membrane anchor is a beta-barrel pore which hosts the autotransport function; it is able to export all types of head and stalk domains to the cell surface and keeps them anchored in the outer membrane. TAAs are modular in nature; a small set of frequently repetitive head and stalk domains is the basis of their structural and functional diversity. We have produced an interactive database, daTAA, that includes an annotation of domain properties. We have by now crystallized a large number of representative domains, e.g. of SadA from Salmonella thyphimurium. Of BadA from Bartonella henselae, we have solved the structure of a head domain that is involved in fibronectin binding. Pathogenic organisms must constantly modify their virulence determinants in the face of adapting host defenses, simply to preserve the status quo. In the case of TAAs, this variability is made possible by the highly repetitive nature of the genes, which facilitates recombination. This enables combinatorial reshuffling of a large number of equivalent modules and presumably leads to the diversity of TAAs observed in Proteobacteria.",

GAS is equipped with many virulence factors allowing the bacteria to infect and persist within the host cell. During infection GAS are exposed to different host environments with changing nutritional conditions potentially affecting the central metabolism of the bacteria.Like other Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) S. pyogenes in general preferably applies the energetically rather inefficient homolactic acid fermentation pathway (2 ATP per molecule glucose) although the genome encodes for the complete enzymatic setup for mixed acid fermentation (3 ATP per molecule glucose). For determining the impact of homolactic acid fermentation on the growth performance and virulence of S. pyogenes M49 we compared an L lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) negative mutant with the corresponding wild type strain. The knock out hardly affected the growth rate in nutrient rich media but led to mixed acid fermentation in the resulting strain. Analysis of virulence-associated abilities of the ldh-strain revealed increased biofilm formation ability but a decreased adherence to and internalization into human keratinocytes and a decreased survival rate in human blood. Survival in human blood could be restored to wild type level when adding lactate to the blood samples. In human serum neither the ldh knock out nor addition of lactate caused changes in the bacterial survival, indicating an impact of homolactic acid fermentation on the cellular components of the blood. These results show that homolactic acid fermentation is not crucial for successful growth of GAS M49 in nutrient rich media but represents an advantage for survival in human blood, clearly indicating a direct crosslink between central metabolism and pathogenicity of GAS.",

Since RpoS also controls quorum-sensing gene expression in P. aeruginosa, the aim of this study was to elucidate the interdependencies of the RpoS and the quorum sensing regulatory networks. We searched for direct RpoS target promoter sequences by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to a P. aeruginosa genome microarray (ChIP-chip). Using this genome-wide approach, we identified 496 RpoS binding sites with high reproducibility. Categorization of the target sequences revealed that a large subset harbours a RpoS binding sequence motif and/or the respective downstream genes have previously been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by RpoS. However, we also identified a subset of targets that lacked a common RpoS motif and only bound RpoS in the presence of LasR or both LasR and RhlR. Since a LexA-based protein interaction system revealed that LasR and RpoS directly interact, our findings do not only accommodate previous models of the complex relationship between RpoS and quorum sensing, but also opens a window for the elucidation of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of RpoS in other bacterial pathogens. Transcriptional regulators can be highly conserved but nevertheless fulfill divergent functions in related bacteria. Here we show that the MarR-like transcriptional regulator FarR contributes to the different lifestyles of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. These closely related species are highly adapted to their respective human host niches, N. meningitidis mainly acting as a commensal and only rarely becoming invasive, in contrast to the obligate pathogen N. gonorrhoeae. We demonstrate that FarR, which mediates fatty acid resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, is present in N. meningitidis and binds to the meningococcal farAB promoter region. However, in N. meningitidis, deletion of FarR did not lead to fatty acid resistance. Further analyses identified a FarR repressed protein in N. meningitidis that is absent in N. gonorrhoeae. This protein is the meningococcus specific adhesin and vaccine component NadA which has most likely been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we proved that the meningococcal FarR specifically binds to the nadA promoter region. A sixteen base pair palindromic repeat present in both the farAB as well as in the nadA promoter region was characterized as the exact binding site and a consensus sequence was established. De-repression of nadA resulted in significantly higher association of a \u00a8farR mutant strain with epithelial cells. This down-regulation of nadA expression may enable N. meningitidis to keep the balance between pathogenicity, as NadA is responsible for adherence to host cells -and immune evasion, as repression of the highly immunogenic adhesin might administer to a persisting infection. Hence FarR has gained control over a meningococcus specific gene involved in host colonization, thus contributing to differing niche adaptation in these pathogenic Neisseriae.",

To seperately analyze chlamydial metabolism from its host cell has been rendered impossible due to its obligate intracellular developmental cycle. In this study we present a novel method that enables the separate analysis of host cell and chlamydial metabolism in living cells. We used NADH fluorescent lifetime imaging (FLIM) by two-photon microscopy in Chlamydia trachomatis infected Hep-2 cells to characterize the metabolic activity of host and pathogen. NADH, the key cofactor for enzymes in energy production is supposed to be imported into the chlamydial inclusions from the host cell and to be utilized for chlamydial ATP synthesis. Changes in NADH fluorescent lifetimes and abundances have been shown to reflect diverse protein bindings of NADH and therefore are indicative for different \"NADH-species\" and altered metabolism. We found marked differences in NADH fluorescent lifetimes between the host cell and the intracellular chlamydial inclusion as an indicator for the unique metabolism of Chlamydia. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes of the host cell decreased the metabolism also in the Chlamydia according to the NADH FLIM data. Interestingly, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I and III differently affected intracellular growth and progeny of chlamydiae. Thus, complex I inhibition had no effect on the size of chlamydial inclusions but the recovery rates were reduced, while complex III inhibition decreased both, the size of the forming chlamydial inclusions and infectious pathogens. We speculate that chlamydial inclusions harbour diverse \"NADHspecies\" which might allow to selectively target chlamydial energy consumption to prevent intracellular chlamydial growth.",

This study is focused on the \"High-Pathogenicity Island\" (HPI), which is a PAI widely spread among extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli and serves as a model for horizontal transfer of PAIs in general. We applied a phylogenetic approach using multilocus sequence typing on HPI-positive and -negative natural E. coli isolates representative of the species diversity to infer the mechanism of horizontal HPI transfer within the E. coli species. In each strain the partial nucleotide sequences of 6 HPI-encoded genes and 6 housekeeping genes of the genomic backbone, as well as DNA fragments immediate upstream and downstream of the HPI were compared. This revealed that the HPI is not solely vertically transmitted, but that recombination of large DNA-fragments beyond the HPI plays a major role in the spread of the HPI within E. coli species. In support of the results of the phylogenetic analyses, we experimentally demonstrated that HPI can be transferred between different E. coli strains by Fplasmid mediated mobilization. Sequencing of the chromosomal DNA regions immediate upstream and downstream of the HPI in the recipient strain indicated that the HPI was transferred and integrated together with HPI-flanking DNA regions of the donor strain. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that conjugative transfer and homologous DNA recombination play a major role in horizontal transfer of a pathogenicity island within the species E. coli.",

In-vitro, Hp induces a drastic epithelial cell migration implying the disintegration of the mucosal epithelium. Since less is known about the cellular mechanisms, we focussed on the signalling network leading to the Hpinduced motogenic response. The pathogenic factor CagA (cytotoxin-associated gene A) of Hp is a crucial factor in host cell migration. CagA is injected through a type IV secretion system followed by tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Src and Abl kinases. Phospho-CagA is then involved in the regulation of certain actin binding proteins, which localized in focal adhesions mediating the contact between the extracellular matrix and the cellular actin cytoskeleton. We identified the actin binding protein VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) as an important signaling molecule in Hp-induced cell migration, which has been previously described to bind the ActA protein of Listeria allowing efficient bacterial propulsion in the cytoplasm. In Hp-infected epithelial cells, VASP and phospho-CagA were localized in focal adhesion complexes mediating the contact between the extracellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton of motile cells. Immunoprecipitation analyses revealed a CagA-dependent induction of serine/threonine phosphorylation of VASP. Down-regulation of VASP expression using specific siRNA or overexpression of a phosphorylationresistant VASP mutant blocked epithelial cell elongation. These data implicate a coordinated role of tyrosine phosphorylated CagA and VASP in the regulation of highly dynamic focal adhesions in motile epithelial cells.",

PspC, a pneumococcal surface protein, interacts with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) to promote bacterial adherence to and invasion into epithelial cells. Internalization of pneumococci requires the co-ordinated action of actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and the retrograde machinery of pIgR. Recently, we have shown that the pIgR-mediated pneumococcal entry process depends on the cooperation and activation of Rho family GTPase Cdc42, PI3K, and Akt. Here, we assessed the role of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) during PspC-pIgR initiated adherence and invasion. We show that especially Src family PTKs, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are essential for pneumococcal invasion while p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are not involved. Pharmacological inhibitors of PTKs and MAPKs, respectively, and genetic interference with Src PTK function caused a significant reduction of pIgR-mediated pneumococcal invasion. In addition, pneumococcal ingestion by host cells induces activation of ERK1/2 and JNK. In agreement with activated JNK, ist target molecule and DNA-binding protein c-Jun was activated. We also show that functionally active Src PTK is essential for activation of ERK1/2 upon pneumococcal infections. In conclusion, these data illustrate the importance of a coordinated signalling between Src PTKs, ERK1/2, and JNK during PspC-pIgR-mediated uptake of pneumococci by host epithelial cells.",

They are targets for several bacterial cytotoxins. Chlamydia trachomatis genital serovars cause sexually transmitted diseases. They encode the putative chlamydial effector protein CT166, which shares homology with clostridial glucosylating toxins (CGTs). CGTs are glucosyltransferases that glucosylate small GTPases from the Rho/Ras family, resulting in actin reorganization. Homology of CT166 to CGTs is based on a DXD motif that is essential for the glucosyltransferase activity of CGTs. Here we demonstrate that ectopically expressed CT166 induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in HeLa cells similar to CGTs. A competition study using a DXD-mutant of CT166 provided evidence that CT166 shares a common substrate and a common function with toxin B from Clostridium difficile. Coexpression of a glucosylation-resistant, constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (Rac1-Q61L) reverted the morphological changes induced by CT166. In contrast, a similar mutant of RhoA (RhoA-Q63L) could not reverse the effect of CT166 on the cytoskeleton. Taken together our results indicate that CT166 targets the host-cell regulatory molecule Rac1 and that this leads, most likely by glucosylation and inactivation of the small GTPase, to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

In contrast to several other small \u0215-barrelforming toxins, \u012e-toxin has been thought to remain in the plasma-membrane of target cells and to not reach intracellular compartments.

The precise mechanisms underlying these transport processes are not completely understood. We have shown previously that C. trachomatis infection caused fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus. Golgi fragmentation is triggered by Chlamydia-dependent truncation of the Golgi matrix protein, golgin-84. Inhibition of golgin-84 processing by specific protease inhibitors blocked Golgi fragmentation, inhibited bacterial growth and sphingolipid acquisition. Furthermore, we could show that fragmentation of the Golgi by knock-down of golgin-84 or giantin before infection boosted Chlamydia progeny. These data indicated that the structure of the GA regulates Chlamydia propagation. Rab proteins are important small GTPases that control Golgi structure and Chlamydia recruits specific Rab proteins to their inclusions. Therefore, we hypothesized that Rab proteins might regulate Chlamydiainduced Golgi fragmentation. Using a RNA interference approach we screened for Rab proteins that inhibit Chlamydia-induced Golgi fragmentation. Interestingly, knock-down of two Rab proteins that regulate retrograde transport blocked Chlamydia-induced Golgi fragmentation and furthermore decreased bacterial replication. This study indicates that these Rab proteins are important regulators of chlamydial propagation and Golgi structure.

Cell culture experiments using siRNA and inhibitors demonstrated that \u02151 integrin mediated signalling and the RhoGTPases RhoA and Rac1 are crucial for Yop injection demonstrating that Yop translocation is a process which needs the activation and modulation of host cells. As demonstrated by infection of splenocyte suspensions in vitro, injection of Yops appears to occur randomly into all types of leukocytes indicating that detection of Yop injection can be used as a marker for bacteria cell interaction in vivo. Upon infection of mice the highest total number of Yop-injected cells represent B cells, particularly CD19 + CD21 + CD23 + follicular B cells, followed by neutrophils, dendritic cells and macrophages suggesting a distinct cellular tropism of Ye.",

Due to their outer membrane localization HrpB proteins represent potential targets for the host's immune system during colonization and disease. As we have shown previously by analyzing a collection of 822 meningococcal carrier isolates, hrpB genes are present in virtually all clonal complexes of N. meningitidis. In contrast to the HrpA proteins that display a considerable degree of C-terminal sequence variation, the HrpB proteins seem to be highly conserved between meningococcal strains. To assess whether HrpB proteins elicit an antibody response during invasive infection, the sera of patients recovering from meningococcal disease were analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies. In western blots with purified HrpB, specific IgG antibodies could be detected in the majority of the sera analyzed. To identify the epitopes or immunodominant regions within the HrpB protein, peptide microarray slides were spotted with overlapping peptides covering the complete HrpB sequence and probed with the patient sera. According to a three-dimensional model of the HrpB structure, overlapping peptides corresponding to the putative extracellular loop 3 and 6 were identified as main targets of antibody response. Antibodies directed against loop 3 and 6 were detected in 91% and 83% of the reconvalescent sera, respectively. Whether antibodies that target meningococcal HrpB proteins are protective against invasive disease will be addressed in further studies. Objectives: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder with an incidence of 1 in 2500 in Caucasians. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant bacterial pathogen in CF and grows within a hypoxic biofilm in the CF lung causing chronic infection and associated inflammation. In this study we have investigated the effects of hypoxia on the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-\u021bB in alveolar epithelial cells in response to stimulation with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa. Methods: A549 lung epithelial cells were incubated with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa (108 CFU/ml) for 30 minutes to 8 hours at 21% and 1% atmospheric oxygen. Following exposure, nuclear and cytosolic levels of p65 (NF-\u021bB family member) and Cox2 (target gene of NF-\u021bB) were determined by immunoblotting. Results: Incubation of cells with heat inactivated P. aeruginosa clearly increased nuclear p65 protein level in a manner that was profoundly amplified by either epithelial cell hypoxia or hypoxic bacteria. Stimulation of innate immunity in alveolar epithelial cells is largely mediated by three toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5). Incubation of cells with toll-like receptor specific agonists (flagellin for TLR5) increased NF-\u021bB level in a manner which was also amplified by hypoxia. Conclusion: These data indicate that microenvironmental hypoxia is a major determinant of the pulmonary epithelial inflammatory response during P. aeruginosa infection. Further investigations of signaling molecules participating in this response will reveal new targets for anti-inflammatory therapy in Cystic Fibrosis.",

EAP belongs to a new group of secreted S. aureus adhesins (SERAMs), and was previously shown to interfere with inflammatory and angiogenic responses by inhibiting leukocyte recruitment and blocking Ras-activation. Here the effect of EAP on the inflammatory response of primary endothelial cells and monocytes, alone and in combination with other PAMPs (LPS, LTA, MDP and Pam3Cys) was examined. EAP\u00b4s ability to block ERK-pathway activation was found to particularly interfere with fast immune responses: thus, expression of the procoagulant tissue factor (approx. halfed in TNF\u012e-stimulated HUVEC and LPS-stimulated PBMC (qRT)) and early TNF\u012e-secretion in PBMC (complete block of LPS effect at 4 hrs of stimulation (ELISA)) were strongly inhibited by EAP. On the other hand, NF\u021bB-dependent responses, like late TNF\u012e-secretion in LPSstimulated PBMC (at 14 hrs or 24 hrs) and ICAM-1 expression in LPSstimulated HUVEC and PBMC were strongly enhanced (more than doubled (qRT)). These pro-inflammatory effects may be due to cross-linking of ICAM-1 (sensitive to blockage with inhibitory mAb), or inhibition of pathways involved in endotoxin-tolerance (p56Dok-2-phosphorylation in HUVEC and IRAK-M synthesis in PBMC). Taken together with previous observations (inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, interference with vascular permeability increase), at least in vitro, EAP effectively counteracts the hyperreactive state. At the same time the development of an anergic compensatory situation could be attenuated. Further in vivo studies are indicated to test the anti-septic potency of this protein.",

The pneumococcal enolase, a glycolytic and moonlighting enzyme, is a major plasminogen binding protein located in the cytoplasma and also associated to the cell surface of pneumococci. In addition to two C-terminal located lysine amino acid residues, an internal plasminogen binding motif (FYDKERKVY) was identified in former studies as pivotal plasminogen binding site of the octameric pneumococcal enolase. Here, we studied the effect of pneumococcal adherence to host cells in the presence of host cell bound plasminogen. Eukaryotic epithelial and endothelial cells bind human plasminogen in concentration-dependent manner as analysed by flow cytometry. In cell culture infection studies pneumococcal adherence to eukaryotic cells was significantly increased in the presence of plasminogen. In contrast, pneumococcal internalization into eukaryotic cells was not effected by plasminogen. Plasminogen-mediated adherence of pneumococci to host cells was significantly inhibited by the lysine amino acid analogue epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA) suggesting a role of lysine binding sites in the kringle domains of plasminogen. Moreover, a synthetic peptide representing the internal plasminogen binding epitope of the pneumococcal enolase reduced significantly plasminogen mediated pneumococcal adherence to host cells. Adherence of pneumococcal mutants producing an enolase with a deletion of the lysine residues at the C-terminus was significantly reduced compared to wild-type pneumococci. The reduction in plasminogen initiated adherence was even more significant when pneumococci produce an enolase without any plasminogen-binding activity. These results demonstrated the essential role of the internal plasminogen binding site in enolase for plasminogen-mediated adherence to human cells.",

Recent studies revealed the spread of an emerging subclone in France and Spain. To determine the possible spread of this subclone within Germany, we tested F. t. holarctica isolates from Germany and nearby countries with geno-and phenotyping methods. 45 F. t. holarctica isolates covering virtually all endemic areas of Germany and 57 isolates from nearby countries were selected for this study. We typed these isolates with MLVA and tested them for the presence of a subclone-specific deletion marker (RD23) by conventional PCR. Additionally the 23S rDNA sequence was determined and the isolates were tested for erythromycin susceptibility. A distinct geographic distribution of F. t. holarctica isolates was observed. Isolates from Western Germany consistently shared genetic characteristics (RD23 deletion and MLVA-type) with the Franco-Iberian subclone and were erythromycin-sensitive (Biovar I). In contrast to this isolates from North-East Germany showed distinct genetic characteristics (no RD23 deletion, distinct MLVA types) and were erythromycin-resistant (Biovar II). Additionally these characteristics were highly correlated with 2 single nucleotide substitutions on the 23S rDNA sequence of these isolates. Interestingly, a mixing of both F. t. This study helps closing a significant gap in the distribution pattern of F. t. holarctica in Europe. Phylogentic studies on isolates from Germany, belonging to the Franco-Iberian subclone will shed further light on ist origin and spread. The high correlation between 23S rDNA genotype and erythromycin resistance may indicate a direct functional link between this genetic marker and the observed phenotype.",

Werner *1 1 Infectious Diseases, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode Branch, Wernigerode, Germany Severely ill, intensively cared and immuno-compromised patients are at risk of acquiring infections with facultative pathogenic E. faecium. Furthermore, infections with multi-and vancomycin-resistant isolates of E. faecium (VRE) were increasingly prevalent among German hospital patients since 2003. Results of molecular typing (MLVA, AFLP, MLST) allow differentiating isolates according to their ecological backgrounds and defining hospitalacquired E. faecium (haEfm; CC17) significantly more often isolated from outbreaks and clusters of infections and colonizations worldwide. However, these methods (MLVA, AFLP, MLST) are time-consuming, laborious and costintensive. A cheap, quick and reliable test for defining haEfm isolates is highly desirable but challenging in the near absence of any genomic knowledge. A few previous studies suggested putative candidate markers. But many of them were not distributed among all haEfm (esp, hyl) and others appear in allelic variants complicating the establishing of a PCR-or hybridization-based test (acm, scm). Genomic comparisons using microarrays identified an insertion element IS16 exclusively distributed among all tested clinical E. faecium favouring this element as a suitable marker for haEfm including hospital-acquired VRE. In an initial test with >200 Efm strains from clinical and commensal origins we confirmed the excellent predictive value of IS16 for haEfm. Based on these data we introduced PCR-based screening for samples sent to our Laboratory for Enterococci in October 2007. Up to May 2009, 523 Efm from 51 microbiological laboratories (>70 German hospitals) were tested and 520 (99.4%) were IS16-positive. Only 74% of isolates were esp+ and 63% were hyl+; most of them were VRE (96%). In conclusion, results of our initial study and routine screening indicated wide prevalence of haEfm from clinical cases in Germany. In addition, IS16 prevalence predicts that vancomycin resistance appeared exclusively among haEfm clones.",

From his visitors, relatives and friends eleven fell in illness after some days with fever and a characteristical vesicular eruption on their bodies.

Later on 113 other persons in the Kosovo province showed the same typical eruptions and got severe diseases: 26 patients died. A traveller from northern Yugoslavia who stayed only one day in the Kosovo started a second chain of infections with smallpox outside Kosovo. One of the first new cases was diagnosed as a \"penicillin allergy\" and had been demonstrated to several medical doctors and students as an unusual exanthema caused by penicillin. Later this patient died by the hemorrhagic form of smallpox. From 38 infected contact persons 8 died.

Zimmermann 1 1 Hygiene Institut, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany 2 Bruker Daltonic GmbH, Bremen, Germany Between January and December 2008 Klebsiella pneumoniae producing a carbapenemase was isolated from 9 patients of a university hospital. Due to this still uncommon resistance pattern an outbreak was suspected, confirmed and subsequently contained. Ten isolates from the outbreak patients -one patient was colonised with two phenotypical different isolates -underwent typing with PFGE. Additionally all outbreak isolates and epidemiological unrelated K. pneumoniae isolates were analysed with MALDI-TOF MS in order to estimate its utility for outbreak investigations. In contrast to PFGE MALDI-TOF MS is protein-based, fast, cheap and additional strains can easily be added to the analysis at a later stage. Strains were cultivated on blood agar, extracted with a formic-acid/ethanol method and a series of 24 spectra for each strain was generated. Using the Bruker Daltonics microflex mass spectrometer and the standard software package (MALDI Biotyper 2.0) three types of analysis were performed: dendrogramm generation, subtyping and composite correlation index. All three methods correctly differentiated the outbreak strains from epidemiologically unrelated strains. However, relationships between the members of the outbreak group differed from method to method. The eradication of measles by 2010 remains an important if somewhat optimistic public health goal of WHO. We conducted a study among pupils from Hassloch, Rhineland Palatinate and assessed their knowledge, attitude and practice regarding measles vaccination in order to identify vaccination-gaps and their causes. A structured questionnaire covering demographics, vaccination status, reasons for non-vaccination and opinion on vaccination related statements was handed out to 220 pupils from 5th and 9th grade of Hauptschule, Realschule and Gymnasium. Descriptive analyses of vaccination rates depending on school type and grade, reasons for non-vaccination and information sources were complemented by a multivariable regression looking for factors conducive to vaccination. All questionnaires were returned. 201 of 213 (92%) pupils with known vaccination status were vaccinated against measles. Of 12 unvaccinated pupils, 5 (42%) had forgotten to get their immunisation. 94 (96%) of males and 107 (93%) of females were vaccinated. Vaccination rates were 90% (45/50) in Hauptschule, 95% (69/73) in Realschule and 97% (87/90) in Gymnasium. 92% (122/132) of 5th graders were vaccinated against measles compared with 98% (79/81) of 9th graders. 51 (23%) pupils named their GP as a source for information on measles followed by TV (n=37, 17%) and school (n=31, 14%). The internet was only named by five pupils (2%) as an information source. In multivariable regression, tetanus vaccination, higher grade, being male and visiting a higher school type was positively associated with being vaccinated against measles, although only tetanus vaccination was statistically significant on the 0,05 level. We observed different vaccination rates depending on grade and school type. Vaccination campaigns should especially focus on pupils entering Hauptschule to bring vaccination levels above the 95% threshold needed for eradication. Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of the Q Fever disease, has been the source of endemic outbreaks in Germany during the last decades. According to it`s low infection dose via an aerosol route (up to one bacteria could cause an infection) clusters of infections are always seen or could be identified. The source of infection is material from asymptomatic goats, cows and sheeps, shedding large amounts of the microorganism during e.g. birthing (lambing) season in their placenta material. In humans up to 50% of the infections are subclinical and diagnosis is very often delayed. Typically specific antibody detection via ELISA/IFT confirms the diagnosis. Back tracing of the infection should be one possibility to identify the source of an outbreak and to initiate countermeasures. In addition, forensic microbiology for this bacteria gets also important in the light of bioterrorism because Coxiella burnetii is regarded as an potential bioterroristic agent. We recently developed a modified VNTR-method (Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats) and 20 Coxiella burnetii isolates were analysed which had been cultured from human and animal material in Germany during 1969 to 2003. Twelve different genotypes could be identified and in one case we could link a human isolate to a sheep strain from a large outbreak in Soest 2003 with up to 300 infected persons. The 14 different VNTR-markers used could divide German strains in regional clusters but no clear correlation could be drawn from the genotype according to clinical illness (acute or chronic disease) and the respective animal species. This is the first genomic typing of a collection of German Coxiella burnetii strains. VNTR is a powerful tool in classification of Coxiella isolates and in back tracing of infections to their source. Koch-Institut, Wernigerode, Wernigerode, Germany Background: Todate there is no data on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in Namibia. This is the first study analyzing the dissemination of the serious pathogen, the prevalence of MRSA and the clonal diversity of S. aureus strains. Methods: 181 S. aureus isolates were obtained from 206 clinical specimens [major specimens: sputum (n=64); pus (n=42); throat (n=11); nasal swabs (n=10); urine (n=16)] from different clinics in Oshakati and Windhoek, Namibia. All isolates underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing, toxin gene analysis, multilocus sequence typing, agr group and spa typing. And for MRSA SCCmec typing was performed. Results: 14.4% of the 181 S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant and were isolated from inpatients' specimens of medical and paediatric departments. The majority of MRSA strains belonged to the clonal complex CC8 (spa-types t104 and t064) and were spread in clinics in Oshakati and Windhoek. Other less frequent MRSA STs were ST5, ST26, ST30, and ST101. The MRSA strains were typed as SCCmec IV and grouped in agr I. The respiratory isolates were frequently identified as MRSA (>60%). The remarkable antibiotic resistance profile \"penicillin-oxacillin-cotrimoxazole-rifampicin-tobramycin\" for ST8 was detected. The MSSA strains (ST1, ST5, ST8, ST15, ST22, ST45, ST30, ST72, ST97, ST121 and ST188) were heterogeneous by pheno-and genotypic analysis. All MSSA isolates were penicillin-resistant and nearly 5% additionally towards cotrimoxazole and tetracycline. Conclusion: The clonal complex CC8 MRSA was predominantly detected in different clinics in Oshakati and Windhoek besides the CC5 and CC30 MRSA strains. Approx. 71% of these multi-resistant MRSA strains expressed the toxin genes sea, sej and lukPV and were associated with serious respiratory infections requiring specific treatment, emphasizing the ability of these strains to produce serious illness.",

In the US, a highly virulent community-associated MRSA, USA300, has rapidly spread and causes severe skin and soft tissue infections in immune competent persons. Except for USA300, it is largely unclear, to which degree bacterial factors, e.g. genotype and virulence gene repertoire, or host factors determine the outcome of S. aureus host interactions. To elucidate the contribution of bacterial factors to S. aureus furunculosis, we analyzed the Protein A (spa)-derived genotypes, virulence gene patterns (Panton-Valentine-leukocidine (pvl), exfoliative toxins, superantigens, agr) and the prevalence of lysogenic phages. 86 S. aureus isolates from adult patients with recurrent abscesses and furuncles were compared with 106 control S. aureus strains from healthy nasal carriers. All strains were collected in Szczecin, Poland between 2002 and 2008. Genotyping revealed that 48.8% of furunculosis isolates belonged to the same clonal cluster -CC121. In contrast, only 3 out of 106 colonizing strains belonged to CC121 (P<<0.001). The prototypic furunculosis strains were spatype t157 or 435, and carried the genes for the PVL, the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc) and agr type IV, but lacked the gene for methicillin-resistence (mecA). PVL was highly prevalent among furunculosis strains from different lineages (82.6% vs. 0.9%; P<0.001) and strictly linked to phage Sa2int. In contrast, exfoliative toxins and superantigens were not associated with furunculosis. Spot samples from pediatric clinics showed that CC121 also caused recurrent abscesses in children in Northern Germany. In conclusion, CC121 is highly virulent and the major cause of abscesses and furuncles. Staphylococcal virulence in furunculosis is determined by clonal lineage (CC121) and PVL toxin.",

For taxonomic reasons, the main three clinically relevant species, A. baumannii, A. genomic species (gen. sp.) 3 and A. gen. sp. 13TU, and one environmental species, A. calcoaceticus, are linked together in the A. calcoaceticus-A. baumannii complex whose representatives cannot be distinguished based on phenotypic attributes. The increasing isolation rate of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter strains from German veterinary clinics has been the impulse to determine which species were involved. To this aim amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis was used. Restriction patterns of 56 tested strains identified 52 A. baumannii isolates and three A. gen. sp. 3 isolates. One strain had a unique pattern and could not be classified. Subsequently, isolates were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis for determination of their epidemiological relationships. Using the endonuclease ApaI and a grouping identity of 87 % as threshold level for the establishment of strain relatedness, 3 main clusters and 9 unique profiles could be identified. Within the cluster that comprises the largest amount of strains (n=38), 7 subclusters could be assessed with a similarity of 100 % among strains. These findings were confirmed by comparison of genomic profiles obtained by selective amplification of restriction fragments (AFLP). In conclusion, marginal genetic variety among epidemic A. baumannii strains inside German veterinary clinics could be detected. The close relationship between the animal isolates might suggest an epidemic spread in veterinary clinics. Since the natural habitat of A. baumannii is still unknown, we favour further investigations to assess whether or not animals may be a potential habitat for this species.",

The occurrence of P. aeruginosa in water systems is a potential threat for human health. Contamination of water systems with P. aeruginosa is routinely recognized by conventional culture methods. The genotyping method of macrorestriction in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis allows the analysis of genetic relationship of P. aeruginosa isolates and can be used for localizing sources of contaminations. In this study 111 P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from aquatic environments (81% from eleven drinking water systems and swimming pools and 19% from five other technical water systems) in Germany. All strains were isolated on selective media and identified by a biochemical system (API 20 NE). The genetic relationships of all isolates were analysed by comparing PFGE patterns. Strains with a similarity of 75% in PFGE patterns were defined as one clone. The cluster analysis showed 19 different clones. The number of isolates included in single clone types varied between one and 32. The major cluster was composed by 32 isolates from three different water systems which are neither geographically nor temporally correlated. All isolates of this study were compared with a representative strain of clone C earlier described as a major P. aeruginosa clone common to patients and aquatic habitats (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. (1994 ) 60, 1734 -1738 . Only three out of the examined 111 isolates belong to clone C. PFGE analysis of this study showed that in the examined water distribution systems one dominant clone of P. aeruginosa exists. This clone is different to clone C which was found also but at a lower frequency. This study shows that in water distribution systems another clone can predominate. Clostridium difficile isolates recovered from 170 patients suspected of suffering from Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) at the Cologne university and several teaching hospitals in November 2008 were analyzed by molecular techniques; i.e. repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR, Diversilab \u00ae ), surface layer protein A gene sequence typing (slpAST), PCR typing for the presence of the paloc genes tcdA, tcdB, tcdC as well as deletions within the tcdC gene, and PCR typing for the presence of binary toxin genes cdtA and cdtB. Typing results for the 33 recovered isolates were compared to a representative set of local ribo-/slpA-types previously isolated. The slpAST identified four groups of isolates with near identical sequence types with 13, 8, 2, and 2 isolates in these groups. Three isolates had unique slpA sequences. Surprisingly five isolates were non-typeable by slpAST. The rep-PCR identified five clusters within the >95% similarity cut off with 10, 4, 3, 3, and 2 isolates, with an additional ten isolates showing below 95% similarity to any other isolate. Both methods identified a major cluster of isolates indicating spreading of this strain among all teaching hospitals investigated in this study period. Whereas slpAST and rep-PCR results were mostly congruent, typing for tcdA/B, tcdC deletion and cdtA/B were not generally consistent with the slpAST or rep-PCR grouping. None of the strains in our study sample was related to the C. difficile (BI/027/NAP1), which has been reported to have caused recent outbreaks in North America and Europe. Our findings clearly show that monitoring clinical isolates by rep-PCR or slpAST can reveal outbreaks otherwise not detected by the surveillance systems in our hospitals.",

The Matrixassisted-laser-desorption-ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) might be an inexpensive method for rapid identification of bacterial species. The aim of this study was to validate this method in comparison to biochemical and molecular methods. 605 clinical isolates of 17 clinical relevant CoNS species were tested. All strains included in this study were clinical isolates identified by the use of VITEK-2 (Biomerieux, France), molecular identification was performed for equivocal results. Samples were prepared in duplicate, cases of doubt (Biotyper 2.0 score less than 1.7) were retested in MALDI-TOF MS. With the exception of slight modifications in culturing and sample preparation samples were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. For identification proteomic data of all samples were calculated by the use of Biotyper software (Bruker Daltonics). Overall, the same species was found in 603 of 605 isolates. Good identification was seen with S. epidermidis (58/58), S. haemolyticus (35/35), S. saprophyticus ssp saprophyticus (277/277),S. schleiferi ssp schleiferi (7/7), S. succinus ssp succinus 4/4) and S. sciuri ssp scuiri (3/3). However, low scores less than 1.85 were detected for all S. cohnii (7/7) and 2 of 9 S. warneri were identified as S. haemolyticus. Subspecies identification failed for S. capitis and S. hominis. Concerning the accuracy of similar identification compared to reference method MALDI-TOF MS is able to differentiate correctly between a huge number of CoNS species but differs on certain subspecies. Compared with biochemical and molecular standards it is an easy and inexpensive method that can improve the accuracy and time to results of clinical diagnostics in microbiology laboratories. Unlike peritonsillar abscess (PTA), which are primarily treated surgically, recurrent tonsillitis (RT) is often treated by tonsillectomy only after a series of failed drug therapy attempts. The underlying reasons for the lacking success of conservative therapeutic approaches are still not well understood. In a prospective study, tonsil specimens from 130 patients with RT and 124 patients with PTA were examined for the presence of extra-and intracellular pathogenic bacteria using antibiotic protection assays. Staphylococcus aureus isolates from RT-patients were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, spa-typing and MSCRAMM-gene-PCR. Their ability for biofilm formation was tested and their cell invasiveness was confirmed by a flow cytometric invasion assay, fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. There were only significant diffences between these two patient groups for the prevalences of S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. S. aureus was the predominant species (57.7%) in RT-patients. Based upon the antibiotic protection assay results nearly all S. aureus strains were located inside predominantly epithelial cells, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and FISH. The MSCRAMM-Gene-PCRs identified fibronectin binding protein A in all isolates giving hint for their capability for cell invasion. The results of the internalization assay confirmed that 87% of these S. aureus-isolates were invasive strains and mere colonizers. After collagen-or fibronectin coating 5.5% and 81.6% of all S. aureus-isolates, respectively were able to form considerable biofilm masses. The MSCRAMMgene-pattern, biofilm formation capability and penicillin-susceptibility show a clear arrangement within the different PFGE-clusters/spa-CC. Our results demonstrate that S. aureus is the most common cause of RT and indicate that S. aureus uses an intracellular location to survive the effects of antibiotics and the host immune response. ",

While the epidemiology of temporarily limited clusters was often characterized with fingerprint methods, namely pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the epidemiology and clonal distribution of EHEC O157 infections over years remains unknown. We therefore analyzed EHEC O157 strains isolated in Germany since 1987 using multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA). Up to 14 epidemiologically unrelated EHEC O157 strains per year were randomly chosen from our strain collection starting in 1987. All strains were investigated using the PulseNet MLVA O157 scheme (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, USA). Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the minimum-spanning tree (MST) tool of the Ridom SeqSphere software version 0.9 beta (Ridom GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg). MLVA types differing in two or less loci were clustered into groups. The VNTR-loci specific biodiversity for a total of 171 strains ranged from 0.64 to 0.88; 6 to 20 distinct alleles were found in the investigated loci resulting in 128 different MLVA profiles. Null alleles were found in four of eight loci with a frequency from 0.6% to 43.3%, concerning 46.8% of all strains. Clustering based on MLVA profiles assigned 67% of the strains to 16 groups containing 2 to 48 isolates. In addition to several clones that occurred only once, the MST exhibited two clonal groups consisting of 30 isolates over a period of 20 years indicating highly adaptive clones with an evolutionarily successful persistence. In conclusion MLVA enables for the first time a comprehensive view on the clonal distribution of EHEC O157 in Germany. The presence of few successful clones indicates the necessity of a close host adaptation and corroborates the source-sink dynamics of these pathogens. Research on Bacillus anthracis as a biological weapon began more than 80 years ago. Since the occurrence of the \"Amerithrax\" -letters in the U.S.A. in 2001, the threat of bioterrorism pushed scientists to spotlight forensic microbiology especially for Bacillus anthracis. The forensic challenge is to differentiate between endemic infections and an intentional release. In order to make this possible, accurate and reliable typing-methods, as well as databases are required. In the context of the bioterroristic attacks in 2001 Multi Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR) Analysis based on 8 markers (MLVA-8) evidenced that the collected spores belong to the genetic cluster of the \"Ames\" strain. MLVA investigates several defined regions, based on nucleotide repeat structures directly attached to each other Repeat copy numbers may differ from strain to strain and a combination of repeat-copy numbers of multiple genetic loci generates a strain specific typing-pattern. In the years after, typing patterns of isolates from nearly all over the world were investigated and published. For achieving higher discrimination power several laboratories extended the existing MLVA-8 -system with up to 31 markers. In this study we investigated a collection of 40 B. anthracis strains isolated in the Republic of Bulgaria between 1960-80 from soil and animals. We determined their MLVA pattern using a modified VNTR-method with 15 markers (van Ert el al, 2007) and compared the results using UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean) clustering methods with existing data of 1179 different strains from all over the world. In this global context, the Bulgarian isolates form a novel and unique cluster that differs significantly from those isolates of geographical close related regions. In addition, two new alleles of markers could be observed. Forensic microbiology of Bacillus anthracis using genome based typing systems such as MLVA has the power to trace an infection back not only for normal clinical cases but also in a suspected bioterrorism scenario.",

Freyburger 1 , F. von Loewenich *1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universit\u00e4t Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium which is transmitted by Ixodes sp. ticks. It causes febrile illness in humans and animals such as sheep, cattle, horses, dogs, and cats. Roe deer are regarded as potential reservoir hosts. In contrast to the United States, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a rare disease in Europe, although the pathogen seems to be widespread in the tick-and animal-population. Because the bacterium does not grow on conventional media, its detection depends on microscopic, molecular, and serologic methods. It is not clear to date for Europe, whether HGA is underreported or whether strains with specific pathogenic potential circulate here. To address this question we analyzed the genetic differences between A. phagocytophilum strains from various species sequencing 497 bps of the 16S rRNA gene of 202 samples from humans, horses, dogs, cats, sheep, cattle, European bisons, roe deer and red deer. No clear association between the 16S rRNA gene sequence and the sample origin was found. In contrast, the analysis of the total open reading frame of the A. phagocytophilum-specific ank gene revealed a strong association between ank gene cluster and host species. To investigate, whether this is reflected by phylogenetic relatedness of the strains, we developed a Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme for A. phagocytophilum. The analysis of the concatenated housekeeping gene sequences revealed that all roe deer samples were clearly separated from those of other host species. Thus, roe deer are probably not the reservoir for human infections. On the other hand, European sequences from humans, dogs, and horses were highly related to those from the United States. Isolates from North America formed a distinct own cluster, what might reflect the different geographic origin. Given the homology of European and American Strains, we conclude that HGA should occur in Germany. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing subclinical mastitis. The infection of the mammary gland is a serious disease threatening all mammals in particular dairy cattle and causes enormous costs to the dairy industry. To gain further insights into the host specificity of S. aureus and ist virulence, the epidemiology and clonal relationship as well as the distribution and expression of virulence genes of the different S. aureus strains has to be analysed. In the present study, 23 S. aureus isolates involved in either bovine (16 isolates) or human (7 isolates) mastitis were characterised. For genetic and epidemiological studies, we utilised the well established Multi-Locus-Sequence-Typing (MLST) technique. Moreover, the agr type and the presence of virulence and resistance genes were determined by using a diagnostic microarray. For a more detailed analysis of the host specificity, sequence analyses of genes with high rates of nonsynonymous substitutions among homologous gene pairs in the sequenced bovine S. aureus strain RF122 or with divergent sequences in diverse bovine associated S. aureus isolates have been done. For this purpose, we selected the following genes: fnbA, SAB0513, SAB2172, spa, and sstC. Finally, virulence gene expression of these isolates was analysed by a 2D gel-based proteomics approach. A comparison of extracellular protein patterns revealed a very high heterogeneity between the clinical isolates. The observed variability of the exoproteomes was mainly caused by both genome plasticity and an unprecedented gene expression variation. The data imply that genomic studies focussing on virulence gene conservation patterns need to be complemented by protein expression analyses to assess the virulence potential of bacterial pathogens like S. aureus. Clinical microbiologists have frequently been baffled by the impressive capability of pathogenic bacteria to acquire novel traits such as antimicrobial resistance. However, the actual rates with which nucleotide substitutions, entire genes, or complex mobile genetic elements are gained and lost in bacterial populations have as yet not been determined. In the present study, we show that a clone of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that causes an ongoing epidemic of hospital infections has accumulated measurable diversity within two decades. Based on serial, time-structured samples of DNA sequences that were taken from this population, we used coalescent methods to calculate divergence times and to reconstruct and date episodes in the pathogen\u00b4s history, including a recent demographic bottleneck and a subsequent population expansion. In addition, comparative genomics indicated a history of complex phage dynamics.",

            "text": "For therapy control of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung inflammation, a biochemical marker is urgently needed. Therefore, we investigated lactate in sputum of CF patients for its suitability as marker for the outcome of CF lung exacerbation treatment. In sputum of 25 adult CF patients without exacerbations lactate concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. In 10 patients from Halle and 11 patients from the Florence CF center, lactate was determined during exacerbation and after i.v. antibiotic treatment. In all patients, lung function parameters were measured using either the Viasys Jaeger bodyplethysmograph (Halle) or the portable ZAN 100 morgan spirometer (Florence). In all CF sputum specimens lactate was detectable in a range from 0.2 to 14.1 mmol/L. In the CF patients without exacerbations, lactate values correlated negatively with FEV1 (r=-0.446, p=0.043), whereas for FVC, correlation coefficients were lower. In the exacerbated patients from Halle, lactate decreased from 4.8 \u00b1 2.7 at exacerbation to 1.8 \u00b1 1.6 mmol/L after treatment (p=0.003). The decrease in lactate correlated with FEV1 (r=-0.467) and FVC (r=-0.725) increases. In the patients from Florence, the values were 2.8 \u00b1 2.4 vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.9 for lactate before and after treatment, and r=-0.143 for FEV1 and r=-0.496 for FVC. Thus, in two independent lung function determinations we could demonstrate that amelioration of lung function values correlates with a decrease in lactate. Lactate in CF sputum can be determined noninvasively and several times a day. It may be used for treatment control of stable and exacerbated CF patients. It is inexpensive and can be investigated using routine equipment. Antibiotic as well as antiinflammatory therapy is reflected by changes in lactate values, especially during exacerbations. Thus, lactate is a promising marker for therapy control of CF lung infection and inflammation. In sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), next to facultative anaerobes such as P. aeruginosa also obligate anaerobes prevail. It is unknown whether the obligate anaerobes contribute to CF lung pathogenicity. Thus, we investigated the influence of obligate anaerobes on the growth of P. aeruginosa. In sputum of our Halle CF patients, the most frequently occuring anaerobes are Veillonella spp., Staphylococcus saccharolyticus (Peptococcus spp.), and Streptococcus constellatus (Str. milleri). We diluted each of these strains separately from 5 x 107 cfu/ml to 5 x 100 cfu/ml, incubated the anaerobes together with P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 [5 x 107 cfu/ml], and let them grow in an anaerobic bench (0% oxygen) in tryptone soy broth (TSB) for 3 days. Thereafter, cfu\u00b4s were determined for both bacteria. Even very low concentrations of the obligate anaerobes were sufficient for survival in co-incubation with P. aeruginosa PAO1. Veillonella spp. and Str. constellatus diluted 10-7 times as well as S. saccharolyticus diluted 10-6 times reached nearly the same concentration as the undiluted P. aeruginosa after 3 days of growth. Whereas Veillonella spp. and S. saccharolyticus did not influence P. aeruginosa cell numbers, Str. constellatus scaled down PAO1 counts upon 5%. The survival of low-dose obligate anaerobes may be explained by oxygen consumption of P. aeruginosa. The constant concentrations of PAO1 in the presence of the obligate anaerobes Veillonella spp. and S. saccharolyticus can be explained by the fact that these microorganisms do not at all consume oxygen, whereas the growth reduction caused by Str. constellatus is in coincidence with its competitive oxygen comsumption as a microaerophilic bacterium. The ability to form biofilms is a critical factor in chronic infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has made this bacterium a model organism with respect to biofilm formation. This study describes a new, previously unrecognized role for the human cationic host defense peptide LL-37. In addition to its key role in modulating the innate immune response and weak antimicrobial activity, LL-37 potently inhibited the formation of bacterial biofilms in vitro. This occurred at the very low and physiologically meaningful concentration of 0.5 microg/ml, far below that required to kill or inhibit growth (MIC = 64 microg/ml). LL-37 also affected existing, pregrown P. aeruginosa biofilms. Similar results were obtained using the bovine neutrophil peptide indolicidin, but no inhibitory effect on biofilm formation was detected using subinhibitory concentrations of the mouse peptide CRAMP, which shares 67% identity with LL-37, polymyxin B, or the bovine bactenecin homolog Bac2A. Using microarrays and follow-up studies, we were able to demonstrate that LL-37 affected biofilm formation by decreasing the attachment of bacterial cells, stimulating twitching motility, and influencing two major quorum sensing systems (Las and Rhl), leading to the downregulation of genes essential for biofilm development. WU-virus) . Clinical data and data on microbial colonization of the patients were enrolled, a risk factor analysis was performed. Results: HBoV-DNA was detected in 1 (2%), EBV DNA in 3 patients (6%) resulting in a positivity rate of 8%. Viral loads were 1.5x10E2 genome equivalents (geq)/ml for HBoV and ranged from 1x10E3 geq/ml to 9x10E4 geq/ml for EBV. Patients tested virus positive had suffered significantly more pulmonary exacerbations during the preceeding year (7.75, SD: 2.06 vs. 4.45, SD: 2.92; p=0.03). Furthermore, all of them were colonized with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and Aspergillus fumigatus (OR: infinity). The patients were significantly more often positive for MRSA (OR: 8.2; p=0.05). For further clinical data see Table 1 . Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis suffer from chronic suppurative airway infections which lead to lung insufficiency and preterm death. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the first and one of the most prevalent pathogens which colonizes and infects the airways of CF-patients, often for many years with the same clone. Methods: In this study, S. aureus isolates which were collected during a multicenter study, initiated to determine parameters to dissect S. aureus colonization from infection in CF-patients, were molecular typed by spa sequencing. Toxin profiles for sea-see, eta, etb, tst, seg-sej, pvl including agr specificity groups were determined by multiplex PCR. Results: 122 S. aureus isolates from 53 specimens (nose 20, throat 20, sputum 11, nasal lavage 2) cultured from 27 patients were further analyzed. Spa sequencing revealed that 13 patients carried 1 or 2 clones, while 1 patient 3 clones, respectively. All patients carried 1 individual clone. Additional clones were shared by 2 patients in 1 centre each (t091, t159, t1050), by 2 patients in 2 centres (t005, t008) and by 5 patients in 4 centres (t084). The isolates were positive for the following genes: sea 21; sec 12; sed 3; eta 7; tst 25; seg 54; seh 5; sei 59; sej 3;. agrI 57, agrII 40, agrIII 16, agrIV 9. Conclusions: All patients carried at least 1 individual clone in their airway specimens. Only few clones were shared by several patients. Many isolates were positive for the exfoliative toxin eta or pyrogenic superantigens with sei being the most detected gene indicating the virulence potential of S. aureus in the background of CF.",

The strains of the first patient belonged to agr group I (4 strains), III and IV (1 strain each) and the strains of the second patient to agr group I, II and IV. By PCR, all strains were positive for fnbA, fnbB, clfA, clfB, sdrC and 62/77 positive for cna. There were different sizes of amplicons in some strains and their subtypes for cna, fnbA, fnbB, clfA and clfB. 17 strains were negative for sdrD and 6 for sdrE. Conclusions: By PCR analysis, strains were identified, which showed differences in amplicon sizes of special adhesins indicating changes in the repeat area assumingly due to adaptation of the microorganism to the hostile environment during longterm persistence. Acknowledgments: This study was supported by a grant of the DFG KA2249/1-3. In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) mutator strains may lead to the rapid selection of variants that are specifically adapted to the hostile environment of the inflamed CF lung. By a comparative proteome and transcriptome analysis of sequential, isogenic non-mutator and mutator isolates we identified changes in the physiology of PA during CF lung survival. An increased expression of several genes involved predominantly in micro-aerobic metabolism as well as in TCA-cycle, glyoxylate shunt and energy metabolism was found. For further analysis we performed lacZ-reporter gene fusions. Interestingly, PA1554, PA1557 (type cbb3 oxidases), oprF (nitrate uptake), idh and icd (isocitrate dehydrogenases) reporters were significantly increased under oxygen-restricted conditions in LB, whereas himD (\u0215-subunit of the integration host factor) and nuoA (NADH dehydrogenase) reporters revealed a significant up-regulation under oxygen-restricted conditions using artificial sputum medium used to mimic the milieu of CF airway secretions. Thus, these genes comprise potential key markers of hypoxic lung adaptation of PA. Moreover the specific activity of ICD and IDH isoenzymes was analysed under oxygenlimited conditions. Interestingly, under anaerobic conditions in particular ICD and under aerobic conditions in particular IDH contributes to isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. In addition, in silico analysis of these genes revealed a putative binding motif for anaerobic regulator ANR in the promoter region of these genes. To verify the role of ANR in the micro-aerobic regulation of these genes by band shift experiments we generated a mutated ANR (D149A) that is stable also under oxygen-rich conditions. In summary, these results suggest that PA1554, PA1557, oprF, idh, icd, himD and nuoA genes may be involved in metabolic adaptation of PA to micro-aerobic conditions of CF mucus.",

Brade 1 , T. Thymidine-dependent small colony variants (TD-SCVs) of Staphylococcus aureus can be cultured from the respiratory secretions of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF) and are associated with chronic and treatmentresistant infections. These characteristics, as well as the variety of mutations in the thymidylate synthase encoding thyA gene which are responsible for thymidine dependency, suggest that these morphological variants are hypermutators. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed the mutator phenotype of different S. aureus phenotypes, in particular CF-derived TD-SCVs, CF-derived isolates with a normal phenotype (NCVs), and non-CF NCVs. The comparative analysis showed that the CF isolates had significantly higher mutation rates than the non-CF isolates. The TD-SCVs, in turn, harbored significantly more strong hypermutators (mutation rate 10-7) than the CF and non-CF NCVs. Moreover, antimicrobial resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics including gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, fosfomycin, and rifampin was significantly more prevalent in TD-SCVs than in CF and non-CF NCVs. In this context it is of note, that macrolide resistance, which is usually mediated by mobile genetic elements, was conferred in half of the macrolide-resistant TD-SCVs by the point mutations A2058G or A2058T in the genes encoding the 23S rRNA. Sequence analysis of mutS and mutL genes, which are involved in DNA mismatch repair in gram-positive bacteria, revealed that in hypermutable CF isolates and especially in TD-SCVs, the mutL gene was often truncated due to frame-shift mutations. In conclusion, these data provide direct evidence that TD-SCVs are hypermutators. This hypermutability apparently favors the acquisition of antibiotic resistance and facilitates bacterial adaptation during long-term persistence. Pseudomonas aeruginosa owes most of ist capability to thrive under a variety of environmental conditions to ist modular genome and phenotypic adaptability. In chronic infections -such as in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis -P. aeruginosa easily adapts to its environment by developing variants that show increased resistance towards the host immune defense and antimicrobial treatment. Clinical and laboratory experiments have shown that P. aeruginosa can form a genetically diverse community generating an \"insurance effect\" by rendering the population more flexible towards environmental conditions. Since the underlying genetic variations range from insertion or deletion of large parts of the chromosome down to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), it is both essential and challenging to determine the complete genotype. We analysed 3 distinct morphological variants occurring reproducibly after a few days of incubation of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on soft agar plates. These variants exhibit large differences in motility and biofilm formation and remain stable under different culture conditions suggesting that this variation might be caused by genetic differences. A comparative genome hybridization (CGH) of the 3 variants with a recently described PAO1 whole genome DNA-microarray (PATA1) did not detect any genetic variation. Because of the limitations of PATA1 (SNP detection ~ 50 % sensitivity) potential small genetic differences might have been missed. Therefore, one of the variants was selected and analysed with an Illumina Genome Analyzer. Indeed, a single nucleotide exchange could be detected within the type IV fimbrial precursor gene pilA. This allele was confirmed to be present in 13 independent isolates suggesting a strong link between allele and phenotype. We demonstrate the applicability of microarray based comparative genome hybridization and next generation sequencing to unravel the genetic determinants of phenotypic variants.",

            "text": "The In cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease Pseudomonas aeruginosa has to conquer a challenging environment, which is characterized by chronic inflammation, mucus plugging and recurrent antibiotic treatments. By the comparison of isogenic non-mutator and mutator CF isolates of P. aeruginosa, we showed that isolates from end-stage CF lung disease are characterized in particular by adaptations in metabolism and pathogenicity. Among adaptive changes that are probably selected by the prevailing growth conditions of hypoxic CF mucus, we found that PA3126 was significantly hyperexpressed in end-stage likely best lung-adapted mutator strains. PA3126 of P. aeruginosa shows 67% amino acid homology to the small heat shock protein IbpA of E. coli. Small heat shock proteins (sHSP) serve as helper proteins that bind denatured proteins and facilitate subsequent refolding by ATP-dependent major heat shock proteins (HSP). HSP stabilize and protect intracellular proteins as chaperones but may also act as proteases that degrade them in consequence of heat, oxidative or other environmental stresses. At present, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of sHSP. To elucidate the role of IbpA for CF lung adaptation, we investigated the regulation and relevance of P. aeruginosa IbpA (PA3126) under stress conditions expected to predominate in the chronically infected CF lung. By LacZ reporter gene assays in PAO1 we found high ibpA promoter activity under low oxygen conditions in artificial sputum medium (ASM) used to mimic composition of CF mucus. Moreover, we determined growth and survival of an ibpA transposon mutant, the relative expression of ibpA gene and the proteome of ibpA mutant under anaerobic, oxidative and heat stress conditions. These data indicate that IbpA may play an important role during persistence of P. aeruginosa in the stressful CF lung. Yersinia enterocolitica 4/O:3 is the most common pathogenic type found in humans and animals, especially in fattening pigs. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, gentamicin and chloramphenicol have been recommended for use in complicated yersiniosis. Emerging antimicrobial resistance has been recognised among zoonotic pathogens including Y. enterocolitica. Thus, the aim of this work was to study resistance patterns of 16 antimicrobial agents among Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 strains isolated from different origin. Antimicrobial resistance patterns of 359 Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 strains collected between 1999 and 2008 from Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Croatia were studied by the agar disc diffusion method (CLSI 2002) . 112 strains were originated from humans and 247 from non-human sources (pigs, wild boars, monkeys and pork products). Ampicillin (10 \u021dg), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20/10 \u021dg), aztreonam (30 \u021dg), cefotaxim (30 \u021dg), ciprofloxacin (5 \u021dg), chloramphenicol (30 \u021dg), colistin (25 \u021dg), erythromycin (15 \u021dg), furazolidon (50 \u021dg), gentamicin (10 \u021dg), nalidixic acid (30 \u021dg), streptomycin (10 \u021dg), tetracycline (30 \u021dg), trimethoprim (5 \u021dg), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.25/23.75 \u021dg) and sulfamethoxazole (25 \u021dg) were tested.

Resistance to streptomycin (8%) and sulfamethoxazole (6%) was observed among strains from different sources. Sporadic resistance to trimethoprim (0.3%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1%) was detected in Germany and Switzerland. All strains were resistant to erythromycin. Only 2 human strains and 1 pig strain were sensitive to ampicillin. Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 strains were susceptible to most of the antimicrobial agents.

Among the antimicrobial agents tested, the following \u0215-lactam antibiotics were included: penicillin G, ampicillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2:1), cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoperazone, ceftiofur, and cefquinome. To identify potential producers of extended spectrum \u0215-lactamases (ESBLs), all 100 ampicillin-resistant E. coli isolates were subjected to an initial screening for cefotaxime resistance and subsequent phenotypic confirmatory tests using ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanic acid and cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid disks as recommended by CLSI. A total of 11 putative ESBL-producing E. coli isolates was identified by this approach. Further analysis concentrated on an E. coli isolate from a canine respiratory tract infection. This isolate was resistant to all \u0215-lactam antibiotics tested, to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (2:1) as well as to gentamicin, neomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, enrofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (19:1). It carried two plasmids of ca. 10 and 50 kb, both of which conferred ampicillin resistance upon transformation or conjugation, respectively. Further analysis identified a blaTEM gene on the ca. 10-kb plasmid and an ESBL gene of the type bla CTX-M on the ca. 50-kb plasmid. Susceptibility testing of the blaCTX-M-carrying transconjugant revealed thatexcept \u0215-lactam resistance -none of the aforementioned resistance properties were associated with this plasmid. Sequence analysis of the blaCTX-M gene and its flanking regions confirmed the subtype blaCTX-M-1. Moreover, a complete insertion sequence IS26 as well as parts of the insertion sequence ISEcp1 were identified in the upstream region and part of an mrx-mph(A) operon in the downstream region of blaCTX-M-1.",

In contrast to the wealth of data on MRSA ST398 in swine, comparatively little is known about MRSA associated with bovine mastitis. This is mainly due to the fact that such strains actually occur rarely in veterinary routine diagnostics. During November 2008 to January 2009, six MRSA isolates from independent cases of bovine mastitis were identified in Lower Saxony. The six strains carried the gene mecA on SCCmec type V cassettes in four isolates and on a type IV.1 cassette in one isolate. The SCCmec type of the remaining isolate could not be determined by the PCR assays used. All six isolates had related ApaI-macrorestriction patterns, but were non-typeable by SmaI PFGE analysis. The results of spa typing showed t011 in five isolates and t034 in the remaining isolate. Susceptibility testing revealed that in addition to \u0215-lactam resistance, all six isolates were resistant to tetracycline via the gene tet(M), which was present either alone or in combination with tet(K) and/or tet(L). Three isolates were resistant to macrolides/lincosamides with one of them carrying the gene erm(C), one the genes erm(C) and erm(A), and one the gene erm(B). Trimethoprim resistance was detected in four isolates with three of them harbouring the novel trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK. Gentamicin resistance was detected in a single isolate which carried the gene aacA/aphD. Plasmid profiling and protoplast transformation experiments identified small erm(C)-encoding plasmids of 2.5 kb, a plasmid of about 4 kb with tet(K), and in two isolates larger plasmids which carried tet(L) and dfrK. Based on their pheno-and genotypic characteristics, the six MRSA isolates from bovine mastitis closely resembled porcine ST398 isolates. This observation suggests a transfer of such strains between different animal species.",

Microbiol. & Paras., CMUL, Lagos, Nigeria Background: Enterococci are usually part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. However, there are consistently cases of severe infections in patients with Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and virulent enterococci. Methods: We analyzed the virulence factors (aggregation substance (encoded by asa1), gelatinase (gelE), cytolysin (cylA), enterococcal surface protein (esp) and E. faecium-hyaluronidase (hyl)) of 150 enterococci isolates from Nigerian animal (chicken, pigs, cattle), human and environmental specimens by performing the multiplex-PCR. Antibiotic susceptiblity was tested by use of VITEK2. Vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by Etest. Results: Out of 150 isolates 105 (35 E. faecium and 70 E. faecalis) expressed gelE and approx. 50% enterococcal isolates expressed asa1. One environmental E. faecalis isolates expressed esp and one animal E. faecium isolate was positive for hyl. More than 50% were erythromycin and quinudalfopristin resistant, and one third was tetracycline resistant. Conclusion: The resistance results are essential for the treament monitoring and the epidemiology of the enterococci. The multiplex-PCR revealed a diffusion of asa1 and gelE among the five virulence genes. These were distributed among the animal, human and environmental isolates. There was no emergence of human esp-positive strain. Nevertheless one environmental esp-positive E. faecalis isolate from the Lagos Lagoon was detected which will be elucidated in future. Background: By considering the daily increase in drug resistance of various viruses, novel antiviral compounds extracted from natural resources -due to their fewer side effects, had always been important to researchers. In the present study, we investigated antiviral activity of the hot water extract of a green seaweed, Caulerpa sertularioides, collected from coastal water of Bushehr in the Persian Gulf, against Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1). Methods: The hot water extract of a green seaweed, Caulerpa sertularioides was sterilized by autoclave and filtration methods. After determining ist cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) value, the effect of the extract on the inhibition of HSV-1 replication was examined in Vero cell culture. Results: The extract showed antiviral activity against HSV-1 in both attachment and entry of virus to the Vero cells and also on post attachment stages of virus replication. Inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values of the autoclaved extract were 81\u03bcg/ml and 126 \u03bcg/ml for attachment and post attachment stages, respectively. IC50 values of the filtered extract were 73 \u03bcg/ml and 104 \u03bcg/ml for attachment and post attachment stages, respectively. CC50 values for autoclaved and filtered extracts were 3140 \u03bcg/ml and 3095 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: The hot water extract of Caulerpa sertularioides of the Persian Gulf had antiviral effect against HSV-1.",

Isolates showing a multiple resistant phenotype were further processed via agar diffusion method and MIC testing to determine the resistance profiles against 18 antimicrobial substances widely used in human and veterinary medicine. Additionally to the phenotypic resistance survey we performed PCR based detection of common resistance genes. To get knowledge on the phylogenetic background of the E. coli isolates we also performed Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. High rates of E. coli isolates from rat intestines exhibited a multiresistant phenotype with resistances for up to 11 antimicrobial substances including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines and sulfonamides. Resistance occurred most frequently against doxcycline and the beta-lactams ticarcillin, cefalexin and ampicilin. None of the investigated isolates was resistant against the carbapenems meropenem and imipenem. One of the multiresistant isolates showed extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) production of the bla CTX-M9 type. Sequence types (STs) determined via MLST included ExPEC-related STs, such as ST88, 70, 641, 428, and 38. The CTX-M9 containing isolate was assigned to ST131. This ST also encloses uropathogenic and invasive E. coli of the new emerging CTX-M15-producing O25:H4 clone which currently disseminates across the globe. Our findings indicate a common occurrence of antimicrobial resistant E. coli strains in rodents in urban settings, urging further epidemiologic studies in the future.",

Although there are some reports about the presence of ESBL producing E. coli in livestock and household animals, knowledge about prevalence and phylogenetic background of such strains is rather scarce. We therefore took phenotypic ESBL producing strains, isolated from urinary tract, wound infections, and few other indications in dogs (n=62), cats (n=22) and horses (n=36) in the last 12 months, and studied them for the corresponding bla genes by PCR and sequence analysis. More than 100 isolates were found to carry genes of different CTX-M types (mainly CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-15). Taking into account the total number of E. coli isolated from the different clinical sites and host species, ESBL producing E. coli of different CTX-Mtypes were detected with a prevalence of 7.3% in isolates from horses, 3.5 % in E. coli of the urinary tract of dogs and 2.5 % in that of cats. MIC testing of these isolates against 19 different antimicrobial agents revealed patterns of multiresistance. Phylogenetic analysis assigned the strains to more than 30 different sequence types (STs), including ST131, which has attained worldwide attention due to its intercontinental spread. In addition to CTX-M-15-ESBL producing strains in ST131 (n=8; Ont(rel.25):H4), other STs accumulated ESBL-producing strains from different hosts and countries possessing identical CTX-M-and O-types, such as ST410 (n=16; Ont:Hnt), ST224 (n=8; O8:H23), ST648 (n=5; O1:H6), ST405 (n=3; O102:H6).

Their ability to develop resistance against various antimicrobial agents is the major cause of treatment failure. In veterinary medicine, only a few publications deal with the occurrence and pathogenic potential of Acinetobacter species (sp.) in animals, notwithstanding its considerable isolation rate from animals in veterinary clinics. The objective of this study was the phenotypic identification of animal Acinetobacter isolates and assessment of their antimicrobial susceptibility status. Investigations were performed with 56 Acinetobacter strains isolated from 26 dogs, 23 cats, 3 horses, 1 guinea pig, 1 budgerigar, 1 cow and 1 clinical environment sample between 2000 and 2008. Phenotypic characterization below genus level included tests modified according to Bouvet and Grimont (1987) . By use of these tests, 52 strains were identified as A. baumannii and the remaining 4 organisms as non-A. baumannii sp.. Susceptibility against 27 antimicrobial agents, representing 13 different antibiotic classes, was evaluated by agar diffusion-and/or broth microdilution test according to CLSI guidelines. All isolates were resistant to penicillin and oxacillin, cephalosporins, lincosamides, phenicoles, rifamycines, makrolides and fusidic acid. Resistance to other \u0215-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and colistin occurred in 4 to 59 % of the isolates. Only imipenem and polymyxin B showed in vitro activity against 98 % of the strains. These data reveal A. baumannii as the most dominant species among the animal isolates in this study. Additionally, the high number of strains with multiple antimicrobial resistances from animals in veterinary clinics points out these organisms as potentially nosocomial pathogens apart from human also in veterinary medicine.",

Slightly increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) observed under carbapenem therapy are often due to increased production of efflux pumps or a loss of porins (outer membrane proteins, OMPs). Most prevalent is the acquisition of different carbapenemase genes by plasmid transfer which results in carbapenem resistance. In Enterobacteriaceae are KPC enzymes or metallo-\u0215-lactamases the main cause of carbapenem resistance. Here we report on molecular analysis of multidrugresistant isolates of different gram-negative species.

Gatermann 1 1 Abteilung f\u00fcr Medizinische Mikrobiologie, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany Background: Therapeutic options in enterobacteriaceae are limited due to an increasing prevalence of quinolone resistance and of extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL). Around half of ESBL isolates of our area carry aac(6\u00b4)-Ibcr as shown in a previous study. Aim of the current work was to further characterize plasmids harbouring ESBL in a selection of our ESBL strain collection. Methods: Out of a collection of E. coli (n = 102) and K. pneumoniae (n = 75) ESBL strains characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and seqeuencing of the ESBL gene 12 E. coli and 17 K. pneumoniae strains were chosen for further plasmid characterization. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH1 and selected on cefotaxim or ceftazidime containing agar. The presence of ESBL in the transformants was checked by a double disk synergy test. Co-transferred resistance on nonbetalactam antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion. A PCR and subsequent restriction analysis was performed to detect aac(6\u00b4)-Ib-cr. Results: Of the transformants 17 carried CTX-M-15, eight CTX-M-1, two CTX-M-14, one CTX-M-9 and one SHV-2. Nine strains carried aac(6\u00b4)-Ib-cr. No resistance against non-betalactam antibioticas was cotransferred in nine transformants. Tobramycin resistance was found in 65.5% of transformants whereas 34.5% showed resistance to gentamicin, 48.3% to sulfamethoxazol-trimethoprim, 20.7% to chloramphenicol and 13.8% to doxycyclin. Conclusion: A high proportion of ESBL strains in our area are positive for aac(6\u00b4)-Ib-cr and in this work we could demonstrate that aac(6\u00b4)-Ib-cr is carried on the same plasmid as ESBL in a considerable proportion of isolates. This is also reflected in the co-transferred tobramycin resistance. Resistance to 3rd gen. Cepahalosporins in Salmonella is due to acquisition of resistance genes. Plasmid-mediated ESBL genes as well as ampC genes occur most frequently. Here we report on molecular analysis of 45 cephalosporinresistant isolates of Salmonella. Cephalosporin-resistant isolates of Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium (n= 29), Infantis (n=5), Typhi (n=1), Paratyphi B (n=1), Enteriditis (n=1), Kentucky (n=1), Panama (n=1), Mikawasima (n=1), Virchow (n=1), and Subspecies I (n=4) were selected from the strain collection of the German National Reference Laboratory for Salmonella. All isolates showed the ESBLphenotype. By PCR and sequencing the ESBL genes blaTEM-52, (n=7), blaCTX-M-1 (n=32), blaCTX-M-15 (n=2), blaCTX-M-3 (n=1), blaCTX-M-9 (n=1), blaSHV-12 (n=1) and blaSHV-2 (n=1) were identified. Macrorestriction analysis revealed that 18 S. enterica ser. Typhimurium isolated from hospitals in five federal states in 2007 were identical. Retrospectively we found this strain again in three fecal specimen of swines from 2006. One S. enterica ser. Typhi was isolated from an Iraqi woman after her return from abroad. The strain contained blaCTX-M-15 and the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinant qnrB2. In all isolates the ESBL genes and the qnr gene were successfully transferred into E. coli recipients. ESBL-producing Salmonella are still rare in Germany. The strains are of animal origin or they are imported from other countries. Alarming is the easy transferability of resistance determinants among different enterobacterial species. Therefore there is an urgent need of surveillance of cephalosporinresistant Salmonella in humans, animals and food to prevent further dissemination and ensure the therapeutic success for treatment of severe infections as typhoid fever.",

Furthermore, ESBL production is also not associated with higher resistance rates against tigecyclin. These claims were investigated with the present study employing recent clinical isolates. E. coli isolates were selected for TET resistance (MIC 8mg/L). ESBL production was carried out with E-test determinations employing cefotaxime and ceftazidime with or without \u0215lactamase inhibitor. Thereafter, the tigecycline MICs of these strains were determined. Eleven out of 156 E. coli strains selected for this study were TET susceptible and ESBL positive (S+), 36 TET resistant and ESBL positive (R+), 79 TET susceptible and ESBL negative (S-), and 30 TET resistant and ESBL negative (R-), respectively. The tigecycline MIC distributions for these groups suggest that TET resistant isolates display a tendency for higher tigecycline MICs as compared to TET susceptible isolates. However, this tendency is currently not statistically significant. Further investigations with other Enterobacteriaceae are necessary to compare the results with those seen for E. coli. In recent years, the production of extended spectrum \u00df-lactamases (ESBL) in E. coli has significantly increased in human and veterinary medicine, primarily due to the spread of CTX-M-type ESBLs. Among the CTX-M enzymes, CTX-M-15 has currently been shown to be the most frequent one all over the world, and, very recently this enzyme was identified in a clonally related group of E. coli isolates characterized by their multi locus sequence type (ST) and O-type, namely ST131 and O25:H4. It has been shown that this group of ESBLproducing E. coli has emerged and disseminated in different continents with a major focus on human populations, while there is only one report about its presence in an animal, namely a dog with urinary tract infection in Portugal. To trace the possible spread of such emerging pathogens among the animal population, we investigated 122 CTX-M-producing E. coli isolates from dogs (62), cats (22), horses (36), a rabbit (1) and an American kestrel (1) for their phylogenetic background and resistance patterns, thereby demonstrating possible similarities to human isolates. Sequence analyses of the blaCTX-M genes revealed almost equal proportions of CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-15 type \u0215lactamases. Multi locus sequence typing enabled the strains to be assigned to more than 30 different STs, with the detection of ST131 strains being most appealing. The ST131-strains have been isolated in different European countries from urinary tract (n=6) and wound infections (n=2) in dogs (n=7) and one horse (n=1). Sequence analysis of the blaCTX-M genes confirmed the presence of the CTX-M15 type \u0215-lactamases in these strains and O-types were Ont(rel.25):H4. Macrorestriction patterns were either identical or closely related (> 80 % similarity), confirming a clonal relationship of the strains. Our results suggest that a transmission of the clonally related group of O25-ST131 CTX-M-15-producing E. coli has most likely been occurred between human and animals. ESBL producing isolates remain susceptible to cephamycine (e.g.cefoxitin) and carbapenems. Their prevalence can vary greatly from a site to another and over time for a given site. In this study was investigated prevalence of TEM in ESBL producing E. coli isolates. Material and Methods: It was used E. coli strains isolated from various clinical materials. ESBL production was investigated by double disc synergy test in these isolates. The bacterial strains were tested for resistance to amoxicillinclavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem by performing disc diffusion method. TEM-derived enzyme was determined by using polimerase chain reaction at isolates to be positive according to the double disc synergy test. Results: The presence of TEM type ESBL was detected at 84 of 156 E. coli isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility of these isolates were determined. All of ESBL producing E. coli isolates (TEM positive and TEM negative) were shown susceptible to carbapenems. It was determined to be low rate of in vitro susceptibility against other antibiotic. Conclusion: It was determined blaTEM gene about half the amount of ESBL producing E. coli isolates in our hospital. The research was shown that carbapenems are most effective medicine against TEM-derived and non-TEM derived ESBL producing E. coli isolates. We think that this results will useful at epidemiologic researches in the future. This research is supported by the fund of Gazi University. Increased numbers of Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) have been observed within the past years. C. difficle, exhibiting resistances to erythromycin and moxifloxacin (ribotype 001), were predominantly found in Bavaria (Southeastern Germany). Recently, accumulations of CDI were observed during cold periods. As previously shown, erythromycin and moxifloxacin were predominantly prescribed during the same seasons indicating use of these antibiotics for the treatment of respiratory infections. In the present study we compared data about the consumption of various antibiotic classes by outpatients in our region with the number of patients exhibiting C. difficile toxin (Tcd) positive stool samples. We found a negative correlation for cephalosporines class I (ATC index J01DB; Spearman\u00b4s rank correlation coefficient R = -0.446), \u0215-lactamase sensitive penicillins (J01CE; -0.480), combinations of sulfonamides and trimethoprim including derivatives (J01EE; -0.563), and macrolides (J01FA; -0.063). A positive correlation was noticed for second generation cephalosporines (J01DC; 0.711), combinations of penicillins including \u0215lactamase inhibitors (J01CR; 0.767), and for quinolones (J01M; 0.709). Regarding the association of quinolone prescriptions in detail comparably low positive correlation coefficients were calculated for moxifloxacin (R = 0.382) and levofloxacin (R = 0.553). However, a strong positive correlation coefficient of R = 0.917, p < 0.0001 was observed for ciprofloxacin. Interestingly, all C. difficile isolates found in our region were resistant to ciprofloxacin suggesting that the increasing use of ciprofloxacin may have contributed to increasing numbers of CDI. ",

            "text": "It is widely accepted that an increasing use of antibiotics selects bacterial resistances to the drugs given. On the other hand, it is known that restrictions for the use of antibiotics do not necessarily guarantee declining resistance rates by themselves. Here we present data about prescriptions of folic acid antagonists and ciprofloxacin to Bavarian (South-eastern Germany) outpatients between 2000 and 2006. Also the number of significant E. coli, isolated from urine samples and the proportion of E. coli resistant to co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin were monitored. Between 2000 and 2006 the sum of ciprofloxacin and folic acid antagonists prescriptions stayed constant. However, prescription numbers of ciprofloxacin increased while those of folic acid antagonists decreased, suggesting an apparent shift in the treatment of urinary infections toward ciprofloxacin. During the observation period the proportion of E. coli resistant to ciprofloxacin increased from 5% to 10% while that to co-trimoxazole increased from 21% to 27%. Since also the proportion of E. coli simultaneously exhibiting resistance to ciprofloxacin plus co-trimoxazole increased from 3.9% to 8.5% increased the use of ciprofloxacin seems to facilitate a selection of resistance to co-trimoxazole even when its use declines. As a direct result in 2006 only 68.9% of co-trimoxazole resistant urinary E. coli were susceptible to ciprofloxacin while in 2000 there were 81.4%. On the other hand, in 2000 only 21.8% of ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli were susceptible to co-trimoxazole and this proportion remained low until 2006 (25.3%) In summary, in Bavaria ciprofloxacin is increasingly used for treatment of urinary infections for outpatients. This development resulted in a marked increase of E. coli exhibiting resistances to co-trimoxazole and to a combination of ciprofloxacin plus co-trimoxazole altogether. PCR ribotyping of Clostridium difficile has been proven to be a valuable tool for identification of various strains. In comparison to other strains C. difficile ribotype 027 was identified as a hyper-virulent strain. Recently, also C. difficile ribotype 078 was suggested to exhibit increased pathogenicity. Our laboratory is located in Northern Bavaria performing microbiological analyses for more than 40 hospitals and 2000 ambulatory physicians. In a recent study, C. difficile ribotype 001 was most frequently isolated from patients in our region. In contrast, C. difficile 078 was found sporadically while ribotype 027 was not isolated. In this study, the distribution of C. difficile PCR ribotypes isolated within January -March 2009 was examined. Within that period 370 patients suffering from CDI were observed. For comparison, during the first three months of previous years only 32 (2000) to 264 (2006) patients had been noticed indicating a further increase of CDI in 2009. The median age of the patients was 79 years (54% female, 46% male). Most of C. difficile bacteria were isolated from inpatients and therefore considered as health care associated (85 percent, 310 isolates from about 30 different health care facilities). In contrast, 15 percent (55 isolates from 50 various physicians) were obviously communityassociated. In total 27 ribotypes were identified by PCR ribotyping. In agreement with our previous study ribotype 001 was still the predominant strain (58%). However, 12 isolates (4%) were ribotype 027 while ribotype 078 was not found within the observation period. So far our data show that the expected number of CDI per year was already overrun in the first three months of 2009. While the PCR ribotype 001still was predominant also hyper-virulent ribotype 027 was found in our region.",

According to the fact that mycoplasmas are cell wall-less bacteria macrolides are in most cases the first choice for antibiotic treatment of M.p. infections. Resistance to macrolides are based on point mutations in the domain V of the 23S rRNA gene of M.p.. The occurrence of macrolide-resistance was shown in recent studies from Japan and China in which up to 90% of M.p. strains investigated are resistant. A more comprehensive overview of world-wide macrolide-resistance is hampered by the problems in cultivating M.p. strains which is successfully established in reference laboratories only. The use of molecular methods like real-time PCR offers the possibility for a culture-independent characterisation of the circulating M.p. strains including their resistance. This is the first study mainly investigating respiratory tract samples from adult patients by molecular methods in order to detect the actual macrolide-resistance in M.p.-positive specimens. In addition, the investigation of strains isolated from patients of different ages were included to get a more comprehensive survey of macrolide-resistant M.p. over time in Germany. A total of 167 respiratory tract specimens of adult outpatients with confirmed M.p. pneumonia sampled between 2003 and 2008 and 100 patient strains isolated between 1991 and 2009 in Germany were tested for macrolide-resistance. Using PCR, realtime PCR and sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene of M.p. 1.2% of respiratory tract samples and 3.0% of strains were found to be resistant. The results indicate a limited but not negligible importance of macrolide-resistant M.p. in the investigated population which requires a monitoring of macrolide susceptibility of isolated strains or the testing of respiratory samples by molecular methods.",

Patients and Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of MXF and CLI in the treatment of odontogenic abscesses and inflammatory infiltrates. The analysis of microbial parameters was part of the secondary endpoints. Results: Two hundred five bacteria were isolated from 71 patients (viridans streptococci 77x, Prevotella spp. 56x, Neisseria spp. 19x, Streptococcus (S.) anginous group and hemolytic streptococci 17x, other anaerobes 15x, and other bacteria 21x). 98% of pathogens were susceptible to MXF followed by AMX/CLA (96%), LVX (85%), PEN (67%), CLI (60%), and DOX (50%). S. anginous group and hemolytic streptococci were detected significantly more frequent (p=0.04) in patients with abscesses (12/95) compared to patients with infiltrates (5/110). In four patients within the infiltrate group with therapy failure following CLI viridians streptococci (3x) and Neisseria spp. (3x) could be detected that were resistant to CLI. Conclusions: In this study MXF showed a convincing in vitro and in vivo activity against odontogenic bacteria compared to CLI that justify its use for treatment of odontogenic abscesses and infiltrates. Our analyses clearly indicate that S. anginous group and hemolytic streptococci are associated with odontogenic abscesses and that viridians streptococci and Neisseria spp. play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

We show that several nucleoside analogs, in particular halogenated derivatives of 2'-deoxyuridine, substantially impair bacterial utilization of extracellular thymidine in S. aureus. Time-kill methods revealed that combination with 5iodo-2'-deoxyuridine restored the antimicrobial activity of SXT in the presence of thymidine, leading to a bactericidal effect even at a concentration of 8 \u03bcmol/l of the nucleoside analog. Moreover, 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine combined with SXT showed a broad spectrum of activity in the presence of thymidine comprising several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.",

Recent numbers of Staphylococcus aureus infections show a trend to higher percentages of community aquired cases compared to hospital aquired ones. The risk of severe S. aureus infections is therefore no longer a problem restricted to health care units, but is also present in every day life. As a consequence, the continuing, rapid development and spread of resistance mechanisms of this pathogen against commonly applied antibiotics constitutes a major challenge concerning discovery or design of new antibacterial substances. Among a variety of compounds belonging to the class of bisquaternary naphthalimides, one substance meanwhile named \"MT02\", showed remarkable antimicrobial effects against gram-positive bacteria. For example, Staphylococcus strains had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.32 \u03bcg/ml for S. aureus strain USA300, 0.63 \u03bcg/ml for S. aureus strain RN1HG and 2,5 \u03bcg/ml for S. epidermidis strain 567. Comparative microarray experiments with \"MT02\" and antibiotics with known modes of action were performed to gain insight into the mechanism of \"MT02\". For this purpose, Ciprofloxacin, a DNA-gyrase inhibitor, Gentamycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis and Oxacillin, an inhibitor of cell wall synthesis were applied. The number as well as the type of genes that were significally up-or downregulated after treatment of bacterial cultures with \"MT02\" was most similar to the results obtained after treatment with Ciprofloxacin. Similar results were obtained with comparative radioactive whole cell labelling experiments: The recorded activity caused by the integration of radioactive labelled thymidine was strongly decreased after supplementation of Ciprofloxacin or \"MT02\" to the cultures. The drawn conclusion of these studies is that the bisquaternary naphthalimide \"MT02\" interferes with DNA metabolism in gram-positive bacteria.",

Heisig 1 1 Pharmaceutical Biology and Microbiology, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany In vitro selection of E. coli WT with ciprofloxacin yielded slowly growing high-level fluoroquinolone resistant (hl-fqr) mutants with mutations in genes gyrA, parC and marR. Growing these mutants without selective pressure resulted in mutants showing WT-like growth rates and partial loss of the mar phenotype. DNA sequence analysis of the mar loc revealed two different point mutations in marA. Thus this study aimed at investigating the impact of these marA mutations on the phenotype of the compensated mutants. MarA point mutations were introduced into the chromosome of parent strains WT and ist marR deletion derivative WTIII by site-directed mutagenesis to yield WT-S16, WT-S32, WTIII-S16 and WTIII-S32. MICs were determined in the absence and presence of Na-salicylate (SAL, activator of marA expression). While a deletion in marR slightly increased growth rate (WTIII 20min) compared to WT (15min), MarA point mutations alone had no and only a slight reduced influence on the doubling time of WT, and WTIII, respectively, (WTIII-S16 and WTIII-S32 18min). Antibiotic susceptibility as MICs (\u03bcg/mL) MICs were decreased by up to twofold and by fourfold for marA mutants of WT and WT III, respectively. Addition of Na-salicylate resulted in an increase in the MICs by up to fourfold for WT, WT III, and their corresponding marA mutants. A mar phenotype including hl-fqr can be reverted by two different marA point mutations leaving growth rate nearly unaffected indicating an essential role of mar genes for the development of stable hl-fqr. The emergence of antimicrobial drug resistance is of enormous public concern due to the increased risk of delayed treatment of infections, increased length of hospital stay, substantial increase in cost of care and high risk of fatal outcome. A prerequisite for the development of effective therapy alternatives, is the detailed understanding of the diversity of bacterial mechanism that underlie drug resistance, especially in problematic gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathogen provides impressive chromosomallyencoded mechanisms of intrinsic resistance, as well as the potential to mutate, gaining resistance to current antibiotics. In this study we have screened the comprehensive Harvard PA14 non-redundant library for P. aeruginosa mutants that either exhibited increased or decreased resistance against 19 antibiotics commonly used in the clinic. This approach identified several genes, whose inactivation sensitised the bacteria towards a broad spectrum of different antimicrobials and uncovered novel genetic determinants of resistance to various classes of antibiotics. Knowledge on the enhancement of bacterial susceptibility to existing antibiotics and on novel resistance markers or modifiers of resistance expression may lay the foundation to effective therapy alternatives and will be the basis for the development of new strategies in the control of problematic multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria. were calculated to interpret the results. Synergism was defined as FICI <=0.5, indifference as FICI >0.5 to <=4, and antagonism as FICI >4. Results: 125/140 tests performed with the 10 SA revealed no significant effect. In contrast, synergism was observed for 6, 3, 4, and 2 strains with CAZ, CRO, P/T and IMP, respectively. Likewise, the vast majority of tests performed with the 10 EFS strains revealed indifferent effects, but DAP plus RIF was synergistic against one strain. Of the 50 tests performed with the 10 EFM, 31 revealed no significant effect, while synergy was observed for 7, 6, 3, and 2 strains with RIF, AMP, GEN, and VAN, and for one strain with AMK.

With \u0215-lactams (in particular CAZ), however, there may be a synergistic effect against some SA, while DAP in comb. With RIF or AMP may be useful in the treatment of EFM infections.",

However, data on the susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators after the introduction of this new class of antibiotics in Germany in 2006 are missing. Tigecycline is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. Methods: In this multicentre trial, the susceptibility of clinical isolates of frequently encountered bacterial species recovered from wounds, intraabdominal specimens or blood were tested to tigecycline and 16 other antimicrobial agents (G-TEST II). The isolates were collected in 15 medical microbiology laboratories throughout Germany. The susceptibility patterns were determined using the microdilution method in a central laboratory.",

After 4 months on intensive care unit and a total of 6 months hospitalization the patient was discharged to rehabilitation in much better condition. Molecular PCR and sequencing analysis of the E. faecium isolate revealed the linezolid resistance to be associated to a point mutation in the 23S rDNA (G2576U transversion). This mutation has been previously described to cause linezolid resistance in clinical enteroccci isolates. The rapid emergence of resistance to linezolid in our E. faecium isolate contradicts previous reports indicating that such resistance arises only after prolonged therapy with this antibiotic. Interestingly, the linezolid-resistant E. faecium was isolated 6 weeks after termination of linezolid therapy, which is kind of unusual since linezolid resistance was so far described to occur during linezolid therapy. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can cause a wide range of diseases and is the cause of most hospital-aquired infections worldwide. Due to an increasing resistance against standard antibiotic treatments, it is highly desirable to develop novel anti-infective strategies against this pathogen. One major risk factor for the development of an infection with this pathogen is the colonization of the skin. Approximately 30% of the human population carries this bacterium in the anterior of the nose unsymptomatically, but if the immune system is weakened (e.g. in HIV patients or under immune suppression after organ transplantation), this colonization can lead to infections which originate from the patient\u00b4s own microflora. S. aureus is able to secret a variety of adhesion factors that enable the bacterial cell to adhere to the extracellular matrix and plasma proteins of the host. Our project aims to identify and to develop compounds that interfere with the adherence of S. aureus to epithelial cells to prevent or to interrupt the colonization of the skin. Therefore we established an adhesion assay which utilizes an automated microscope for the determination of bacterial adherence to eukaryotic cells: A novel quantification method suitable for high-throughput screening. The establishment and validation of the method is presented. Aims: The incidence of tularemia is low, but with a minimal infectious dose the causative agent Francisella tularensis is still considered to be one of the most concerning bioterrorist weapons. Recommendations for post-exposure prophylaxis and therapy have to be based on reliable susceptibility data. Due to a lack of European data, there is a need for results in a CLSI-approved manner. Methods: We determined the antibiotic susceptibility of a selection of F. tularensis holarctica isolates originated from Germany, Austria, France, Spain, and other European countries using a commercially available, customized broth microdilution testing system (MICRONAUT-S, Merlin, Germany). Furthermore, we included strains of the opportunistic pathogen Francisella philomiragia and some unusual strains of the genus Francisella. Our test panel comprised 14 antibiotics including chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, streptomycin and tetracycline. Results: As expected, the MICs observed were consistent with other published data of studies investigating the antimicrobial susceptibility of F. tularensis isolates. Although erythromycin is not a recommended therapeutic drug for tularemia, we observed two geographical distinct groups of F. tularensis holarctica isolates, that overlapped in a small region in Germany. In contrast to Francisella tularensis several strains of Francisella philomiragia were found to be resistant towards quinolones and tetracycline. Conclusion: Being performed in accordance with CLSI criteria, this study contributes reliable data of antibiotic susceptibility patterns of European Francisella isolates. Furthermore, the standardized methodology can be used for testing of suspicious colonies from clinical specimen for therapeutic guidance. Gentamicin or streptomycin should be preferred as therapy of Francisella philomiragia-infections in immunocompromised patients. Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance to antiseptics, disinfectants, preservatives and sterilants can lead to the formation of a special source of hospital-acquired infection -biocides solutions in which the hospital strains of microorganisms can emerge, survive and multiply. Therefore, monitoring of resistance to biocides among the hospital microorganisms is the actual task of medicine.",

Because selective markers for S. saprophyticus are limited, we searched for additional resistance determinants in clinical isolates. We found a tetracycline resistant S. saprophyticus strain and isolated and sequenced a plasmid, which belongs to the pT181-family that is usually found in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We named it pLMTS. Like pT181 it consists of 4439 bp with an GC-content of 31 %. The differences to pT181 manifest in 18 mismatches including 6 gaps. This results in 4 amino acid exchanges in the 3 genes repC, pre and tetK. We are interested in the tetK gene that codes for a tetracycline efflux pump, which may be used as a selective marker for the generation of mutant-strains. We transformed this plasmid into Staphylococcus carnosus TM300 and S. saprophyticus 7108 and they became tetracycline-resistant. We amplified the tetK gene plus its promotor region via PCR, ligated it into a mutagenesis construct and cloned it into the pBT2 shuttle vector. S. saprophyticus 7108 transformed with this construct is tetracycline-resistant. So we showed that tetK is active on pBT2 in S. saprophyticus. It was shown that a single tetK copy in the chromosome of S. aureus causes tetracycline resistance. So it is expected that it does so in S. saprophyticus permitting the use of tetK as a new tool for genetic manipulations.",

Univ. of Graz, Graz, Austria Antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) has increased world-wide, but varies within geographical regions. Therefore a retrospective analysis of resistance in S. pneumoniae over a period of ten years was conducted. Methods: From 1997 to 2006, a total of 1439 non-duplicated S. pneumoniae isolates was identified at the Institute of Hygiene, Microbiology and Environmental Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Austria, and subsequently tested for antibiotic susceptibility. For penicillin resistance rates (MIC >= 2 mg/L) were found to be consistently low at 0.3 % (2.7% of S. pneumoniae isolates were non susceptible pneumococci (MIC 0.125 mg/L to 1.0 mg/L). Increase of resistance was remarkable for erythromycin (3.5 % in 1997; 12.2 % in 2006) and clindamycin (1.8 % in 1997; 5.4% in 2006) . For tetracycline resistance increased from 4.5 % in 2000 to 8.8 % in 2006 and for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole from 7.1 % in 1998 to 9.5 % in 2006. No increase of resistance was found for chinolones, with an overall resistance rate of 0.3% over the study period. Contrary to previously published data resistance for penicillin remained at a constant low level over the study period. In accordance to international trends an increase of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was found whereas resistance for chinolones persisted on a very low level. Results for penicillin resistance underline the usefulness of local surveillance for the monitoring of the spread of this pathogen. The desperate need for new therapeutic approaches against notoriously antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus has led to a quest for new antibacterial target structures and lead compounds. However, only a few new potential targets have been identified and it has been very difficult to identify promising lead compounds in recent years. Here we characterize the antibacterial properties of the synthetic compound TPBC, which has recently been successfully used to protect biomaterials against devise-related infections. We demonstrate that TPBC has potent bactericidal activity against many bacterial pathogens while human cells are affected only at high concentrations.",

Detailed biochemical analyses demonstrate that TPBC blocks very efficiently the EII subunit of the bacterial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which has previously never been considered as an antimicrobial target. Hence our study reveals PDHC as an attractive target for novel antibiotics such as TPBC or related compounds. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of recently developed metabolomics techniques for analyzing the mode of action of antimicrobials. Introduction: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in primary care for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) without being warranted (e.g. common cold, flu). Physicians regularly mention patients' expectations as a reason for these prescriptions \"against better judgement\". Little is known regarding the prevalence of such expectations in Germany, potential causes and factors of influence (knowledge and attitude). Methods: In November 2008, 1778 persons registered with a large market research company were invited to complete an online questionnaire (multiple choice, Likert-scales) on expectations towards physicians concerning prescription of antibiotics and knowledge and attitudes regarding effectiveness and use of antibiotics in the context of URTIs. We calculated relative frequencies of answers (stratified by demographic variables) and used logistic regression analysis to identify determinants for expecting a prescription of antibiotics when suffering from a common cold. Results: In total 1076 persons (55% male) aged 15 to 78 years participated (response: 61%), of which 93% reported to use antibiotics \"only if absolutely necessary\". A prescription of antibiotics was expected by 113/1076 (10.5%) for a common cold and by 92.7% for pneumonia. Among predictors for expecting an antibiotic prescription for common colds were the following opinions: \"common cold or flu can effectively be treated with antibiotics\" ",

Objectives: We evaluate the impact of the immunization of children <2 with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (3+1 doses) started in July 2006 on serotype specific incidence of IPD in Germany using capture recapture analysis. Methods: IPD cases in children <16y were reported by two independent sources: microbiological laboratories and pediatric hospitals. Serotyping was performed at the National Reference Center for Streptococci. Age and serotype specific incidence rates were based on capture recapture estimates combining the two reporting sources. Results: For children <2y, in the period Jul 08-Mar 09 eight out of 74 reported cases were caused by PCV7 serotypes in comparison to 88 out of 120 from Jul 05-Mar 06. This 89% reduction was most significant for serotypes 14 (48 vs. 5), 19F (20 vs. 1) and 23F (12 vs. 1). Serotyped cases with non-PCV7 serotypes increased (32 vs. 66). The incidence of IPD in children <16 decreased from 4.0/100,000 pre vaccination (97-03) to 3.2 post-vaccination (07-08). The reduction in incidence was attributed to significant reductions in children <2y (20.0/100,000 to 11.0). In this age group the incidence of all PCV7 serotypes was strongly reduced (4: 0.9 to 0.2; 6B: 1.7 to 1.0; 9V: 0.7 to 0.2; 14: 5.7 to 1.2; 18C: 1.0 to 0.3; 19F: 1.6 to 0.9; 23F 1.7 to 0.2). The incidence of non-vaccine serotypes remained stable. Conclusions: Two years after the introduction of PCV7, the reduction in reported cases of IPD with vaccine serotypes in children <2 was almost 90%. The incidence of IPD in children <2y was reduced by about 50%, whereas no significant increase in the incidence of non-vaccine serotypes was observed.This reflects the success of the vaccination programme. Possibly higher serotyping rates may explain the observed increase of reported cases of non-vaccine serotypes. We report the epidemiological analysis of a suspected MRSA-outbreak in a university hospital in southern Germany. The infection control staff reported a clustering of 7 nosocomial MRSA cases on 2 ICUs within one week. Investigation of patient history revealed the transfer of 2 patients from ICU-A to ICU-B. Because an ongoing outbreak was suspected, an additional screening of ICU staff was initiated and 8 members were tested positive for MRSA. The epidemiological analysis using spa typing was performed with all MRSA isolates and revealed two independent outbreaks: one with 4 patients on ICU A (spa type t785) and another outbreak with 2 patients and 2 staff members on ICU B (t032). However, the remaining 6 staff members were colonized with different MRSA strains not related to the two outbreak strains. Using the spatyping method we could dissect the suspected outbreak into two independent clusters including two staff members that had no obvious clonal relationship. In addition, we could prove that the 6 remaining MRSA-positive staff members were not involved in the outbreak scenario as originally assumed. In sum, our investigation clearly showed, that spa-typing is a very useful tool for the rapid analysis of suspected MRSA-outbreaks.",

Since 2007, a common approach for the admission screening of risk patients has been established in the network hospitals and its implementation has been supervised by the public health authorities. All hospitals agreed to perform S. aureus protein A (spa) typing of every first MRSA isolate from each patient and all blood cultures isolates. All typing results are collected in a central database. Since in the EUREGIO Twente/M\u00fcnsterland pig-farming has a high socio-economic impact, special attention was paid to isolates of the clonal complex (CC) 398 (e.g. spa types t011, t034, t0108). Increasing prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics is regarded to facilitate selection of multiresistant germs. Surveillance of outpatient antibiotic use might contribute to the efforts made for preventing the spread of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) within regional networks. In the EUREGIO MRSA-net, this issue has been addressed by offering training sessions on MRSA and antibiotic awareness to general practitioners in cooperation with the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Westphalia-Lippe (KVWL) which represents the German part of EUREGIO and other regions in North Rhine-Westphalia. Furthermore, in 2006, a possibility for reimbursement of MRSA eradication therapy in outpatients has been created. We present first data comparing the use of selected antibiotics in outpatient care of 2.875 medical doctors in the EUREGIO to 13.538 in the KVWL region. Regional data for outpatient prescription of antibiotics (based on Defined Daily Doses (DDD)) were collected by the KVWL and analyzed for the years 2002 to 2007. In order to compare the prescription of different antibiotics like fluoroquinolones or mupirocin in the EUREGIO to the whole KVWL region, we used the Cochrane Armitage Trend Test. Altogether, a total of 12.3 DDD / day per 1,000 inhabitants (DID) were prescribed in 2002, followed by 12.9 DID, 12.9 DID, 14.4 DID, 13.8 DID and 14.4 DID from 2003 to 2007, respectively. The increase in the total number of all antibiotics and the number of fluorochinolone prescriptions was significantly lower in EUREGIO compared to whole KVWL region. In contrast, the number of mupirocin prescriptions increased significantly more in EUREGIO than in KVWL region. As desirable, EUREGIO tends to prudent antibiotic use. The increasing number of mupirocin prescription among outpatients reflects the growing demand and, facilitated by new refunding possibilities, the increasing implementation of MRSA eradication therapy in outpatient care.",

Preliminary results of E. coli resistance against Cefotaxim and Ciprofloxacin are 6.5%, 20.7% respectively in stationary medicine, and 2.6%,14.4% respectively in ambulatory practice. For K. pneumoniae, resistance against Cefotaxim is 10.6% in stationary medicine and 2.4% in ambulatory practice. In comparison to E. coli, resistance against Ciprofloxacin is lower (stationary: 13.9%, ambulatory: 6.3%). For P. aeruginosa resistance of Ceftazidim, Piperacillin, Imipenem, Ciprofloxacin in stationary medicine are 6.5%, 7.0%, 7.0%, 15.8%, and in ambulatory medicine, 2.0%, 2.7%, 2.8%, 10.6% respectively. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus reaches 25.7% in stationary medicine and 16.5% in ambulatory practice. Conclusion: Consistent with previous findings and across all pathogens, investigated resistance against antibiotics is clearly more prevalent in hospitals than in out-patient health care.Expansion and continuation of this surveillance system will allow a more representative interpretation of the epidemiological situation and identification of trends in Germany. Median erythromycin use accounted for 52% of total macrolide use in interdisciplinary ICUs, 26% in medical, but 80% in surgical ICUs. The median percentage of macrolides on total antibiotic use was 9% (range 0-13) in interdisciplinary, 7% (range 4-24) in medical and 3% (range 0-12) in surgical ICUs. Conclusion: Erythromycin is not only used as an antibiotic but also as a systemic acting prokinetic drug e.g. to treat postoperative adynamic ileus in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. However, recent Cochrane reports stated that erythromycin showed \"homogenous and consistent absence of effect\" as prokinetic drug. Therefore, it seems most worthwhile to revise this indication of erythromycin use all the more macrolide use accounted considerably to total antibiotic use in some ICUs and because erythromycin use promotes the spread of antibiotic resistance and is a known risk factor for MRSA.",

The present study analysed bacterial strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects of VSL#3 on intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and protective mechanisms of VSL#3 in the context of ileal and colonic inflammation. VSL#3 selectively inhibited TNF-induced secretion of the T-cell chemokine interferon-inducible protein (IP-10) in Mode-K cells. Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) cell surface proteins as well as PMSF-sensitive secreted proteins were identified to be the active components of VSL#3, suggesting bacterial proteases to play a role in the inhibition of IP-10. L. casei failed to block TNF-induced IP-10 gene transcription whereas IP-10 secretion and IP-10-mediated T-cell transmigration were inhibited. Kinetic-and pulse-chase experiments as well as brefeldin A-induced blockade of the export machinery showed that L. casei did not impair initial IP-10 production but decreased intracellular IP-10 stability. The inhibition of vesicular trafficking by 3-methyladenine inhibited IP-10 but not IL-6 expression, mimicking the inhibitory effects of L. casei. These findings suggest that L. casei impairs vesicular pathways important for the secretion of IP-10, followed by subsequent degradation of the proinflammatory chemokine. Pre-and post weaning feeding studies revealed that VSL#3 is not protective in TNF \u01fbARE mice. In contrast, VSL#3 feeding in IL-10 -/mice resulted in significantly reduced cecal inflammation and consistently IP-10 protein expression was reduced in primary cecal epithelial cells. We demonstrate intestinal segment specific effects of probiotic intervention correlating with IP-10 protein expression in the native epithelium. L. caseiinduced post-translational degradation of IP-10 in IEC was found to be a new probiotic mechanism contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of VSL#3.",

They are the most potent inducers of regulatory T cell (Treg) populations and therefore are important in tolerance induction towards commensal species. How this is achieved is not yet fully understood. In the present study, we investigated whether human monocyte-derived DC might interact and respond differentially to infections with the pathogenic Escherichia coli EPEC E2348/69, the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917, or the E. coli K-12 strain C600.

Strain-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of various strains and species of bifidobacteria was previously shown by our group in in vitro experiments using LPS-challenged HT-29 cells. Here, we analyse the anti-inflammatory effects of a strain of B. bifidum with good adhesive properties to intestinal epithelial cells in the Rag1 -/mouse model of murine colitis. The transfer of CD4 + T-cell populations from wild type C57BL/6J into congenic Rag1 -/mice leads to the development of colitis mediated by T-helper type 1 cells due to the lack of mature regulatory T-cells in these mice. In a placebo-controlled set up one group of Rag1 -/mice (Rag1 tm1Mom ; n = 4) received B. bifidum (2x109 cfu per animal) in PBS followed immediately by transfer of CD4 + T-cells. Two control groups received placebo of which one group also was transferred with CD4 + T-cells to induce colitis. Feeding with the probiotic and placebo was continued three times a week and weight was recorded for 34 days when all animals were sacrificed. The anti-inflammatory effect of feeding the B. bifidum strain was assessed by measuring weight and length of dissected colons, histology scores of colonic tissue samples, and quantitative real time PCR for various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, the composition of the bacterial flora of all mice was analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The activation of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation. In this study, we investigated the influence of bacteria-derived proteases on the development of intestinal inflammation. Monoassociation experiments of Wild type (WT) and IL-10 deficient mice (129SvEv) with Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) strain OG1RF revealed increased mRNA expression levels of the bacterial gelatinase E (GelE) under conditions of experimental colitis. To further characterize the role of this bacterial protease in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, we monoassociated WT and IL-10 -/mice for 15 weeks with E. faecalis strain OG1RF and isogenic mutant strains TX5264 (gelE deletion) and TX5266 (fsrB deletion) that lack GelE expression. Histopathological analysis revealed a significant reduction of distal and proximal colonic tissue pathology in the absence of bacterial GelE. Transwell experiments with concentrated conditioned media (CM) of E. faecalis OG1RF demonstrated a tremendous decrease of TER values in the murine intestinal epithelial cell line Ptk6 whereas the GelE deficient mutant strain (TX5264) did not affect the barrier integrity. Consistent with these results, purified proteolytically active GelE caused a dramatic decrease in TER values as well supporting the hypothesis that GelE impairs barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium. In this context we identified the barrier related proteins E-Cadherin and ZO-1 as potential targets of GelE. We showed that the E. faecalis-derived gelatinase E contributes to the development of experimental colitis in IL-10 -/mice. In transwell cultures GelE led to the impairment of epithelial barrier integrity, suggesting that bacterial proteases contribute to the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. In order to establish itself as a successful pathogen for acute and recurrent infections, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, GAS) has to pass layers of resident microflora to gain access to its final target, the epithelial cells of the upper human respiratory tract. Comparison of interactions between S. pyogenes and S. salivarius K12 or two strains of S. oralis, all members of the physiological microflora, were done to find out new promising candidate probiotic bacteria for S. pyogenes infection treatment. Co-culture experiments by direct or indirect contact as well as bacteriocin assays revealed that S. salivarius K12 can inhibit S. pyogenes growth stronger than S. oralis. SEM and CLSM analyses showed that S. pyogenes can establish itself as a member of mixed species biofilms with both S. salivarius K12 and S. oralis in vitro. However, S. oralis acts like a substrate for S. pyogenes in mixed species biofilms, whereas S. salivarius K12 becomes the dominant strain in mixed species biofilms with S. pyogenes. In addition, S. salivarius and S. oralis protect epithelial host cells from S. pyogenes inflicted damage when they were introduced two hours before S. pyogenes infection in adherence/internalization and cytotoxicity assay using HEp-2 cells as eukaryotic cells model. By SEM analyses we showed that S. salivarius acts as a probiotic via suppressing S. pyogenes growth by development of protective biofilms on the top of the eukaryotic target cells. In contrast, S. oralis induces protection of the eukaryotic cells without cell adhesion or biofilm formation, but by altering host immunity/cytoskeleton factors, surface proteins, proteases, chaperones based on HEp2-cells transcriptome data analysis.",

The balanced relationship between intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and gut microbes can be disturbed, resulting in the activation of the mucosal immune system which contributes to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We used a T84 cell culture model to analyze the cellular responses of IECs coincubated with the gram-negativ probiotic strains E.coli Nissle 1917, a colonization mutant (EcN-M1) and the urogenic strain ABU (83972). Taking into account that IBD may develop after defects of barrier function and based on Affymetrix microarray data for infected IECs we focussed on proteins of the apical junctional complex (AJC) (ZO-2, E-cadherin, Occludin). These proteins and therefore the general barrier function are also regulated on the protein level by different PKC isoforms. We used the transepithelial resistance (TER) of the T84 monolayer as a read out system for monitoring epithelial barrier function. Barrier function was enforced by probiotic E.coli and disrupted after EPEC infection (E2348/69), however, could be reestablished by incubation with gram-negativ probiotics. The analysis of miRNA expression (Febit) in IECs after co-incubation with probiotics confirmed the transcriptional regulation of important proteins of the AJC, of apoptosis mechanisms and of the inflammatory response. This study revealed cellular responses of IECs specifically induced by gramnegativ probiotic E.coli strains. Further insight into molecular mechanisms (e.g. miRNAs) will foster the development of new strategies for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.

In previous work we show, that monocolonization with B. vulgatus leads to enrichment of semimature tolerogenic lamina propria dendritic cells (LPDCs) characterized by low expression of CD40 and intermediate expression of MHC-class-II.

Interestingly, heat inactivated lactobazilli show the same effects on Candida infection and mucosal immune response like living lactobazilli. L. rhamnosus GG exert protective effects in a model of localized oral candidiasis that might be mediated by a modulation of TLR regulation.",

We hypothesized that bacterial adaptation is reflected by a modified bacterial protein expression. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis followed by electro-spray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify proteins differentially expressed in E. coli MG1655 collected from cecal contents of mice monoassociated with this bacterial species and in E. coli MG1655 grown under anoxic conditions on a complex medium reflecting the substrate composition of the animal diet. Proteins with the highest relative difference in abundance were aspartate carbamoyltransferase (13-fold) and 5'phosphoribosyl 4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole synthase (7fold). They play a role in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. We hypothesize that the availability of nucleotides in the cecum is diminished prompting E. coli to induce enzymes for their synthesis. The Nacetylneuraminate lyase was threefold up-regulated in cecum. This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of N-acetylneuraminic acid to form pyruvate. Its upregulation probably reflects the utilization of host glycoproteins by E. coli. Nacteylneuraminate lyase is key for the successful establishment of E. coli in the gut [1] . To further characterize the role of bacterial candidate proteins in the colonization process we are constructing mutants devoid of the mentioned proteins. Our results indicate that intestinal substrate availability is a key factor for the successful colonization.",

This balance can be disturbed leading to the activation of the mucosal immune system and contributing to the development of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We used the transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of a T84 monolayer after co-incubation with Gram-positive probiotic bacteria as read out system to monitor barrier integrity. Based on more than 300 differentially regulated genes and taking into account that IBD may develop after defects of the intestinal barrier function, we focussed on genes encoding adherence junction (E-cadherin and \u0215-catenin) proteins. Our data indicate that the barrier function is subject to regulation of different adherence junction proteins by Gram-positive probiotic bacteria. For in depth transcriptional analysis we focussed on miRNA expression. Preliminary results revealed different RNA molecules to be affected by different Lactobacilli species. On the protein level we investigated the regulation of adherence junction protein by assessing phosphorylation reactions of different PKC isoforms which appear to modulate the barrier functions of epithelial cells. Novel PKC\u012f and PKC\u0217 are upregulated after co-incubation of T84 cells with Gram-positive Lactobacilli. E-cadherin co-localizes with novel PKC\u0217 in response to L. acidophilus. Generally speakings the regulation of barrier function is subject not only to the presence but also to the activity of different PKC isoforms depending on the impact of different Gram-positive probiotic bacteria. Our study revealed cellular responses of IECs specifically induced by probiotic Lactobacilli. Further insight into the molecular mechanisms will foster the develop-ment of new strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. IBD).",

Our project aim is to engineer Escherichia coli as a vehicle for the intestinal delivery of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) which has emerged as a promising option for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Various bacterial transport systems have been evaluated for their ability to secrete IL-10 in a biologically active form. The most promising export systems were the E. coli \u012e-hemolysin transporter and the general secretion pathway using the leader peptide of the outer membrane protein F (OmpF) of E. coli. The complete \u012e-hemolysin operon was cloned into a pUC19 based vector except for the hemolysin A gene which was replaced by a modified IL-10 gene containing a linker and the hemolysin A signal peptide nucleotide sequence at the 3' end. The linker encodes potential cleavage sites for the outer membrane protease T of E. coli, thus enabling the processing of the signal peptide during the translocation process. Export of IL-10 by the Sec-dependent general secretion pathway was achieved by cloning a codon optimized version of the IL-10 gene with an OmpF leader peptide sequence at the 5' end into a pUC19 based plasmid. Secretion and processing of the recombinant IL-10 was confirmed by ELISA and Western Blot analysis of the different cell fractions. The biological activity of the recombinant IL-10 was verified by a proliferation assay using an IL-10 dependent murine mast cell line and an immunological assay measuring TNF-\u012e production of LPS activated monocytes following incubation with recombinant IL-10. In conclusion, modified bacterial transport systems enable E. coli to secrete biologically active recombinant IL-10 and thus render it a suitable carrier for delivery of potential therapeutics in the intestine.",

Cues from the commensal microflora are needed to maintain epithelial homeostasis, but the molecular and cellular identities of these cues are unclear. We show that signals from the commensal microflora contribute to the differentiation of a lymphocyte population co-expressing stimulatory NK cell receptors and the transcription factor ROR\u0216t that constitutively produce interleukin (IL)-22. Emergence of these IL-22-producing ROR\u0216thi NKp46+ cells depended on the expression of ROR\u0216t but not on IL-15, indicating that these cells may not be NK cells but rather be derived from lymphoid tissue-inducer (LTi) cells. Interestingly, these ROR\u0216thi NKp46+ cells are located together with ROR\u0216thi NKp46-LTi cells within the cryptopatches of the small intestine and both cell populations constitutively produced IL-22. IL-22 regulated epithelial expression of proteins involved in antimicrobial protection of epithelial surfaces and tissue regeneration (e.g., RegIII proteins). Mice genetically lacking ROR\u0216t do not develop cryptopatches and epithelial expression of RegIII proteins in the crypts was strongly diminished. We propose that IL-22 released by cryptopatchresident cells promotes mucosal homeostasis.",

To characterize the impact of a single nonpathogenic bacterial strain on the intestinal epithelium in the presence of an established microbiota, we inoculated reconstituted Lacotobacillus-free (RLF) mice at 8 wk of age with Lactobacillus reuteri 100-23. Primary IEC from the small intestine of L. reuteri-inoculated and control RLF mice were isolated 2, 6, and 21 d after inoculation followed by gene expression analysis (real-time PCR; Affymetrix microarrays) as well as 2-dimensional-gel electrophoreses (2D SDS-PAGE) and peptide mass fingerprinting via MALDI-TOF MS. At d 6, gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u012e, IL-6, interferon-\u0216-inducible protein 10, and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 was transiently induced, whereas gene expression levels of regulatory proteins A20 and Toll-interacting protein decreased. In addition, 8 target proteins with changes in the steady-state protein expression levels were identified at d 2 and 6 of L. reuteri colonization. Consistent with the absence of histopathology, L. reuteri-induced activation of primary IEC returned to control levels by d 21 after inoculation of RLF mice. The capability of L. reuteri 100-23 to directly trigger epithelial cell activation was confirmed in small IEC cultures using the murine cell line Mode-K. These results clearly indicate that the intestinal epithelium is reactive toward environmental changes induced by the commensal bacterial strain L. reuteri 100-23 even in the presence of an alreadyestablished microbiota. The induction of transient IEC activation may help to maintain mucosal homeostasis. In recent studies we administer and readminister the non colonizing strain L. reuteri DSM20016 after a wash out phase to study the IEC response after a second exposure to the same strain. The proportion of the two major intestinal bacterial phyla (Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) changes in obese humans and in animal models for obesity. Proposed mechanisms of a bacterial contribution to obesity include higher polysaccharide utilization efficacy, higher de novo hepatic lipogenesis and reduced expression of the fasting-induced adipose factor (Fiaf) in conventional than in germfree mice. We aim to identify bacterial species influencing host energy metabolism and dietary factors contributing to these effects. Germfree and conventional mice were fed either a low fat (LF) or a high fat (HF) diet. Germfree mice on HF diet had a higher energy uptake and a lower energy expenditure than the conventional controls resulting in higher body weight and body fat content. When germfree and conventional mice were fed a HF diet with the same macronutrient proportions but differing in carbohydrate and fatty acid composition, germfree mice gained less body weight than the conventional animals. We detected higher fiaf mRNA levels in the intestinal mucosa of the germfree animals but failed to demonstrate elevated Fiaf protein levels. Quantification of bacteria using the oligonucleotide probes Erec482 and Lab158 (Firmicutes) and Bac303 (Bacteroides) revealed dramatic changes in microbiota composition induced by changing the diets from standard chow to purified experimental diets. In mice fed the standard chow, 66 % of the total bacteria were detected by the three probes but the percentage decreased to 31 % and 18 % in animals fed the LF diet and HF diet, respectively. Sequence analysis and taxonomic assignment of 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed that Erysipelotrichaceae strongly increased in response to the HF diet. Nothing is known about the role of this bacterial family in the intestine. We conclude that not only host-bacteria interactions influence energy metabolism but that the type of dietary carbohydrates or fat can modify the interplay between host and bacteria.",

Although there are many findings about the mechanisms of its probiotic effect, not much is known about its adherence to human surfaces. We performed adhesion assays both with cryosections of human gut biopsies and with different human epithelial cells-lines. EcN is able to adhere to cryosections of human gut tissue, but its adhesion efficiency depends on the gut part. We observed a high adhesion rate to the terminal Ileum and the Colon descendens, whereas the adhesion to the Colon ascendens and the Colon transversum was very low. Additionally we could show that the adhesion efficiency of EcN could markedly be decreased by addition of polygalturonic-acid and pectic oligosaccharides. By testing different EcN-mutants, we were able to demonstrate that the expression of the flagella is necessary for its successful adhesion to cryosections of human gut biopsies, as a fliC-deletion mutant was non-adherent in contrast to type1-and F1C-pilideletion mutants. EcN adheres also very efficiently to the cell-lines Caco2 and T24. However, there was surprisingly no decrease in adhesion efficiency with the fliC-deletion mutant, indicating that another structure must be responsible for effective adhesion to the human epithelial cell-lines. Therefore we tested further adhesindeficient mutants and until now we can also exclude F1C-fimbriae, the capsule and curli to play a role in adhesion to Caco2-and T24-cells.",

The probiotic microorganisms benefit the host by strengthening of the barrier of digestion tract, modulating the immune response and preventing pathogenic infections. Previous effort by us and other researchers to generate germ-free Lepidopteran larvae have demonstrated the existence of health-promoting bacteria in insect gut. Laboratory cultivation and metagenomic enumeration were carried out to identify probiotic bacteria in the gut of Egyptian Cotton Leafworm Spodoptera littoralis. Unexpectedly low numbers of bacteria species were identified in laboratory-reared insects. Some of these species are metabolically active. The bacterial community varied from location to location in digestion tract, from time to time while insect aging, and when insects shift from one food source to another. High intestinal Escherichia coli numbers in IBD patients indicate an important role of this organism in chronic gut inflammation. Especially virulent E. coli genotypes are frequently detected in IBD. We aimed to find out whether gut inflammation in an IBD mouse model is associated with a particular E. coli strain.

Sequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes indicated that IL-10 -/mice harbour a significantly higher proportion of E. coli, Blautia producta and Entercoccus gallinarum in the gut than healthy controls. Culture based and molecular approaches showed that intestinal numbers of E. coli significantly increased with age in IL-10 -/mice compared to the wild type animals and that all animals were colonized by one single O7:H7:K1 E. coli strain, belonging to the virulence-associated phylogenetic group B2. A high number of virulence and fitness associated genes was detected in the strain's genome. Real time PCR analysis of E. coli virulence genes, using bacterial RNA isolated from caecal contents of 16 week old IL-10 -/and wild type mice, revealed moreover that the neuC gene involved in K1 capsule synthesis of the O7:H7:K1 strain is 6.8 fold upregulated under inflammatory conditions. This finding suggests that the K1 capsule is possibly involved in the adaptation of the isolated E. coli strain to inflammatory conditions of the murine gut. (EcN) is a well defined probiotic strain, which is effective in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis {Rembacken, 1999 160 /id}. The aim of this study was to explore safety aspects of this frequently used probiotic strain in immune deficient hosts. Therefore, germfree Rag1 -/mice were monocolonized with EcN. Upon transplantation of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells of healthy C57BL/6 donor mice the E. coli Nissle mono-colonized Rag1 -/mice died. Analysis of bacterial load in the peripheral organs revealed a massive translocation of EcN. In contrast, SPF Rag1 -/mice were protected even though the numbers of bacteria in the intestine did not differ. Furthermore, EcN monocolonized C57BL/6 mice showed no increased mortality rate indicating that CD4 + T cells were essential either for the inhibition of translocation or for the clearance of EcN from the peripheral organs. The translocation and dissemination are EcN specific effects, as they were not observed in germfree Rag1 -/mice mono-colonized with E. coli mpk, a commensal E. coli strain isolated from the murine intestine. Additionally, the dissemination of EcN in mono-colonized Rag1 -/mice was not flagella dependent, as the translocation of EcN \u01fbfliC and EcN \u01fbflgE to peripheral organs was comparable to the translocation of wildtype EcN. Surprisingly, transplantation of CD4 + T cells in germfree Rag1 -/mice before they were mono-colonized with EcN did not increase the mortality rate and only few EcN disseminated into the peripheral organs. This also indicates that CD4 + T cells seem to be essential to inhibit translocation of EcN or to clear disseminated EcN.",

Several human-flora associated (HFA) rodent models have been created for this purpose. However, it is important to recognize that not all HFA models are equal, and that their strengths and weaknesses must be taken into consideration when selecting the most relevant model for studying a specific human condition. In this study, we have evaluated the population efficacy, quality and stability of the transplanted human bacterial community in germ-free rats, GF mice and antibiotic-treated mice using such state-of-art molecular biological tools as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and pyrosequencing. TRFLP analysis followed by ordination and multivariate statistical testing revealed that GF rats were the most successfully colonized HFA model emulating the original human microbiota (in regards to both bacterial species present and distribution). No global differences were observed between different strains of GF rats or GF mice, ruling out that overall colonization was influenced by the recipient's genetic background. Pyrosequencing analysis of selected representative samples was used to assess the detailed bacterial community structural differences in these colonized rodent models. Such analysis gives a detailed overview on the fine-scale quality of the newly transplanted human microbiota. Overall, this work provides the first comprehensive report showing the dynamic colonization of a complex human bacterial community into different HFA rodent models. Although the GF rats were the most efficient model, an acceptable level of colonization of the GF mice still makes this model a useful tool, particularly as many strains with specific genetic deficiencies are available. The adoptive transfer of CD4 + T-cells into immunodeficient hosts is a well known model of inflammatory bowel disease. The development of colitis in this model is associated with the accumulation of activated CD4 + T-cells of the Th1 phenotype in the colonic lamina propria and results in severe colitis. Factors driving the Th1-biased T-cell responses like for example the CD4 + T-cell subset and the bacterial antigen inducing inflammatory responses, as well as the APC stimulating the response are still not defined. We monocolonized germfree Rag1 -/with either B. vulgatus or E. coli mpk. We analyzed specific pathogen free (SPF) and conventional (CV) Rag1 -/mice which differ in the composition of the intestinal microbiota. The differently colonized Rag1 -/mice were transplanted with CD4 + T-cells from healthy BL/6 donor mice and monitored for signs of intestinal inflammation. Furthermore histopathological changes and the phenotype of Tcells and DCs from cLP was analyzed. SPF Rag1 -/mice not show any signs of intestinal inflammation in contrast to CV Rag1 -/mice which developed severe colitis. Analysis of the intestinal microbiota revealed that induction of colitis in CV Rag1 -/mice was associated with an increase in E. coli but decrease in Bacteroidetes compared to SPF Rag1 -/mice and treatment of CV Rag1 -/mice with B. vulgatus was able to prevent induction of colitis. In line with this we were able to detect a significantly decreased Bacteroides to E. coliration in children suffering from Crohn's disease. This data might indicate that the intestinal proportion of E. coli to Bacteroidetes might be an important factor in induction of prevention of colitis in a genetically predisposed host.",

With the growing acceptance of this novel technology in the field of diagnostic microbiology and the broad availability of individual open platforms to perform an exponentially growing spectrum of in-house or commercially prefabricated PCR / NAT assays, there is a gowing demand for appropriate quality control (QC) activities. Therefore a program for external validation of diagnostic NAT-based assays was timely activated in 2002 by the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology (DGHM) and is now organized by INSTAND e.V., D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany (www.instandev.de) . This subset of INSTAND\u00b4s well-established quality control initiatives is termed \"Bacterial Genome Detection (PCR / NAT)\". The spectrum of covered target organsism expanded permanently and at present we offer certified proficiency testing panels for 12 prominent bacterial pathogens on a semi-annual basis. The talk will focus on the concept of our unique sample design and discuss some practical aspects as well as noticable problems experienced during the past rounds of PCR/NAT proficiency testing for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Bordetella pertussis, Helicobacter pylori, EHEC, Borrelia burgdorferi, Legionella pneumophila, Salmonella enteritica, Listeria spp., MRSA, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. With the help of selected examples, relevant benchmarks are summarized and an overall assessment of results reported by the participating laboratories is depicted. The value of Interferon-\u0216 tests for the discrimination between active and inactive tuberculous infections is still unclear. Patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) were tested and compared with patients with non-specific pulmonary diseases. All patients with symptomatic tuberculous infections diagnosed by clinical appearance and conventional methods (microscopy, PCR, culture) had levels of Gamma -Interferon (GI) >0,3 IU/ml (median 12 IU/mL) measured by the \"QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube-Test\". Thus, very low GI concentrations (< 0,2 -0,3, especially below 0,1 IU/mL) in patients with suspected TB (infiltrates in the lung, fever of unknown origin, extrapulmonary findings suspective of TB) can be regarded to have a low probability of symptomatic TB infection. In the group of low GI concentration all conventional methods showed negative results for TB and in combination with other diagnostic results during the hospital stay, tuberculosis could be excluded, confirming the negative predictive value of low IG levels. Exceptions were patients with proven TB and immunosuppression, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis during anti-TNF-\u012e therapy, or patients with genetic immunodeficiency, which had also very low GI concentration. Yet, patients with proven tuberculous lymphadenopathy of the mediastinum or neck, or other extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis showed a very high GI concentration of >10 IU/mL. Case reports are presented. Very low levels of GI are obviously associated with a very low probability of active TB, whereas high levels indicate active TB, -if clinical signs of the disease are present. Nevertheless, conventional microbiological tests for direct identification of microorganisms still remain the methods of choice for the daily clinical routine. Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne disorder caused by the spirochete B. burgdorferi. In Germany the number of incident cases is estimated to range between 40.000-60.000 annually. LB remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, but in most cases laboratory support is essential. LB is generally responsive to antimicrobial chemotherapy but the variable clinical picture, persistent symptoms following treatment in some patients, and ongoing problems with quality and standardization of diagnostic tests complicate the medical management of LB patients. Unfortunately, little is known on the resulting economic impact of LB on the German health care system. The GILEAD project is focused on a better characterization of the disease burden and the medical cost of LB in Germany. Here we analyzed in-and outpatient data concerning treatment and laboratory testing as provided by a German health insurance company covering 6,6 million members. Medical, epidemiological, and economic data (ICD-and EBM-codes) for 2007 are currently under investigation to identify the total number of cases with definite or suspected LB and to analyze the number of diagnostic tests and antibiotic treatments. Initial results suggest that in 2007 the diagnosis LB was coded in 23.310 out of 6,6 million insured members (0,35%). At the same time the number of hospitalized patients with suspected or definite LB accounted for 762 cases. The number of diagnostic tests ordered turned out to be 29.616 EIAs and 16.832 immunoblots. Moreover, a total number of 35.665 antibiotic treatments were administered. Concerning the outpatient sector, our investigations also revealed that for 2007 a total number of 203.871 EIAs and 58.737 immunoblots were reimbursed to the health care providers. Our study is the first investigation into the medical and economical burden of LB for the German healthcare system and suggests a high amount of inappropriate healthcare services. The findings coming from the GILEAD project will help assessing the economics of current and future disease management and prevention programs.",

Panels with three blood samples (stabilized, 400\u03bcl each), containing Toxoplasma-DNA (Toxoplasma genom equivalents (TGE)) or tachyzoites (10-5,000/sample), are distributed twice a year. The stabilized samples gave reproducible results when stored at room temperature and retested over a period of > three years. Participating laboratories (mean 40 per distribution) preferred in-house assays (>90%). Neither inhibition nor false positive results were reported. The percentage of correct results varied from 53.7% (10 TGE/sample) to 100% ( 500 tachyzoites/sample). Protocols, performances, and quantitative results of the participants differed widely; no single protocol proved to be superior to others. Conclusion: External quality control with blood samples is a promising step towards validation of Toxoplasma-PCRs in clinical practice. The reference material may help to increase sensitivity and improve standardization. The consistent goal of the MiQ initiative is to establish and improve the German Diagnostic Standards in the field of Medical Microbiology. For this purpose, an expert consensus is reached for every general topic on the specific analytic procedures including preanalytic issues, basic and extended microbiologic analysis in the diagnostic laboratory, reporting and interpretative aspects as well as quality assurance. The consensus statements are supported by an extensive literature review, and finally, each revised or new Standard is edited with the approval and support of other Medical Societies of the respective fields. Revision periods range between 6 and 9 years depending on the extent of diagnostic developments in the specific field. Currently, several MiQ projects are close to publication. This includes the revisions of \"Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques\" (MiQ 1), \"Parasitic Diseases\" (MiQ 4), \"Mycobacteria\" (MiQ 5), \"Infections of Skin and Subcutaneous Tissues\" (MiQ 6), and \"Lower Respiratory Tract Infections\" (MiQ 7 + 8) as well as the new MiQ projects \"Ocular Infections\", \"Myo_/Pericarditis\" and \"Validation in the Microbiology Laboratory\". In an advanced stage is the revision of the MiQ project \"Gastrointestinal Infections (MiQ9)\" and the new MiQ project \"Peritonitis\". In this symposium, selected aspects of recently published and almost publishable MiQs with interest to a larger audience will be presented. Moreover, we will report on the current status of recognition of the MiQ standards by AWMF. Finally, we will use the DGHM conference to approach specialists for a revision or first publication on MiQ projects such as \"Genital Infections\" and \"Multiresistant Bacteria\". The MiQ Procedures Quality Standards are an integral part of the Quality Assurance Initiatives of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Hygiene und Mikrobiologie and provide solid, expert-and literature-based practical recommendations applicable in all diagnostic microbiology laboratories.",

            "text": "Are pigs a possible reservoir for human Corynebacterium ulcerans infections? Identification of Corynebacterium strains from porcine nasal swabs with high fibronectin-binding capacities were purified and evaluated quantitatively in an ELISA-based binding test. BBK32 from PHei possessed a higher fibronectin-binding ability than that from B31. Further, a four amino acids variation in the 32-residue peptide (position 131 to 162) of PHei was responsible for the higher affinity to fibronectin. In addition, both gelatin and collagen could inhibit the fibronectin-binding capacities of most of the BBK32 polypeptides, however, the inhibition impact caused by gelatin or collagen on BBK32 from B31 is higher than that on BBK32 from PHei. Haemaphysalis qinghaiensis, a distinctive tick species of China, transmits pathogens like Theileria and Babesia to sheep, goats, yaks and cattle and is a major economic burden to animal husbandry in China. We therefore searched for an immunological control way against this tick. Two cDNA libraries of H. qinghaiensis were constructed from either adult ticks or eggs and 21 positive clones (named Hq02 to Hq22) were screened with polyclonal immune sera. Six reactive clones with full-length cDNA sequences were cloned by 5\u00b4-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Sequence analyses indicated that four clones encode myosin alkali light chain like protein, calreticulin, troponin T subunit and ribosomal protein L23a, respectively. The other two clones, Hq05 and Hq15 were novel genes of the tick. Hq15 was a tick salivary glandassociated protein. Expression profiles were determined by rt-PCR on cDNAs synthesized from eggs, larvae, nymphs and adults. Western blot using the expressed and purified recombinant proteins showed that Hq02 and Hq05 could only be recognized by polyclonal immune sera generated by immunization of rabbits with tick salivary gland extracts, while they did not react with hyperimmune sera from H. qinghaiensis-infected rabbits. This strongly suggests that Hq02 and Hq05 proteins were concealed antigens of the tick, while reactivity of recombinant Hq07, Hq08 and Hq15 proteins with the latter sera suggested that these proteins were exposed antigens of the tick. Anti-tick immunity of the recombinant proteins was evaluated on laboratory reared sheep. Vaccination with rHq05 and rHq15 conferred significant protective immunities. Compared to the controls, both proteins induced a 40% reduction in the amount of eggs laid by each tick. Moreover, immunization of sheep with rHq05 led to a 37% decrease in the hatching capability of eggs. These results show that both rHq05 and rHq15 are promising candidate tick vaccine molecules for the control of H. qinghaiensis.",

The number of isolates was slightly higher than in the year before, showing the continued acceptance of the reference center. 2292 isolates were included in studies on invasive pneumococcal disease in children and adults, invasive Group A streptococcal disease and colonization of pregnant women with Group B streptococci. Two new analyses were established: serotype 6C PCR and superantigen determination using multiplex PCR. In 2008, a strong focus was on the surveillance of the German pneumococcal vaccination program. In 2008 a clear reduction in IPD caused by isolates with vaccine serotypes was seen among children under 2 years of age as well as among adults. Antibiotic resistance levels among pneumococci have changed in 2008. The introduction of new breakpoints for penicillin has led to a lower level of resistance among non-meningitis isolates and a higher level of resistance among meningitis isolates. Macrolide resistance levels have gone down to 14,9% and 12,6% among children and adults respectively. This reduction seems to be correlated to the introduction of the vaccine. Resistance levels to clindamycin, tetracyclin, telithromycin and fluoroquinolones remained low. All Group A streptococci remained sensitive towards penicillin. Resistance levels for macrolides and clindamycin remained low (4,2% and 0,8%). In 2008 a study on Group B streptococcal colonization among pregnant women was initiated. Furthermore, two studies on acute otitis media, and a study on pneumococcal carriage among children were started.",

            "text": "Projects of the National Reference Centre for Helicobacter pylori N Three months after written susceptibility test based recommendations, information on the treatment scheme chosen and the therapy outcome is collected by use of a standardized questionnaire. The aim of this study is to evaluate which eradication therapy is most successful in a given pattern of antimicrobial resistance and to derive evidence-based recommendations for susceptibility test based H. pylori eradication therapy. In 2008 the NRC focused on establishing the national S3 guideline on Helicobacter pylori and gastroduodenal ulcer disease. Furthermore, the NRC participates in a European multi-centre study on primary resistance of Helicobacter pylori. Beside those epidemiological studies the NRC is engaged in molecular typing of multidrug resistant strains. Protocols to detect resistance mediating mutations in the 23S rRNA-(Clarithromycin), 16S rRNA-(Tetracycline), rpoB-(Rifampicin/Rifabutin) and gyrA-gene (Quinolones) were established. Recently the NRC as the first laboratory succeeded in growing Helicobacter pylori from heterotopic gastric mucosa (HGM) in an adult patient. A further interesting case was isolation of Helicobacter felis from a child's gastric biopsy. Monthly data on antimicrobial use were obtained from the computerised pharmacy database. Consumption i.e. antimicrobial usage density (AD) was expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) and normalised per 1000 patient-days (pd). Results: Mean AD of quinolones in 49 ICUs was 157 DDD/1000 pd ranging from 39 to 363 in 2001-2007. The mean percentage of quinolones on total antibiotic use was 13%. Quinolone consumption did not differ by type of ICU (interdisciplinary, medical, surgical). Total quinolone use significantly increased over time which was mainly due the increase of moxifloxacin from 0.5 to 36 DDD/1000 pd. The AD of moxifloxacin continuously increased by 0.5 per month whereas the use of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin stayed stable over seven years. Ciprofloxacin use was 116 and levofloxacin use 16 DDD/1000 pd in 2007. Conclusion: Quinolone use in ICUs increased significantly from 2001 to 2007 based on the continuously increased use of moxifloxacin. Quinolone use contributes considerably to total antibiotic use in ICUs. Furthermore, quinolones are not only administered in hospitals but substantially also in the ambulatory setting and in veterinary medicine. Therefore, this class of antibiotics exerts considerable selection pressure and collateral damage with respect to antibiotic resistance.",

For years, Germany has been plagued by recalcitrant rises of IMD in an area around the city of Aachen with a population of 1.1m bordering the Netherlands, leading to incidences of up to 3.1/100,000 (2005) . A previous collaboration between German and Dutch institutes showed that the responsible clone had the type profile B:P1.7-2,4:F1-5: in preparation) . New Zealand had also experienced a country-wide epidemic caused, among other strains, by B:P1.7-2,4:F1-5: ST-42 starting in 1990, which ultimately -type-19 . This findings suggest, that despite high regional incidences in Western Germany, spread of the outbreak clone east-and southward had not taken place. Serum bactericidal antibodies (SBA) against an Aachen type strain DE9686/04 using sera of 20 individuals obtained before and after vaccination with MeNZBTM indicate a rise of SBA-titres comparable to vaccine strain NZ98/254. All individuals had SBA-titres > 8 against DE9686/04 after vaccination. In conclusion, results indicate that the clone with the profile B:P1.7-2,4:F1-5:ST-42:MLVA-type-19 has not spread into control regions investigated, and that MeNZBTM might be effective in controlling this clone. Objectives: Significant regional variations among serotypes of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) are known. So far, no data have been published about regional differences among IPD in Germany. Methods: A population and laboratory based surveillance study was conducted in Germany to collect data about invasive pneumococcal disease in children < 16 years and adults 16 years. Isolates were identified using standard procedures including bile solubility and optochin sensitivity. Results: In this study, 3724 isolates were included. 2065 isolates were obtained from children < 16 years (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) , and 1659 isolates were obtained from adults 16 years (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . Results were classified to federal states and supra-regional trends illustrated by classifying the federal states into regions. Among childhood isolates, the most common serotypes were 14 (26.4%), 6B (7.7%), 23F (7.4%), 19F (7.1%), 1 (7.0%), 18C (6.2%), and 7F (5.6%). Serotype coverage for the 7-valent conjugate vaccine was 62.3%. For the 10valent vaccine and 13-valent vaccine (in development) the coverage was 75.5% and 84.8%, respectively. The coverage varies considerably among the federal states. Penicillin G resistance was observed in 7.4% of meningitis cases. Among adults, the most common serotypes were 14 (16.9%), 3 (9.2%), 4 (7.8%), 7F (7.5%), 1 (6.8%), and 9V (6.1%). Serotype coverages were 46.5% (PCV7), 61.1% (PCV10) and 76.3% (PCV13). Penicillin G resistance was observed in 6.4% of meningitis cases, at which considerably higher rates of resistance were observed in the North-East region (13.0%), than in the North-West (7.1%) and South (1.8%) regions. Conclusions: The present study describes remarkable regional variations of IPD in Germany both for adults and children and may serve as a basis for the interpretation of changes in IPD against the background of the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < 2 years in Germany at end of July 2006.",

Outbreak investigation: Stools from seven participants were available for examination and three of them yielded L. monocytogenes, all serovar 4b and identical pattern by DNA fingerprinting. Disease did not affect four persons who did not eat from a home-made meat dish including jellied pork in a small restaurant in rural Austria. 12 of the remaining 15 fell ill 24 -48 hours later (age median: 62 years; fever 12, diarrhoea 9, headache 5, vomiting 4, myalgia 2, sore throat 1). A 72-year-old man recovered from gastroenteritis, but has been hospitalised 19 days after the meal due to bacterial meningitis. Epidemiological investigation gave evidence that consumption of the meat dish including jellied pork was the most probable cause of the outbreak (p = 0.0015). In addition, microbiological examinations found L. monocytogenes (3*10 3 -3*10 4 colony forming units per gram) in the home-made jellied pork. The strain was not distinguishable genotypically from the human isolates. Active search for more cases in other visitors having a meal in the same restaurant yielded a group of four persons. Of them, a 48-year-old woman and her husband ate jellied pork and she fell ill from rhombencephalitis subsequently. Discussion: A single case of systemic Listeria-infection with a suspicious history (day trip abroad) gave reason for an active microbiological and epidemiological assessment by the Austrian Consiliary Laboratory for Listeria. An outbreak has been discovered, the most probable source has been found and an additional case of systemic infection (encephalitis) has been explained by the outbreak.",

Due to the ubiquitous prevalence of legionellae in water supply systems, strains isolated from patients and environmental sources have to be compared by molecular typing. For this purpose, a diagnostic microarray was developed and used to characterise a collection of L. pneumophila isolates. Genes used as targets were selected from previous studies (Th\u00fcrmer et al. JMM 2009:58, 588-595) .

Classical differentiation of suspected isolates is done by biochemical tests, which are time consuming and often give unclear results. Recently, matrix assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was shown to allow identification of isolated microorganisms within 15 minutes and is therefore a fast alternative for species differentiation. We used this technology in comparison with classical microbiological and molecular methods for the identification of Corynebacteria showing the usefulness of this methodology. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on 79 Corynebacterium spp. strains which were isolated from human clinical and veterinary specimens during a period of 10 years by the German Consiliar Laboratory for Diphtheria. 72 (91%) showed identical results when the MALDI technology using the provided reference database and a standard pattern matching algorithm (Biotyper 2.0 Software, Bruker Daltonics) was compared to the biochemical identification result obtained with API Coryne. After rpoB gene sequencing of isolates with differing results, MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the 7 remaining strains was confirmed. Two isolates which were only identified at genus level by biochemistry are now identified as C. amycolatum and C. coyleae, respectively.",

EHEC can cause bloody and non-bloody diarrhoea and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans, and fatal cases of acute renal failure are not uncommon in small children of up to 4 years of age. EHEC-infections in humans have been mostly associated with preceding consume of raw milk or raw meat products from ruminants. In addition, sandboxes, contaminated water, fruit juice or close contact to ruminants have been reported as source of infection but little is known about the occurrence of STEC/EHEC strains in other environments like poultry farms and petting zoos, especially in Germany. Therefore, in order to investigate EHEC sources other than oral infections due to consumption of unpasteurized milk or raw meet, we sampled petting zoos and laying hen flocks from May to September 2008. A total of 570 faecal samples from 11 species (goat, sheep, chicken, pig, rabbit, guinea pig, donkey, fallow deer, kangaroo, cattle and horse) were collected in 24 German petting zoos. In addition 82 faecal samples, 60 environmental swabs and eight feed samples from eight flocks of laying hens representing different housing systems were investigated. The collected faecal samples were treated by O157-specific immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and the sorbitol negative colonies isolated were tested for the presence of stx1, stx2, hlyA, eaeA and O157 gene by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR). We could isolate EHEC in six of 24 petting zoos (25%) in goats, rabbits and pigs and in four of eight laying hen flocks (50%). These results imply that sources other than ruminant products should be considered in future epidemiological studies concerning EHEC transmission routes.",

Though Shiga toxins are considered major virulence traits of EHEC, further potential virulence factors have been characterised in recent years, indicating that the pathogenesis of EHEC infection is a multifactorial process. One such additional virulence factor is the autotransporter protein EspP (extracellular serine protease, plasmid-encoded), which has been shown to cleave factor V of the human blood coagulation cascade. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of structural polymorphisms in espP genes, as well as functional implications of the respective variations on protein level. We analysed clinical isolates of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and EHEC belonging to 112 different serotypes and were able to distinguish five subtypes of espP (espP\u012e to espP\u0130). Within serotypes where multiple strains were analysed, all contained the same espP allele. Notably, EspP subtypes displayed significant differences concerning functionality of the encoded proteins and distribution in the analysed strain collection. While EspP\u012e was strongly associated with highly virulent serotypes and displayed full autotransport and proteolytic activity, the subtypes EspP\u0215 and EspP\u012f were either not secreted or proteolytically inactive. Moreover, these subtypes mostly occurred in strains with lower virulence. In conclusion, our data demonstrate the high degree of heterogeneity of espP among the strains investigated, leading to lack of proteolytic activity or transport function of subtypes EspP\u0215 and EspP\u012f. Despite this genetic diversity, the functional properties of EspP remained unchanged in the most virulent strains, supporting the role of EspP as a putative virulence factor of EHEC.",

Witte 1 1 Wernigerode Branch, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany Objective: MRSA CC398 is widely disseminated as nasal colonizer among industrially raised pigs and frequent in nasal swabs from humans directly exposed to pigs. It is also able to cause infections in humans. Knowledge on further transmission to nonexposed humans is an important prerequisite for assessing the potential risk for humans. We addressed this question by study on nasal colonization. Methods: The study was performed on 47 farms with MRSA colonized pigs and 229 humans (113 exposed, 116 nonexposed) working and living on these farms. Furthermore colonization of veterinarians and of their family members was investigated. For addressing dissemination beyond farms nasal swabs from 462 pupils attending a secondary school in a high density pig farming area were investigated. Nasal swabs were streaked onto chromagar MRSA as selective agar. MRSA detected were typed by means of spa-typing and PCR-typing of SCCmec elements. For antibiotic susceptibility testing MIC was performed by microbroth assay. Results: From 113 humans exposed 97 (86%) revealed as nasal carriers; from their 116 nonexposed family members 5 were positive (4.3%). According to multivariate regression analysis the risk for acquisition of MRSA is 138 times greater for exposed humans than for nonexposed ones; antibiotic treatment before sampling was without influence. Among veterinarians attending pig farms (n = 49) nasal colonization was found in 22 (45%) of them. In 15 families of veterinarians with 18 exposed humans 4 from 44 family members (9%) revealed as colonized. Among 462 pupils in only 3 of them MRSA CC398 was detected (3 from 40 living on pig farms). Conclusions: As already observed in studies in other European countries nasal colonization of humans exposed to pigs is frequent, and there is also transmission at low frequencies to humans living in contact. Spread beyond farms is obviously rare.",

Guenther 1 1 Institut f\u00fcr Mikrobiologie und Tierseuchen, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Fachhochschule Lausitz, Senfenberg, Germany Wild birds are supposed to be a perfect non-point source of zoonotic pathogens and different studies investigating the composition of their intestinal flora identified several bacterial species, all of which could pose a considerable threat to human health. A consequent molecular typing of these pathogens, however, has been only rarely performed, and in case of E. coli it is limited to the screening of virulence markers associated with enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). In contrast, there is not any study unravelling the role of free-living wild birds in distributing extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), such as uropathogenic (UPEC), avian pathogenic (APEC) and new born meningitic E. coli (NMEC) to environmental sources. We therefore processed fecal samples of Mallard ducks for E. coli and investigated unique clones, as defined by PFGE, for their virulence genotype. Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and in vivo experiments were performed for selected strains. Of 60 clones identified among 142 E. coli, 15 were recovered from multiple individuals (up to 23/clone). None of the strains harbored Shiga toxin genes, while other genes linked with intestinal pathogenic E. coli were only occasionally identified. In contrast, the strains possessed considerable numbers of VAGs (up to 30) linked with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including those coding for protectins, iron acquisition genes and adhesins. The pathogenic potential of selected strains was confirmed in chicken infection experiments. Moreover, selected clones were assigned to sequence types (STs) being most prominent for human ExPEC strains, including ST95 and ST73, as well as to the EcoR group B2, which is highly linked with extraintestinal virulence. In conclusion, Mallard ducks have to be considered as an important reservoir for zoonotic E. coli strains, thus serving as a substantial non-point source especially of strains capable of causing extraintestinal diseases. Coxiella burnetii (C.b.) is the causative agent of Q fever, and could be used as a biological weapon. Different genotyping systems are established for clinical implementations and for differentiation of a natural occurring outbreak from a bioterroristic act. The IS1111-insertion sequence, coding for the transposase, is found multiple times in C.b. genomes. In 2007, Denison et al. Established a genotyping system based on four of these regions, which were analyzed in PCRs. The algorithm, proposed by Denison et al., allowed a classification in the genomic groups I -V, according to the six groupings derived by different authors using plasmid profiles, PCR or restriction-endonuclease digested DNA. In order to accomplish a more detailed classification, we analyzed the seven published C.b. genome sequences and found 83 different IS1111-regions. Alignments could show, that 61 of them are present at least twice in the annotated sequences. After extending the published system by a group VIspecific and five additional IS1111-markers, we tested the 130 strains of our gene bank in PCRs with a common antisense primer binding inside of the elements, but different upstream located sense primers specific for each of them. Taken together we accomplished a more detailed classification of C.b. strains into nine groups. We detected members of group I -V, but no member of group VI. All members of group IV have the QpRS plasmid and all members of group V are plasmidless, having a chromosomal plasmid homologues. We divided group III in two major groups, one of them holding the QpDV plasmid, group I in two and group II in four clusters. However, there were no relations between IS1111-group and clinical symptoms, course of disease, geographical origin, or host species. In further studies we will investigate additional IS1111-markers, to refine our genotyping system still more. A microarray chip platform several elements could be analyzed simultaneously in one step, thereby making this method more suitable.",

A total of 180 E. coli were isolated from 1.400 faecal specimens of wild living rodents and were tested for the STEC-associated genes stx, eae and escV located on the pathogenicity island (PAI) Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE) by PCR. None of the strains harboured stx genes, while 10 (5.6%) were positive for escV and eae. These strains were further investigated for the presence of EPEC genes bfpB (bundleforming pilus B), EAF (EPEC adherence factor) and the EAEC gene astA. Three of the LEE-positive strains harbored astA, but genes specific for typical EPEC could not be detected. Therefore all 10 LEE-positive strains were designated as being atypical EPEC (aEPEC). Serotyping revealed three strains being On.t.:H6, four strains On.t.:NM and one strain each O179:H31 and O167:H, respectively. Furthermore, we tested the strains for known insertion sites of the stx lambdoid phages by PCR. As each of the 10 atypical EPEC strains harbored intact insertion sites, all would have the potential to function as a possible STEC ancestor. Multi locus sequence typing was performed and allowed the assignment of four strains to ST28, four to ST1094, one to ST1092 and one strain to ST1104. In order to gain DNA-fingerprint-profiles of the strains, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed, yielding to ten completely distinguishable PFGE-patterns. Our data argue against wild rodents being a reservoir for STEC. However, as 5.6% of all rodent E. coli harbor a LEE, these animals seem to be a reservoir of diarrheagenic aEPEC. As all rodent aEPEC have the potential to be transduced by stx-carrying phages, and the serotypes detected are STEC serotypes, rodents may act as carriers of pre-STEC strains, especially if the animals live in farm environments. Further studies are needed to functionally characterize phage transducing conditions for rodent aEPEC on a functional level.",

Although they gain more and more importance, many issues about their ecology, e.g. reservoir host specificity and transmission cycles, are still unclear. In spring 2007, 191 Ixodes ricinus ticks have been collected from 99 birds of 11 different species on a German bird conservation island in the Baltic Sea in order to test them for Borrelia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Babesia ssp. infections. Identification of the pathogens was performed by PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis. The majority of birds with positive ticks were European robins (Erithacus rubecula) and thrushes (Turdus ssp.). Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was detected in 27 (14.1%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 5 (2.6%), Rickettsia ssp. in 14 (7.3%) and Babesia ssp. in 9 (4.7%) of the tick samples. Coinfections with different pathogens occurred in 6 ticks (3.1%). Among Rickettsia infections we identified at least two different species: R. monacensis (6/14) and R. helvetica (1/14). Seven isolates were only characterized as Rickettsia spp. Further characterization of Babesia infections resulted in B. divergens (5/9) and B. microti (4/9). The fact that 11 ticks (5 larvae, 6 nymphs) were infected with B. afzelii suggests that birds may, in contrast to former studies, also serve as reservoir hosts for this species. Furthermore, birds are presumably involved in transstadial transmission of Anaplasma. Since we detected 5 Rickettsia positive larvae, transmission of those pathogens from birds to ticks is possible. Two birds were infested with more than one Rickettsia positive tick, which supports this hypothesis. The fact that we found Babesia microti and Babesia divergens in altogether 5 larvae suggests that birds might be reservoirs for both Babesia species.",

Possible coinfections with Borrelia spp. and other tick-borne pathogens like Babesia spp. are of great importance because in cases of human disease difficulties of diagnosis and treatment can occur. We investigated the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and Babesia spp. in a frequently visited forest region of Thuringia (Zeitzgrund, near Stadtroda). About 1000 ticks were collected in 2006 (n=506) and 2007 (n=494) and investigated for a part of the ospA gene of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and a region of the 18S-rRNA gene of Babesia spp. by PCR. Further characterization resulted from restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing. Overall, 27.0% (270/1000) were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., infection rate varied between 20.0% (86/430) in nymphs and 32.3% (184/570) in adults. Borrelia garinii (133/270) was detected most frequently, especially OspA type 6 (66/270), followed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (70/270), Borrelia afzelii (42/270), Borrelia valaisiana subgroup I (28/270), Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (5/270), Borrelia spielmanii (3/270), Borrelia valaisiana subgroup II (2/270) and Borrelia lusitaniae (1/270). 1.4% (14/1000) of the investigated ticks were infected with several Borrelia spp.. Babesia specific DNA was detected in 5.0% (50/1000) of the ticks with an infection rate of 1.9% (8/430) in nymphs and 7.4% (42/570) in adults. Babesia microti was slightly more prevalent (28/50) than Babesia divergens (20/50). Two isolates were only characterized as Babesia spp..

Our findings should point out that ticks are not only infected with a great heterogeneity of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. species and OspA types, but also coinfected with Babesia microti and Babesia divergens. Further studies on distribution, interferences with other pathogens or medical importance and the development of reliable diagnostic tools for human diseases are urgently needed.",

From about 30 spotted fever group rickettsiae described so far, at least 15 are known to be pathogenic for humans. Anaplasma phagocytophilum is the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA).

Individual ticks were investigated for a part of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) of Rickettsia spp. and the 16S rRNA gene of Anaplasma phagocytophilum by PCR. Further identification resulted from restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequencing. Overall, 14.7% (147/1000) of the investigated ticks were infected with Rickettsia spp.. After sequencing of 64/147 positive amplicons Rickettsia helvetica (29/64) was detected predominantly.

Moreover, there seems to be a year-to year variation, so in 2006 (130/506) there were more ticks infected than in 2007 (71/494). Our results contribute data on the prevalence of Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in Germany. Further studies on the circulation and co-circulation of both pathogens in the same biotope, their interferences, reservoirs or factors influencing infection rate like climatic conditions are needed. Evaluation of the importance of both organisms in Germany, but also in other parts of Europe should be accompanied by development of reliable diagnostic methods.",

In the alternate hosts there are two different stages: rapidly replicating tachyzoites and dormant bradyzoites. The tachyzoites are mainly found in an early stage of infection whereas bradyzoites persist lifelong within cysts. Tachyzoites and bradyzoites are known to express stage-specific antigens, which we recombinantly expressed in E. coli. A total of eight different antigens were first evaluated separately in an immunoblot assay with defined serum pools of patients with acute or latent infection or without infection to analyze their individual diagnostic qualities. After the antigens have been evaluated in regards to their ability to react with T. gondii-specific IgA, IgM or IgG antibodies of the respective patients groups, we established a lineblot assay for simultaneous testing of the different antigens. This lineblot assay is currently being tested for use as a tool to diagnose not only different stages of infection, but also to diagnose different clinical manifestations of toxoplasmosis, such as i.e. cerebral toxoplasmosis or retinochorioiditis, respectively.

Besides Shiga toxin (Stx), the major virulence factor, additional virulence determinants have been identified, such as the recently described autoaggregation factor EhaA, an autotransporter contributing to the formation of cell aggregates and biofilms. Furthermore, EhaA mediates adhesion to primary epithelial cells of the bovine terminal rectum. EhaA is highly prevalent among STEC strains (Shiga toxinproducing E. coli), but the distribution among other E. coli pathotypes is yet unknown. Methods: We analyzed 42 strains of the HUSEC reference collection (http://www.ehec.org/) for the presence of internal fragments of the passenger and translocation domain of ehaA by PCR, Southern blot and sequence analysis. In addition, the analysis was extended to a set of 200 E. coli isolates from ABU/UTI and bovine mastitis as representatives for ExPEC (extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli). Results: In total, 34 of the 42 HUSEC strains (81%) are ehaA positive. This amount correlates with the previously reported prevalence among STEC. Discrepancies between PCR and Southern blot results were not observed. In contrast, preliminary results of ExPEC strains reveal that up to 98% of bovine mastitis isolates encode ehaA, whereas the prevalence among ABU/UTI isolates seems to be lower (65%).",

Though the contribution of this protein to pathogenesis in not known in detail yet, it might participate in the colonization of both, humans and animals. Future studies will include additional pathotypes to elucidate origin and role of this virulence factor as well as ist contribution to HUS. Bartonella species are gram-negative, fastidious bacteria. B. henselae is found in cats and transmitted to humans via cat scratches or bites. In humans it causes cat scratch disease, which is associated with mild to severe clinical symptoms. The prevalence of bartonellosis among humans in Germany seems to be high, and severe clinical cases have been described. However data of B. henselae prevalence in cats and other animals are rare. The objectives of this study were to detect, isolate and genetically characterize Bartonella species in blood, obtained from cats in Germany. In our study we analyzed cat blood samples from North and West Germany by bacterial culture and PCR. From a total of 507 blood samples only 11 were culture positive, resulting in a prevalence of 2.17%. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism identified 10 of these isolates as B. henselae and one isolate as B. clarridgeiae. Furthermore, we performed a real time PCR based on the citrate synthase gen, to detect Bartonella species in blood samples revealed a much higher prevalence of 17.9%. Amplified fragment length polymorphism typing was applied to 10 B. henselae isolates from Hannover and 33 isolates from other studies. A dendrogram was generated that allowed identification of two major clusters with different sub clusters. Isolates from Hannover seemed to be more related as they belonged to a sub-cluster of isolates from Jena and Freiburg. In addition all isolates were subjected to multilocus sequence typing. Two clonal complexes comprising of sequence types that had 6 from 8 allels in common. Nearly all isolates from Hannover represented an individual sequence type.",

The regular life cycle of the parasite can be extended by a number of paratenic hosts. Recent incidental background findings of A. alata mesocercariae in meat of wild boars initiated a re-assessment of the potential human health risk as posed by this parasite. Since 1973 several reports about human larval alariosis in North America have been published. The parasite infestation in humans manifests itself in various clinical signs which range from low-grade symptoms and a diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis to an anaphylactic shock with lethal consequence. Nearly all cases of human alariosis could be linked with consumption or handling of game meat and/or frog legs. The risk for humans was generally ignored or at least postulated to be negligible until this issue re-emerged in Europe: Jak\u0161ic et al. (2002) and Gro\u00dfe & W\u00fcste (2004 , 2006 published results on repeated incidental findings of DMS in meat of wild boars during Trichinella inspection in certain areas of Croatia and Germany. The Federal Institute of Risk Assessment concluded that meat which contains A. alata mesocercariae should be regarded as unfit for human consumption. A final risk assessment could not be given due to the lack of information about both the prevalence of DMS and the suitability of Trichinella inspection methods to detect this parasite in wild boar meat. Against the backdrop of a general lack of knowledge in relevant areas of Alaria biology the own studies concentrate on the most pressing questions of the optimization and/or development of methods for reliable Alaria mesocercariae detection, the distribution of the mesocerariae within their paratenic hosts, i.e. identification of potential predilection sites, particularly in wild boars, and their prevalence in sylvatic populations of animals with respect to their introduction into the food chain.",

Intestinal hemolytic E. coli without such VAGs experienced much less attention in routine laboratory diagnostics and scientific characterization. Based on recent results we hypothesized in the present study that porcine intestinal hemolytic E. coli lacking IPEC-typical VAGs might be very similar to extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) regarding their virulence gene profile. We therefore tested 37 porcine intestinal hemolytic E. coli without IPECtypical VAGs, isolated from the intestines of clinically healthy as well as diarrheic pigs, for the presence of ExPEC-typical VAGs and characterized their affiliation to major phylogenetic groups by PCR. We could show that several of these hemolytic strains, predominantly representing members of the EcoR B2 group, carried a broad variety of ExPEC-typical VAGs. Detected genes were hra, papC, sfa/focCD, tsh, mat, chuA, fyuA, ireA, iroN, irp2, iucD, sitD, cvi/cva, iss, neuC, kpsMT II, traT, astA, vat, hlyA, cnf1/2, ibeA, pic and malX. Additionally, a representative strain of this collection turned out to be highly pathogenic in a systemic chicken infection model. In conclusion, we show that porcine intestinal hemolytic E. coli without IPECtypical VAGs share a considerable number of virulence features with ExPEC. Being present in the intestine of clinically healthy and diseased pigs, they could be easily transmitted into the environment, thereby posing a potential risk for human and animal health.",

In Iran, all of the confirmed AE cases were reported from Ardebil province. So, for establishment of a control program, we needed to know the ecology of the disease by serological screening of residents, detection of worms in carnivores and histopathological study on rodents in the region. Performing the study, firstly one thousand and one hundred residents from 53 villages including stable and nomad complexes in Moghan plain were selected randomly. After filling in the questionnaire, 5 ml of blood samples was collected from each person. The sera were examined by using a commercial Kit of ELISA. For the second part,two valid and highly sensitive tests; nested PCR and Copro-ELISA were used for detection of adult worm infection in 149 carnivores including 89 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 49 dogs and one jackal. Foxes and jackals were hunted under the governmental control program in the region. At final stage 245 rodents of 7 species were trapped and their livers were studied for detection of alveolar cysts by routine histopathology methods at parasitology laboratory of Pasteur institute of Iran. As the result 1% (11/1100) residents were positive for AE. The most infected age group was 21-30 years old with 46% (5/11) cases. In the case of rodents, 245 specimens of 7 different species were trapped in the region but none of them were positive for alveolar cysts. In the case of carnivores, all of cases were tested by Copro-ELISA and 30 cases showed positive of which 25 cases were confirmed by nested PCR. In conclusion, the comparison of results of our study with previous ones showed reducing rate of prevalence of alveolar echinococcosis. The main reasons can be distribution of developed agriculture and growth of the urbanization which has limited the habitat of wild life in the region.",

Thullier 2 1 Department of Immunology, Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany 2 Antibody Technology Group, Department of Transmissible Agents, Centre de Recherche du Service de Sant\u00e9 des Arm\u00e9es, La Tronche, France Aims: Tularemia is a highly contagious infectious zoonosis, transmissible by inoculation, ingestion or inhalation of the infectious agent Francisella (F.) tularensis. More than 200 species ranging from mice to men have been shown to develop clinical infection. Although serology is still considered to be a cornerstone in tularemia diagnosis, there is no fast and cost-effective assay which could also be deployed in outbreak situations affecting remote areas or countries with limited resources. Methods: To overcome this problem we developed a rapid test for tularemia serology based on lateral flow technique and analyzed 208 sera or antibody preparations derived from humans and five different other species. All specimens were tested in parallel by serum agglutination, ELISA and the new assay. Results: The novel test efficiently detected F. tularensis-specific antibodies in sera from humans and other mammalian species (non-human primate, pig, rabbit, mouse). This new tool required none or minimal laboratory equipment and results were obtained within 15 minutes. When compared to the method of microagglutination, which was shown to be more specific than ELISA, the ICT had a sensitivity of 98.3% (58 positive sera tested) and a specificity of 96.5% (58 negative sera tested) on human sera. On animal sera, the overall sensitivity was 100% (22 positive sera tested) and specificity was also 100% (70 negative sera tested). Conclusions: We have developed and evaluated a novel, cost-effective and simple diagnostic test, which can detect F. tularensis-specific antibodies in serum from humans and other mammalian species within a few minutes. Besides the confirmation of clinically suspected tularemia cases, this ICT could also be used as a valuable tool to monitor successful vaccination with live vaccine strains containing LPS (e.g. LVS) and to detect sero-converted individuals or animals in outbreaks situations or in the context of epidemiological surveillance programs.",

Besides Stx there are other virulence factors that take part in disease development. Here, we investigated the presence and further characteristics of bacteriocins that are natural antimicrobial peptides secreted by the respective organism within the strains of the HUSEC collection. The HUSEC strain collection consists of 42 well-characterized EHEC isolates (http://www.ehec.org/) that serve as a reference collection for HUS-associated EHEC. Within this collection, the presence of nine different bacteriocins (microcins J25, B17 and H47, colicins Ia/Ib, V, E1, 10 N and M) was investigated using specific PCRs and dot-blot hybridizations. Subsequently, PCR products were sequenced for further analysis. In total, by PCR 12 of the 42 HUSEC strains contained at least one bacteriocin encoding gene. Six of the nine different bacteriocins were detected, only colicins V, colicins N, and microcin J25 were not detected. Cross-checking by dot-blots resulted in confirmation of all positive PCR results. In addition, dotblot hybridization gave positive signals in 11 strains for 12 additional genes.",

Future studies will include phylogenetic analysis to determine the origin of bacteriocin genes in HUSEC and phenotypic characterizations and functional analysis of the bacteriocins. Infections with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are a major cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Shiga toxins (Stxs), especially Stx2, are believed to represent major virulence factors of EHEC, contributing to HUS pathogenesis. Beside EHEC-associated HUS, there are hereditary, atypical, forms of HUS, which are mostly caused by mutations of complement regulators. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not complement is also involved in the pathogenesis of EHEC-induced, typical, HUS, either by being activated directly or indirectly by involvement of ist inhibitors. Purified Stx2 markedly activated complement via the alternative pathway and was found to bind to Factor H (FH), however, only when it was active. No apparent cleavage or destruction of FH was visible and cofactor activity in fluid phase was unaffected, but clearly delayed for surface attached FH, where it is essential for host cell protection. Binding studies using FH constructs revealed that Stx2 binds to short consensus repeats (SCRs) 6-8 and SCRs 18-20, but not to SCRs 16-17, i.e. to regions involved in the surface recognition function of FH. In conclusion, complement, and in particular Factor H, not only plays an important role in atypical HUS, but most probably also in EHEC-induced HUS. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a highly pathogenic subgroup of intestinal pathogenic E. coli, can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and are the most common cause of acute renal failure in children worldwide. Recent studies have shown that the EHEC genome is not static but flexible and reacts quickly to milieu changes during the course of infection loosing not only Shiga toxin (stx) encoding genes but also genes of yet unknown functions. The aim of this study was to characterize the loss or gain of EHEC genes during infection. To study the genomic changes whole-genome microarray analysis of two EHEC O26 isolates from the same patient suffering from HUS were performed. The first strain was isolated from a stool sample during the acute phase of infection and the follow-up strain was isolated 8 days later. For confirmation, genetic changes were crosschecked by PCR. A total of 9308 genes were examined. Of these, 41 genes showed differences between the first and the subsequent isolate. During infection, 36 genes were lost and five genes were acquired. Thirty-two of the genes were located on the genomic island OI#45 and included also the stx operon. The other nine genes encoded different hypothetical proteins. The microarray results for eight genes were clearly confirmed by PCR. For the remaining genes, no clear loss or gain of genes was detected by PCR most probably due to changes in copy number. This study confirmed the flexibility of EHEC genomes during the course of infection. Future studies will investigate the changes on nucleotide level using whole-genome sequencing and the variable genes of unknown functions to clarify the genetic mechanisms underlying these changes. This may finally lead to better understanding also of the host factors that contribute to this genetic variability.",

Our actual investigations on intestinal innate immune responses towards commensal gut bacteria in animal models of intestinal inflammation have provided a deeper understanding on the role of the intestinal commensal microflora and corresponding host receptors in inflammatory bowel diseases. However, detailed insights into C. jejuni pathogenesis and bacteria-host-interactions are restricted by the lack of adequate animal models. We have recently established experimental tools to address the question how C. jejuni interacts with the innate immune system and to determine potential roles of commensal gut bacteria in C. jejuni infection. Oral infection experiments revealed that gnotobiotic mice generated by quintuple antibiotic treatment were effectively colonized by the C. jejuni reference strain NCTC11168 at high concentrations whereas mice with normal flora did completely eradicate the pathogen within one day past infection. Most importantly, the colonization resistance displayed by healthy mice was completely abrogated by intestinal inflammation. In mice with acute ileitis or chronic colitis C. jejuni colonized the entire gastrointestinal tract and translocated into mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, liver and cardiac blood. We conclude that intestinal inflammation might predispose a host for infection with a gastrointestinal pathogen which might have preventive implications for patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.",

Cuny 1 1 Wernigerode Branch, Robert Koch Institute, Wernigerode, Germany Objective: MRSA CC398 is widely disseminated as nasal colonizer of pigs, of other livestock and humans professionally exposed to colonized animals. Here we report on its emergence as the cause of deep seated infections of skin and soft tissue in humans. Methods: MRSA from skin and soft tissue infections in humans were sent to the author's laboratory as the German national reference centre for further characterization. The isolates were typed by means of spa-typing, SCCmec typing and microbroth MIC assay for antibiotic susceptibility. Attribution of spa-types to clonal complexes was performed by means of the BURP algorithm. Results: Among 127 MRSA isolates originating from abscesses and furuncles 5.2% were assigned to CC398. This corresponded to the prevalence of caMRSA (PVL +) ST1, 3.7%; ST5, 3%; ST22, 3%; ST59, 2.2%; and ST30, 5.2%. Most frequent were PVL pos. caMRSA ST8, 41.7% and ST80, 35%. There was no association with a particular spa-type (spa t011, t034, t0521). The isolates were resistant to \u0215-lactams, erythromycin, clindamycin, fusidic acid and partly also to cotrimoxazole, and susceptible to linezolid, rifampicin, fusidic acid, fosfomycin, tigecyclin and daptomycin. Infections caused by CC398 needed surgical treatment. All 7 humans affected had been exposed to colonized pigs as farmers or as veterinarians. Conclusions: MRSA CC398 is able to cause deep seated infections in humans with professional exposition to livestock comparable to PVL-positive caMRSA.",

            "text": "Background: Since 2004, there have been several lines of evidence indicating an increased tularemia activity in Germany represented by the rise of human cases and a growing number of F. tularensis infection in diverse animal species. Tularemia is a severe, sometimes fatal disease. For this reason, we tried to ascertain if the observed re-emergence is due to changes in endemic/enzootic activity of F. tularensis or is mainly related to increased application of novel and improved diagnostic tools. Methods: In Germany, tularemia is a reportable disease in humans and animals. We obtained and analyzed all publicly available data on reported cases from 2009 back to 1949, including information from scientific publications. Additionally, the laboratory records of the Germany reference laboratory, which had confirmed approximately 80 to 90 % of all human tularemia cases in the last decade and virtually all infections in animals since 2004, were dissected. Results: A clear, significant increase in reported tularemia cases in humans as well as animals (hares) was observed starting in 2004/2005: (1) Between 2004 and 2009 the incidence was five times higher when compared to recent fiveyears intervals dating back to 1970. (2) In 2007 the highest annually incidence has occurred for about 50 years. (3) A first air-borne outbreak involving 11 cases was notified in 2005. (4) In 2007 and 2008, F. tularensis was firstly isolated from blood in five patients resulting in at least one additional laboratory-acquired infection. Conclusions: Although diagnostic capacity was partially improved in veterinary as well as public health and clinical laboratories, this emendation can not solely explain the rise in reported tularemia cases in humans and animals. While first epidemiological as well a ecological studies revealed that tularemia is certainly underestimated, large-scale longitudinal studies are necessary to explore the whole extent of this severe zoonosis in Germany. Recent cowpox virus (CPXV) infections of humans in Europe transmitted from cats and pet rats have risen public awareness of this rare zoonosis. Based on serosurveys wild rodents are regarded as primary reservoir hosts, however, attempts to isolate the causative virus have failed so far. Cats can become infected while hunting and could therefore serve as a sentinel to determine a possible genetic variation of CPXV strains circulating locally in wild rodents. In a retrospective study we analysed 73 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin samples from cats with a histologically proven CPXV infection. In this regard the appearance of intracytoplasmic eosinophilic A-type inclusion bodies is a pathognomic marker for CPXV infection. Specimens had been collected in different parts of Germany during 2000 to 2008. Following DNA extraction part of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (about 270 bp) could be amplified from all but one specimen, thereby confirming the diagnosis \"CPXV infection\" which was based on light microscopy. Amplification of the entire open reading frame (about 950 bp) was not possible for the majority of specimens due to DNA degradation caused by fixation with formalin. However, sequencing part of the HA gene subsequently followed by BLAST search allowed identification as CPXV. 72 sequences could be allocated into 21 different CPXV genotypes, 10 of which have not been described before. A phylogenetic analysis was inferred and the geographic distribution was imposed on a map. Based on a known variation among CPXV isolates in central Europe which was also confirmed in this study, CPXV might have originated from central Europe. A geographically and host-related independent evolution might explain the genetic divergence seen today.",

Development and launch of novel vaccines has not seen a turn around before the late 1980ies, a trend triggered by the appearance of novel pathogens, the apparent stagnation to control the rebound of global infectious diseases, the pending threat of a pandemic flu and the spread of multi drug-resistant pathogens. The encouraging progress made in the scientific fields of immunology, molecular biology, genomics and host-parasite interaction, but also in the arena of novel manufacturing technologies has enabled and facilitated the development of novel vaccines. Vaccines based on vulnerable and sometimes outdated manufacturing sources are about to become flanked or even replaced by novel cell culture products, as seen by the introduction of cell culture flu and JEV vaccines. Furthermore, genomic approaches have helped to identify protective antigens which have stimulated the development of novel protein subunit vaccines, some of them in advanced clinical trials. However, induction of protective immunity often fails due to a lack of immunogenicity of vaccine antigens in the absence of adjuvants. Thus, adjuvants have been recognized as means to overcome some difficulties to potentate existing vaccines, but also to design novel vaccines. On the other hand, also new needle-free delivery technologies have the potential to facilitate the efficacy of existing vaccines and to enable novel vaccines by the virtue to depose the antigens at sites where the concentration of APCs is the highest; e. g. at the epidermis. For example a novel skin patch delivery technology has been developed and demonstrated to facilitate the efficacy of a \"panflu\" vaccine upon injection, but also to enable the development of an ETEC vaccine against traveler diarrhea. Viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family are characterized by a positivestranded RNA genome of 7 to 8.5 kb packed into a capsid of 30 nm. This virus family displays an important genetic variability. Recently, many new genotypes, species, and even genera, have been identified. In addition to this genetic diversity, the spectrum of associated diseases caused by these viruses is very large and ranges from the common cold to poliomyelitis. The Enterovirus genus is a prototype example of this heterogeneity at both the genetic and phenotypic level. It contains 11 species, 7 of which infect humans, including the 3 rhinovirus species. Despite their common genomic features, rhinoviruses are restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas enteroviruses infect the gastrointestinal tract and can spread to other sites, such as the heart or the central nervous system. Both rhino-and enteroviruses are also characterized by an important genetic variability, as exemplified by the existence of around 100 different serotypes and the recent discovery of new enterovirus genotypes and the rhinovirus C species. The presentation focuses on the following three aspects related to this genus: 1) the development of molecular tools for the detection and quantification of all rhinovirus and enterovirus serotypes, which allows to better appreciate the incidence of these viruses; 2) the phylogenetic comparison of rhinovirus and enterovirus reference serotypes and characterization of previously unknown cis-acting replication elements that may serve as classification tools; and 3) the molecular epidemiology of circulating strains that led to the identification of a new respiratory enterovirus and recombinant rhinoviruses.",

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) all express the same acquired resistance determinant, a low affinity penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a. However, resistance levels vary greatly between strain lineages and are strongly dependent on the strains genetic background. MRSA were initially confined to hospitals but have recently emerged as community acquired pathogens, associated with lower methicillin resistance levels and increased growth rates. MRSA also express varying degrees of resistance heterogeneity, differing in their ability to segregate subpopulations of higher resistance. Vancomycin resistance took longer to arise, has not spread as widely and appears to be more biologically costly. Although, even very small increases in vancomycin MIC levels, such as those seen in vancomycin-intermediate resistant S. aureus (VISA), can cause therapy failure. VISA phenotypes are acquired intrinsically, through the accumulation of mutations. Multiple genetic pathways can generate different VISA phenotypes, varying in resistance levels and heterogeneity, hampering identification of VISA by genetic and phenotypic methods. Traits common to VISA include cell wall thickening, decreased peptidoglycan crosslinking and an increased positive cell envelope charge, all of which sequester or repel vancomycin, preventing it reaching its site of action. High level vancomycin resistance, due to acquisition of the vanA operon from enterococci, is even more costly as it requires the bacterium to simultaneously synthesize a new resistant cell wall, while degrading any normal susceptible cell wall. Staphylococci posses a highly complex regulatory network consisting of two component sensor-transducers, transcriptional regulators and sigma factors, allowing them to sense their environment, nutritional status and cell integrity and enabling them to adjust their metabolism and control virulence factor production. Many of these regulatory circuits also strongly influence the expression of resistance, linking resistance to growth rate, carbon source availability and other environmental factors",

Only one (1.7 %) specimen led to contradictory interpretations (VIDAS high, ARCHITECT low). The Bravais-Pearson's correlation coefficient calculated for the quantitative test results was 0.91 (Upper Austria: 0.92, Styria: 0.89). From a linear regression model (adjusted R2: 0.82) we derived following formula for estimation of a VIDAS proportion (V) from an ARCHITECT proportion (A) and vice versa (lower and upper 95 % confidence intervals given in parenthesis): ARCHITECT and VIDAS avidity tests demonstrate a high correlation of quantitative values, and yield almost concordant interpretations if borderline signals are regarded unproblematic with regard to false diagnosis.",

Methods: The hospital infection surveillance system KISS (Krankenhaus-Infektions-Surveillance-Systems) has been used to record nosocomial infections (NI) in German ICU for over 10 years. KISS focuses on three of the most important types of nosocomial infections: lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchitis), primary bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections. Parallel special risk factors -devices like ventilation, central line and urinary catheters -are monitored. Up to four pathogens can be recorded for each infection. The reported surveillance data were collected in 483 ICUs in 340 German hospitals from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007.",

Since DAP may be used in combination with other antibiotics, we evaluated the interaction of DAP with other drugs against S. aureus (SA) and enterococci. Methods: 30 strains incl. MRSA and VRE were studied. Synergy testing was performed by using the checkerboard microdilution method.

Brunner 1 1 Institute of Health Economics and Clinical Epidemiology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany Objectives: The pharmacoeconomic impact and the clinical efficacy of sequential therapy (i.v./p.o.) with ciprofloxacin (CIP) is compared to parenteral treatment regimens in severe infections. Methods: A systematic review of published economic studies and a metaanalysis of clinical trials were performed based on a literature search in several databases (restriction year 1989-January 2009). Results: Six economic and twelve clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. The mean differences in costs i.v./p.o. versus i.v. were: -3.1%, 12.5%, 21.3%, 37.6%, 37.6% and 45.4%. Cost-savings were demonstrated in five economic studies with two results being statistically significant (p<0.05). In four studies, the costs were specified and the predominant expenses were hospital per diem costs (92.8%). Antibiotic drug acquisition and administration costs accounted for about 7.2%. More than half of the patients (69.6%) receiving CIP i.v. could be switched to CIP p.o. (1439/2068). Twelve RCT's were included in the meta-analysis of efficacy (n=1245). A greater clinical effectiveness for sequential CIP therapy was found (Relative Risk 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45; 0.93). The subgroup analysis of four studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness in the treatment of complicated intraabdominal infections yielded a RR of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.25; 0.85). A decrease in length of hospital stay for CIP i.v./p.o. was shown in six out of nine studies. Conclusions: Clinical outcomes of the trials with CIP i.v./p.o. demonstrate that sequential therapy is statistically equivalent to treatment regimens using parenteral medication only.",

Adhesion of these bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) could be an important prerequisite for their probiotic effects. Recent in vitro studies of our group showed that especially those strains of bifidobacteria that show good adhesion to IECs have a high antiinflammatory potential. We analysed the adhesive structures of a B. bifidum strain that showed excellent adhesion to IECs in previous studies as well as potent inhibition of LPS-induced NF-\u021bB activation. For this purpose, we established a method to obtain clean cell wall, membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of bifidobacteria. We were able to show, that in particular the cell wall fraction inhibits adhesion of whole cells of a B. bifidum strain to differentiated monolayers of IECs. To test whether the structures responsible for adhesion of a B. bifidum strain are cell surface proteins a B. bifidum strain was treated with pronase, lipase and periodate and cell wall fractions were prepared after the treatment. Several bands were absent in the cell wall fraction from bacteria that were treated with pronase in comparison to the cell wall fraction from the untreated B. bifidum. Furthermore, treatment of a B. bifidum strain with pronase significantly decreased adhesion to IECs whereas treatment with lipase and periodate did not show any effects on adhesion. This indicates that proteinaceous cell surface components are involved in adhesion of B. bifidum to IECs. Recently, BopA, a protein of the cell surface, was identified that was implicated in adhesion to IECs. We created derivations of a B. bifidum strain with altered expression of BopA and tested the in vitro adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Additionally, we overexpressed BopA in E. coli, purified the protein and performed competitive experiments.

Gunzer 1 1 Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, GermanySince its discovery in 1917, Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) has been point of interest for scientific research. Especially in the last years, the strain has been analyzed in many studies and projects aiming to characterize and subsequently utilize its probiotic effects. Even after having been established in the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, such as colitis ulcerosa or diarrhea, there are still dark spots in our knowledge, especially concerning the accurate molecular mechanisms of its probiotic effect. Genomic analysis has shown that EcN and E. coli CFT073 possess very large nucleotide homologies, despite their different effects on humans. Our aim is to investigate the effect of EcN and E. coli CFT073 on the adherence of enteropathogenic E. coli 2348/69 (EPEC) to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Human intestinal epithelial cell lines Caco-2 or Lovo were incubated with either EcN or E. coli CFT073 for two hours before infecting them with EPEC.",

Here, we investigated whether EcN cells killed or inactivated by different methods were still able to show antimutagenic action. Methods: To measure mutagenic and antimutagenic activities, the Ames-test with specific Salmonella and E. coli mutant strains, and the Comet-assay with Caco-2 epithelial cells were employed. The directly acting mutagen 4nitroquinoline-1-oxide (NQO) was used as test substance. NQO was coincubated in both mutagenicity tests with either live, UV-light-inactivated, ultrasound-treated or heat-killed EcN bacteria or with cell-free spent supernatants of EcN cultures. After sterile filtration, the co-incubation mixtures were tested for remaining mutagenic activity. Results: Live EcN bacteria did not exhibit any mutagenic activity, neither in the Ames-test nor in the Comet-assay. On the contrary, EcN dose-dependently inhibited mutagenic activity of NQO. UV-light did not affect EcN's antimutagenic activity, while ultrasound treatment diminished it. Heat-killed EcN bacteria and cell-free spent supernatants of EcN cultures did not show any revealed that the antimutagenic action of live EcN bacteria was not due to simple absorption of NQO to the bacterial cell envelope, but was the result of biochemical transformation of NQO. Conclusion:Live as well as UV-light-treated EcN bacteria display antimutagenic activitiy against the mutagen NQO. The antimutagenic action of EcN was partly lost by ultrasound treatment, and completely gone after heatinactivation of the bacteria. Our results show that this newly detected activity of EcN is dependent on the living cell, thus adding a novel feature to the probiotic nature of E. coli Nissle 1917.PWP08Bacterial proteases contribute to the development of chronic intestinal inflammation through the impairment of epithelial barrier functionsN.

            "text": "Corynebacterium ulcerans is an inhabitant of mucous membranes in animals and may cause different type of infections such as lymphadenitis, mastitis and respiratory infections in domestic and wild animals. In humans toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium ulcerans may cause a diphtheria-like disease ranging from classical and wound diphtheria to milder symptoms. Due to former findings human infections are usually associated with the ingestion of raw and unpasteurized milk and close contact to diary cattle, pet dogs and cats. Recently the first case of severe C. ulcerans diphtheria-like disease in a farmer was reported after contact with an asymptomatic pig harbouring the same toxigenic strain. We investigated nasal swabs of 63 asymptomatic pigs to examine these animals as possible carriers of C. ulcerans. All Corynebacterium isolates were identified by Api Coryne and matrix assisted laser desorption / ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Background: A country-wide prospective multicentre hospital-based surveillance of MRSA case-patients was established in the year 2003 with participating hospitals of the national German nosocomial infections surveillances system (KISS). This is called the MRSA-KISS module. Objectives: To assess regional variations of MRSA incidence densities in German hospitals. Methods: The data were recorded during routine surveillance by the infection control team of each hospital and send to the national reference centre for analyzing every year. The German Federal Counties were grouped into five regions to create comparable regions according to the number of inhabitants (North (N), West (W), East (E), South-West (SW) and South-East (SE)). The summarized data from 2006 and 2007 were stratified to the five regions and a multiple logistic regression was performed. Results: A total of 36,162 MRSA case-patients and 36,797,125 patient days from 169 hospitals were analyzed. MRSA identification later than 48 h after admission was classified into nosocomial cases. Hence, 28.1% (24.7% to 31.7%) were nosocomial and a total of 71.9% (68.3% to 75.3%) were imported MRSA case-patients. The total MRSA incidence density was 0.98. The data show significant differences of the regions. MRSA incidence densities (ID; median) (MRSA case-patients per 1,000 patient days) of 169 hospitals grouped into five regions showed significantly variations (p=0.009) East (ID 0.69; CI95 0.94; 0.98), South-East (ID 1.11; CI95 1.34; 1.40), South-West (ID 0.77; CI95 0.75; 0.80), North (ID 0.63; CI95 0.78; 0.81), West (ID 0.96; CI95 0.98; 1.03) and total (ID 0.83; CI95 0.97; 0.99) . Conclusion: This study demonstrated significant regional variations according to the MRSA incidence densities, which may be explained by differences of the various dominating MRSA strains or variations of the infection control habits among the regions. Serogroup W-135 and Y meningococci express capsule polysaccharide polymerases (SiaDW-135 and SiaDY) that are 98% identical in their amino acid sequences (n=1037 aa). Recently, we identified amino acid 310 within the EX7E motif of the enzyme's nucleotide recognition domain as the crucial position that determines the specificity towards UDP-galactose or UDP-glucose (Claus et al., 2009) . Now, we analysed the sequence of the EX7E motif of 206 meningococcal disease isolates and 94 carriage isolates which had been assigned to serogroup W-135 and Y, respectively, by slide agglutination. 86 of 90 W-135 isolates (96%) harboured the galactosyltransferase motif EX2PX4E and 210 of 210 serogroup Y isolates (100%) harboured the glucosyltransferase motif EX2GX4E. Four of all 300 isolates (1.3%) harboured an EX2SX4E motif. Meningococcal strains with the latter motif have been suggested by Tsang et al., 2008 , to express a polysaccharide capsule that is composed of both galactose and glucose. By using commercially available polyclonal antibodies, two of the EX2SX4E isolates agglutinated with the W-135 antibody only, whereas the other two reacted with both the W-135 and the Y antibody. An ELISA with monoclonal antibodies unambiguously assigned the EX2SX4E motif to serogroup W-135. In summary, for culture independent confirmation of serogroup W-135 and Y meningococci by PCR and subsequent sequencing, the short EX2PX4E and EX2GX4E motifs provide a highly accurate discrimination. The EX2SX4E motif requires further biochemical and immunochemical characterisation; isolates with this motif should be reported as \"either W135 or Y\".",

Amino acids position 131 to 162 in its N-terminal region (about 206 amino acids) are mainly responsible for the Fn-binding ability. In the present study differences in the Fn binding capacity of B. burgdorferi strains from different species and genomic location of bbk32 were investigated. Southern blot analyses based on 23 strains of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. spielmanii revealed that position of bbk32 is rather variable between the species but also within a given species. bbk32 could be located on the linear plasmids lp23, lp24, lp25, lp31 and lp36. The meaning of this finding remains unclear so far. To compare Fn binding capacity, nine gene fragments encoding either three independent segments or the whole N-terminal regions of BBK32 proteins of both B. burgdorferi s.s. isolate B31 and B. garinii isolate PHei were cloned. In addition, two multi site-directed mutagenesis-and two deletion mutations were constructed, subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 expression vector and expressed as glutathione S-transferase fused protein.
