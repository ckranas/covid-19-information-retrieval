Information was retrieved through key words and key questions covering the stability and degradation of ncRNAs after oral ingestion, the passage of ncRNAs from food and feed to human and animal organs and tissues via the gastrointestinal tract and other barriers, as well as the potential effects on the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system or the entire organism. Full description of the strategy used for the literature search and for studies selection is provided and the number of retrieved publications is reported. This report is divided into four parts discussing the kinetics of exogenous ncRNAs in humans and animals, with focus on ingested ncRNAs (Part 1); the possible effects of ncRNAs on the gastrointestinal tract (Part 2), systemically (Part 3) and on the immune system (Part 4). This report suggests that some plant ncRNAs (e.g miRNAs and siRNAs) show higher stability as compared to other ncRNAs due to peculiar chemical characteristics (2'-O-methylation at 3' end). However, ingested or administered ncRNA must overcome many extracellular and cellular barriers to reach the intended target tissue or functional location in sufficient amount to exert any biological effect. Literature data indicate that chemically unmodified and unformulated ncRNAs exhibit very low stability in the gastrointestinal tract and in biological fluids and, in general, do not elicit major biological effects. This report also provides an overview of the RNA content in plant-derived foods and diets and discusses the controversies on the presence of dietary exogenous RNAs in the biological fluids of humans and animals and their effects.

The keywords \"increased intestinal permeability\" or \"increased plasma clearance\" are intended to retrieve any study indicating changes in these parameters.

These hetsiRNAs may account for approximately half of a plant's total mass of sRNAs.

However, there are substantial differences between these two kingdoms with regard to miRNA biogenesis, and mechanism and scope of miRNA-mediated gene regulation (Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006) . Detailed pathway comparisons and species information are described elsewhere . Transcription of miRNAs is typically performed by RNA polymerase II, and transcripts are capped and polyadenylated. In animals, most miRNAs are derived from longer hairpin transcripts (pri-miRNA) by the consecutive processing by the RNase III-like enzymes Drosha and Dicer, whereas in plants only Dicer (particularly DCL1) is responsible for miRNA processing. Thus, the biogenesis of most miRNAs in plants occurs in the nucleus, whereas in animals it requires the sequential cleavage of pri-miRNA in the nucleus and then in the cytoplasm by distinct RNAseIII enzymes (Rogers and Chen, 2013) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 954, "end": 982, "text": "(Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1631, "end": 1654, "text": "(Rogers and Chen, 2013)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Overview on ncRNAs"}, {"text": "Once processed, one strand of the hairpin duplex is loaded into an AGO protein to form the core of the miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs). miRISCs silence the expression of target genes predominantly at the post-transcriptional level (PTGS). The targets to be silenced are recognised through base-pairing interactions between the loaded miRNA and mRNA target, which contains a partially or fully complementary sequence (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011) . Plant miRNAs recognize fully or nearly complementary binding sites, which are generally located within the open reading frames (ORFs) of the mRNA target. Of importance is that miRNA nt 9-12 are usually engaged in base pairing, which allows target cleavage by AGO proteins (between nt 10 and 11). By contrast, animal miRNAs recognize partially complementary binding sites, which are generally located in 3' UTRs. In both plants and animals, complementarity to the 5' end of the miRNA (the 'seed' sequence, containing nt 2-7) is a major determinant in target recognition and is sufficient to trigger silencing. For most miRNA-binding sites complementarity is limited to the seed sequence (seed-matched sites) or to the seed sequence plus miRNA nucleotide 8. However, in some rare cases complementarity to the 3' region of the miRNA might contribute to target recognition, particularly when the mRNA has a weak seed match. Even for these sites, however, miRNA nucleotides 9-12 generally bulge out, preventing endonucleolytic cleavage by AGOs. In both animals and plants the miRNA 5' terminal nucleotide is buried in the mid domain of AGOs and is not available for pairing with the target (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011) . Therefore, there is an important difference in complementarity between plant and animal miRNAs and their targets; this is less extensive in animals than in plants. In both animals and plants miRNAs can move from cell-tocell. While in mammalian cells miRNAs and other types of RNAs can be transferred through secretory vesicles (Ruvkun, 2008; Valadi et al., 2007) , in plants they mostly use a different mechanism (Kobayashi and Zambryski, 2007) (see section 3.1.1.4. for details).

These are transcripts longer than 200 bp without any clear protein coding potential. lncRNAs are transcribed either from intergenic regions (lincRNAs), introns (incRNAs) or the opposite strand to protein-coding genes or other lncRNAs; they are thus natural antisense transcripts (NATs) (Ariel et al., 2015; Chekanova, 2015; Shafiq et al., 2016; Yamada, 2017) . As a confirmation of their widespread nature and possible biological relevance, lncRNAs have been identified in plants, fungi and animals. In fact, lncRNAs are involved in diverse biological processes across the eukaryotes, ranging from regulation of mating type in yeast to the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in mammals (Zofall et al., 2012; Flynn and Chang, 2014) . In plants, lncRNAs play key roles in flowering time regulation, gene silencing, root organogenesis, seedling photomorphogenesis, and reproduction (Ariel et al., 2015; Chekanova, 2015; Shafiq et al., 2016; Yamada, 2017) . Although plant lncRNA biological characterization is still limited, detailed analysis of over 200 Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome data sets identified 40,000 putative lncRNAs, including approximately 30,000 NATs and over 6000 lincRNAs. Both in plants an mammalians (Jin et al., 2013; Liu, J et al., 2012) these lncRNAs do not show association with small RNAs and are also expressed at lower levels (30-fold to 60fold less) than mRNAs. Plant NAT-lncRNAs can overlap completely (60%) or have complementary sequences in the 5' or 3' regions of mRNAs. They accumulate in a tissue-specific manner and many are modulated in respond to biotic or abiotic stresses, suggesting fine-tuning regulatory roles Wang et al., 2015; Ben Amor et al., 2009; Xin et al., 2011) . NAT-lncRNAs also accumulate under specific environmental conditions such as light exposure, and their expression overlaps with accumulation of histone acetylation marks, suggesting some transcription regulation effect . In plants there are other types of lncRNAs. Such is the case of the lncRNAs involved in: 1) the RNA-dependent DNA methylation silencing pathway (RdDM); and 2) the lncRNAs generated from PHASloci which serve as precursors of 21-nt and 24-nt secondary phased phasiRNAs in many plant genomes (Zhai et al., 2015; Fei et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2015) .

Most lncRNAs regulate transcription. In animals this can be achieved by: 1) modulation of transcription factor DNA-binding activity; 2) control of RNA Pol II pausing; or 3) recruitment of chromatin modellers, which will ultimately affect chromatin topology and nuclear organization (Bonasio and Shiekhattar, 2014) . In plants, there are two lncRNAs (HID1, APOLO) that associate with chromatin, promote loop formation, and modulate transcription ), (Ariel et al., 2015 (Figure 3 ). Some lncRNAs act at the post-transcriptional and translational level (Chekanova, 2015; Jabnoune et al., 2013) . Specifically, lncRNAs can act as \"decoys\" or mimics by blocking certain RNAs and/or DNAs to access their protein regulators (e.g. IPS1) (Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2011) . Bioinformatics analyses have also identified other putative miRNA target mimics in animals that act similarly to plant miRNA sponges (Chekanova, 2015) . Another plant lncRNA (ASCO) also acts as a decoy of nuclear speckle RNA binding proteins leading to different alternative splicing events and consequent altered root development (Bardou et al., 2014) . Other lncRNAs with biological function are the enhancerRNAs (eRNAs), described in yeast and mammals, but still unknown in plants. These eRNAs can act in cis as scaffolds to recruit co-activators and thus promote chromosome looping between enhancer and promoter regions; they can interact with other lncRNAs to form specific chromosome structures to control gene expression. eRNAs are regulated by the exosome which can affect either RNA synthesis or degradation in these regions (Pefanis et al. 2015) . The exosome can also protect eRNAs from genomic instability by resolving R loops, which are stable RNA-DNA triplexes naturally formed during transcription, which can persist in regions that have divergent transcription, eventually becoming deleterious (Skourti-Stathaki and Proudfoot, 2014 The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

However, Pol V-dependent lncRNAs are difficult to identify probably due to their low accumulation rates. Nevertheless, the few identified lncRNA are non-polyadenylated and can be either tri-phosphorylated or capped at their 5' end (Wierzbicki et al., 2008) . In addition, Pol V also seems to collaborate with Pol II to promote RdDM (Zheng et al., 2009) . Another group of regulatory ncRNAs that are Pol IV -RDR2 dependent were identified at intergenic regions overlapping mostly with transposons or sequence repeats.

Therefore, transgenic plants expressing any of these lncRNAs may have biotechnological value. To assess the future relevance of these lncRNAs it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms behind their function, since they are quite different from those of sRNAs (siRNAs and miRNAs).The best studied lncRNAs in this process are: 1) COLDAIR (Heo and Sung, 2011) ; 2) COLDWRAP (Kim and Sung, 2017); 3) COOLAIR (Swiezewski et al., 2009) and ASL (Shin and Chekanova, 2014) .

Interestingly, these four lncRNAs originate from different regions within the FLClocus (promoter, first intron, and 3' end antisense) suggesting a function in cis. They all contribute to prevent FLC transcription by recruiting the PRC2 silencing complex and the accumulation of repressive chromatin marks (Crevill\u00e9n and Dean, 2011; Csorba et al., 2014; Rosa et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2013sza; Swiezewski et al., 2009; Liu, F et al., 2007) .

Similar results were reported for another circRNA derived from the phytoene desaturase gene (Tan et al., 2017) .

Despite size and biogenesis differences, most ncRNAs share sequence-specific inhibitory functions. Important differences are present between plants and other organisms in sRNAdirected silencing pathways, which are highly diversified and specialized in plants through the expansion of RDR, DCL and AGO proteins that mediate sRNAs biogenesis and function. The vast majority of small regulatory RNAs in humans and animals are miRNAs. In contrast to plants, no evidence for systemic spreading of RNA silencing in humans and vertebrates have been found.

Although the initial model would suggest non-cell autonomous (one whose action extends beyong the cell producing the signal) RNA silencing by sRNAs, other intermediates could also account for this signal: dsRNAs produced by RDR activity (plant specific), or fold back RNA acting as silencing trigger (Dunoyer et al., 2007; Dunoyer et al., 2005; Himber et al., 2003 and Smith et al., 2007) . These intermediates could also diffuse from one cell to another and be processed again by DCL4, which has been associated with 21nt siRNA movement (Dunoyer et al., 2005) . In detail, secondary siRNAs processed from dsRNA by DCL4 could move cell-tocell to propagate silencing by signal amplification. It has been shown that DCL4 expression from phloem companion cells is critical to the short-term spread of the silencing effect of a siRNA duplex. This was reported in a study in which the viral suppressor P19 was found to be expressed in phloem companion cells and able to bind to 21nt small dsRNA (Vargason et al., 2003) . DCL4-dependent siRNA movement has also been shown to occur within certain organs, such as leaves, to create gradients (Chitwood et al., 2009; Levine et al., 2007) . Other DCLs-dependent siRNAs are involved in siRNA movement and these can also be sorted into different RISC complexes (Montgomery et al., 2008; Mi et al., 2008) . Other examples of mobile siRNAs could be the ta-siRNAs and DCL4-dependent 21nt siRNAs, also acting through AGO1. DCL3 processing of long dsRNA substrates generated by Pol IV (a plant-specific RNA polymerase) and RDR2 (another plant-specific protein) leads to production of 24nt siRNAs that are incorporated into AGO4 and will transcriptionally silence transposons (Chapman and Carrington, 2007; Mi et al., 2008) . In fact, siRNAs derived from transposons or methylated regions in the genome have been shown to be associated with chromatin silencing. These 24-nt mobile siRNAs could then promote epigenetic changes transmissible to following generations. When transgenes are expressed in plants, the generated dsRNAs can be processed by DCL3 and DCL4.

Plant small RNAs (sRNAs) can move either cell-to-cell or long distance. Cell-to-cell movement occurs through plasmodesmata (green arrows) that allow spreading of sRNAs from the cell where they are generated to 10-15 neighbouring cells (A). This cellto-cell movement can be extended over the surrounding cells by signal amplification (B). In this case, sRNA targets will be converted into new dsRNAs by the combined action of DCLs and RDRs.

Adapted from (Dunoyer, P. et al., 2013) , (Melnyk et al., 2011) and (Molnar et al., 2010) . In terms of miRNA mobility, it is still unclear if all miRNAs, or only a subset, can diffuse. Different mobility could be associated with different tissues/structures, and/or the size and stability of the passenger strand miRNA (a.k.a. miRNA*, star strand). In addition, miRNA movement regulation could involve subcellular compartmentalization (by nuclear export proteins such as HASTY (Park et al., 2005) ) and sequestration via AGO proteins (e.g. miR165/6 can be sequestered by AGO10 and affect shoot apical meristem differentiation (Liu et al., 2009; Tucker et al., 2008) ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1308, "end": 1334, "text": "(Dunoyer, P. et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1358, "text": "(Melnyk et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1363, "end": 1384, "text": "(Molnar et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1773, "end": 1792, "text": "(Park et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1922, "end": 1940, "text": "(Liu et al., 2009;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1961, "text": "Tucker et al., 2008)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary"}, {"text": "Most of the information is available for sRNAs since they represent the most studied class of ncRNA to date.

The size of these transcripts varies and their processing normally occurs in a base-to-loop direction (Rogers and . In plants, there are multiple DCL endonucleases that possess DExD/H-box RNA helicase, DUF283, PAZ, tandem RNaseIII, and dsRNA-binding domains. DCLs cleave the dsRNA precursor generating a 2-nucleotide 3' overhang (Margis et al., 2006) . Processing of the pri-miRNA requires at least two catalytic cycles to free the miRNA:miRNA* duplex. In animals, this requires sequential cleavage of the pri-miRNA in the nucleus first and then in the cytoplasm by different RNase III enzymes. The biogenesis of most miRNAs in Arabidopsis requires DCL1 (Park et al., 2002; Reinhart et al., 2002) , although other DCLs may be involved, but are not essential (Xie et al., 2004; Gasciolli et al., 2005) . In contrast to animals, all plant miRNA processing steps occur in the nucleus (Papp et al., 2003) . DCL1 activity will result in mature miRNAs of 20-21 nucleotides (nt), although variations in size can occur (Rogers and Chen, 2012) . Confirming its fundamental biological relevance, dcl1 mutants are lethal (Golden et al., 2002) . Other DCL proteins that function in different sRNA biogenesis pathways might also have minor roles in miRNA biogenesis. For instance, several miRNA genes are partially processed into 23-25-nucleotide mature miRNAs species whose accumulation depends on DCL3 (Vazquez et al., 2008) . In the absence of DCL3, mature 22-nucleotide miRNAs can accumulate due to DCL2 activity. In contrast, processing of miR822, miR839, and miR869 depends primarily on DCL4, probably as a consequence of highly complementary fold-backs in these pri-miRNAs (Ben Amor et al., 2009; Rajagopalan et al., 2006) . DICER cleavage of animal pri-miRNAs is facilitated by the action of dsRNAbinding domain (dsRBD) proteins (DRBs) (Jiang et al., 2005; Parker et al., 2006) . In Arabidopsis, there are five DRBs that have been shown to bind dsRNA in vitro (Hiraguri et al., 2005) . The best studied member of this family is HYL1 (HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1) which is involved in pri-miRNA processing, but also in pri-miRNA intron splicing (Laubinger et al., 2008; Szarzynska et al., 2009) . HYL1 seems to increase the accuracy of DCL1 processing of most, but not all, pri-miRNAs, suggesting that other mechanisms may also be involved (Liu, C et al., 2012) . From the same family, DRB2 and DRB4 are also involved in pri-miRNA processing, by associating with DCL4 (Rogers and . Another protein involved in miRNA biogenesis is SERRATE (SE), which can interact with HYL1 and DCL1 (Lobbes et al., 2006; Machida et al., 2011) . Like HYL1, SE also seems to increase DCL1 pri-miRNA cleavage efficiency (Dong et al., 2008) . Of interest is that these two proteins (HYL1 and SE) can be regulated by phosphorylation. Although HYL1 phosphorylation can decrease its activity (Manavella et al., 2012) , the biological relevance of this modification in SE is not known (Rogers and . Another regulator, DAWDLE (DDL), a phosphothreonine-binding forkhead associated (FHA) domain protein, seems to stabilize pri-miRNAs, possibly by direct binding (Yu et al., 2008) . Like SE and HYL1, DDL can also interact with DCL1, but does not seem to be involved in pri-miRNA processing. DDL most likely facilitates DCL1 access or recognition of pri-miRNAs.

In mammalian cells, artificially introduced 2-O-methyl groups can stabilize siRNAs without affecting their RNA interference activity (Czauderna et al., 2003) . Considerable work has been done to address the issue of miRNA modifications and how these affect their stability. Among these, 2'-O-methylation has been identified as relevant. Plant miRNAs have a naturally occurring methyl group on the 3' nucleotide ribose ( Figure 5 ). In this case, methylation does not require guide RNAs, since HEN1 (HUA ENHANCER 1) can methylate miRNA:miRNA* duplexes. This HEN1-dependent 2'-Omethylation on the 3' terminal ribose is a Mg2+ dependent methylation mechanism that will ultimately stabilize miRNAs (Abe et al., 2010; Molnar et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2006) .The HEN1 Mg2+-dependent methylation mechanism relies on its two dsRBDs binding the substrate duplex, and the La motif-containing domain interacting with the 5' end of the substrate strand (Huang et al., 2009 ).

However, it is still not clear whether HEN1 can methylate free miRNAs or can bind HYL1, DCL1 and AGO1, although it has been shown to interact with HYL1 and DCL1. In animals, the HEN1 homolog has a different structure since it does not possess the dsRBD and La motif-containing domains. Therefore, the animal HEN1 homolog methylates singlestranded sRNAs associated with AGO or PIWI proteins (Saito et al., 2007; Horwich et al., 2007) . The degradation of ncRNA molecules in plants and mammals is mediated by 3' nucleotidyl transferases and exoribonucleases. The Arabidopsis HEN1 SUPPRESSOR1 (HESO1) belongs to the DNA Polymerase \u03b2 gene family (Zhao et al., 2012; Ren et al., 2012) . In other organisms, HESO1 putative homologs are ribonucleotidyl transferases that are able to add specific nucleotides to the 3' end of different RNAs (Martin and Keller, 2007) . Arabidopsis HESO1 can also add nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' end of unmethylated miRNAs in vitro and exhibits a preference for uridine (Ren et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2012) .

Most of the available reports assessing ncRNA half-life focus on the role of 3' truncation, 3' uridylation and consequent degradation (see above) as the main processes regulating miRNA turnover in plants. However, a recent report identifies the enzymes (SDN1 and SDN2 exonucleases) responsible for 3' truncation in vivo and its relationship with 3' tailing (uridylation). Also of importance, this report shows the opposite role of AGO1 and AGO10 in miR165/6 degradation by SDNs, specifically SDN1. AGO10 promotes miR165 degradation by SDN1, an unexpected role for a plant AGO which has been associated with a protecting role in miRNA stability (Yu et al., 2017) . This function of AGO10 (enhancing miR165 degradation) keeps miR165 out of the stem cell niche in the shoot apical meristem (where AGO10 is not expressed). Accumulation of ectopic miR165 in the shoot apical meristem fails to maintain the stem cell population. This kind of mechanism is thus needed to clear miR165 since this particular miRNA can move between cell layers (see miRNA movement section, above).

Indeed, turnover assays revealed that the average miRNA half-life is 119h (i.e. \u22485 days) (Figure 6 ). Although some miRNAs have a shorter half-life, these data generally indicate that miRNAs are much more stable (\u224810x more) than messenger RNAs. (Gantier et al., 2011) . Several features have been described that might explain this high half-life for miRNAs. For instance, partial pairing of miRNA and the mRNA target site generally produces translational repression, while extensive pairing of miRNA and mRNA produce a mRNA cleavage (Pasquinelli, 2010) . In the former case the miRNA remains stable, but in the latter it degrades. Further studies in mammalian cells have also shown that Argonaute proteins stabilize mature miRNAs in a slicing-independent manner, increasing mature miRNA stability (Winter and Diederichs, 2011). For specific miRNAs, it has been found that certain RNA-binding proteins (i.e. roquin) can enhance mature miRNA-146 stability by reducing its 3' end uridylation (Srivastava et al., 2015) . While intracellular levels of miRNAs are mostly affected by cell division (Ghosh et al., 2015; Gantier et al., 2011) , miRNA activity and turnover can also be controlled by subcellular distribution of microribonucleoproteins; that is, polysome sequestration contributes to an increase of cellular miRNA levels, but without an increase in miRNA activity (Ghosh et al., 2015) . Plant small RNA duplexes can be 2'-O-methylated at their 3' terminal ribose by HEN1, loaded into AGO and protected from uridylation and degradation by 3'-5' exonucleases.

Thus, this silencing transfer mechanism is very relevant for the food and feed risk assessment of ncRNA GMO plants, highlighting the need to evaluate the stability of ncRNAs outside the plant.

Most of ncRNAs, including sRNAs and lncRNAs have been discovered in the last 20 years, and thus new data has been added to the body of knowledge. In a study of sRNA stability under cooking conditions, plant miRNAs were detected after cooking although at significantly lower levels when compared to fresh plant tissues (see Table 19 ) (Zhang, Lin et al., 2012) . Differences were observed for miRNAs from different food/feed sources (rice, cabbage, wheat or potato), ranging from nearly undetectable values to almost 80% persistance of miRNAs after cooking. Levels of miRNAs were monitored with a stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay using the U6 snRNA for normalization, a commonly used housekeeping gene in miRNAs analyses.

Understanding the molecular basis that confers plant ncRNA stability is of vital importance and needs to be further evaluated to better inform on the relevance of plant ncRNA for food and feed risk assessment. For instance, modifications plant miRNAs not occurring in mammals, such as the methyl group located on the 3' nucleotide ribose, could hypothetically have an impact on plant miRNAs stability in mammalian systems due to the lack of the appropriate enzymes for their recognition and degradation, or due to increased stability to mammalian RNases . Should this be the case, plant miRNAs could manifest a much longer than expected half-life in mammalian organisms when compared to mammalian miRNA, which could increase the probability of encountering target molecules. The literature contains descriptions of possible in vitro interaction of plant miRNAs with mammalian miRNA silencing complexes which may trigger target repression Chin et al., 2016) . However, this hypothesis needs to be experimentally validated since there are gaps in the literature. Moreover, it needs to be determined if sufficient levels of ingested plant miRNAs reach a target cell to determine an effect in mammalian cells. For instance, in mammalian studies it has been suggested that the threshold for target gene regulation is between 1000 and 10000 copies of mammalian miRNA per cell . Accumulation of plant exogenous ncRNAs has not yet been reported, but recent next generation sequencing studies have reported a plethora of plant miRNAs and other RNAs in circulating in the human organism (see section 3.3).

Since then, the ability to use exogenous (synthetic) agents to control gene expression has revolutionized many aspects of biological research and catalysed the development of a new promising class of exogenous molecules to treat human diseases. However, despite the obvious promise of this approach, progress has been slow because of the need to overcome myriad technical hurdles, particularly those related to the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and delivery of antisense molecules. Indeed, as most antisense-based potential therapies have not yet produced significant clinical results, very few RNAbased or DNA-based antisense drugs have been approved for clinical use. In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first ASO-based therapeutics for the treatment of a human disease. In 1999, Fomivirsen (marketed as Vitravene) was approved for clinical use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the European market for treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in immunocompromised patients. Fomivirsen is a synthetic 21-mer ASO (DNA) that binds complementary to the sequence of the mRNA encoding the IE2 protein from CMV.

Information on naked (non chemically modified) exogenous RNAs is mainly presented in this section. Of these publications, 15 support the uptake of exogenous ncRNAs. One study reports no intestinal absorption of RNA (Baintner and Toth, 1986) , and three others suggest that RNA is degraded before absorption (Loretz et al., 2006; O'Neill et al., 2011; Sonoda and Tatibana, 1978) . Uptake of plant exogenous RNAs, after oral intake is not included here, and will be reviewed in chapter 3.3; and uptake of exogenous RNAs from the pharmaceutical/medicinal area is described in section 3.1.4. Herein, uptake refers to passage of the molecule (in this case a ncRNA) through the cellular membrane as a part of the absorption process. An important feature for the possible biological effect that exogenous RNAs, including ncRNAs, may have within an organism is their cellular uptake. Because of their size and negative charges, exogenous RNAs cannot easily passively cross cell membranes (see below). However, earlier studies suggested that exogenous RNAs, either homologous (Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966; Galand and Ledoux, 1966; Sirdeshmukh and Bhargava, 1983) or heterologous (i.e. from E. coli, yeast or others) (Natural Academy of Sciences, 1960; Herrera et al., 1970; Galand et al., 1966) , could be taken up by mammalian cells (Bensch and King, 1961) . Intact, RNA may be present inside the cell but is reported to degrade rapidly in some studies (Herrera et al., 1970; Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966) . Extracellular ribonuclease activity seems to inhibit uptake (Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966) or function (Niu et al., 1961) of exogenous RNAs. Uptake of exogenous RNA is apparently not due to altered membrane permeability, impaired cell viability, or ribonuclease degradation of the macromolecule during incubation experiments (Herrera et al., 1970) . Radioautographic evidences (radioactive assays) have shown the uptake of macromolecular RNAs by normal and neoplastic mouse cells, but degradation was also shown to occur prior to or after RNA uptake (Schwarz and Rieke, 1962) . Although intracellular degradation may occur, early studies also described biological actions in response to uptake of exogenous RNAs (Niu et al., 1961; Niu et al., 1962; 1960; Esposito, 1964) , suggesting that once taken up by a cell, RNA could eventually exert a biological effect. Studies on other types of cellular uptake of exogenous RNAs, such as transfer RNAs, either homologous or heterologous (depending on donor RNA and recipient cell type) have been conducted (Gallagher et al., 1972; Sakai and Cohen, 1977; Crooke et al., 1971) . However, as noted in RNA therapeutics development (see section 3.1.3.1), the large number of barriers encountered by RNAs from intake to cell uptake needs to be considered when evaluating possible exogenous RNA bioavailability (Figure 10 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 439, "end": 464, "text": "(Baintner and Toth, 1986)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 531, "end": 552, "text": "(Loretz et al., 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 553, "end": 574, "text": "O'Neill et al., 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 575, "end": 601, "text": "Sonoda and Tatibana, 1978)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1321, "text": "(Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1346, "text": "Galand and Ledoux, 1966;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1378, "text": "Sirdeshmukh and Bhargava, 1983)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1467, "text": "Sciences, 1960;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1489, "text": "Herrera et al., 1970;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1490, "end": 1510, "text": "Galand et al., 1966)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1573, "text": "(Bensch and King, 1961)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1692, "text": "(Herrera et al., 1970;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1693, "end": 1722, "text": "Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1815, "text": "(Shanmugam and Bhargava, 1966)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1846, "text": "(Niu et al., 1961)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2050, "end": 2072, "text": "(Herrera et al., 1970)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2275, "end": 2300, "text": "(Schwarz and Rieke, 1962)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2455, "text": "RNAs (Niu et al., 1961;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2456, "end": 2473, "text": "Niu et al., 1962;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2474, "end": 2479, "text": "1960;", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 2480, "end": 2495, "text": "Esposito, 1964)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2798, "text": "(Gallagher et al., 1972;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2821, "text": "Sakai and Cohen, 1977;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2822, "end": 2842, "text": "Crooke et al., 1971)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3072, "end": 3082, "text": "(Figure 10", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "RNAs uptake with focus on ncRNAs"}, {"text": "The GI tract offers a large surface area potentially relevant for ncRNAs cellular uptake and following systemic release, since it contains a large variety of cell types at different maturational levels (e.g. stem cells in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fchn) located only a few microns from an extensive capillary network (Lozier et al., 1997) .

Phagocytic cells of the RES, particularly the abundant Kupffer cells in the liver and splenic macrophages, express a number of cell surface receptors, including integrins and scavenger receptors, that are potentially involved in uptake, although the role of scavenger receptors in uptake of free oligonucleotides is somewhat controversial (Juliano, 2016).

Paracellular transport occurs through the junctions between cells and is limited to molecules of approximately 6 nm diameter or less; only microRNAs would be able to transit this barrier by this method. Caveolar-mediated transcytosis carries large proteins across the endothelium within vesicles of about 70 nm.

Early (Srivastava, 1965; Lassek and Montag, 1990 ) and more recent studies ) have estimated that the total RNA content in plants is about 1 mg/g plant tissue. Plants contain an array of ncRNAs, including highly abundant transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), single-stranded antisense RNAs, and the miRNAs and siRNAs that trigger RNAi and their precursor dsRNAs . Long dsRNAs from non-plant, exogenous sources are particularly common in plants, including plants used for food and feed, due to infection from RNA-containing viruses. Animalderived foods are generally richer in RNA than plant-derived foods, and are likely to contribute significantly to overall RNA consumption (Jonas et al., 2001) . Of the 1 mg/g tissue of total RNA content in plants, relative percentages (by weight) of the major RNA forms are approximately 80% rRNA, 3-5% mRNA, and 10-15% tRNA, with sRNAs accounting for less than 5% of total RNA in plants . sRNAs are present at levels of up to 1.61 \u00b5g/g of conventional soybean grain (average = 0.66 \u00b5g/g grain) and comparable amounts are present in the grains of conventional corn and rice . In tobacco plants engineered to overexpress a dsRNA under the control of a constitutive promoter, siRNAs levels in leaves reached about 1.5% of total RNA (Chau, B. L. and Lee, K. A., 2007) . Total exposure to construct-derived sRNAs from a putative biotech soybean product was estimated to be 45 \u00b5g/Kg/day in the general population and 82 \u00b5g/Kg/day for children aged six and under . Using these same assumptions for RNA expression levels in sweet corn, consumption of corn at the highest possible rate would result in an estimated intake of 106 \u00b5g/Kg/day in the general population and 170 \u00b5g/Kg/day for children aged In the absence of encapsulation or chemical stabilization to prevent degradation or without the addition of penetration enhancers, the absorption of RNA -including siRNAs -across the GI tract is described as negligible (Akhtar, 2009; Jain, 2008) . One study suggests that activity could be possible for certain highly expressed plant miRNAs following food intake (Zhang et al., 2012a) . This study reports that in mice fed a diet consisting entirely of cooked rice (i.e. human equivalent of about 33 kg/day of cooked rice) , several rice miRNAs were detectable in mouse serum and liver. Some of the results presented in this study were contested in later studies (Chen et al., 2013) . Petrick et al. clearly stated the unlikelihood of achieving such high concentrations of mature plant miRNAs in the serum, plasma and organs of humans or animals via food intake since the high levels of rice administered the experimental animals did not reflect anticipated dietary exposure levels. In another study, it was concluded that plant miRNAs identified in animal sRNA sequencing data can originate from artefacts of the sequencing process (Zhang et al., 2012b) . Even in the case of 20-mer oligonucleotides modified to increase their stability, oral bioavailability in rats was only 0.1% (Nicklin et al., 1998) and intestinal absorption was less than 1% in a model that bypasses the gastric acidic environment.

Human Argonaute 2 (Ago-2) is a catalytic core component of RNAi machinery. Ago-2 mediated gene silencing has been proposed to be linked to the Mitogen Activated Proteine Kinase signalling pathway (Zeng et al., 2008) , which is activated in response to cellular stress. Since various kinds of stress on human cells induce formation of stress granules, Ago-2 can be recruited to these granules, modifying its intracellular localization and the efficacy of RNAi activity (Detzer et al., 2011) . Ago-2 is thus regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels, suggesting that Ago-2 levels can influence cellular miRNA activity (Adams et al., 2009 ). It has also been proposed that inactivation of mitochondria could lead to a strong decrease in miRNA-mediated RNAi efficiency, and, to a lesser extent, to siRNA-mediated RNAi (Huang et al., 2011) . Due to the interaction of P-bodies with mitochondria, reduced Ago-2 activity could be due to changes in location of endogenous Ago-2 from Pbodies (Huang et al., 2011) . Association of Ago-2 with cytoplasmic RNA granules is known to regulate the translational repression activity of the protein, but phosphorylation of certain residues may prevent this inhibition, allowing the protein to remain active in the cytoplasm (Lopez-Orozco et al., 2015) .

Further research is needed on how transgenic ncRNAs affect expression levels of other ncRNAs, and other RNAs such as mRNAs. Alteration of the expression levels of certain ncRNAs within the plant may modify the levels of other ncRNAs due to putative compensatory circuits and codifying RNAs. This in turn could lead to changes in protein and enzymatic content, with putative consequent alteration of the modified plant's nutritional value.

Also, a study of body fluid composition of rats orally administered yeast RNA, mixtures of its constituent nucleosides or its constituent bases and ribose was performed (Heaf and Davies, 1976) . The authors showed that ingestion of RNA increased intestinal levels of ribose, inorganic phosphate, uridine, pseudouridine, uracil, inosine or uric acid. The effect of orally administered mixed nucleosides on blood and urine composition was similar to that of RNA, while some differences were noted for some equivalent mixture of free bases (Heaf and Davies, 1976) . This study showed that the dietary RNA-phosphate passed to the urine from the gut, suggesting that most of the RNA-ribose was probably metabolized (Heaf and Davies, 1976) . It has been shown in a murine model of Staphylococcus aureus infection that the oral administration of RNA was ineffective while the intraperitoneal nucleoside-nucleotide mixture was more effective in maintaining host resistance against bacterial infection (Adjei et al., 1993) . Supplementation with nucleotides has also been shown to exert biological effects, including expression regulation of certain genes (Sanchez-Pozo and Gil, 2002; Gil, 2002) , although the mechanisms of action are still unknown. It is generally assumed that nucleotides are not essential nutrients, but under certain conditions (i.e. low dietary intake, tissue needs increased or stress) dietary nucleotides may play a role as conditionally essential nutrients (Jung and Batal, 2012; Carver and Walker, 1995) . In this context, dietary supplementation with yeast RNA promoted ulcer healing in a rat model of indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis (Sukumar et al., 1997) . Similar effects were observed when nucleosides and nucleotides were administered intravenously (Veerabagu et al., 1996) .

The plant miRNAs were distinguished from human miRNAs by their 2'-Omethyl modification, which made them resistant to periodate whereas the human miRNAs having free 2' hydroxyl were periodate sensitive. It was then assumed that the identified plant miRNAs were coming from the food uptake. Two rice miRNAs named osa-miR156a and osa-miR168a were particularly abundant in human serum samples, since rice is common in human diets. Additional in vitro experiments showed that these plant miRNAs can endure conditions that mimic the acidic environment of the gut, suggesting that plant miRNAs can survive being eaten and digested, pass through the mammalian GI tract and reach target organs. The authors also showed that diet-derived plant miR168a can target the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor Adapter Protein 1 (LDLRAP1) mRNA based on sequence complementarity. This miRNA was able to reduce the LDLRAP1 protein level in the blood and liver of mice fed rice, and eventually increase their plasma low-density lipoproteins (LDL) content. This publication raised questions about whether food-derived sRNAs could play an active role in human/animal health. However, it was controversial and its results were questioned due to nutritional imbalances in the test-diet studies or lack of RNAi-mediated modulation of LDLRAP1 protein levels in mouse liver (Witwer and Hirschi, 2014; Chen et al., 2013; .

Measuring LDLRAP1 protein levels in the liver of mice fed with miR168a-containing rice diets by ELISA instead of Western-blot analysis, Dickinson and colleagues did not detect any protein change modulated by miRNA168a-diets. Although changes in the LDL plasma levels were indeed detected, the authors concluded that LDL increases resulted from nutritional imbalances rather than from a miR168 consumption mediated effect.

Most of the available data suggests either that gastrointestinal absorption of dietary plant miRNAs does not occur in healthy consumers or miRNAs levels in blood and tissues of consumers are too low to have a biological impact. However, the biological activity of food miRNAs may be more dependent on their accumulation in exosomes than on their abundance per se, because of their reported low concentration. Development of sensitive sensors to help to detect the functionality of low-level absorbed miRNAs would facilitate assessment of the effects of dietary miRNAs in consumers.

Using two models of acute renal failure (Baliga et al., 1999) , i.e. the Cisplatin (a chemotherapeutic agent) and the glycerol-induced models, it was observed that only mice receiving Cisplatin exhibited measurable levels of dietary miRNAs in sera and urine.

The study found continual survivability of plant miRNAs in an in vitro simulated digestion system for over 75 min without any significant decrease in their levels (Philip et al., 2015) . miRNA levels have been analysed qualitatively by real-time PCR using TaqMan miRNA assays. Stability of the plant-derived small RNA miRNA2911 was also assessed using an artificial in vitro digestion system that simulates mammalian gastric and intestinal conditions . Yang et al. compared three samples which contained a) 1 mL cabbage extract with 10 pmol plant-derived MIR2911 (measured by qRT-PCR), and 10 pmol spiked-in synthetic 2'-O-methylated MIR168a and artificial miRNA termed C7; b) 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 10 pmol each of synthetic 2'-O-methylated MIR2911, MIR168a and C7; and c) 1 mL PBS with 10 pmol each of synthetic MIR2911, MIR168a and C7 without the 2'-O-methylation. Time course analysis during both gastric and intestinal phase digestion showed that most miRNAs displayed modest resistance in the acidic gastric environment (up to 60 min), while in the intestinal phase the levels of all miRNAs were drastically reduced after five minutes (Figure 14) . Regardless of synthesis origin and 2'-O-methylation, the digestive stability of MIR2911 was up to 100-fold higher than that of the other miRNAs. The most stable form of MIR2911 was the plant-derived form in the cabbage extract, since 0.044% survived, compared to 0.0059% for the 2'-O-methylated form, and 0.0037% for the non-modified form. Similar results were observed when 10 pmol of synthetic 2'-O-methylated MIR2911, MIR168a and C7 were digested in vitro using the ex vivo intestinal fluids ( Figure 14) . Indeed, MIR2911 appeared to be more stable after 2-hour digestion than the other tested miRNAs. Finally, by directly measuring MIR2911 levels in vivo in the small intestines of mice fed the plant-based diet (daily dietary MIR2911 intake 10 pmol) it was observed that this particular miRNA reached level more than 100-fold higher than those observed in the animals consuming a single 400 pmol dose of the synthetic MIR2911. MIR168a, a miRNA also present in the plant-based diets, was also detected in the small intestines at a level 100 times lower than that of MIR2911 . Using transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the artificial miRNA amiR-RICE, the murine miRNA mmu-miR-146a or their controls, Yang et al. studied gastrointestinal digestion and bioavailability of transgenic miRNAs (Yang et al., 2017b) . Levels of transgenic miRNAs in plants (qRT-PCR quantification) were similar (22.9 and 26.3 fmol/g of fresh weight for amiR-RICE and mmu-miR-146a, respectively) to that of sRNA MIR2911 (18-19 fmol/g in fresh shoot tissue). However, in diets stored at room temperature, the abundance of amiR-RICE and mmu-miR-146a decreased gradually by \u224810-fold (\u22481 fmol/g diet) while that of the sRNA MIR2911 increased \u224885fold after 24h. In vitro gastric and intestinal simulated digestion of the synthetic forms of the plantbased transgenic miRNAs showed that amiR-RICE and MIR2911 had similar digestive stability, while mmu-miR-146a was significantly less stable. The surviving percentage in the intestinal phase after 75 min was 0.39% for mmu-miR-146a compared to \u22481.11% for MIR2911 or amiR-RICE (Figure 15 , frame A). The surviving percentage in the in vivo assays (gavage-fed 400 pmol of synthetic sRNAs) further decreased the stability of the miRNAs, reducing their level to 0.0014% for amiR-RICE and 0.00045% for MIR2911 (Figure 15, frame B) . However, the levels of miRNAs in the small intestines were higher for MIR2911 (238 fmol/mouse) than amiR-RICE (2.7 fmol/mouse), while mmu-miR-146a levels were undistinguishable from the host mouse miRNA (Figure 15 , frame C). amiR-RICE was not found in serum (neither are miRNAs reported in previous studies and present in transgenic plants) while MIR2911 was found only in the serum (28.5 fM, or 1.3 x 10 7 copies per mouse) of mice fed the plant transgenic diets (Yang, J. et al., 2017b) www.efsa.europa.eu/publications 145 EFSA Supporting publication 2019:EN-1688", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 187, "text": "(Philip et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 353, "end": 374, "text": "(Philip et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF169"}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2591, "text": "Yang et al. studied", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2660, "end": 2680, "text": "(Yang et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4182, "end": 4206, "text": "(Yang, J. et al., 2017b)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1350, "end": 1361, "text": "(Figure 14)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1861, "end": 1871, "text": "Figure 14)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3465, "end": 3475, "text": "(Figure 15", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3694, "end": 3714, "text": "(Figure 15, frame B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 3920, "end": 3930, "text": "(Figure 15", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Dietary exogenous ncRNAs (plant origin): presence and biological effects on the GI tract and its annex glands"}, {"text": "The present document has been produced and adopted by the bodies identified above as authors.

Certain miRNAs found in breast milk have also been found in placenta tissue (Munch et al., 2013) , although their physiological role is unknown. Other studies have shown that colostrum miRNAs (early lactation period) are more abundant than in the later lactation period (Gu et al., 2012; Xi et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2013) . Bovine milk miRNAs isolated from the colostrum whey fraction were more abundant than in the mature milk whey fraction (Izumi et al., 2012) .

In addition to the extracellular barriers specifically related to oral absorption, defensive humoral and cellular barriers efficiently prevent the intrusion of exogenous entities into the organism (Jeong et al., 2007) . Systemically-administered nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by nucleases in a few minutes and, even in nucleic acid drug therapy using positively-charged polyplexes, they readily interact with serum components to form larger aggregates, resulting in rapid clearance by RES or phagocytes (Jeong et al., 2007) . If the nucleic acids survive in the blood stream, they must still reach the appropriate tissues and enter the target cells. In systemic nucleic acid therapy, continuous endothelial walls in the microvasculatures are one of the main barriers limiting the access of oligonucleotides to target cells. In certain pathological cases, such as cancer, the presence of leaky vasculatures in the vicinity of highly penetrating solid tumours allows nanoparticulates to penetrate and accumulate in tumours due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect (Jeong et al., 2007) . Caveolae-mediated transcytosis has been considered one of the important mechanisms of macromolecules transport across the endothelium (Schnitzer, 2001) . Another possible limiting barrier is the extracellular matrix consisting of various proteoglycans, which are proteins covalently cross-linked with carboxylic or sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (Ruponen et al., 2003) . Since GAGs, such as heparin sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronic acid, are polyanions, they may repel the negatively-charged oligonucleotides, affecting mobility of the nucleic acids in the tissue extracellular matrix and therefore limiting their access to target cells. In the case that oligonucleotides reach the target cell membrane, they must enter the cell. The first barrier is the anionic plasma membrane itself, and the second is cellular uptake via endocytosis (see section 3.1.5). Without a specific ligand-receptor interaction mechanism, the entrance of ncRNAs results in a lack of cell specificity (Jeong et al., 2007) . Once taken up by cells, the nucleic acids are localized within the endosomal compartments, where the pH rapidly drops to about 5 by the action of membrane-bound ATP-driven proton pumps. The endosomes mature to lysosomes where the oligonucleotides can be degraded by various enzymes (Jeong et al., 2007) . As previously indicated, any surviving nucleic acids must then escape from the endosome to exert their functional effects. In nucleic acid drug therapy, certain endosomal disruptive agents, such as lysomotropic chloroquine, fusogenic peptides and pH-sensitive neutral lipid, are used to facilitate or promote endosomal escape through membrane disruption (Jeong et al., 2007) . After endosomal escape, ncRNAs should move through the cytoplasm to encounter their molecular targets, or to the peri-nuclear space where nuclear translocation takes place if the nucleus is the target compartment. Passive diffusion of high-molecular weight macromolecules is limited in the cytoplasm. A complex network of microfilaments and microtubules, highly concentrated proteins and various subcellular organelles provide the cytoplasm with a high fluid phase viscosity and mesh-like structure with 300 to 400 \u00c5 pores from, making the diffusion process size-dependent (Jeong et al., 2007) . In fact, microinjection of plasmid DNA into the cytoplasm showed that normal DNA was practically immobile in the cytoplasmic space (Dowty et al., 1995) . However, DNA molecules with less than 250 base pairs seem to undergo free diffusion in the cytoplasm (Lukacs et al., 2000) , suggesting that small oligonucleotides (i.e. miRNAs) do not face limitations regarding their intracellular trafficking, contrary to large ncRNAs (i.e. lncRNAs) which might encounter more restrictions reaching the peri-nuclear space. Finally, some ncRNAs need to enter the nucleus to be functional. The nuclear envelope consists of a double-layer membrane with nuclear pores.

Such is the case of the central nervous system (CNS), where delivery of nucleic acids is particularly challenging because of its anatomical and physiological complexities. The CNS is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which consists of tightly joined capillary endothelial cells, restricting access of large molecules into the brain. The CNS extends to include the spinal cord, which is protected by the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), made up of choroid plexus epithelial cells limiting the free diffusion of molecules into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The BBB and the BCSFB express numerous transporters and receptors which contribute to the transfer of essential nutrients such as glucose and amino acids into the CNS. Within the CNS, different cell types exist including neurons, astrocytes and other glial cells. Entry of nucleic acids into neurons is notoriously difficult for unclear reasons, although it is likely related to their post-mitotic nature, as well as the complex structures and intricacies of neuronal networking (O'Mahony et al., 2013) . For instance, variances in the uptake of siRNA lipoplexes (liposome and nucleic acid complexes) were reported at different parts of the neuron structure, with greater uptake efficiency at the cell soma compared to the neuritis, which may occur because of different membrane compositions in these domains (O'Mahony et al., 2013) . Circumventing the BBB is only possible by direct administration of ncRNAs to a target region of the brain or by administration to the spinal cord where trans-synaptic retrograde transport to the brain is possible. Some delivery systems exploit the receptor-mediated uptake of molecules such as transferrin, lactoferrin and insulin receptors by attaching a ligand for the receptor to the non-viral delivery system, or promoting a transient mechanical disruption of the BBB (O' Mahony et al., 2013) . In certain neurological diseases, and in particular in brain cancers, anatomical and physiological changes occur that can impact BBB integrity and the CNS accessibility. Delivery to the CSF to bypass the BBB presents its own obstacles, including rapid clearance from the CSF, the BCSFB and limited diffusion from the CSF into the brain parenchyma (O'Mahony et al., 2013) (Figure 17) . Another specialized barrier is the placenta. The placenta serves as the interface between the maternal and foetal circulatory systems, and regulates the transfer of oxygen, nutrients and waste products. When exogenous substances are present in the maternal bloodstream, the extent to which these affect the foetus is determined by transport and biotransformation processes in the placental barrier. This barrier is formed by fusion of the outer blastocyst trophoblast cells facing the uterine epithelium into multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast. Proliferation of syncytiotrophoblast is mediated by the fusion of precursor cytotrophoblast cells. Maternal blood in the intervillous space and foetal blood in the villous capillaries are separated by a continuous layer of syncytiotrophoblast, a discontinuous layer of cytotrophoblast cells, basal lamina, connective tissue, and foetal endothelial cells (Al-Enazy et al., 2017) . The placenta undergoes several changes as pregnancy progresses. Overall, the placental barrier becomes thinner over time, the distance separating the maternal circulation from the foetal circulation decreasing from 50-100 \u00b5m in the second month to only 4-5 \u00b5m at term. Passive diffusion across the placenta is favoured for lipophilic substances, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Smaller compounds tend to cross the placenta more readily, with compounds having a molecular weight less than 500 Da crossing it most easily (Al-Enazy et al., 2017) . Since nucleic acids are polarized, negatively charged molecules, it is unlikely they would be able to cross the placenta by passive diffusion.

Of note is that exogenous miRNAs (xenomiRs) were only found in 17% of the tissue samples (from 392 total samples), with several studies being completely void of any xenomiRs. XenomiRs were absent from most human tissues samples, or present at very low abundances (with a median of 3.5 read counts). No enrichment of xenomiRs was found in tissues relevant to dietary intake (i.e. hepatocytes and blood cells). By contrast, out of 432 human body fluids datasets, xenomiRs were found in 69% of samples, although at very low levels (median of 5 read counts). Even though the blood brain barrier separates the cerebrospinal fluid from the bloodstream, xenomiRs were found in comparable quantities in both , suggesting no depletion (as expected by the presence of the barrier) of xenomiRs in body fluids separated from the main bloodstream. Moreover, the lack of co-occurrence of xenomiRs in cerebrospinal fluid and serum of the same individuals, do not support that xenomiRs detected in cerebrospinal fluid samples have entered through the bloodstream, and thus do not support a dietary origin of xenomiRs. The most common xenomiRs in body fluid samples belonged to the clades for rodents (34%), dicots (29%), insects (13%) and euphyllophytes (11%), suggesting that xenomiRs composition does not reflect human food sources. From 10 billion sequence reads (all samples), xenomiRs were in low abundance, comprising only 0.001% of the total reads (40,055). The same study reported a controlled feeding trial in rats and piglets (see section 3.3.3 below for details). Shu et al. (2015) used bioinformatics tools to characterize the structural characteristics of exogenous miRNAs that can contribute to cross-species transportation and thus be transferred into human circulation . Thirty-four thousand (34.000) miRNAs sequences were compiled from 194 species (from five kingdoms including Animal, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Viruses), including dietary miRNAs (5217 miRNAs) from 15 types of common food species such as cow milk, breast milk, tomato, grape, and apple. Using a support vector machine (SMV)-based feature elimination strategy, 1102 features based on sequence, structure, and physicochemical properties were analysed to distinguish human circulating miRNAs from the remaining sequences.

Direct binding of miR-168a to exon 4 of LDLRAP1, which is in the ORF (open reading frame), was demonstrated by luciferase reported assays. Transfection of both pre-miR-168a and mature miR-168a resulted in decreased LDLRAP1 protein expression (but not that of mRNA) in HepG2 cells. Moreover, transfection of the intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line with miR-168a produced microvesicles with plant miR-168a which can be taken up by HepG2 and reduce LDLRAP1 protein expression. miR-168a seemed to be associated to AGO2 protein and other cells like 293T cells which were also able to package miR-168a in microvesicles and then deliver miR-168a into HepG2 . Injection (iv) of antisense oligonucleotide against miR-168a into mice during fresh-rice feeding reduced miR-168a levels in the liver and reversed LDLRAP1 repression. Mice were finally fed with fresh rice for 7 days to evaluate the physiological function of food-enriched in plant miR-168a. Serum and liver miR-168a levels were induced already at 1 day of feeding and the liver LDLRAP1 protein was repressed after 1, 3 and 7 days. Consequently, LDL levels in mouse plasma were significantly elevated on days 3 and 7 after fresh rice feeding. Administration of an antisense oligonucleotide against miR-168a reduced plasma levels of miR-168a, repressed reduction of LDLRAP1 in the liver and blocked the rice-induced elevation of plasma LDL levels, suggesting that elevation of fresh-rice derived miR-168a in the mouse liver specifically decreased liver LDLRAP1 expression and that this caused elevated LDL levels in mouse plasma (Figure 18 ).

Using six plant miRNAs ( Table 26 ) that showed typical kinetic absorption curves, the total amount of plant miRNAs absorbed by the body was calculated. Using the plant miRNAs concentration in watermelon juice and the areas under the plasma concentration-vs-time curves (AUC) of plant miRNAs, the total uptake amount, total absorption amount and absorption rate for each plant miRNA was calculated (Table 25) . Absorption rate ranged from 0.04% to 1.31%. miR-156a, miR-162a and miR-168a were found almost exclusively encapsulated in microvesicles. miRNAs were validated in watermelon juice or plasma by northern blotting. Using the same protocol, a fruit eating study was performed. Each subject consumed an equal portion of watermelon, apple, banana, orange, grape, mango and cantaloupe (2.5 kg in total). While miRNAs concentration varied, the kinetics of plant miRNAs after fruit administration appeared similar to the kinetics after juice administration (Liang et al., 2015b) .

Moreover, droplet digital PCR analysis showed that counts from plasma were generally very low and of variable intensity, as occurs in non-specific amplifications. This even occurred in miR-160 (plant miRNA with relatively high apparent count by qRt-PCR), which showed large number of counts but with variable intensity plots (\"rain\" appearance) (Figure 24) , and is consistent with non-specific amplification . Overall, the study (though only 2 subjects were included) suggests that the detection of plant miRNAs in plasma does not support a general and consistent uptake of dietary plant miRNAs .

MiR-156a and miR-159 reached up to 1000,000 copy numbers/mg food. The conserved animal miRNA miR-21 was expressed at substantial levels (\u2248100,000 copies/mg food) in meat but not in fruits. Mouse vegetarian and soy-enriched diets also contained high quantities (up to 1000,000 copy numbers/mg food) of miR-156a and miR-159a, but not miR-21. In contrast, mouse diets enriched with animal products contained elevated levels of miR-21, suggesting that conserved plant and animal miRNAs are commonly present in oral diets for various animal organisms. Although the dietary record of 7 of the 10 healthy adults reported the intake of fruits replete in miR-156a, miR-159a and miR-169a the day prior to plasma harvest, these plant-derived miRNAs were undetectable in plasma samples. Following 4-week feeding with a custom animal lard diet containing miR-21 no detectable levels of miR-21 were found in plasma samples of miR-21 -/mice, while high quantities of this miRNA in plasma were seen in control wild type mice fed the same diet . In tissues (liver, lung, kidney and stomach) miR-21 was either not detected or detected at exceedingly low levels corresponding to less than one copy of miR-21 per cell (assuming that the mammalian cell expresses roughly 10 pg of total RNA). Wild type-mice showed only a non-significant trend toward increased plasma levels of miR-156a after consuming either a vegetarian or soy-enriched diet when compared to mice fed a lard diet for the same period (4-week) ( Figure 25) ; however, levels were very low. Indeed, miR-156a was detected in organ tissues (liver, lung, kidney and stomach) but at levels of less than one copy of miRNA per cell and regardless of diets. miR-159a and miR-169a were not detected at all. Fresh avocado containing three specific plant miRNAs was also fed to mice (4.5 g per mouse over 24 h). Even though the three miRNAs were found in the stomach content of mice at high levels, very low levels were found in plasma and organ tissues, reaching levels lower than one copy miRNA per cell in tissues. This provides no evidence of substantial steady-state presence of these plant miRNAs in organ tissues after dietary intake . Assuming that, on average, at least 100 copies per cell (>100 copies/pg sRNA per cell) are necessary to achieve canonical target gene repression (Brown et al., 2007) , at least 10 15 copies of a given plant miRNA must be ingested and delivered for widespread biological activity in humans (the average human body contains \u224810 13 cells).

Possible ncRNAs passage between cells is limited by the presence of tight junctions and the pore size in the human intestine would prevent the passage of all but miRNAs, which are the smallest ncRNAs. Although crossing the cells by transcytosis may be possible, this mechanism implies facing new intracellular barriers, such as nucleases, recycling of ncRNAs back to the lumen and nuclear uptake. However, M-cells, present in the gut epithelium interspersed between enterocytes, present certain characteristics that would make them more amenable for RNA uptake. A second barrier is represented by a set of obstacles during the passage from the intestine to the target tissue, which encompasses plasma and tissue nucleases. Once in the circulatory system, exogenous ncRNAs are subjected to distribution and elimination. For example, small RNAs would be rapidly cleared by the kidney due to their small size. Furthermore, ncRNAs need to escape the reticuloendothelial system, the function of which is to clear foreign pathogens. Finally, they would have to cross the vascular endothelial barrier to reach the target tissue, facing hurdles like those in the enterocytes. Packaging or incorporation of ncRNAs into extracellular transport systems (i.e. exosomes/microvesicles or inclusion in ribonucleoprotein complexes) would confer certain resistance to nucleases and other barriers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General remarks"}, {"text": "ncRNAs must enter the target cells to exert their functions.

It has been estimated that small RNAs make up far less than 5% of total RNA in plants, suggesting a very low exposure to plant ncRNAs under normal conditions. Whether sufficient levels of exogenous plant ncRNAs can be consumed in the diet to exert a biological effect is also another aspect that needs to be evaluated. Some examples in the literature suggest that for certain plant miRNAs (i.e. miR-156a) a person would need to consume 1670 kg of cantaloupe to reach the 100 copies of miRNA per cell possibly determining an effect.

The meagre available literature contains a very few studies of the half-life of plant ncRNAs (i.e. miRNAs, lncRNAs and circRNAs) both inside the plant cell and outside the plant. Specifically, the stability of circRNAs should be assessed due to their apparently high stability. Moreover, very few reports focus on assessment of plant ncRNAs stability in mammalian systems, when ingested. Understanding the molecular basis that confers plant ncRNAs stability is of great importance and needs to be further evaluated. For instance, plant miRNAs and siRNAs carry modifications that do not occur in mammals. These modifications, such as the presence of a methyl group located on the 3' nucleotide ribose, could hypothetically have an impact on the plant miRNAs stability in mammalian systems/cells due to either the lack of the appropriate enzymes for recognition and degradation of plant miRNAs by mammalian cells, or the increased stability to degradation by mammalian RNases. The circularized structure of plant circRNAs would hypothetically confer them increased stability to mammalian RNAses. If this is the case, plant miRNAs and circRNAs could exhibit a much longer half-life in mammalian systems than expected, especially when compared to mammalian miRNA or circRNAs. This would increase their chances of reaching the appropriate target tissue and encountering suitable target molecules within the cells. The half-life of plant ncRNAs within mammalian cells is also an important aspect to consider. Experiments are needed with labelled plant ncRNAs, first in transfected mammalian cells (in vitro studies) and then orally administered to experimental animals (in vivo studies). Radioactive probes or molecules of very low molecular weight, such as biotin or fluorescein, should be used, in order to prevent distorting the actual size of the studied plant ncRNA; this is important when studying miRNAs stability due to their small size.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Gaps in the scientific literature and recommendations"}, {"text": "Another aspect possibly relevant for risk assessment is to understand whether and how ingested GM plant-derived ncRNAs can affect the expression levels of other ncRNAs and other RNAs, due to putative compensatory circuits and codifying RNAs.

Putative pathways of dietary exogenous ncRNAs after ingestion and the many transporters potentially involved (i.e, in cellular uptake, or barrier passage transport pathways) in the transit from the gut to the target tissues should be characterized using standard molecular biology gainof-function and loss-of-function approaches. Also, the many routes of mammalian intracellular trafficking to the specific intracellular target should be studied. To this aim, ncRNAs isolated from human diets should be used preferentially, since most of the incomplete current knowledge comes from the RNA-therapeutics field or is derived from the invertebrate world.

Several other 2'-Omodified structures have been tested in RNAi studies(Odadzic et al., 2008). 2'-Fluoro (2'-F) modification locks the sugar ring into the C3'-endo sugar pucker resulting in increased thermal stability at 2 to 3 \u00baC per modification, and improved RNA affinity(Pallan et al., 2011). However, 2'-F modified oligonucleotides are not nuclease resistant(Li and Rana, 2014). 2'-F is widely used in miRNA(Rayner  et al., 2011) and siRNA (Lima et al., 2012)  therapies and is also present in an FDA-approved aptamer for treatment of macular degeneration(D'Amico et al., 2006). Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) is another chemical modification leading to a bicyclic RNA that tethers the 2'oxygen to the 4'carbon via a methylene bridge, locking the sugar furanose ring into the C3'-endo conformation(Obika et al., 1997)  (Figure 9). The LNA modification dramatically increases RNA biding affinity (\u2248+5 to +8 \u00baC per LNA) and nuclease resistance inASO, siRNAs (Mook et al., 2010; Mook et al., 2007), miRNAs(Janssen et al., 2013)  and aptamer(Schmidt et al., 2004)  therapeutics. Although fully modified LNA might reduce efficacy as well as off-target effects(Mook et al., 2007), the use of this chemical modification allowed the development of a complete tiny RNA (\u22488 mers) for in vivo miRNA use(Obad et al., 2011; Rottiers et al., 2013).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF19": {"text": "Unlocked RNA, lacking the C2'-C3'-bond of the RNA ribose ring, are compatible with the siRNA mechanism and have increased stability in vivo even when naked (Laursen et al., 2010).

Indeed, the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acids, including RNAs, is rapidly hydrolysed by nucleases in biological systems. Replacement of one of the non-bridging oxygen of a phosphodiester linkage with a sulphur (phosphorothioate) is one of the most common backbone modifications used in the current RNA-based therapeutics arsenal (Eckstein, 2014). Phosphorothioate backbones are less susceptible to nuclease cleavage in vivo and thus increase DNA or RNA stability, as has been widely observed when developing ASO therapeutics(Kastelein et al., 2006), miRNA therapeutics (Janssen et al., 2013 Esau  et al., 2006; Krutzfeldt et al., 2005), or siRNA therapeutics(Soutschek et al., 2004; Braasch et al.,  2004).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF21": {"text": "unspecific target genes(Winkler et al., 2010)  or platelet activation(Flierl et al.,  2015).Several other backbone modifications have been studied in RNA-based therapeutics(Wan and Seth,  2016). Boranophosphonate, as a replacement of one of the nonbridging oxygen atoms of the phosphodiester linkage with boron, enhances nuclease resistance and exerts siRNA activity using singlestranded RNAs(Hall et al., 2006). Alkoxy group modification (phosphotriester) increases serum stability, confers neutral charge and they can be converted by cytoplasmic thioesterases into native, charged phosphodiester-backbone siRNAs(Meade et al., 2014). The use of nitrogen (N3'-N5' phosphoroamidate) increases resistance to nucleases and affinity toward the complementary RNA(Faria et al., 2001;  Gryaznov, 2010). Amides can also be a good replacement for phosphodiester internucleoside linkage in RNA and may increase RNAi activity when placed near the 5'-end of the passenger strand(Mutisya et  al., 2014). Replacing the sugar phosphate backbone with a peptide scaffold [peptide nucleic acid (PNA)] increases nuclease resistance but with limited solubility and poor protein binding(Egholm et al., 1993;  Wan and Seth, 2016). PNA can be used for translation inhibition(Nulf and Corey, 2004)  or as a siRNA mechanism(Gaglione et al., 2014). Phosphorodiamidate morpholinos, in which the sugar phosphate backbone is replaced with a morpholino ring and the phosphodiester linkage with a phosphorodiamidate linkage, confers very high resistance to nucleases(Hudziak et al., 1996). Although also tested for miRNA function(Chang et al., 2016), morpholinos have mainly been evaluated for exon skipping therapy(Cirak  et al., 2011). Several other additional chemical modifications, not described here, have been reported in the literature.ConjugationBecause of their size and negative charges, exogenous RNAs cannot easily cross cell membranes (see below). Moreover, chemically modified oligonucleotides, when administered in the absence of a carrier, show limited tissue distribution and are rapidly excreted in urine(Tavitian et al., 1998; Li and Rana,  2014; Moschos et al., 2011). Thus, different conjugation methods have been developed for RNAs therapeutics. Cholesterol conjugation has been shown to increase cellular uptake in several tissues as well as in vivo stability of anti-miRs (antagomirs)(Krutzfeldt et al., 2007; Krutzfeldt et al., 2005), siRNAs(Wolfrum et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2009)  or other ASOs. Lipoprotein-mediated delivery of cholesterolmodified siRNA has been proposed to increases hepatic uptake(Wolfrum et al., 2007).

Different formulations have been developed, including cationic lipids, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lipid conjugates(Morrissey et al., 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2006); N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), which binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) expressed on hepatocytes (Akinc et al., 2010); or several others described elsewhere(Wu and McMillan, 2009). All these advances have led to liposomal delivery of miRNA miR-34, which is being used in clinical trials(Beg et al., 2016).Advances in material science, nanotechnology and chemical engineering have also led to development of nanoparticle (polymer)-based methods for in vivo RNA delivery(Li and Rana, 2014). A wide variety of tools have been developed leading to several therapeutics reaching clinical trials(Sullenger and Nair,  2016; Zuckerman and Davis, 2015). Chitosan polymer nanoparticles have been used to deliver siRNAs and miRNAs(Gaur et al., 2015)  both systemically and for mucosal delivery(Howard et al., 2006). Pectincoated water-soluble chitosan nanoparticles have been tested for colonic delivery of dsiRNA(Hussain et  al., 2017). Several modifications of chitosan have been developed, including galactose-modified trimethyl chitosan-cysteine conjugates for oral delivery(Han et al., 2014).Lipid nanoparticles containing siRNA have rapidly entered into clinical trials for several diseases(Dunning  et al., 2016; Suhr et al., 2015; Coelho et al., 2013; Tabernero et al., 2013). Among these, Revusiran (known as ALN-TTRSC), a GalNAc-siRNAs conjugate which targets transthyretin (TTR), has undergone clinical development (via subcutaneous route for liver diseases)(Zimmermann et al., 2017). Together with Patisiran (also known as ALN-TTR02), which also targets TTR via intravenous administration, these are the most advanced siRNA-based therapeutics to date (Zuckerman and Davis, 2015; Sullenger and Nair, 2016). Other non-lipidic nanoparticles have also been developed. CALAA-01 is a polymer-based nanoparticle coated with the human protein transferrin that targets the kidney, allowing the siRNA to reach the RRM2 gene(Zuckerman et al., 2014).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF25": {"text": "BD, Parsons C, Slack FJ. 2016.

The epithelial layer includes enterocytes, goblet cells, M-cells, Paneth cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes and hormone-secreting endocrine cells. RNAs could theoretically cross the epithelium either between the cells (paracellular route) or through the cells (transcellular route). The first option is limited by the presence of tight junctions between cells (Linnankoski et al., 2010). These junctions represent less than 1% of the mucosal surface area of the intestine(Jung et al., 2000). In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, tight junctions permeability is increased as the epithelium is disrupted(Clayburgh et al., 2004). Paracellular pore size in the human intestine generally ranges from 0.5-3 nm (Linnankoski et al., 2010), which would theoretically barely allow passage of miRNAs, the smallest ncRNAs, which have a cross-section size of approximately 2.5 nm and a contour of 6-7 nm(Gu et al., 2012). The transcellular transport route has the advantage of presenting an extensive area for theoretical uptake(Daugherty and Mrsny, 1999). The main mechanism is transcytosis, involving endocytosis of molecules at the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells, their transport through the cells and across the basolateral membrane into the underlying lamina propria(O'Neill et al., 2011).

Daily oral treatment (8 days) with these encapsulated nanoparticles (60 \u00b5g siRNA/kg) reduced inflammation in a mouse model of colitis(Laroui et al., 2014). Single-chain CD98 antibody (scCD98)-PEG-urocanic acid (UAC)-modified chitosan (scCD98-PEG-UAC)/PEI nanoparticles carrying siRNAs against CD98 were also shown to be effective in a murine model of colitis(Xiao et al., 2014). The siRNA nanoparticles were encapsulated in an alginate chitosan hydrogel (ratio 7/3) that selectively degraded in the vicinity of the inflamed colon (2 mg/kg siRNA per day for 4 days)(Xiao et al., 2014). The same group tested a combination therapy using the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin. A polymeric nanoparticle containing hyaluronic acid-functionalized siRNA against CD98 (siCD98) and curcumin, encapsulated into a hydrogel comprised of chitosan and alginate, was used in a model of ulcerative colitis(Xiao et al., 2016). Daily treatment with an oral dose of 5 mg/kg curcumin and 16.55 \u00b5g/kg siCD98 was efficient in a mouse model of DSS-induced colitis(Xiao et al., 2016). An alternative nanoparticle using polyethyleneimine for TNF\u03b1 siRNA delivery, was found to be effective in a mouse model of colonic inflammation (Laroui et al., 2011). As above, for oral use (5 mg siRNA/mL hydrogel) the siRNA nanoparticles were encapsulated in alginate chitosan hydrogels(Laroui et al., 2011).Chitosan is a linear cationic mucopolysaccharide composed of randomly distributed N-acetyl-Dglucosamine and \u03b2-(1,4)-linked D-glucosamine. Its biocompatible, biodegradable, mucoadhesive, nonimmunogenic and non-toxic properties have led to development of polymers for oral use(Lai and Lin,  2009). Indeed, chitosan polymer derivative nanoparticles have also been used for ncRNA delivery for oral use. To improve the solubility of chitosan, trimethylation modification can be introduced(Kean et  al., 2005)  or galactosylation modification applied to increase galactose receptor-mediated endocytosis. Nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan-cysteine containing siRNA against TNF\u03b1 (2'-O-methyl modified) were evaluated for their resistance to GI biological fluids. While different formulated nanoparticles resisted incubation with intestinal fluids, intestinal homogenate and gastric fluids, naked siRNA (even slightly chemically modified) was degraded following incubation with gastric fluids for 5 min or other physiological fluids for 2 h(He et al., 2013b). To test the in vivo biological activity, nanoparticles were administered orally to mice (200 \u00b5g/kg) and 24h post administration reduced LPS-induced serum TNF\u03b1 levels and reduced mRNA expression in liver, spleen and lung were observed(He et al., 2013b).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF54": {"text": "Yin et al., 2013).

Other chitosan nanoparticles were also tested for non-chemically modified siRNAs for oral use(Ballarin-Gonzalez et al., 2013). siRNA (78 \u00b5g) incorporated in chitosan nanoparticles was detected in the stomach, proximal and distal small intestines, and colon of mice 1 h and 5 h after oral gavage(Ballarin-Gonzalez et al., 2013). Nevertheless, low levels of naked siRNA were found in these organs at 1 h and were further reduced 5 h after dosing.

Other types of RNAs have also been found in breast milk, including mRNAs(Hata et al., 2010; Izumi et al., 2012; Izumi et al., 2015), pre-miRNAs(Gu et al., 2012) and long ncRNAs(Karlsson et al., 2016). Several studies have identified miRNAs in human breast milk(Kosaka et al., 2010; Alsaweed et al., 2015; Alsaweed et al., 2016c, a), bovine milk(Hata et al., 2010)  and in milk of other species including pig(Gu et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014;Sun J, 2017), panda and goat(Golan-Gerstl et al., 2017). It has been proposed that human milk miRNAs primarily originate from the mammary epithelium, while a smaller contribution is provided by maternal blood(Alsaweed et al., 2016c). Indeed, a considerably amount of mamary gland miRNAs were present in milk-derived microvesicles(Hata et al., 2010). Human milk miRNAs have been found to positively correlate with milk cellular and lipid content (Alsaweed et al., 2016a). In breast milk, miRNAs have been found in the cell fraction(Alsaweed et al., 2015), lipid fraction(Munch et al., 2013), exosomelike nanovesicles(Gu et al., 2012; Hata et al., 2010;Zhou et al., 2012), whey fraction(Izumi et al.,  2012)  and supernatant of whey after exosome isolation(Izumi et al., 2015). As far as their function, immune-related miRNAs are particularly abundant in human breast milk(Kosaka et al., 2010;, as well as the milk of cow(Hata et al., 2010;Sun et al., 2013), pig (Gu et al., 2012 Chen et  al., 2014;Sun J, 2017), goat(Mobuchon et al., 2015) and panda. Metabolism-related miRNAs were also common(Carney et al., 2017; Alsaweed et al., 2016a; Chen et al., 2014). Although a large amount of miRNAs has been identified in milk exosomes, it is important to note that several studies indicate that they are enriched by very few miRNA types.

The European Food Safety Authority reserves its rights, view and position as regards the issues addressed and the conclusions reached in the present document, without prejudice to the rights of the author(s). (Zhou et al., 2014) . Twenty female and ten male rats per group in the first generation (F0) were fed the different diets. Their pups, 20 weanling/female/group and 10 weanling/male/group were randomly selected as an F1 generation. The F2 generation was acquired by using the same procedure described above. At weaning, F3 generation rats were chosen, and 10 rats/sex/group provided the corresponding diets and observed for 13 weeks. No major differences in animal survival, health status, behaviour, body weight, food consumption, or reproductive capacity were observed with the different diets. Some statistically significant differences were observed in animals given the transgenic rice diets compared to those receiving the standard diet for certain clinical chemistry parameters, in certain generations (ALT, ALKP, LDH, cholesterol, HDLC, LDLC). These changes were not considered adverse or biologically significant (Zhou et al., 2014) . Moreover, no evidence of altered incidence or altered severity of background changes was observed in any organ or tissues of the rats fed the three diets (Zhou et al., 2014) . Although minor changes in the mean relative weight of epididimides in male F3 adults was observed in rats fed the rice diets compared to the control group, no difference was observed between the transgenic rice fed rats and their near-isogenic line controls, suggesting overall that the transgenic line was unlikely to cause any risk to rat health in reproduction or development, even when consumed for up to three generations (Zhou et al., 2014) . However, these studies did not evaluate any aspect related to RNAi.Heinemann et al. compared the history of risk assessment of GMOs producing dsRNAs in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, with a focus on regulatory context (Heinemann et al., 2013) . The authors suggested some processes to properly assess the safety of dsRNA-producing GM plants before their release or marketing. These include i) bioinformatics analysis to identify any likely, unintended targets of the dsRNA in human and animals; ii) experimental procedures that would identify all new intended and unintended dsRNA molecules in the GM product; iii) testing animal and human cells in tissue cultures for a response to intended and unintended effects of dsRNAs from the product; iv) long-term testing on animals; and possibly v) clinical trials on human volunteers (Heinemann et al., 2013) . In response to this article, the regulatory agency Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) published a document addressing regulation of GM crops and foods developed using gene silencing (http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/gmfood/Pages/Response-to-Heinemann-et-al-on-theregulation-of-GM-crops-and-foods-developed-using-gene-silencing.aspx). This document criticised some of the comments of the above risk assessment review. Some key points included the lack of weight of scientific evidence (published up to 2013) to support the view that small dsRNAs in foods are likely to have adverse consequences in humans; the lack of a scientific basis for suggesting that small dsRNAs present in GM foods have different properties than naturally-occurring ones; or the adequate acknowledge of many barriers (in the uptake, distribution and targeting) during oral development of small dsRNA therapies, among others. The overall suggestion was that there was no need to consider additional studies as proposed by Heinemann et al. (2013) .Commentary documents reviewing scientific meetings in the context of RNAi technologies in agricultural biotechnology discuss some of the aspects reviewed in this document .Additional relevant documents of baseline information to support the risk assessment and environmental risk assessment of RNAi-based GM plants can be obtained from EFSA external scientific reports ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1330, "end": 1349, "text": "(Zhou et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 2251, "end": 2270, "text": "(Zhou et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 2427, "end": 2446, "text": "(Zhou et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2895, "text": "(Zhou et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF270"}, {"start": 3120, "end": 3144, "text": "(Heinemann et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 3731, "end": 3755, "text": "(Heinemann et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF261"}, {"start": 4260, "end": 4282, "text": "(published up to 2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4771, "end": 4794, "text": "Heinemann et al.
