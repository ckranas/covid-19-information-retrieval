Here we further characterize FNEs as a potential non-invasive tool to probe human in-utero neurodevelopment. METHODS: Maternal plasma samples were precipitated with ExoQuick solution and FNEs were isolated with biotinylated anti-Contactin-2/ TAG1 antibody-streptavidin matrix immunoabsorption. Total exosome content (CD81), placental contamination (PSG-1) and sonic hedgehog (SNHH) protein levels were quantified by ELISA. Expression of CD81 was examined in fixed human fetal brain at 15-19 wks from healthy pregnancies (HP) and those with heavy current ethanol (FAS). Immunostainings utilized primary antibodies followed by FITCcongugated secondary antibodies.",

            "text": "The FNE fraction in maternal plasma was 2-20%. FNEs crossreacted weakly with PSG-1. In the 1 st/ 2 nd trimester, there was a positive correlation between PSG-1 and gestational age (GA, r=0.52, p=0.03) but none between GA and CD81 (r=0.03, p=0.87) . SNHH FNE levels normalized to CD81 were significantly reduced in FAS compared to HP (p=0.03). CD81 was widely distributed within fetal brain but was reduced in FAS. Mean maternal plasma/cord plasma FNE ratio was 0.89 at term. CONCLUSIONS: We expand on our novel methods for isolating FNEs from maternal plasma as a non-invasive method to probe fetal neurodevelopment. Decreased levels of SNHH in FNEs from FAS suggest that EtOH alters signaling for neuroproliferation and potentially decreases innate neuroprotection. Exosomal proteins are seen in many regions of the developing brain but may be altered in disease. Placental contamination of FNEs is minimal but increases with GA. Placental passage of FNEs is robust at term. Further research is needed to characterize the correlation between maternal blood FNEs and structural/molecular fetal brain injury. *Figure(s) will be available online. (ID) and anemia in addition to high gestational weight gain (GWG). High GWG in this group may increase inflammation. Recent evidence suggests obesity is a risk factor for ID due to inflammatorymediated increases in hepcidin, the major iron-regulatory hormone. Our study objective was to assess the effect of prepregnancy body mass index (ppBMI) and GWG on hepcidin, iron status and inflammation among women with twins. METHODS: A prospective cohort of women \u226519 years with uncomplicated twin gestations and who delivered \u2265 24 weeks gestational age (GA) were recruited between 2011 and 2014. BMI was classified according to the WHO and GWG was categorized using the 2009 IOM pregnancy weight gain guidelines. Maternal iron status and inflammation included hemoglobin (Hgb), hepcidin, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin receptor (TFR), total body iron (TBI), erythropoietin (EPO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Analysis was conducted using SPSS v22 with significance set at 0.05. RESULTS: Our population included 64 women with twins. Approximately 49% had a ppBMI \u2265 25.0 at the onset of pregnancy. Most women failed to meet GWG recommendations. At the first study visit (mean GA 23.0 \u00b16.8), 32.1% of women were anemic compared to 48.4% of women at delivery (mean GA 35.3 \u00b12.3), p<0.01. Mean Hgb at delivery was lowest among women with inadequate GWG (10.8 g/dL \u00b1 1.8, p=0.04). TFR (>8.5 mg/L) and EPO significantly increased across gestation, p=0.02 and p=0.03, respectively. IL-6 was positively associated with hepcidin at delivery (r= .43, p<0.01). No iron status or inflammatory indicators were significantly associated with ppBMI or total GWG. However, when stratified by ppBMI, GWG was negatively correlated with TFR (r= -.49, p=0.02) and positively correlated with ferritin (r= .56, p<0.01) only among women with a normal ppBMI. Women with inadequate GWG had lower levels of ferritin (p=0.04) and TBI (p=0.02) at delivery. These women were also more likely to have a preterm birth (PTB) (p=0.02) and deliver an infant <2500 g (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GWG below IOM recommendations in women carrying twins increased the risk of maternal Fe insufficiency and PTB. These data do not support the premise that excessive GWG or high ppBMI increases inflammation and risk of ID women carrying twins.",

METHODS: We isolated primary trophoblast then 1) inhibited EGFR with either siRNAs or gefitinib (orally available EGFR inhibitor), or 2) inhibited major downstream EGFR adaptor molecules and measured sFlt1 secretion. We also added EGF peptide at varied concentrations and measured EGFR expression and sFlt1 secretion. Finally, EGFR expression was assessed in primary trophoblasts treated with esomeprazole and pravastatin. RESULTS: Inhibiting EGFR with gefitinib or siRNAs significantly reduced sFlt1 secretion by 30-70% from baseline ( Figure 1 ). Small molecules inhibiting the downstream adaptor molecules MEK1/2 (U0126), Erk/12 (PD98059), c-RAF (ZM336372) and JAK2 (AG490) potently induced a dose dependent reduction in sFlt1 secretion. Adding low dose EGF (up to 1.0pg/ml) increased EGFR gene expression and increased sFlt1 secretion. Interestingly, the effects of EGF followed a bell-shaped curve: >1ng/ml of EGF down-regulated EGFR and reduced sFlt1 secretion, whereas >100ng/mL EGF up-regulated EGFR and increased sFlt1 secretion. Treating primary trophoblast with Esomeprazole or Pravastatin dose dependently reduced sFlt1 (as we've previously reported) coincident with a significant dose-dependent reduction in EGFR mRNA expression. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a new level of molecular regulation for sFlt1. EGFR appears to positively regulate sFlt-1 secretion. The implications are that identifying drugs that block EGFR signaling (such as gefitinib which is currently in clinical use) may be a novel therapeutic strategy.",

FACS was conducted on blood samples to identify circulating DsRed cells. Lung, liver, and spleen were harvested 4 weeks after induction, followed by FACS for DsRed cells. Paraffin embedded tissue sections were stained by immunofluorescence for DsRed. The slides were visualized using confocal microscopy. qRT-PCR was used to characterize the sorted DsRed cells in lung, liver and spleen. RESULTS: Circulating DsRed endometriosis-derived cells were identified in all animals with transplanted endometriosis and not in controls. A significantly higher number of DsRed cells were found in the CXCL12 treated group during the first 17 days after induction. No difference was found in AMD3100 group compared with those receiving vehicle treatment. FACS analysis revealed endometriosis-derived cells in lung, liver, and spleen of animals with EMS. Significantly higher numbers of endometriosis-derived cells were seen in the tissues of the CXCL12 treated group, while no DsRed cells were found in the AMD3100 treated group or controls. DsRed endometriosis-derived cells were higher in spleen than in lung and liver, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining showed results consistent with FACS analysis. qRT-PCR showed that the sorted cells from lung, liver, and spleen expressed CXCR4 and endometrial mesenchymal stem cell (eMSC) markers CD140B and CD146, but not hematopoeitic stem cell marker CD45. CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis-derived cells, which express stem cell markers and CXCR4, are capable of migrating to distant organs. CXCL12 treatment increased mobilization and engraftment, while blockade of CXCL12 prevented engraftment. Hematologic dissemination driven by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is involved in the spread of endometriosis. CXCR4 antagonists are a potential novel therapy to prevent the spread of this disease. . Literature evidence suggests a pathophysiological role for enhanced PRL signaling in human endometriosis. Patients suffering from systemic hyperprolactinemia and endometriosis were successfully treated with a dopamine receptor (DR) agonist leading to disappearance and shrinkage of endometriotic lesions. However, prolactin produced in extrapituitary sites cannot be blocked by DR agonists. Gene expression studies demonstrated an upregulation of PRLR and PRL mRNA in human endometriotic lesions suggesting a role for local hyperprolactinemia in endometriosis. To block PRLR-mediated signaling, we developed a neutralizing PRLR antibody BAY-094 (005-C04). This antibody acts as a noncompetitive PRLR antagonist in vitro and its in vivo application mimicked the phenotype of PRLR deficient female mice [1] .",

RESULTS: Trpv2 -/mice showed a significantly lower survival rate per litter. However, the number of blastocysts after 4 days in vitro culture were not different between wild type and Trpv2 -/animals. In addition, in vivo decidualization experiments using a MMM revealed successful decidualization in only 20% of Trpv2 -/animals compared to 80% in the Trpv2 +/+ mice. Remarkably, mRNA and functional expression of TRPV2 in hESC decreased significantly after 5 days of in vitro decidualization. In order to illuminate possible upstream signaling pathways, blockers of different pathways were tested. Interestingly, inhibitors of the protein kinase A signaling pathway significantly modulated in vitro decidualization and strongly affected the TRPV2 expression in hESCs. CONCLUSIONS: These data showed a significant lower survival rate per litter in Trpv2 -/mice, that is not caused by abnormalities in blastocyst development. In addition, these results suggest a possible role of TRPV2 in the decidualization process, since the percentage of decidualized animals was lower in Trpv2 -/mice. In addition, these data provide evidence for a reduced TRPV2 expression after decidualization. All together, these results suggest an important role of TRPV2 in the onset of decidualization.",

METHODS: Primary hepatocytes were isolated from CON (n=5-6) and IUGR (n=8-10) fetal sheep. Glucose production, adjusted to protein content, was measured after 24h treatment in glucose-free media with lactate and pyruvate in the absence or presence of 500 nM DEX and 100 \u00b5M cAMP (D+C) . For mRNA analysis by qPCR, hepatocytes were studied basally or with D+C or 100 nM insulin in normoxia (21% O 2 ) or hypoxia (3% O 2 ) for 4 or 24h. For protein analysis by western blot, hepatocytes were treated with insulin (0, 1, 10 nM) for 15 min following 4h of normoxia or hypoxia. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. RESULTS: IUGR hepatocytes had higher glucose production in response to D+C compared to CON hepatocytes (P<0.05). In CON and IUGR hepatocytes, hypoxia for 4h increased PCK1 and PGC1A mRNA (P<0.005) and D+C further increased PGC1A (P<0.001). However, at 24h PCK1 increased with D+C (P<0.005) but not hypoxia; this PCK1 increase was higher in IUGR hepatocytes than in CON hepatocytes (P=0.06). PGC1A mRNA increased synergistically with hypoxia and D+C (P<0.001). Hypoxia increased P-AMPK by 50% in IUGR cells yet the response was 4-fold greater in CON cells (P<0.05). Insulin increased P-AKT and P-FOXO1 in CON and IUGR cells (P<0.001). P-AKT, but not P-FOXO1, was further increased with hypoxia in IUGR cells only (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with maintenance of increased HGP, IUGR hepatocytes had increased glucose production and PCK1 expression. We speculate that this may be due to decreased P-AMPK in response to hypoxia rather than impaired insulin signaling given maintained P-AKT and P-FOXO1 activation. Further, hypoxia alone in CON and IUGR hepatocytes increased PCK1 and PGC1A expression acutely. Thus, sustained hypoxia-induced PGC1A mRNA and decreased P-AMPK may provide a link to persistently increased HGP in IUGR fetuses with hypoxia. The uv-ua difference was significant for total Cholesterol (p=0.033), HDL (p<0.001) and LDL (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found a net uptake of cholesterol from the umbilical circulation to the fetus. Cholesterol uptake from HDL was similar to that of LDL, making HDL an important exogenous source of cholesterol in the term human fetus. AJP, 2010) . Altered regulation of hypoxia signalling by increased prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) expression in the PR fetal lung may be the mechanism responsible for reduced surfactant (Orgeig et al, AJP, 2015) . To understand the role of PHDs in regulating surfactant maturation, we evaluated the effect of PHD inhibition in the lung of the Control compared with the PR fetus. METHODS: PR was induced by carunclectomy (n=13). At 131 & 132d gestation (term=150\u00b13d) fetuses received a bolus of saline (Control (C+S), 11; PR+S, 7) or PHD inhibitor (C+DMOG, 8; PR+DMOG, 6) in the lung via a non-obstructive tracheal catheter. Expression of genes regulating surfactant maturation PCYT1A, LPCAT, LAMP3, ABCA3) were quantified in lung tissue at 133d by qRT-PCR. Total phosphatidylcholine (PC) was measured in lung lavage. Numerical density of SFTP-B positive cells in lung tissue was determined by point counting. Data were analysed by one-way ANOVA with Duncan posthoc test (P<0.05). RESULTS: PR+S reduced P a O 2 , O 2 saturation & fetal weight compared with C+S. There was reduced expression of surfactant proteins (SFTP-A, -B, -C), lipid transporter LPCAT & total lavage PC in the C+DMOG & PR+S fetal lung compared to C+S (Fig 1) . There was reduced expression of surfactant lipid regulatory genes PCYT1A, LAMP3 and ABCA3 in C+DMOG fetuses compared to C+S and PR+S. There was no further effect of PR+DMOG on expression of genes compared to PR+S alone. There was no effect of either PR or DMOG on the numerical density of SFTP-B positive cells in the fetal lung. CONCLUSIONS: The PHD inhibitor, DMOG, mimics the effect of PR, reducing surfactant maturation in the lung of the C fetus. Interestingly, there was no cumulative effect of PR+DMOG, suggesting a maximal downregulation of surfactant system maturation following chronic hypoxemia in the PR fetus.

            "text": "Concentrations of lactate in culture media were also reduced (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis is associated with a shift in the metabolic activity of mesothelial cells resulting in increased secretion of lactate ('Warburg effect'). We obtained evidence that lactate transport proteins are differentially regulated with MCT1 (lactate importer) increased in endometriosis lesions and MCT4 (lactate exporter) increased in adjacent peritoneum. Our data is consistent with a reciprocal metabolic reprogramming of adjacent peritoneum and ectopic lesions supporting supply of lactate from peritoneum to the endometriosis lesion. We also showed that DCA reduces glycolysis and lactate production in mesothelial cells. Since DCA is already used to treat lactic acidosis and certain cancers, 'repurposing' of DCA and/or related compounds may offer potential as therapeutics for endometriosis. Effluxed endometrium acquires adaptive survival characteristics via dysregulated signaling and epigenetic mechanisms that eventually cause disease. Cytochrome (CYP) p450 enzymes metabolize endogenous and exogenous substrates to critically affect organ pathophysiology. KLF11, a transcription factor diminished in endometriosis, epigenetically represses an array CYP enzymes such as model enzyme CYP3A4. We show here that Transforming growth factor\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) regulates KLF11 and thereby alters endometrial metabolism. METHODS: Ishikawa cells were treated over a time course with 10ng/ ml of TGF\u03b21 or vehicle. Additional cells were transduced with wt-KLF11 or empty vector (EV). KLF11 and canonical TGF\u03b2 pathway (TGF\u03b2R1, 2, SMAD2, 3, 7) expression was evaluated by promoter assays and qPCR. Wildtype and Klf11-/-mice with surgically induced lesions were injected daily with vehicle or a TGF\u03b2R1 inhibitor (TRI). Additionally the animals were treated with selective epigenetic histone acetylase/deacetylase inhibitors that targeted KLF11. Murine lesions as well as paired eutopic and ectopic endometrial samples from 28 patients with endometriosis were evaluated for CYP3A4 by Immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: KLF11 was up-regulated early (0-8hours) followed by sustained repression (4-48 hours) in TGF\u03b2 treated cells. KLF11 repressed TGF\u03b2 receptors, SMAD 2 and 3 levels but activated repressor SMAD 7. KLF11 thus repressed canonical TGFB/SMAD signaling. Sustained KLF11 repression mimics loss of Klf11 with disease progression in the Klf11-/-animal model as well as selective lesional loss of KLF11 in human disease. Loss of Klf11 epigenetically activates CYP3A4 expression in time course, animal model and human disease lesions corroborating disease relevance. TRI reduced disease progression in Klf11-/-mice. When combined with an epigenetic inhibitor disease progression was further abrogated. CONCLUSIONS: Dysregulation of the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway is implicated in endometriotic progression. We show here that altered endometrial metabolism, a crucial mechanism that facilitates adaptive and disease-specific pathophysiology is mediated by TGF\u03b2 via an alternative KLF11 mechanism. Inhibition of the SMAD pathway in vivo reduced disease progression in Klf11 -/-mice which was further diminished INTRODUCTION: BCL6, a transcriptional repressor, is emerging as a biomarker of eutopic endometrial dysfunction in women with endometriosis. We have previously demonstrated over-expression of BCL6 in women and non-human primates with endometriosis and evidence of expression modulation by phosphorylated STAT3 and the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR). Gli1 is a known target of BCL6 in other tissues, a downstream effector of IHH signaling, and an important factor in implantation and decidualization. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of altered endometrial BCL6 expression on Gli1 expression. METHODS: Real-time, RT-PCR assessment of mRNA, Western blot assessment of protein, and ChIP PCR assessment of BCL6 binding site occupancy in one or more of the following: endometrial tissue from normal volunteers, normal endometrial stromal cell culture, and the Ishikawa endometrial epithelial adenocarcinoma cell line. RESULTS: Endometrial expression of Gli1 and BCL6 mRNA show opposite trends: In normal whole endometrium, Gli1 was suppressed 5-fold in the secretory phase, while BCL6 increased 2-fold. In cultured stromal cells from fertile controls, treatment with the AhR atagonist, GNF351, results in increased BCL6 mRNA (3-5 fold) and decreased Gli1 mRNA (4 fold). Ishikawa cells, a model for endometrial epithelial cells, show a similar pattern: Treatment with 10 -6 M Medroxyprogesterone (MPA) for 24 hours increases BCL6 mRNA expression 2-3 fold, but decreases Gli1 expression 4-5 fold. Further, BCL6 siRNA knockdown of BCL6 increases Gli1 expression 1.7-fold. ChIP-PCR using an anti-BCL6 monoclonal antibody show a BCL6 binding site in the region of -305 to -202 of the Gli1 promoter that is minimally occupied with estradiol treatment, but increased almost 20-fold with the addition of 10 -6 M MPA. CONCLUSIONS: Endometrial BCL6 and Gli1 are expressed in opposite patterns in both stromal and epithelial cells. Increased BCL6 expression inhibits Gli1 expression by a mechanism that includes direct binding to the Gli1 promoter. Decreased Gli1 expression may play a role in progesterone resistance and decidualization defects in women with endometriosis. Although BCL6 protein can undergo multiple posttranslational modifications that can potentially affect function, simply changing expression levels leads to functional consequences.",

Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Although uterine leiomyomas proliferate and enlarge within hypoxic environments, a hypoxic response in uterine leiomyoma and myometrium has not been observed. Moreover, it has been reported that protein expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), a transcription factor that mediates various hypoxic responses, does not occur in uterine leiomyoma; however, the abundant extracellular matrix surrounding leiomyoma cells may affect the detection of HIF-1\u03b1 protein, thus making the interpretation of in vivo data difficult. Here, we determined whether hypoxia induces HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-mediated hypoxic responses in uterine leiomyoma and myometrium in vitro.",

            "text": "The IRB at our facility approved the protocol. We obtained consent from participants who underwent hysterectomy for symptomatic leiomyoma. We cultured primary leiomyoma and myometrial cells obtained from surgical specimens under hypoxia (1% oxygen) or normoxia (21% oxygen) with or without cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 , 150 \u00b5M), and then extracted total RNA and protein. We performed RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR to determine mRNA levels, protein levels, and the binding of HIF-1\u03b1 to the promoter of HIF target genes, respectively. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced a significant increase in the level of HIF-1\u03b1 protein up to 6 h in both leiomyoma and myometrial cells, with much lower induction levels in the leiomyoma cells. CoCl 2 , a hypoxia mimetic, also significantly induced HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression. In contrast, HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased without any initial increase in both leiomyoma and myometrial cells up to 12 h with a significantly lower decrease in the leiomyoma cells. Hypoxia significantly increased the mRNA expression all 9 HIF target genes tested: ALDOA, ENO1, GAPDH, HK1, LDHA, PFKL, PFKFB3, SLC2A1, and VEGFA. Moreover, hypoxia induced the binding of HIF-1\u03b1 to putative HIF response elements on the promoter of all 3 HIF target genes: ENO1, LDHA, and VEGFA. All of the hypoxic responses including those to CoCl 2 were attenuated in leiomyoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia induces HIF-mediated hypoxic responses in both leiomyoma and myometrial cells. The attenuated responses in leiomyoma cells may reflect the tolerance of uterine leiomyoma to hypoxia, which may be acquired by exposure to chronic hypoxia. The hypoxia-induced down-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA is a unique characteristic of uterus-derived cells. Overactive bladder syndrome (OBS) is a common health problem. We have shown that vitamin D elicits robust antiinflammatory response in human myometrial cells (Thota et. al., 2013) . Recent studies documented expression of vitamin D receptors in human bladder. We hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency in a risk factor for OBS, which induces a heightened inflammatory microenvironment in bladder wall leading to hyper-excitability and premature contractions of the detrusor muscle. Our aim to assess effect of vitamin D and Paricalcitol on expression of inflammatory cytokines and invitro contractility in human detrusor muscle cells. We have shown that in PCOS, nutrient ingestion stimulates proatherogenic inflammation that is independent of obesity. We examined the effect of salsalate administration on nutrient-induced tolllike receptor-2 (TLR-2) RNA and TLR-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) protein from mononuclear cell (MNC) along with the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration in lean women with PCOS. METHODS: Seven lean women with PCOS diagnosed on the basis of secondary amenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia were selected for study. Subjects ingested 100 ml of dairy cream, received a single 5000 IU IM injection of HCG and underwent a hyperglycemic infusion (130 mg/dl) within 5-8 days of menses. Subjects received salsalate 3 gm daily for 12 weeks and were retested after treatment. MNC were isolated from pre-and post-treatment blood samples drawn while fasting and 2 hours after cream ingestion and the hyperglycemic infusion. The TLR-2 RNA content and the protein content of TLR-2 and MMP-2 were respectively quantified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A) were measured by RIA from blood samples drawn at 0, 24, 48 and 96 hours after HCG administration.",

INTRODUCTION: Sex-determining region Y (Sry) gene expression in the post indeterminate fetal gonad leads to Sertoli cell differentiation, seminiferous cord formation and male differentiation. This is followed by an up regulation of SF-1 expression in the male when compared to the female gonad. The aim of this study is to understand SF-1 gene function in the developing Sertoli cell.

The loss of seminiferous tubules was concomitant with a loss of germ cells. Antibody staining for BRDU incorporation showed a loss of proliferation of Sertoli cells in knock out animals.

A majority of women with this disorder suffer from premature ovarian insufficiency and infertility. The underlying mechanism of oocyte damage in this disorder remains unclear. Recently, we have shown that galactose and its metabolites, galactose 1-phosphate and galactitol deteriorate oocyte quality by altering microtubule morphology and chromosomal alignment. The aim of the study was to explore the mechanism by which galactose and its metabolites deteriorate oocytes quality and function. METHODS: Metaphase II mouse oocytes, with (n=120) and without cumulus cells (n=120), were exposed for 4 hours to galactose (2 \u00b5M), galactitol (11 \u00b5M) and galactose 1-phosphate (0.1 mM), concentrations equivalent to plasma levels present in patients compliant with a galactoserestricted diet. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by Cellular Reactive Oxygen Species Detection Assay Kit and apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated by the JC-1 Assay. RESULTS: Most oocytes exposed to galactose and its metabolites showed poor oocyte quality, independent of cumulus cells. Treatment with these metabolites led to ROS overproduction, increased apoptosis ( Fig.1) and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, cumulus cell viability was significantly reduced. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro exposure to galactose and its metabolites compromise oocyte quality through a mechanism involving mitochondrial damage and overproduction of ROS which mediates alteration of intracellular redox potential balance. Supplementation with antioxidants and/or compounds that can further lower or eliminate galactose and its metabolites could improve follicle dysfunction and female infertility in women with classic galactosemia.",

INTRODUCTION: OHSS is a complication in assisted reproduction, arising from the administration of exogenous gonadotropins to induce ovulation. Increase in serum VEGF levels is an important marker for OHSS. We have shown that expression of VEGF closely parallels the expression levels of LHR mRNA in response to hCG treatment of PMGS-primed rats. We hypothesized that transient downregulation of LHR expression that occurs in response to preovulatory LH surge or in response to the administration of exogenous hCG to induce ovulation prevents OHSS. Conversely, aberration of this transient downregulation might contribute to OHSS by the secretion of VEGF. In the present studies, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the transient downregulation of LHR and the resultant suppression of VEGF production seen in controlled PMSG/hCG-induced ovulation model, are altered in the OHSS model. METHODS: OHSS was induced in immature female rats by s.c. injection of 20 IU of PMSG for four consecutive days, followed by 30 IU of hCG on the 5th day. A control group received a single injection of 50IU of PMSG followed by 30 IU of hCG 48h later. Rats were sacrificed and ovaries harvested 0, 12, 24, and 48h after hCG. RESULTS: A significant increase was seen in both ovary diameter and weight in the OHSS group. Vascular permeability was also found to be significantly higher in the OHSS group. LHR mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in the control at 12h after hCG injection, but increased slowly after 24h reaching normal levels by 48h. The pattern of VEGF expression closely paralleled the LHR expression in the control group. In the OHSS group, although LHR downregulation occurred at 12h after hCG injection, LHR mRNA levels was significantly higher at 24 and 48h, compared to the control. Furthermore, the expression of VEGF mRNA in the OHSS group remained high following hCG treatment and showed a steady increase in a time-dependent manner. VEGF protein, measured by ELISA, also showed a similar trend (55, 75 and 90 pg/ mg protein at 0, 24 and 48h respectively, P<0.01 vs. control ). Thus, in the OHSS group, LHR and VEGF expression remained at higher levels following hCG treatment, compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that dysfunctional LHR downregulation after hCG administration and the resultant increase in VEGF production might contribute to the onset of OHSS.",

Fredrick J Rosario, 1 Theresa L Powell, 1,2 Thomas Jansson. 1 1 University of Colorado AMC, Aurora, CO, USA; 2 University of Colorado AMC, Aurora, CO, USA. INTRODUCTION: Low maternal folate levels are linked to fetal growth restriction and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality, however the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that placental insufficiency is associated with placental mitochondrial dysfunction and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We have previously shown that mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a folate sensor and that mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates the transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes (METCC) in the trophoblast. We tested the hypothesis that maternal folate deficiency decreases protein expression of METCC and causes ER-stress in the placenta. METHODS: Four-week old ICR female mice (n=7) were fed a control diet (folic acid (FA), 6 mg/kg) or a folate-deficient diet (FD 0 mg/kg) for 6 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. At E18.5, dams were killed and fetuses and placentas were collected.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity in pregnancy is common and associated with many pregnancy-related complications such as failed induction of labor (IOL). Leptin, an adipocytokine important in energy homeostasis, is found in higher levels in obese individuals, and has been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on myometrial contractility. We hypothesize that leptin plays a role in the mechanism of dysfunctional labor. Thus, we sought to compare the maternal plasma leptin levels in women that had a successful vaginal delivery post-IOL vs. those who had a C-section post-IOL. METHODS: This case-control study utilizes the University of Iowa Maternal-Fetal Tissue Bank (IRB#200901784). A total of 168 women underwent IOL. 54 delivered via Cesarean section and 114 women delivered vaginally. Maternal/neonatal characteristics were collected/ verified in the electronic medical record. Leptin and total protein levels from third trimester samples were measured using commercially available ELISAs. Statistical analyses were performed and logistic regression models were constructed using regression identified and clinically significant confounding variables. All variables were tested at significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: After normalizing leptin for total protein (leptin/protein [pg/ mcg]), women with failed IOL had higher values (0.5 vs 0.3, P = 0.01). Women with failed IOL were more likely to have obesity (mean BMI 32 vs 27, P = 0.0002), preeclampsia (13% vs 2%, P = 0.008), lower Bishop score (3 vs 5, P < 0.001), lower parity (0.3 vs 0.9, P < 0.001) and meconium-stained fluid (35% vs 13%, P = 0.002). They were also more likely to require multiple induction methods (two or more methods) (93% vs 73%, P = 0.008). In a multivariable regression model, Bishop score was the only covariate associated with successful IOL (OR 1.5, P < 0.001). BMI (OR 0.92, P < 0.001), preeclampsia (0.12, P = 0.010), use of multiple methods of induction (OR 0.22, P = 0.008) and leptin/protein (OR 0.42, P = 0.017) were all associated with failed IOL. After controlling for Bishop score and preeclampsia, leptin/protein was still significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of successful induction of labor with an odds ratio of 0.47 (P = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypothesis, elevated leptin/protein levels are associated with failed IOL. Our data support the hypothesis that leptin is an important factor in explaining why obese women are more likely to have dysfunctional labor and failed induction of labor. INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for the development of endometrial adenocarcinoma. We hypothesized that hyperinsulinemia promotes abnormal endometrial proliferation, and sought to characterize molecular mechanisms for this effect in vivo, particularly for the role of insulin receptor isomers, IR-A and IR-B. To eliminate the confounder of obesity, we chose a lean, non-diabetic but hyperinsulinemic model, the MKR transgenic mouse. METHODS: We extracted uteri from MKR (n=9) and WT (n=5) mice at 15 weeks of age. Histology for endometrial dating and hyperplasia was performed. Gene expression for insulin receptor isomers IR-A and IR-B, IGF-1R, ER\u03b1, PGR, and cell cycle regulators were assessed by qRT-PCR. Each group was analyzed in the proliferative and secretory phases (PP and SP) via log transformation and 2-tailed t-test. RESULTS: Endometrial hyperplasia was present in 1 of 9 (11%) of MKR mice, and in none of the WT. MKR mice had 24-fold higher mean cyclin E expression during PP (p<0.05), and a 30% reduction in p27 during SP (p=0.059) relative to WT. In WT, IR-A mRNA increased 1.6fold (p=0.005) between PP and SP. Whereas, in MKR mice, IR-A was similar between PP and SP, and reduced relative to WT (p=0.01). Mean IR-B levels were similar in MKR and WT. IGF-1R was dramatically reduced by 70% in MKR mice relative to WT during PP (p<0.02). MKR and WT had similar expression of ER\u03b1, ER\u03b1 co-activator NCOA2, PGR, FKBP52 and HOXA10. CONCLUSIONS: Here we isolated the endometrial effect of excess insulin from obesity and unopposed estrogen in an in vivo model. Hyperinsulinemia promotes endometrial hyperplasia by altering regulators of the cell cycle. Increased proliferation occurred despite no change in ER\u03b1 or PGR, and a protective reduction in mitogenic receptors, IR-A and IGF-1R.",

Proliferation and apoptosis were livemonitored and filmed by the IncuCyte system. RNA was evaluated by PCR Arrays for proliferation and apoptosis. Tumor foci in soft agar and colony counts were evaluated. A tissue microarray (TMA) of endometrium, endometriosis, endometrioid or clear cell ovarian cancer from 84 patients was evaluated by immunohistochemistry for KLF11 and Ras expression. RESULTS: Proliferation was lowest and apoptosis highest in all KLF11 transduced cells, intermediate levels were noted with controls, RAS and KLF11 or RASsiRNA. Maximal levels were seen with KLFshRNA with RAS. Correspondingly, tumor foci and colony counts corroborated these results as was dysregulation of oncogenic and apoptotic pathways in PCR Assay. We characterized aberrant cell cycle progression via transcriptional dysregulation of KLF11 target cyclinA2. In the TMA KLF11 levels progressively declined from endometrium to endometriosis to ovarian cancer. In contrast RAS mutant expression increased with progression to cancer. CONCLUSIONS: KLF11 is a well characterized human disease gene. Diminished lesional KLF11 results in endometriotic progression. Our data suggests that continued decline of tumor suppressive functions with de novo oncogene mutations promotes development of ovarian cancer.

Total WBC, neutrophils, monocytes and platelets were significantly correlated with stage, however no significant correlations were identified among grade, MI or LVSI with respect to immune cells. Age, grade, histological subtype, MI and LVSI were all correlated with PFS and OS. By univariate analysis, higher neutrophils and higher monocytes were associated with reduced OS (p<0.05).

RESULTS: Our results demonstrated the presence of two major genetic types of uterine CSs [i.e., uterine serous carcinoma-like (USC) profile and endometrioid carcinoma-like profile (EAC)] and provided evidence that both subtypes, as well as ovarian CS, arise from sarcomatous transformation of carcinomas. We found an excess of mutations in histones H2A and H2B, as well as significant amplification of the segment of chromosome 6p. We also found frequent deletions comprising TP53 and MBD3, and frequent amplification of chromosome segments containing PIK3CA, CCNE1, TERT and c-MYC. Amplifications of the histone cluster and TERT were significantly more frequent in CS than their epithelial counterparts. Stable transgenic expression H2A and H2B in USC cell lines suggested a role in sarcomatous transformation. Comparison of the phylogenetic relationships of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements of the same tumors demonstrated separate lineages resulting in these two components. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insight into the origins of uterine and ovarian CS and define the genetic landscape of this type of malignant tumor.

INTRODUCTION: Oogonial stem cells (OSCs) can provide a renewable source of oocytes throughout reproductive life. Yet, all women experience progressive depletion of oocytes to the point of exhaustion, driving menopause. Since OSCs persist in ovaries after ovarian failure, we hypothesize that ovarian aging disrupts external cues necessary for continued differentiation of OSCs into oocytes. Here we tested if changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding OSCs, and by inference mechanical forces, may serve as key participants in OSC function and ovarian aging. METHODS: Ovaries collected from 6-week (young) and 14-month (aged) C57/BL6 mice were probed for collagen type I and type IV protein levels. To study differentiation, feeder cell-free cultures of OSCs (passage 30-35) isolated from young mice were seeded into culture wells coated with 10 \u00b5g/cm 2 of collagen type I or IV, or an equal mixture of both, and then assayed for in vitro derived (IVD) oocyte formation (Nature Protocols 2013 8:966) . To study mechanical force effects, OSCs were seeded onto flexible silicone membranes coated with ECM protein, and vacuum pressure was applied to achieve three distinct doses of tensile strain, after which IVD oocyte formation was measured. For gene expression, RNA was isolated from cultured OSCs and evaluated by quantitative PCR. All experiments were replicated 3 times, and statistical significance determined by ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Levels of collagen type I and IV were decreased in ovarian tissue with age. Compared with control OSC cultures, a combination of collagen type I and IV, but not either collagen alone, enhanced expression of the meiosis initiation gene, Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 twofold (P<0.05), and increased IVD oocyte formation by 140% (P<0.005). Addition of tensile strain at a cellular level further enhanced oogenesis by OSCs seeded onto ECM in a force dependent manner (P<0.05). Gene expression profiling revealed that integrin subunits \u03b13, \u03b1V, \u03b21, and \u03b25, which transduce signals from ECM, were all highly expressed in OSCs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively highlight a novel role for ECM and mechanosensitive signaling pathways in promoting mammalian OSC differentiation.

New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: Trisomy is a common chromosomal abnormality associated with fetal loss and multi-systemic complications of survival in humans. Animal models cannot inform developmental pathophysiology in trisomies. Previous studies have shown slow cell kinetics and reliable differentiation into hematopoietic and neural lineages of trisomic human amniotic fluid cells (AFC). We investigated the behavior of trisomic AFCs compared with euploid AFCs in culture to guide better understanding of abnormal development. METHODS: Amniotic fluid was collected from women identified at risk for fetal abnormality at second trimester amniocentesis. Three samples were identified as trisomic (2x Trisomy21, 1x Trisomy18). AFCs were isolated and cultured to observe morphology and multiplication potential. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to evaluate cell surface markers of pluripotency, as euploid AFCs are known to be pluripotent. Cells were grown as 3D spheroids for differentiation into osteogenic, chondrogenic and neural lineages. Immunohistochemistry staining and fluorescent imaging was performed for analysis of lineage markers. Trisomic cultures were compared to matched euploid controls. RESULTS: Fetal Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 21 AFCs were morphologically indistinguishable from euploid samples. Trisomic AFCs exhibited rapid division for a 96 hr period, exceeding euploid pace. FACS analysis using antibodies for stem cell pluripotency markers SSEA4, TRA-1-60 and CD90 revealed expression patterns similar to euploid samples. Trisomy18 spheroids differentiated similarly to euploid samples into osteogenic, chondrogenic and neural lineages. Trisomy21 samples uniformly induced either more weakly or did not induce at all into all three lineages. * Figure( (HDP) has been proposed to be a central mechanism of fetal neurodevelopmental comprise. Recently it has been shown that pre-eclampsia increases the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 1 . Here we examine the association between HDP and ADHD in the offspring and whether circulating factors in serum from women with a HDP alter early patterns of fetal neuronal growth.",

            "text": "We used data of 13192 children who participated in the 7-year old wave of the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), representative of children born in the UK in the year 2000-2001. HDP including raised blood pressure, eclampsia, pre-eclampsia or Toxaemia were reported by the mothers 9 months after delivery. ADHD was parent-reported at age seven years based on a diagnosis by a doctor. Logistic regression was used for data analysis adjusting for maternal age, body mass index, smoking, depression, pre-pregnancy hypertension among others. To examine fetal neuronal growth, gestational day (GD) 14 rat cortical neurons were treated with 3% serum from either 5 severe cases of preeclampsia or 5 matched controls for 24h. The complexity of 75 individual neurons (15 neurons x 5 serum samples per group) was analysed using a modified line intercept approach to measure neurite number, total neurite length and branching. RESULTS: 991 women reported HDP and 169 children were diagnosed with ADHD. We found an association between HDP and ADHD (adjusted OR 1.8, [95% CI 1.03, 3.07]). In addition, exposure of GD 14 rat cortical neurons to serum from women with established preeclamspia lead to a significant increase in neuronal growth and branching (P<0.001: n=75), when compared to those treated with serum from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, we found that HDP was associated with increased risk of ADHD even after adjusting for several potential confounders. We also show that exposure to serum from women with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, can alter early patterns of fetal neuronal growth, which in turn may affect early patterns of brain wiring, which has been implicated in ADHD. It is not known whether infants conceived after all types of infertility treatment have a higher risk of birth defects than infants conceived naturally. We aim to determine the rate of some major congenital anomalies in live birth of the pregnancies resulted from all types of infertility treatment. METHODS: Data were extracted from NCHS, Vital Statistics database and included a cross-sectional analysis of twin live births in the US from 2011 to 2013. We used the general checkbox in birth certificate whether the pregnancy resulted from infertility treatment. The infertility treatments are grouped into two separate categories in birth certificates: 1) Assisted reproductive technology (ART) (e.g. in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT)) and 2 (None-ART): Fertility enhancing drugs, artificial insemination, or intrauterine insemination (IUI). 27, 29 and 34 States have reported information on infertility treatment and the type of infertility treatment used in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. We compared the rate of congenital abnormalities in ART and none-ART with those who had naturally conceived. RESULTS: From 8,581,826 birth certificates which reported information on infertility treatment, 66,751 were in ART group and 56,204 in None-ART. The rates of some congenital anomalies and adjusted risk ratios have been demonstrated in the CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CCHD occur more often also in pregnancies resulted from fertility enhancing drugs, artificial insemination, or intrauterine insemination. Although the mechanism is not clear, couples considering infertility treatment should be informed of all potential risks and benefits. ART is an indication for fetal echocardiography. It may come in consideration that all pregnancy conceived by infertile couples after all types of infertility treatment may need fetal echocardiogram. The prospective nature of birth cohort studies and wealth of epidemiological data and biological samples provide unique opportunities to address effects of early life exposures on health outcomes later in life. Epigenetic mechanisms attract increasing attention as a potential link between the genetic and environmental determinants of health. We aimed to study the relationship of prenatal exposure to pesticide and other pollutants with epigenetic modifications in children from birth through adolescence. METHODS: Urinary phthalate and organophosphate pesticide (OP) metabolites were measured during pregnancy in 400 women from the CHAMACOS study, an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort of low-income Mexican-Americans living in agricultural Salinas Valley, California. We characterized DNA methylation using 450K Infinifum BeadChips and pyrosequencing of LINE-1 and Alu repeats in bloods collected from children at several time-points. Expression of 2400 human miRNAs was measured by Targeted Sequencing using novel HTG platform. Health outcomes included length of gestation, birth weight, neurodevelopment and obesity parameters.",

            "text": "We observed a modification of effects of OP exposure on these health outcomes by PON1 phenotype and genotype. Maternal phthalate levels in CHAMACOS women were similar to US cohorts, while organophosphate metabolite levels were higher. Phthalate metabolites were associated with child BMI Z-score, waist circumference, isoprostane and adipokine levels. Expression of miRNAs and DNA methylation differed by sex and were also associated with prenatal factors. The PON1-108 that affects birth outcomes and neurodevelopment was strongly associated with PON methylation. The relationship was even more pronounced after adjusting for blood composition. Using causal mediation analysis, we found statistically significant indirect effects of methylation providing evidence that DNA methylation mediates the relationship between PON1-108 genotype and PON1 enzyme expression. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic and epigenetic markers provide insights into mechanisms of adverse birth outcomes, obesity and neurodevelopment and effects of in utero exposure to environmental pollutants. Unlike genetics, epigenetic mechanisms could be reversible and understanding of their role may lead to better protection of pregnant women and children, and improved public health. Mitochondrial dynamics involve fission and fusion, events essential for mammalian cell homeostasis, and whose alterations are implicated in a variety of diseases. Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key player in mitochondrial fission (MF) that, when activated by phosphorylation, is recruited to integral mitochondrial proteins such as mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), thereby inducing fission. We recently reported that elevated ceramide (CER) levels in preeclampsia (PE) increase the expression of Bcl-2 ovarian killer (BOK), a pro-death mitochondrial protein, thereby inducing placental cell death. As no information is available on MF in the human placenta, we sought to examine MF and its regulation by the CER/BOK axis. METHODS: Levels of Drp1 and Mff as well as their association were assessed by western blot (WB), and immunoprecipitation (IP) in placentae and mitochondrial isolates from PE (n=20), and normotensive age-matched controls (AMC, n=20). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to monitor MF in PE and AMC placentae. Human choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells were treated with synthetic CER16 and MF was evaluated by WB, IP and TEM. Active phospho-Drp1, its mitochondrial recruitment and association to Mff, were assessed by IF. In human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293-GFP-BOK), changes in Drp1 and Mff were evaluated in conditions of BOK induction by doxycycline and silencing by siRNA. RESULTS: Drp1 expression and association to Mff increased in placentae from PE vs. AMC. TEM showed augmented MF in PE. Notably, mitochondria isolated from PE showed elevated Drp1 expression and this associated with an accumulation of CER as measured by high performance liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry. Exposure of JEG3 cells to CER16 increased Drp1 expression and its mitochondrial translocation where it co-localized with Mff. controls) is sufficient to inhibit spiral artery growth, which leads to abnormal uteroplacental blood flow, placental damage, and fetal growth restriction. Since angiotensin II increases placental sflt-1 (soluble VEGF receptor) production, which sequesters spiral artery VEGF, we hypothesized that stimulating uterine VEGF expression by microbubbleconjugated gene delivery may rescue the phenotype. METHODS: Litter size and birthweight were measured in 21 WT and 23 TG dams without an intervention. Metrial triangle AGT, angiotensin II, VEGF, and sflt-1 were quantitated by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and HPLC/ mass spec (PRISM-SRM). Uterine vascular targeted transfections were performed in 16 WT and 16 TG virgin mice using either VEGF or luciferase plasmid conjugated to cationic microbubbles using our published protocols. Uterine luciferase expression was monitored by intraperitoneal luciferin injection and bioluminescence. Metrial triangle VEGF and sflt-1 at day 12.5 post gene transfection were measured by ELISA. Spiral artery architecture at day 16.5 was determined by 3D microCT imaging. RESULTS: Transgenic dams expressed more AGT and angiotensin II in the metrial triangle during spiral artery development with an increased sflt-1/VEGF ratio, which inhibited spiral artery angiogenesis compared with WT controls. TG dams had significantly smaller pups than WT controls, which persisted if transfected with luciferase, but was rescued by VEGF-gene delivery. Metrial triangle sflt-1 levels were reduced in VEGF transfected TG dams at day 12.5 and uterine spiral artery growth and branching was intermediate between WT and TG animals. CONCLUSIONS: Recently published work in mice suggested increased VEGF expression in maternal decidual cells may lead to placental insufficiency. Our data suggest that increasing VEGF expression in maternal uterine endothelial cells may have the opposite effect and ameliorate the pathology of abnormal sflt-1 production .",

Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is associated with increased placental lipid peroxidation (LOOH) and sterile neutrophil activation. A potential epigenetic mechanism governing neutrophil activation involves TET2-mediated enzymatic conversion of promoter region methylated cytosines to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). Base excision repair enzymes then convert the 5-hmC to unmethylated cytosine, which allows for specific increases in inflammatory gene expression. We hypothesized that the newly described DNA demethylating enzyme TET2 is activated by LOOH and potentiates neutrophil activation. Inhibitors of inflammation may work in part by preventing TET2 activity. METHODS: Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed on PE vs. normal pregnant (NP) omental fat biopsies to determine neutrophil TET2 expression and localization. Gene and protein expression for TET2 were conducted on the neutrophil HL-60 cell line following treatment with PMA (neutrophil activator), PMA + LOOH, or PMA + LOOH + aspirin, a recommended treatment to prevent PE in women at risk. Fluorescence IHC (IHC-F) was used to observe the translocation of TET2 from cytosol to nucleus as an indicator of activity. Zymo's Quest 5-hmC Detection Kit assessed differences in 5-hmC. RESULTS: IHC staining demonstrated a distinct localization of TET2 protein to the nuclei of neutrophils in PE versus a more diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution for NP. Exposure of HL-60 cells to PMA or PMA + LOOH yielded a respective 3 and 6 fold increase in TET2 gene expression (p<0.001), which was supported by western blotting with a respective 2-and 4-fold increase in protein expression. Additionally, separation of the nuclear and cytosolic cellular compartments for western blotting revealed a clear redistribution of TET2 protein to the nucleus in the PMA+LOOH group. This translocation was confirmed by confocal microscopy (p<0.001) and was attenuated by pretreatment with 10 -4 M aspirin (p<0.001). TET2 expression and distribution were associated with an 8-and 23-fold increase in 5-hmC modified cytosines for USP20, a genetic indicator of 5-hmC modifications, for PMA and PMA+LOOH, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid peroxidation stimulates TET2 activation, which can alter epigenetic regulation of gene expression, perhaps explaining the abnormal neutrophil activation in PE. We speculate that the beneficial effects of aspirin may include inhibition of neutrophil activation. ",

Of these three CpG sites, one is in a known differentially methylated region, one in an open reading frame and one in a CpG island associated with gene PLA2G4C, involved in cell signalling in inflammation and cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation profiling on first trimester maternal leukocyte DNA, initially by 450K platform then validated using pyrosequencing, demonstrates a set of differentially methylated CpG sites that can predict later PE in this cohort, with the most promising set of 3 CpG sites showing 73% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection. This needs to be replicated in an independent cohort, however, if confirmed a readily accessible biomarker which can predict future PE with near 100% accuracy and detect the majority of cases may allow interventions, such as low dose aspirin < 16 weeks, to actually prevent PE.",

INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genomic regions that contribute to the genetic predisposition for developing endometriosis. To identify the strongest and most reliable gene candidates we performed a large GWAS replication and we examined the biologic relevance of the implicated genes. METHODS: A GWAS replication study was performed on 734 newly collected, surgically confirmed, Caucasian endometriosis patients and 11,005 matched population controls. To select the most strongly and reproducibly associated loci we correlated the results from the replication study to results previously reported by us and others and included only those loci that showed strong and consistent replication in multiple populations for further evaluation. We then selected the genes at each locus and performed a literature-review to determine if any of the genes had a shared biological function. RESULTS: We found four genes (WNT4, CDC42, ID4 and VEZT) in the GWAS replication study that confirm our previously reported results and have consistent support in independent studies. A literature review of the four genes revealed that each gene is directly involved in the regulation of the actin-cytoskeleton and epithelial homeostasis. * rs12320196 is a proxy marker for rs3596 and included with calculations for rs3596 CONCLUSIONS: We find evidence that link four genes at the most strongly associated endometriosis GWAS regions, directly to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and homeostasis of the epithelial sheet. There is separate evidence for direct protein-to-protein interaction between CDC42 and VEZT, and that CDC42 can regulate the methylationstatus of ID4. We propose that the integrity of epithelial sheet covering the abdominal surfaces provides a barrier against endometriosis and that insults to the epithelial sheet triggers the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) repair mechanism. During this process the epithelial barrier is compromised and vulnerable to endometrial tissue implants from retrograde menstruation. We speculate that maintaining a healthy and intact epithelium by inhibiting EMT provides a new paradigm to the prevention and treatment of endometriosis.",

RESULTS: MPO is expressed in DD cells with minimal expression in UMSC cells (0.27 \u00b1 0.009 vs 0.088 \u00b1 0.008 fg/\u00b5g RNA, p<0.05), respectively.

Interestingly, low BMI has been associated with endometriosis, however the relation of endometriosis to metabolism is unexplored. In particular, dysregulation in the liver of women with endometriosis has not been previously characterized. METHODS: Endometriosis was induced in 9 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice by suturing donor mouse endometrium into the peritoneal cavity. Sham surgeries were performed on control mice. Mice were euthanized at 21 weeks and livers were collected from both endometriosis and control groups. RNA and proteins were extracted from liver samples and subjected to microarray analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and western blot analysis to determine the differential expression of genes between the two groups. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified 4 upregulated genes tied to weight loss and 2 downregulated obesogenic genes in mice with endometriosis compared to controls. These results were confirmed by qPCR. Expression of Cyp2r1, Fabp4 (regulates adiponectin and leptin), Mrc1 (associated with insulin sensitivity), and Rock2 were shown to be increased. Additionally, expression of Igfbp1 and Mmd2 (adiponectin receptor) were decreased. The above findings were confirmed by western blot. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the existence of a novel metabolic component of endometriosis. These results suggest that endometriosis causes metabolic changes that decrease obesity and metabolic syndrome. These results not only elucidate a new facet of a complex and common disorder, but could have additional implications for understanding and treating obesity as well. Understanding the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments is important. METHODS: Women in the FIRSTT (NCT00995878, clinicaltrials.gov) randomized controlled trial and in a parallel observational study were analyzed in a comprehensive cohort design. The treatment arms were similar with the exception that FUS women had higher pain scores at enrollment. Daily diaries were completed for 6 weeks post-operatively, and all women received the same instructions and prescriptions. Adverse Events (AEs) were recorded and categorized for severity. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-square test, and multivariable regression.",

Uterine ablation of the Notch transcription factor, RBP-J\u03ba (Pgr cre/+ Rbpj f/f ; Rbpj d/d ), in mice results in sub-fertility followed by infertility due to abnormal postpartum endometrial repair and enhanced immune signaling. This study focused on the RBP-J\u03ba mediated transcriptomic mechanisms contributing to dysfunctional postpartum endometrial repair and characterization of RBP-J expression in the endometrium of women with RPL. METHODS: RNA-seq was performed on postpartum day (PPD) 3 endometrial repair sites (nodules) from Rbpj d/d and Rbpj f/f controls (n=3 mice/grp) and analyzed for differential gene expression and enrichment for GeneGo Processes. To determine the impact of endometrial repair on future fertility, unilateral oviduct ligation was performed in mice (n=6/ grp) with bilateral embryo transfer two weeks postpartum and sacrificed at 4.5 d post coitus. For comparison, mid-luteal biopsies obtained from women with unexplained RPL (n=8) and fertile controls (n=13) with IHC for RBP-J\u03ba. RESULTS: Immune pathways, including interferon and complement signaling were significantly upregulated in Rbpj d/d mice on PPD3. Bilateral embryo transfer in Rbpj f/f mice previously pregnant in one uterine horn resulted in no significant difference in implantation sites (IS) between horns (P=0.872). In contrast, no IS were present in either horn of Rbpj d/d mice, consistent with developed infertility postpartum. Floating embryos were present in the nulliparous but not the pregnant uterine horn of Rbpj d/d mice, suggesting global uterine impact of dysfunctional repair. Finally, RPL patients had significantly decreased RBP-J\u03ba expression in both endometrial stroma (P=0.002) and glands (P=0.045). CONCLUSIONS: RBP-J\u03ba is reduced in women with RPL. Rbpj d/d mice display features similar to women with RPL, particularly enhanced interferon and complement signaling. Further, failed postpartum repair disrupts future pregnancy potential, as a consequence of aberrant global endometrial inflammatory signaling. We propose that altered RBP-J\u03ba mediated endometrial repair may contribute to unexplained infertility in RPL patients.",

            "text": "Aging Is Associated with Changes in Mitochondrial Dynamics, Function and mtDNA Quantity. We hypothesized that the decrease in oocyte quality associated with aging could be explained in part with abnormal mitochondria numbers, morphology and/or activity, and investigated the alterations in key parameters of mitochondrial function in aging mouse oocytes. METHODS: Oocytes from old (12 months) and young (9 weeks) C57BL/6J mice were compared for 1) Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under baseline conditions and following H 2 O 2 treatment using carboxy-H2DCFDA fluorescent staining; 2) Mitochondrial stress response by determining expression of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mt-UPR) genes (Clpp, Dnaja3, Hspd1, Hspe1) via qRT-PCR; 3) Absolute mtDNA levels via cloning of mitochondria specific gene (Cox3) followed by qPCR; 4) Mitochondria morphology and dynamics (mitochondria density, coverage, size and shape) throughout folliculogenesis using electron microscopy (EM). RESULTS: 1) ROS levels in aged MII and GV oocytes were higher following pretreatment with H 2 O 2 (p<0.05); 2) The expression of mt-UPR gene Hspd1 was also elevated in aged GV oocytes (p<0.05); 3) MII oocytes from old mice had significantly less mtDNA compared to young ones (58,222 +/-15,429 copies/oocyte vs. 162,106 +/-19,302 copies/oocyte [mean +/-SEM; p<0.01]). 4) Oocyte mitochondria density (number/\u00b5m 2 cytosol area), mitochondria coverage (total mitochondria \u00b5m 2 /\u00b5m 2 cytosol area) and average mitochondria size decrease in both young and old mice oocytes with follicular development (p<0.05). In old mice, mitochondria of primary follicle-enclosed oocytes were smaller with lower mitochondria coverage (p<0.05). A trend of decreased mitochondria density and coverage in old mice oocytes at other stages of follicular development (primordial, preantral, antral) was observed, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Aging is associated with a significant increase in ROS levels in oocytes under stressful conditions and elevated expression of mitochondrial stress response gene Hspd1. Importantly, aged mouse oocytes have lower mtDNA levels and several of their mitochondrial morphological parameters seem to be altered. The success of fertility treatment is highly dependent on proper steroid hormone production and recruitment of ovarian follicles. However, the mechanisms of gene regulation underlying steroidogenesis and ovarian follicular development are still poorly understood. An intriguing candidate is the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19. Prominent H19 expression has been observed in maturing and post-ovulatory human follicles, suggesting an association between H19 expression and ovarian follicular development. Despite these observations, the physiological significance of H19 on steroidogenesis, adult ovarian development, and fertility remains obscure. METHODS: Mouse H19 KO and WT ovaries were fixed in PFA 4% for four hours, sectioned, and stained with picric acid and evaluated for differences in follicle number and morphology. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that altered expression of H19 leads to altered production of steroid hormones by performing estradiol (E2)-specific ELISA following siRNA-mediated H19 knockdown in a granulosa cell line. KGN cells were transfected with H19 silencing RNA or control. After 72 hours, media was collected and E2 ELISA performed per manufacturer's instructions. RESULTS: Notably, the H19 KO ovaries contained a larger number of secondary, preantral, and antral follicles and corpora lutea (p<0.01). H19 KO ovaries contained fewer primordial follicles, (p<.01) and strikingly, were also noted to contain multioocyte follicles, a feature that has also been demonstrated in mice exposed to the potent estrogen analogues diethylstilbestrol and geniestin, suggesting exposure to a hyperestrogenic state in H19 KO mice. Lastly, H19 siRNA knockdown in vitro leads to a nearly 25% increase in E2 production in cell culture (p<0.05).",

Greene D Royster IV, 1 Amanda N Nelson, 1 Justine C Harris, 1 Matthew T Connell, 1 Ryan J Heitmann, 2 Erin F Wolff. 1 1 National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; 2 Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Currently, there are few treatments for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss or implantation failure. Women with recurrent pregnancy loss have been shown to have lower T-Regulatory Cell (T reg ) expression when compared to fertile controls. A murine model has been developed with depletion of T regs (DEREG) after administration of diphtheria toxin (DT), resulting in smaller litter sizes, secondary to embryo implantation failure. We propose a novel treatment for implantation failure using an immune modulator (Rapamycin -Pregnancy Category C) to rapidly expand T regs and increase litter sizes back to normal. METHODS: Female DEREG mice were given DT to induce conditional knockdown of T regs then mated with wild type males and given either saline or Rapamycin to expand T reg production. To detect an increase in litter sizes of 30% after conditional knockdown of T regs using DT, then expansion of T regs using Rapamycin, power analysis revealed that at least 31 mice per arm would be needed to show statistical significance. RESULTS: T reg depletion was confirmed in whole blood samples after DT administration, going from 1.6% on Day 0 to 0.03% on day 3, then rising to 2.7% on day 10 after treatment with Rapamycin. DEREG mice treated with only DT, had smaller litter sizes (4.4 vs. 7.6 pups / litter) when compared with mice treated with saline (p < 0.0001). DEREG mice treated with DT then Rapamycin, had T reg levels that were 69% higher on day 10. Litter sizes were 30% larger for DEREG mice treated with Rapamycin than DEREG mice treated with DT alone [5.7 vs. 4 .4 pups/ litter (p = 0.02)]. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Live birth rates are lower in a murine model after conditional knockdown of T regs . However, reduced litter sizes are corrected and T regs increased after treatment with Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor). This treatment approach should be considered for future human trials as a potential treatment for women with recurrent pregnancy loss or implantation failure with below normal T reg levels.",

The chick embryo is the only established animal model to isolate the effects of any therapy on the fetus independent of effects on the maternal or placental physiology. The model also provides a cost effective, high throughput strategy to compare several antioxidant strategies contemporaneously. METHODS: Fertilised eggs (n=7-10 per group) were incubated under normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H, 14%) from day 1 (term ~ 21 days). Melatonin (1 mg.kg -1 ), pravastatin (1 mg.kg -1 ), allopurinol (5 mg.kg -1 ) or vehicle were injected daily into the air cell from day 13 of incubation, which equates to 25 weeks of human pregnancy. At day 19, the embryo was euthanized and cardiac function determined in a Langendorff preparation. RESULTS: Chronic fetal hypoxia impaired systolic (reduced left ventricular developed pressure, LVDP) and diastolic (elevated LV end diastolic pressure, LVEDP) function ( Fig.1 ). While treatment with melatonin rescued only systolic function, pravastatin rescued only diastolic function and allopurinol rescued both systolic and diastolic function in hypoxic embryos. CONCLUSIONS: We show that human clinically-relevant doses of antioxidants currently on clinical trial to protect the fetus in high risk pregnancy also have direct beneficial effects on the developing heart of the hypoxic fetus.

The interaction of the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R) with its accessory protein (MRAP) is essential for trafficking MC2R to the adrenal cell surface for binding ACTH and signaling. The present study determined whether the estrogen-dependent regulation of fetal adrenocortical development is mediated by ACTH and/ or expression/interaction of MC2R and MRAP. METHODS: Fetal pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA levels were quantified by in situ hybridization, fetal plasma ACTH levels by RIA and fetal adrenal MC2R-MRAP expression and interaction by proximity ligation assay, a novel PCR-based immunofluorescence assay, on day 165 of gestation (term = 184 days) in baboons untreated (n=8) or in which estrogen was suppressed by daily sc administration of letrozole (0.115 mg/kg bw; n=8) or restored by letrozole plus estradiol (each at 0.115 mg/ kg bw, n=5) on days 100-164. RESULTS: Fetal adrenal weight was 50% greater (P<0.01) in letrozoletreated (489 \u00b1 37 mg) than in untreated (332 \u00b1 28) baboons and restored by letrozole plus estradiol (377 \u00b1 39). Although fetal pituitary POMC RNA (4.24 \u00b1 0.68 units) and plasma ACTH (192.8 \u00b1 36 .4 pg/ml) levels, and fetal adrenal DZ/TZ MC2R (3.32 \u00b1 0.58 fluorescent signals/tissue area) and MRAP (9.69 \u00b12.11) protein levels in untreated animals were unaltered, MC2R-MRAP interactin was 2-fold greater (P<0.05) in the DZ/ TZ in letrozole-treated (2.98 \u00b1 0.58 signals/tissue area) than in untreated (1.54 \u00b1 0.45) baboons and restored by letrozole plus estradiol treatment (1.36 \u00b1 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that increasing levels of estradiol with advancing pregnancy suppress interaction of MC2R with MRAP, thereby diminishing MC2R movement to the cell membrane and signaling in the DZ/TZ. This would be expected to reduce progenitor cell proliferation in the DZ and migration to the FZ, thereby curbing growth of and DHAS production by the FZ to maintain placental estradiol levels in a physiological range.

Our objective was to characterize the long term effects of MgSO 4 /BMTZ on the hippocampus; an area of the brain affected in children born preterm. Using a murine model, we examined the effects of these treatments on perinatal brain injury. METHODS: Eighty-eight CD1 timed-pregnant mice were randomized to receive an intrauterine injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the control vehicle (PBS) on E17. Mice were further randomized to receive MgSO 4 /BMTZ or placebo 30 min post-injection. The neurodevelopment of surviving offspring was assessed on postnatal days (PND) 5, 9, periweaning, and 40, 50, and 60. On PND 60, brains were collected and stained for NeuN, a neuronal marker. Hippocampal area and neuronal densities were calculated using ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of dams exposed to LPS produced surviving offspring compared to 100% of controls (p<0.05). Offspring from LPS dams demonstrated impaired performance in negative geotaxis on PND 5 and 9 (p<0.05). Animals treated prenatally with MgSO 4 / BMTZ had improved performance compared to the untreated LPS cohort (p<0.05). The deficits in neurodevelopmental testing among animals exposed to LPS correlated with a significant reduction in hippocampal neuronal density vs. controls and MgSO 4 /BMTZ treated mice (p<0.05).",

CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that prenatal treatment with MgSO 4 /BMTZ following exposure to intrauterine inflammation preserves normal neurodevelopment through its effects on hippocampal neurons. Maternal obesity increases the risk of offspring obesity, in part due to enhanced adipogenesis. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity/high fat diet (HF), we have shown that HF newborns are heavier at birth and demonstrate upregulated expression of adipogenic transcription factor (PPAR\u03b3). Among the two primary fat depots, white adipose tissue (WAT) stores excess energy, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) expends energy via thermogenesis. Transcriptional co-regulators, PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) and TLE3 (transducin-like enhancer protein) promote the development of BAT and WAT, respectively. Importantly, over-expression of TLE3 in BAT transforms BAT to WAT. We hypothesized that TLE3-mediated effects in newborn BAT promotes development of WAT-obesity in the HF offspring. We explored the regulation of adipogenesis in newborn primary BAT cultures. METHODS: Female mice were fed either a control (10% k/cal) or high fat (HF; 45% k/cal) diet to create maternal obesity prior to mating, and diets continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Newborns were delivered spontaneously, males sacrificed at day one of life, and interscapular BAT was collected.Isolated preadipocytes were cultured for 48h (time 0) and subsequently induced to differentiate with hormone inducer mixture. Protein was extracted at day 0, 2, 4 and 6 of induction and expression of TLE3, PRMD1 and UCP1 was determined. RESULTS: In HF preadipocytes from BAT, prior to induction at day 0, TLE3 expression was upregulated whereas that of PRMD1 and UCP1 was downregulated as compared to Control. With induction, both HF and Control cells showed progressively increased expression of TLE3 with concomitant decreased expression of PRMD1 and UCP1 genes, though HF cells maintained increased TLE3 and decreased PRMD1 and UCP1 as compared to Controls. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: In HF newborns, the increased TLE3 likely promotes WAT and suppresses BAT, contributing to obesity. Ex vivo culture results indicate an intrinsic programming of WAT adipogenesis in HF offspring, independent of the body hormonal milieu.",

INTRODUCTION: Placental insufficiency causes fetal hypoglycemia and hypoxia, which increases plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations in late gestation, and collectively result in intrauterine growth restriction (PI-IUGR). These conditions lower plasma insulin concentrations and impair \u03b2-cell function. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the effects of chronic adrenergic signaling to the IUGR pathology in order to determine the role of NE in the IUGR fetal pancreatic \u03b2-cell. METHODS: Transcriptome sequencing was performed on islets isolated from late gestation fetal sheep following two distinct experiments: 1) PI-IUGR and paired controls (n=4/trt) and 2) normal fetuses receiving a 7 day NE-infusion or vehicle control (n=4/trt). Differentially expressed genes were determined for each experiment. Genes that were identified in both experiments were modeled to canonical pathways and functions. In order to determine whether the NE effects were specific to \u03b2-cells, mRNA expression for a subset of candidate genes was measured with quantitative PCR in Min6 (insulinoma) cells, following 24h and 72h of adrenergic stimulation. RESULTS: There were 89 genes differentially expressed in both experiments. Functional analysis revealed these genes were involved in metabolism of lipids, proteolysis, response to nutrient, and proliferation. Candidate genes involved with proliferation/survival were significantly (P<0.05) increased in Min6 after 72hr adrenergic stimulation; death associated protein like-1 (DAPL1, 2-fold), aurora kinase B (AURKB, 1.5-fold), and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 5 (CHD5, 2.7-fold). Interestingly, at 24hr AURKB and CHD5 were significantly decreased in treated Min6. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify transcriptome-wide effects from chronic NE in the IUGR fetal islet. We identified proliferation and survival genes as \u03b2-cell specific through establishing a model of chronic adrenergic stimulation.

We hypothesized that maternal MitoQ, a mitochondrial antioxidant, treatment would prevent IUGR and abnormal development of fetal cardiomyocytes. METHODS: Pregnant rats were randomly injected with MitoQ loaded nanoparticles (125 \u00b5M) or saline via tail vein on gestational day (GD) 15 (nanoparticles were used to restrict treatment to the placenta and prevent its passage to the fetus). Rats were further subdivided into two groups exposed to either hypoxia (11% O 2 ) or normoxia (21% O 2 ) from GD 15-21 (term; 22 days). On GD 21, pregnant dams were sacrificed and pups were separated into males and females. Offspring body and heart weights were assessed. Placental oxidative stress was measured by performing DCF (dichlorofluorescein) staining. Area and binucleation of fixed cardiomyocytes were assessed. RESULTS: In male and female offspring, hypoxia led to IUGR, increased cardiac hypertrophy and placental oxidative stress (normoxia: 2.27\u00b11.55 vs. hypoxia: 13.34\u00b13.96 arbitrary units (a.u.), P<0.05). MitoQ treatment prevented oxidative stress (hypoxia+MitoQ: 2.48\u00b11.06 a.u.), normalized the heart weight in both sexes and prevented IUGR in female fetuses. In male fetuses only, relative cardiomyocyte area (normalized to heart weight) was significantly increased in the hypoxic group (normoxia: 0.019\u00b10.002 mm 2 /g vs. hypoxia: 0.026\u00b10.002 mm 2 /g, P<0.05) and MitoQ treatment prevented this (hypoxia+MitoQ: 0.017\u00b10.002 mm 2 /g). No differences in the percentage of binucleated cardiomyocytes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: We observed sex-specific effects of hypoxia and MitoQ treatment on fetal growth and cardiomyocyte development. Preventing placental oxidative stress using MitoQ may be a novel approach to improve fetal growth and attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in IUGR offspring.",

Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an environmentally ubiquitous estrogen-like endocrine-disrupting compound. Exposure to BPA in utero has been linked to female reproductive disorders including endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, infertility and breast cancer. Estrogens are an etiological factor in all of these conditions. We sought to determine if in utero exposure to BPA altered the global CpG methylation pattern of the uterine epigenome, subsequent gene expression and estrogen response. METHODS: Pregnant mice were exposed to an environmentally relevant dose of BPA (5mg/kg/day) or DMSO control. At 8 weeks of life prenatally exposed offspring (N=22) were then oovariectomized and later given estradiol (600ng) or control.

BPA exposure preferentially altered expression of estrogen responsive genes and therefore the effect on gene expression was not apparent until sexual maturation. At 2 weeks of age, only 18 genes were differentially expressed, while at 8 weeks 316 genes were differentially expressed. Changes in estrogen response were accompanied by increased changes in methylation that selectively affected estrogen response elements. DNA methylation as measured by mean absolute log 2 fluorescence ratio change in animals exposed to BPA in utero compared to controls was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.74), however in genes containing an ERE the mean ratio change was 0.985 (95% CI: 0.78, 1.18) (p=0.014), demonstrating selective methylation of estrogen target genes. The majority genes (65%) with altered expression also had altered promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal BPA exposure programs adult estrogen response. BPA selectively altered the normal developmental programming of estrogen responsive genes by modification of the epigenome. BPA exposure led to preferential methylation of ERE containing genes and thereby determined subsequent response to estrogens. Gene-environment interactions driven by early life exposure to xenoestrogens likely contributes to the increased the risk of estrogen related disease in adults. Term and preterm labor are associated with an increased inflammatory response in myometrium; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Our recent studies indicate that microRNAs (miR) serve important roles. Using miRNA array of myometrium from pregnant mice at 15.5 vs. 18.5 dpc, we found that the miR-200 family was significantly upregulated, while the miR-199a/214 cluster and miR-181a were significantly decreased near term. With the miR-200s and miR-199a/214 functions being revealed, thus far, the role(s) of miR-181a has not been elucidated. METHODS: Mouse and human myometrial cells and tissues were employed to study expression and functions of miR-181a during late gestation. We also mined GRO-seq and ChIP-seq datasets and confirmed transcriptional regulation of the miR-181a host genes. RESULTS: Expression of highly conserved miR-181a was significantly decreased in mouse myometrium during late gestation and in fundal myometrium of women in labor. The putative miR-181a target, TNF-\u03b1 and known target, c-Fos, which are key cytokine/transcription factors involved in the inflammatory response, were coordinately upregulated. In human myometrial cells, overexpression of miR-181a repressed basal, as well as IL-1\u03b2-induced TNF-\u03b1, CCL-2 and CCL-8 expression, whereas, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was increased. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the TNF-\u03b1 3'-UTR contains a bonafide miR-181a binding site, suggesting that TNF-\u03b1 is a direct target of miR-181a.",

We hypothesize that changes in alternatively spliced Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) isoforms across gestation permit uterine specific temporal contractile responses to increasing E2 levels as term approaches. In this study we examined the role of alternately spliced myometrial ER\u03b1 variants by identifying and ablating the relevant splice factors utilizing siRNA and examining the consequences on the expression profile of ER\u03b1 isoform ratios and their downstream targets, the contractile associated proteins (CAPs). METHODS: Utilizing siRNA and lentiviral shRNAs we knocked down specific hnRNPs and SR proteins (splice factors). Uterine myocyte ER\u03b1 isoform ratios and the CAPs were examined by western blot, qPCR analysis and RNase protection assays, as were extracts of pregnant non laboring human myometrial tissue (32 week versus 37 week n=3) in which we established the gestational profile of the major ER\u03b1 isoforms. RESULTS: We demonstrate in the pregnant human myometrium three ER\u03b1 isoforms, the full-length 66 kDa (ER\u03b166), a N-terminally truncated 46 kDa (ER\u03b146) and the C-terminally truncated 51 kDa (ER\u22067), are gestationally regulated. ER\u22067 proteins and mRNA decrease as term approaches. siRNA and lentiviral shRNA knockdown demonstrate that depletion of SRSF1 results in enhanced ER\u03b166 isoform translation while the loss of hnRNPA1 leads to a predominance of ER\u03b146. Knockdown of ER\u03b166 and ER\u03b146 lowers connexin 43 levels, while ER\u03b146 alone is sufficient to maintain connexin 43 expression. CONCLUSIONS: We have created a powerful tool to understand the splice mechanisms, expression levels and subcellular localization of ER\u03b1 isoforms utilizing lentiviral knockdown. Our survey of different splice factor knockdowns has revealed the function of SRSF1 and hnRNPA1 with respect to ER\u03b166 and ER\u03b146. We propose that the high levels of ER\u22067 earlier in gestation antagonizes myometrial ER\u03b146 and ER\u03b166 function; as ER\u22067 in other systems acts in functionally dominant negative role. In conclusion, we have determined the potential importance of myometrial splice factor function with regard to local ER\u03b1 action during pregnancy. INTRODUCTION: Progesterone, acting through its nuclear receptor isoforms, progesterone receptor (PR)-A and PR-B, promotes uterine relaxation during pregnancy. Labor is, in part, triggered by PR-A-mediated functional progesterone withdrawal whereby PR-A represses the activity of PR-B. Furthermore, parturition also involves tissue-level inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammation triggers parturition by inducing PR-A-trans-repression of PR-B. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effects of proinflammatory stimuli in the form of interleukin-1\u00df(IL-1\u00df) on PR-A and PR-B transcriptional activity at an endogenous progesterone responsive gene, FK-501 binding protein (FKBP5), in a human myometrial cell line.",

To elucidate the effects of inflammation on progesterone responsiveness, cells expressing varying relative levels of PR-A and PR-B were exposed to progesterone or the progesterone agonist R5020 and then challenged with IL-1\u00df. Effects on expression of the progesterone responsive gene, FKBP5, were then assessed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Progesterone, in a dose-responsive manner, increased FKBP5 expression through agonistic action on PR-B (EC50 approximately 1.7nM) but not through PR-A. PR-A alone did not inhibit progesterone/ PR-B induction of FKBP5 expression. However, when cells were exposed to IL-1\u00df, PR-A decreased progesterone/PR-B-induced FKBP5 expression. IL-1\u00df alone did not affect FKBP5 expression in the absence of progesterone and PRs. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that in human myometrial cells, progesterone primarily acts through PR-B to modulate expression of genes driven by the canonical progesterone response element. This PR-B mediated effect of progesterone is inhibited by PR-A only in the presence of inflammatory stimuli. These findings suggest that inflammation activates PR-A trans-repression of PR-B, thereby triggering functional progesterone withdrawal and the parturition cascade in the human myometrium. This model presents a plausible explanation of how tissue-level inflammation induces human parturition. ]. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of STIM1 expression and function in the myometrium. METHODS: C57BL/6J (B6) mice underwent timed matings and myometrium was harvested at various time points during the pregnancy and processed for histology, western blot, and electron microscopy. Next, myometrial strips from non-pregnant and term pregnant B6 mice were suspended in a tissue organ bath and stimulated with increasing doses of oxytocin in the presence of a STIM1 inhibitor or vehicle control and the contraction responses measured. Lastly, myometrial strips from a STIM1-LacZ haploinsufficiency model were harvested for staining as well as contraction assays in a tissue organ bath. Contraction responses were compared using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with corrections for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: STIM1 is expressed in the murine myometrium and localizes to the SR and plasma membrane. STIM1 is upregulated during early pregnancy and remains elevated throughout gestation and immediately postpartum. Treatment of uterine muscle strips with a SOCE inhibitor results in decreased contraction force and frequency in response to oxytocin in both pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Similarly, myometrial strips isolated from a genetic model of STIM1 haploinsufficiency also demonstrated decreased uterine contraction force and frequency in response to oxytocin compared to controls. Finally, both STIM1 pharmacologic inhibition and STIM1 haploinsufficiency result in an inability to produce tetanic contractions in response to oxytocin. CONCLUSIONS: STIM1 is critical in tissues that undergo repetitive contraction. STIM1 is necessary for a normal contractile phenotype in the myometrium of both pregnant and non-pregnant mice. Variations in STIM1 genotype or expression within the myometrium of women may result in dysfunctional labor phenotypes.",

To test our specific hypothesis we first characterized a novel Slc20a2 deficient 'KO-first' mouse model. Reproductive trends, viability, frequency of gene transmission, and fetal growth was were assessed. Maternal health was monitored, and placental gene expression and anatomy were analyzed. Two-tailed Student's T-test with unequal variance or One-way ANOVA and Tukey's Post Hoc Test were used to compare means between groups. RESULTS: We found that Slc20a2 is localized specifically to the extraembryonic ectoderm, ectoplacental cone, chorion, allantois, pericytes, and a subset of cytokeratin7 positive trophoblast cells. Slc20a2 deficient mice were found to be subviable; 57% of global knockout mice are embryonic or neonatal lethal, and 31% of global knockout female breeders never produce pups. Neonates supported by a placenta with complete loss of Slc20a2 in either the fetal or maternal placental compartment resulted in significant fetal growth restriction. Abnormal vascular morphology and a remarkable level of placental calcification (deposition of phosphate and calcium-containing mineral) associated with poor maternal health was observed in the Slc20a2 deficient placentas and appeared at or near thickened laminin-positive basement membranes. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein provide the first molecular and histological insights into how Slc20a2 deficiency and dysfunctional phosphate transport may contribute to preeclampsia. These findings also establish the Slc20a2 deficient mouse as the first ever placental calcification animal model, and direct our attention to the need to understand the impact that placental calcification has on placental physiology and dysfunction in humans. We have previously shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and amino acid (AA) uptake in cultured primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells, while monounsaturated oleic acid (OA) activates mTOR and stimulates AA transport. However, the mechanism underlying changes in mTOR signaling and amino acid transport in response to FA is largely unknown. Using untargeted lipidomics in PHT cells we identified lipid metabolites that may link FA exposure to mTOR signaling. We further tested the hypothesis that OA regulation of AA transport is dependent on mTOR signaling. METHODS: PHT were isolated (n=5 placentas), cultured for 66h, and treated with either DHA (50\u00b5M) or OA (100\u00b5M) bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Control cells were exposed to fatty acid-free BSA. After 24h, PHT were collected and underwent HPLC-MS to identify changes in lipid metabolites. We determined the role of mTOR in OA stimulated AA transport in PHT by silencing raptor (mTORC1) or rictor (mTORC2) using siRNA (raptor, n=3; rictor, n=4 placentas). It has been proposed that ovarian function can be improved using stem cells of various origins. Our lab has previously described the presence of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells and their potential for differentiation into multiple cell lines. Here, we outline our efforts to improve ovarian function using mouse uterine cells in a murine model of POI. METHODS: 32 female mice (C57BL/6, 8 weeks old) were administered cyclophosphamide and busulfan to induce POI. Mice were randomized into two groups. Untreated mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used as uterine tissue donors and a single-cell suspension of uterine cells (UCs) was administered to one group of treated animals via retroorbital injection. After seven days, 10 mice in each group were hyperstimulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and ovarian function was assessed by oocyte count. The remaining females were caged with males in a 2:1 ratio to conduct a breeding trial. We assessed time to pregnancy, number of pups, and their health. RESULTS: Mice receiving UCs ovulated 4.4 times as many oocytes as those receiving placebo (7.4 vs 1.7 oocytes p<0.0001). Three weeks into the breeding trial, five of the mice that received UCs had become pregnant, compared to three of the mice in the placebo group (p=0.03). Comparison between both groups showed no difference in time to pregnancy, miscarriage rate, or number of pups. Exposure of the resulting pups of both groups to ultraviolet light showed no green fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a significant increase in ovulation as a result of the administration of UCs, as well as a higher pregnancy rate in the treated animals when compared to placebo. The absence of fluorescence in the resulting offspring suggests that the transplanted cells did not contribute to the oocyte pool. Uterine stem cells have the potential to improve ovarian function and enhance fertility after chemotherapy.",

            "text": "The INTRODUCTION: Adolescent and young women undergoing gonadotoxic chemotherapy treatment have fewer options for fertility preservation than older women. GnRH analogs are controversial and considered experimental for fertility preservation, but recent studies show supportive evidence for their use. It has been suggested that a combination GnRH antagonist and agonist may improve outcomes as the GnRH antagonist will prevent the gonadotropin \"flare\" effect seen with GnRH agonist alone. Here, we utilized a murine model to assess the effect of GnRH antagonists and agonists, alone and in combination, on fertility following gonadotoxic chemotherapy. METHODS: Thirty female Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study with five groups: Group 1-placebo (n=6), Group II-cyclophosphamide (CPA) alone (n=6), Group III-GnRH antagonist (GnRHantag) followed by GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) with CPA (n=6), Group IV-GnRH antagonist followed by GnRH agonist with placebo (n=6), and Group V-GnRH agonist with CPA (n=6). Rats were confirmed to be cycling and then treated at adolescent age (6 weeks) and mated at reproductive age (10wks). Live birth rate (LBR) was the primary outcome and the weight of the rats and ovarian volume were secondary measures. Statistical analysis was via Student T-test or Chi-square where appropriate. RESULTS: Group II had decreased LBR compared to I (p=0.02). Group III and V had LBR similar to Group I rates (p=0.008, p=0.02). There was no difference in LBR comparing Groups III and V. There was no statistically significant difference in the ovarian volume among any group after live birth was achieved. The weight of the rats decreased in all groups treated with CPA during and after treatment, but increased similar to other groups one week after treatment was completed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GnRH antagonist and agonist, and GnRH agonist alone preserved fertility in female adolescent rats following gonadotoxic chemotherapy treatment. The addition of a GnRH antagonist to an agonist does not confer a greater protective effect on reproductive success compared to GnRH agonist alone in this gonadotoxic chemotherapy murine model.

We evaluated the effect of BMI on oocyte characteristics, embryo quality and pregnancy outcomes in an IVF cohort. METHODS: Clinical/laboratory data were prospectively collected as part of the Physiologic Oxygen (PhOx) Study conducted by the Reproductive Medicine Network. Patients were stratified by BMI into underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), obese (30-34.9) and morbidly obese (>35). Primary outcomes were rates of oocyte maturity, 2PN fertilization, triploidy, oocyte degradation and atresia/fracture. Secondary outcomes were cleavage embryo and blastocyst quality, and pregnancy rates. Logistic regression and ANCOVA were performed to compare the effect of BMI on these outcomes. RESULTS: 808 patients were included. After controlling for age, ethnicity, total gonadotropins and peak E2, BMI had a significant effect on rate of fractured/atretic oocytes (p=0.0009) and on 2PN fertilization rate (p=0.01). No differences were seen between BMI groups in number of oocytes retrieved, maturity rate, degradation rate, or triploid fertilization rate. No significant differences were found in measures of embryo quality or in pregnancy rates. Predictive tests in the form of cervical swabs (oncofetal fibronectin (ofFN) or insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1)) have good negative predictive values (NPV) that are valid for only a 3-week period. Previously, we have shown in a small series (n=51) that the endocannabinoid, anandamide (AEA), could be useful in predicting PTB in \"high-risk\" women and we could predict a \"risk-free\" period of 8-10 weeks before delivery; something that would facilitate the management of PTB for these women. Based on these results, it was important determine the accuracy of these observations in a larger cohort. Aim: To examine if a single measurement of plasma AEA concentrations after 24 gestational weeks can predict the risk of PTB and the timing of delivery. METHODS: Women at 'high-risk' seen in our prematurity prevention clinic (PPC) (n=62) or with 'threatened PTB' (n=133) were recruited and had their plasma AEA concentration measured by UHPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Plasma AEA concentrations were significantly higher in women who delivered prematurely (univariate logistic regression, p=0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that gestational age at delivery was significantly associated with plasma AEA concentrations (p=0.004). Linear regression of the prediction of the time interval between the recruitment to delivery in days and plasma AEA concentrations showed a significant inverse relationship that could be used to accurately predict the recruitment to delivery interval (RTDI) (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This second cohort study supports our previous conclusion that that PTL can be predicted by a single blood test, with higher plasma AEA concentrations predictive of PTL. Additionally, the gestational age at delivery and the RTDI could be predicted. Thus, this single test could revolutionise the management of PTL, because it accurately identifies individuals needing primary prevention of prematurity. (but p=0.14) . Combining the three tests also improved prediction in this cohort (AUC 0.88, p<0.001) . CONCLUSIONS: In our study, CL and fFN have demonstrated significant but limited ability to predict preterm birth in high risk asymptomatic women. Performance of all predictors was poorer in the low risk asymptomatic cohort. Test performance in symptomatic women was more promising, excluding pH estimation. There is significant scope to improve upon these techniques for PTB prediction, particularly when utilised for asymptomatic women. Studies to determine whether the addition of novel predictors to these current techniques will improve identification of women at greatest risk of PTB are ongoing. ",

            "text": "In 2009, the MFM division at a tertiary care academic hospital developed a guideline for the administration of a rescue course of antenatal corticosteroids. Eligible patients must be less than 32 and 6/7 weeks with intact membranes, no evidence of chorioamnionitis, have a threat of preterm delivery within the next 7 days and the antecedent treatment given more than 14 days prior and at less than 30 weeks gestation. A stepwise approach to implement the guideline included a formal process within MFM division meetings, hospital-based practice guideline development and full faculty adoption of the guideline. Uptake and adherence to the guideline was reviewed before and after guideline implementation. Rates of rescue dose steroids administration over time was compared using Cochran-Armitage Trend Test. RESULTS: Of 2528 women who received a first course of antenatal corticosteroids from 2008-2013, 142 were eligible for a rescue course. The rate of administration of rescue steroids among eligible women steadily increased over the post-guideline period from 18.2% pre-guideline to 96.1% at the end of the study period (P<0.0001). There were no demographic characteristics associated with lack of administration of rescue steroids among those who were eligible and did not receive a rescue course. The latency period from time of administration of rescue course to delivery varied by indication: from 1.0 week for women with hypertension/ preeclampsia to 3.8 weeks for those with suspected abruption. PPROM, a condition considered to be an exclusion for the use of rescue steroids, was present in (44%) of ineligible women receiving rescue corticosteroids. There was no difference in guideline uptake among prenatal providers. CONCLUSIONS: Using a formal process to implement an MFM guideline on rescue course antenatal corticosteroids, hospital wide administration of rescue steroids increased markedly. The ECBs are the product of dietary fatty acids, and are comprised of the G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2), the endogenous ligands, i.e. N-arachidonylethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachdonoyl glycerol (2-AG), and the respective enzymes/ uptake systems for biosynthesis and degradation. The CB1 receptors are expressed in brain and peripheral tissues, while the CB2 receptor is expressed in microglia, immune and hematopoietic tissues. The recent data showed direct role of endocannabinoids in alcoholic and nonalcoholic (obesity-related) fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty liver has been documented already in fetuses of obese women and in healthy pregnant women as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. However, the markers to diagnose these conditions do not exist. Our objective was to use the baboon model of maternal obesity to evaluate the expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors in maternal and fetal liver and compare the expression to the placenta. METHODS: Archived baboon liver and placental tissues were used for quantification of CB1 and CB2 expression, which was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The cDNA was synthesized according manufacturer's instructions (Roche; Indianapolis, IN, USA). The CB1 monoclonal antibody (ImmunoGenes; Budakeszi, Hungary) was used for IHC in the liver and placenta to confirm expression of the receptor. These slides were then scanned and quantified using Aperio \u00ae software.",

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report regarding presence of both ECBs receptors in fetal and maternal hepatic tissue. ECSs could be markers for NAFLD in pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 2-9% of pregnancies and is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Late diagnosis of GDM was defined as women who had a single abnormal value on a 3 hour 100g glucose tolerance test (GTT) at 24-28 weeks but who met Carpenter-Coustan criteria for diagnosis when this test was repeated a month later. There is limited data on the utility of rescreening women with one abnormal value on a 3hr GTT, the incidence of late GDM in these women, and the differences in outcomes among pregnancies diagnosed with GDM late in pregnancy versus at the standard screening time.",

Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or greater and one abnormal value on the 3hr GTT performed at 24-28 weeks after failing the 1hr 50g GTT. Data abstracted included maternal demographics, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 6,057 women were screened with GTT and 476 met inclusion criteria. Among 476 women rescreened, there were 178 who later met criteria for GDM and 298 with subsequent negative testing. Women with a late diagnosis of GDM were more likely to report a history of GDM in a prior pregnancy than those with no GDM (p<0.0001). Women with a late diagnosis of GDM had a lower BMI at delivery (31.4 kg/m 2 vs. 32.8 kg/m 2 , p<0.01), lower total pregnancy weight gain (11.3 kg vs. 13.8 kg, p<0.0001) and earlier gestational age at delivery (38.4 vs. 38.9 wks, p=0.02). There were no differences in birth weight, 5 minute APGAR, mode of delivery, neonatal length of stay, or macrosomia between the two groups. There were no reported shoulder dystocias in either group. Seventeen (9.6%) of the late diagnosed GDM patients required medication for glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Late diagnosis of GDM resulted in small decreases in BMI and total weight gain at the time of delivery, as well as earlier gestational age at delivery and no differences in neonatal outcomes. Our data does not support repeat GTT screening for women with one abnormal value on a 3hr GTT as there were no clinically significant differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes with late diagnosis of GDM. completed weeks, respectively. NND was defined as a death within 28 days of birth. Low 5-minute Apgar scores of term infants were defined as 0-3. Multivariable logistic regression models stratified by gestational age at birth were used to assess the BMI-NDD association. RESULTS: There were 8683 neonatal deaths (2.6 per 1000 live births); most were early preterm (64%), while 14% were late preterm and 22% were term births. The unadjusted risk of NND among early preterm and term births tended to increase as BMI increased. After adjustment for race/ ethnicity, education, parity, and smoking, grade 1, 2, or 3 obese women were 1.2 to 1.4 times as likely as normal weight women to have a NND following an early preterm delivery. Following a term delivery, grade 2 and 3 obese women were 1.7 to 1.8 times as likely as normal weight women to have a NND. The adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for NND at term were the strongest among the infants with 5-minute Apgar scores 0-3 (grade 2 obese: 2. There is a paucity of data on WC as a risk factor in pregnancy. C-reactive protein(CRP) is an acute phase reactant and marker of inflammation. It has shown potential to predict preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. We sought to evaluate first trimester CRP in overweight/obese women grouped by waist circumference <88cm versus >88cm compared to normal weight women. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate CRP levels in 3 groups of pregnant women: 1) BMI <25, 2) BMI 25-34.9 with WC <88cm and 3) BMI 25-34.9 with WC>88 cm. High sensitivity CRP was run on serum and waist circumference was measured prior to 14 weeks gestation in a convenience sample of eligible women seen by Wake Forest University obstetricians. Medical and obstetric data were abstracted. The hypothesis that first trimester CRP would differ between groups was tested by analysis of variance(ANOVA). Demographic and medical variables were evaluated with chi square for dichotomous variables and ANOVA for continous variables. Pearsons Correlation Coefficient was used to assess relationships between variables. RESULTS: Of 24 women, 9 were in group 1, 5 in group 2 and 10 in group 3. CRP values did not differ but trended toward being higher in group 3(p=0.09) *Figure(s) will be available online. Intake CRP was higher in women with intake BMI over 30(p<0.01) when controlling for chronic HTN, DM and smoking. First trimester WC had positive associations with CRP(R=0.39), age(R=0.39), parity(R=0.52) and BMI(R=0.85). There was no relationship between CRP and age(R= -0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Being obese leads to increased systemic inflammation as defined by elevated CRP in the first trimester. Waist circumference is closely related to obesity and is correlated with increasing CRP, age and parity. Increased incidence of second and third trimester complications in the obese population may be rooted in inflammatory insults to placental development early in gestation. Obesity is a major risk factor for surgical site infections (SSI) after cesarean and high rates persist despite current preventive measures. Culture-independent sequenced-based analysis of the skin at cesarean incision sites has the potential to provide new insights on the etiology and prevention of SSI. We sought to characterize the skin microbiome at the incision site in women undergoing cesarean delivery and compare microbial community structures in obese and non-obese women.",

Skin swabs were obtained at the site of planned cesarean incision immediately prior to preoperative skin preparation and stored at -80C until DNA extraction. 16s rRNA V4 region was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Operational taxonomic units were assigned using the Greengenes reference database. Reads were clustered by QIIME at 97% similarity and specimens were rarefied to a read depth of 1200. Analysis including Shannon diversity and specific taxon abundance were compared between obese (BMI \u226530 Kg/m2) and non-obese (BMI <30 Kg/m2) women. RESULTS: Preoperative skin swabs were obtained from 144 patients; 21 were excluded for low DNA yield, and 123 were analyzed. In all, 91 (74.6%) patients were obese. The skin microbiome at cesarean incision site of pregnant women as a group was characterized predominantly by Corynebacteriaceae (32%), Staphylococcaceae (26%), Clostridales(10%), and Lactobacillaceae (9%). Microbial diversity was significantly higher in obese compared with non-obese women (Shanon diversity, P=0.03). Obese women had significantly higher abundance of Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus and Planococcaceae, and lower abundance of Lactobacillus and Methylobacterium compared with non-obese women. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Obese women have higher microbial diversity and specific taxa compositions compared with non-obese women. These differences may contribute to the higher risk of SSI after cesarean in obese women, and provide insight into newer SSI prevention strategies in obese women.

Based on our data, we propose to consider changing the threshold for AMA from 35 to 40 years. CONCLUSIONS: Gestation length is reduced in shorter and Aboriginal women. Neonatal morbidity is reduced at late preterm gestations in Aboriginal but not in short women. Stillbirth is more common in both groups after 40 weeks. We suggest that the shortened gestation in Aboriginal women is physiological but that in short women it is the result of maternal constraint of fetal growth, whereby the shorter woman delivers a fetus earlier when it is smaller and safer for the mother, albeit at increased risk to the neonate. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery between 35-36wks yields a relatively favorable ratio of demise to RDS. The outcome prior to 35wks is not improved by FLM testing due to the low incidence with poor negative predictive value. Further, the incidence of neonatal demise is such that it parallels that of ICP. Improvement with mature testing may be seen at 35wks, which is reflected in the demise to RDS ratio, however, delay in delivery results in doubling of the incidence of demise. Thus reasonable recommendation for delivery is 35wks with FLM, or delivery at 36wks without testing.",

Required clinical information was obtained from the patients' chart. Placental examination was conducted by one pathologist. RESULTS: One hundred seventy women with singleton gestations were included. Their median gestational age at delivery was 33 weeks of gestation (range, 22-41 weeks). There were 14 placental findings including those normal (n = 70). Of the women with normal placenta, one woman with meconium peritonitis showed high PCT level (6.7 ng/mL) in the umbilical blood. The main findings were chorioamnionitis (CAM; n = 43) and fetal vessel thrombosis (FVT; n = 14). PCT level in CAM (5.77 \u00b1 15.3 ng/mL) and FVT (6.75 \u00b1 16.6 ng/mL) were markedly higher compared with the normal pathological findings (0.23 \u00b1 0.16 ng/mL). PCT level in CAM with stage \u2265 2 of fetal response was higher when compared with that in CAM with stage 0 or 1 of fetal response. Furthermore, among the stages of fetal response, PCT levels were highest in those with stage \u2265 2. CONCLUSIONS: FVT, but not CAM, influenced the PCT levels in the umbilical cord blood. When PCT is applied for the diagnosis of early-onset sepsis, the placental findings need to be considered. Reactive electrophiles originate from exogenous and endogenous sources, and can be found in the blood stream after inflammatory processes, ionizing radiation, pollutant exposure, and following the oxidation of natural molecules such as lipids. Their presence has been associated with various pregnancy complications. Measurement of reactive electrophiles in the blood stream could be a useful tool to characterise an individual's environmental exposures but their high reactivity and very short unbound life-span makes their detection difficult. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the major protein in blood with high nucleophilic properties. It has been reported that unbound reactive electrophiles in the circulation bind to the HSA's free sulfhydryl groups and form \"adducts\" on a specific residue. METHODS: Liquid Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS; QExactive, Thermo) was used to investigate 14 potential adducts of the HSA cysteine (Cys 34 ). Serum was obtained from subjects at 20 weeks of gestation in Auckland, New Zealand. The subject groups comprised women that reported smoking before and during the pregnancy (n=20); women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (n=20), and women identified as having a small for gestational age (SGA) foetus (n=20). The subjects were matched with controls according to age, body mass index and ethnicity. Data extraction and statistical analysis were performed using SIEVE version 2.2 SP2 and R version 3.2.2.",

CONCLUSIONS: While we did not identify any significant differences in HSA adducts between cases and controls, we successfully detected adducts of the Cys 34 HSA. This demonstrates that adductomics is a robust method for detection of potential reactive electrophiles in vivo and can be applied in future adductomics studies.

Greater GWG correlated inversely with postpartum TBW change (R 2 =0.15, P < 0.03). However, the change in postpartum TBW between visits was not associated with pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, third trimester maternal fat mass, or infant birth weight. Compared to women with NGWG, women with EGWG had less weight loss (6.82 \u00b1 2.7 kg versus 8.06 \u00b1 1.9 kg) and TBW loss (5.27 \u00b1 2.7 kg versus 7.10 \u00b1 3.6 kg) at 2 weeks postpartum *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, women with EGWG during pregnancy lost less weight and TBW (both in absolute amounts and proportionally to total weight loss) two weeks postpartum compared to their NGWG peers. This suggests that women with EGWG retain more weight immediately after delivery, which is proportionally higher in adipose content (vs. water) than NGWG, possibly contributing to increased risk of obesity in these women. INTRODUCTION: Prior to parturition, the cervix undergoes a ripening process allowing dilation necessary for delivery of the fetus at term. This process is complex and may involve a potential role for an inflammatory cascade. An increase in resident immune cells near term gestation has been observed in cervical stroma. The cervix is richly innervated, however the role of cervical innervation remains enigmatic. SP and CGRP are primary neuropeptides in sensory pain fibers and have been localized by immunocytochemistry in the cervix. Fibroblasts are the primary cell type in the cervical stroma and integral in regulating cervical integrity. In the present study we hypothesized that HCFs express receptors for CGRP and SP and that SP and/or CGRP stimulate chemokine expression in HCFs.",

In this study we hypothesized that enhanced ghrelin signaling in beta cells inhibits insulin secretion in pregnant rat fed LP diet. METHODS: Pregnant SD rats were fed a diet with 20% (CT) or 6% casein (LP) from Day 1 of pregnancy until sacrificed on Day 21 (n=6-10 rats/diet) and plasma was collected for insulin measurement by ELISA. Pancreatic islets were isolated and mRNA levels of Proinsulin 2, Ghrl (ghrelin), Mboat4 (membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 4), Bche (butyrylcholinesterase) and Ghsr (growth hormone secretagogue receptor) were measured by real-time PCR.

            "text": "Inhibition The underlying mechanisms of de novo seizure during pregnancy and preeclampsia remain unclear, but may involve loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We previously showed that tight junction permeability is unchanged in pregnancy, but little is known about the adaptation of BBB efflux transporters to pregnancy. We hypothesized that efflux transporter activity protects the maternal brain by preventing passage of seizure-provoking factors that circulate in pregnancy into the brain, and that decreased activity will result in seizure. Here we investigated the role of the BBB efflux transporters p-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer-resistant protein (Bcrp) in seizure prevention by inhibiting their activity in vivo during pregnancy and monitoring for spontaneous seizure. METHODS: Electroencephalography (EEG) was monitored in freely moving nonpregnant (NP, n=8) and pregnant (P, d19, n=8) Sprague Dawley rats via intracortical electrodes in the primary motor cortex and hippocampus. After baseline recordings, rats were treated with the Pgp inhibitor PSC833 (10mg/kg s.c.) and Bcrp inhibitor Probenecid (200mg/kg i.p.), and EEG and video recorded continuously for 2 hours. Time-synced video was used to assess physical manifestation of seizure associated with high frequency spikewave discharges indicative of epileptiform activity on EEG. RESULTS: Three NP rats were excluded due to technical issues and 1 P rat that had epileptiform activity on baseline EEG was excluded. Inhibition of Pgp and Bcrp caused hippocampal epileptiform activity in 100% (7 of 7) of P rats with a latency to onset of 1360\u00b1156 sec that was more prominent and faster than in NP rats, where only 40% (2 of 5) of rats had epileptiform activity with a latency of 2244\u00b1934 sec. Physical manifestations of seizure corresponding to epileptiform activity on EEG, including head nods, jaw jerks and clonic extension of limbs, were present in 2 rats per group. CONCLUSIONS: Efflux transporters appear critical in prevention of seizure in nonpregnant and pregnant states. Pregnancy appears to be more sensitive to seizure induced by efflux transporter inhibition, potentially due to greater seizure-provoking factors circulating in pregnancy and/or the brain being hyperexcitable during pregnancy. Regardless, decreased activity of efflux transporters at the BBB may be one mechanism by which de novo seizure occurs during pregnancy and preeclampsia.",

Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) mediates this process, although the actual stimulus for increasing NO is not known.

The opposite, sham-operated uterine horn served as an internal control. Another group of rats (n=4) was given L-NAME (0.5 g/L) in drinking water to inhibit NOS post-ligation. Following uterine excision on day 20, uterine artery and vein lumen diameters (and arterial wall thickness) were measured under unstressed conditions at three points along the vessel. Arteries were then cannulated and pressurized to evaluate distensibility. Fetal and placental weights were recorded, as well as fetal resorptions and number of pups. RESULTS: Cervical (but not ovarian) end ligation induced significant expansive remodeling of both arteries and veins at the ovarian end. Arterial and venous lumen diameters increased 51 \u00b1 13.8 and 76 \u00b1 26.9%, respectively, relative to the contralateral side. Arterial wall thickness increased 52 \u00b1 10.5% (all p<0.05). Remodeled arteries were significantly (44 \u00b1 12.0%) more compliant than controls. Arterial and venous enlargement was completely abrogated by NOS inhibition. Surprisingly, there were no effects of ligation on fetal or placental weights, fecundity, or incidence of resorption. CONCLUSIONS: Surgically altering uterine hemodynamics revealed the influence of shear stress on maternal uterine arterial and venous expansive remodeling, along with changes in matrix properties. Fetal and placental data attest to the ability of the uterine circulation to adapt to a significant hemodynamic challenge without compromising reproductive outcome. We previously showed that seizure threshold is lower during pregnancy; however, the mechanisms by which the brain adapts during gestation to alter excitability are unclear. Here we determined pregnancy-induced changes in hippocampal slice excitability and excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit expression and activity that could contribute to network excitability. We hypothesized that adaptations occur during pregnancy to increase NMDAR activity in the hippocampus, a brain region central to seizure generation that enhances slice excitability. METHODS: Seizure activity and duration were determined electrophysiologically in hippocampal slices from nonpregnant (NP, n=4) and late-pregnant (LP, d19-20, n=8) rats by comparing evoked potentials in response to zero magnesium (Mg 2+ ), a seizure-provoking stimulus that is selective for NMDAR activation. Power spectrum analyses were used to compare activity in the seizure range of 200-400 Hz. Western blot was used to measure and compare total and phosphorylated NMDAR subunit protein expression as a measure of NMDAR activity in hippocampus from the same animals (n=10/group). ",

The objective is to evaluate the compliance to such a protocol and identify risk factors/barriers to non-adherence. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of singleton gestations with prior sPTB presenting for ultrasounds between 1/1/12-6/30/12 and 7/1/13-12/31/13. Women with a history-indicated cerclage were excluded.

Risk factors and pregnancy outcomes for those who were and were not screened were compared. RESULTS: 104 women were included. Overall, 89% of women were offered serial TVUS CL screening with an acceptance rate of 90%. The rate of sPTB was 18%.

Oxidative stress is characterized by the imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the rate of their consumption by antioxidants. ROS generated during pregnancy can oxidize proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and increased oxidative stress has been described in third trimester of normal pregnancies and labor. Moreover, early increase of oxidative stress is associated with premature senescence of amniochorion membranes which could lead to PPROM. The aim of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress markers, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and malondialdehyde (MDA), in PPROM and term amniochorion membranes. Up to now in Literature only three papers were published on the utility of a preterm prevention clinic to reduce incidence of prematurity and neonatal morbidity in patients with a history of PTB.",

We then compared the outcomes of patients controlled in our preterm prevention clinic in the following two-year period (2013) (2014) , in order to verify if the same results were obtained. METHODS: Retrospective study including singleton pregnancies with no fetal abnormalities and a history of at least one PTB seen in our dedicated clinic for PTB prevention between 2011 and 2012. This group was compared to women with the same risk factors (history of PTB or pPROM) not seen in PTB prevention clinic who delivered in the same period (controls). RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2012 PTB incidence was significantly different in the two groups (19,6% in patients attending PTB prevention clinic vs 32,9% in controls) and PTB < 32 wks were reduced by 9 times (0,98% vs 7,4 %); moreover in the first group we didn't record any delivery before 28 wks g.a versus 4, 2% in patients treated with usual care. The same good results of preterm prevention clinic were confirmed by the analysis of outcomes of the following two-year period. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience a clinic dedicated to preterm prevention modifies clinical outcomes of patients with a hitory of PTB, significantly reducing severe prematurity (<32 wks). sensitizing the uterus to stimulation and contraction. IL-1\u03b2 is a key mediator of this process, inducing both pro-inflammatory and pro-labour genes. We have previously shown that IL-1\u03b2 up-regulates expression of the PGF2\u03b1 receptor FP and strongly induces IL-6 production in HMSMC. IL-6 knockout mice deliver 24h late due to a delayed rise in UAPs (Robertson et al. 2010) . As UAP levels do rise normally, albeit 24h late, IL-6 is not critical for UAP expression. We hypothesized that IL-6 may promote sensitization of the myometrium to contraction by stimulating UAPs and cytokines in the myometrium.",

N=6-9 patients; paired t-test, or repeated measures ANOVA then Tukey's post hoc test (p\u22640.05). RESULTS: IL-1\u03b2 treatment strongly increases relative mRNA abundance for IL-6 (p<0.0001) and increases IL-6R (p>0.05). IL-1\u03b2 also up-regulates COX-2 mRNA expression (p<0.001), and FP (Zaragoza et al. 2006 ) while down-regulating OTR mRNA expression (p<0.05). IL-6 treatment does not change expression of COX-2, FP, or OTR. Although not statistically significant in this patient set, IL-1\u03b2 also increases expression levels of its receptor system IL-1R1, IL-1RAcP and IL-1RAcPb. IL-6 treatment induces a slight increase in IL-1R1 expression, but has no effect on IL-1RAcP, IL-1RAcPb, or IL-6R. Treating HMSMC with 15 ng/mL IL-6 however induces a 3.6-fold increase in IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1\u03b2 contributes to the process of uterine transformation by promoting expression of UAPs, cytokines and their receptors, including IL-6. IL-6 is not necessary for UAP induction, but a loss of IL-6 results in delayed UAP increases. From this study, we conclude that IL-6 does not stimulate UAP expression in HMSMC, but does stimulate IL-1\u03b2. These data suggest that the primary role of IL-6 is to regulate IL-1\u03b2 levels in uterine stromal cells and leukocytes and not to activate the uterus directly.

INTRODUCTION: Exposure to toxic metals during pregnancy has been linked to a variety of negative reproductive outcomes, such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and low birthweight. In contrast, trace elements play an important role in maternal health and fetal development where deficiencies in essential metals, such as selenium and zinc, have been correlated to miscarriage and preeclampsia. The exact etiologies of such outcomes and the effects of fetal exposure to these metals are largely unknown. Therefore, the ability to assess levels of these elements is critical to determining the underlying causes of such conditions and the effects that both essential and non-essential metals have in fetal development.",

            "text": "We set out to examine the effects of toxic and essential metals on fetal gene expression using cell-free fetal RNA (cffRNA). METHODS: Leveraging a retrospective cohort examining spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), metals were measured in amniotic fluid (AF) by Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. ccfRNA was extracted from AF and fetal expression assessed using the Nanostring platform. The essential metals selenium, manganese, and zinc, and toxic metals arsenic, mercury, and lead were selected for regression analysis. RESULTS: Arsenic was associated with increased expression of three genes: Phospholipase C, Beta 1 (Phosphoinositide-Specific) (PLCB1), Progesterone Receptor (PGR), and Olfactory Receptor, Family 4, Subfamily S, Member 2 (OR4S2). Lead was associated with increased expression of Ribosomal Protein, Large, P0 (RPLP0). Selenium was associated with increased expression of Neurotensin Receptor 1 (High Affinity) (NTSR1). These genes encode proteins with functions that include progesterone signaling, neurotensin mediation, and regulation of myometrial contractility. CONCLUSIONS: Using a custom nanostring panel focused on pathways related to sPTB (HPA axis, inflammation, oxidative stress), we show there are differences in targeted expression as they relate to metals exposure. The results highlight the potential for detrimental health effects of prenatal metals exposure and the potential to identify biomarkers of environmental exposure during this critical developmental period. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of preterm birth (PTB) reported to date have failed to identify replicable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to explain genetically indicated preterm birth. The GWAS were underpowered to detect either high effect single SNPs or an effect driven by multiple, small-effect SNPs acting through common pathways. The objective of this study was to determine whether integration of GWAS with myometrial transcriptome data for PTB adds power to detect the combined influence of small genetic variants in causing PTB. METHODS: A list of candidate SNPs from the largest meta-analysis of PTB-GWAS was integrated with term and preterm laboring myometrial transcriptome data in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The SNPs were mapped to their associated genes, and a PPI network enriched with the candidate SNPs and topologically related proteins was constructed and scored with myometrial expression data to identify subnetworks of coordinately expressed genes enriched with PTB-SNPs. RESULTS: Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2C (MEF2C) was central to 15/22 term myometrium subnetworks. MEF2C is a transcription factor co-regulated with 5 ion channel, 2 inflammation, and 4 muscle function associated genes. The MEF2C networks were enriched with 11 PTB-SNP genes in total. The transcription factor TWIST1 was most frequently altered in the preterm myometrium networks. TWIST1 carries a PTB associated SNP and is an essential regulator of NFkB signaling in the myometrium. The phospholipase, PLA2G4C, carries five PTB-SNPs and was found in both the term and preterm myometrium subnetworks associated with MEF2C. SNPs in PLA2G4C have been previously associated with preterm birth and shown to disrupt prostaglandin synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows how several PTB associated SNPs that are statistically insignificant on their own may act through a common pathway to drive PTB. The combined SNP signature in this pathway may serve as a marker for PTB risk and/or a new set of therapeutic targets that may be effectively modulated to prevent PTB. We hypothesized that the antimicrobial capacity of cervical mucus may be related to DEFB4 CN, and that this may be altered in women who deliver preterm. METHODS: Cervical mucus was collected antenatally from white European women at increased risk of sPTB who attended a specialist PTB clinic and snap frozen (n=210). Upon thaw, samples were eluted in 10mM HEPES buffer and aliquots prepared for DNA extraction, protein quantification (total protein, Bradford assay; HBD2, ELISA) and standard antimicrobial assays using E coli. DEFB4 CN was determined by paralogue ratio test. All assays were performed blind to pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: DEFB4 CN correlates with cervical HBD2 expression in women at increased risk of sPTB who deliver at term (r=0.2206, p=0.0093), but not in women who spontaneously deliver preterm. Cervical mucus antimicrobial activity correlates with HBD2 expression in all women (term: r=0.6155, p<0.0001; preterm:, r=0.6015, p<0.0001).",

Based upon the induction of Ptgs1 at E12.5 in our dataset, which is a crucial marker for timing of labor in mice, differential gene expression preceding 12.5 was studied in detail for the identification of upstream transcription factors. Ingenuity pathway analysis identifies Tbx2, Myc, Mycn as the top active upstream transcription factors based on the directional gene expression of their downstream targets in transition from E10.5 to E12.5. Additionally, RNAseq on human myometrium comparing the quiescent and contractile state substantiates the putative role of TBX2 as an upstream regulator for partition initiation. CONCLUSIONS: This dataset defines unique gestational age-specific gene expression profiles valuable for exploratory identification of triggers for the initiation of labor in mice. Furthermore, Tbx2 is a candidate transcriptional regulator of gene expression in the transition from myometrial quiescence to synchronized contractions from mid gestation to late gestation. is one of the strongest uterotonic agents known to stimulate uterine contractions and plays a key role in the initiation and regulation of both term and preterm labour (PTL). We have recently demonstrated an additional pro-inflammatory role of OT in human gestational tissues, thus suggesting that tocolytics that target OT/ OTR system to inhibit premature uterine contractions should ideally inhibit both uterine contractions and inflammatory activation. Oxytocin receptor (OTR) antagonists such as Atosiban have been used therapeutically for the treatment of PTL. We have previously shown that Atosiban not only fails to inhibit the pro-inflammatory effects of OT in human amnion, but Atosiban alone activates NF-\u03baB and MAPKs as well as upregulating downstream pro-labour gene expression, such as COX-2, p-cPLA 2 , IL-6 and CCL5.",

This led to subsequent decreases in OT-induced expression of COX-2 and p-cPLA 2 , which was reflected in PGE 2 synthesis. Successful inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by OBE001 also translated to suppression of OT-induced NF-\u03baB-regulated pro-labour gene expression including COX-2, IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2. Moderate reduction of OT-induced p-ERK activation was observed in both gestational tissues but it did not reach significance.

Animal studies have implicated that activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B/AKT is important for uterine artery remodeling during pregnancy. However, suitable human uterine artery (UA) cell models are still lacking, impeding the understanding of the molecular mechanisms. The objective of this study is to develop a primary human uterine artery smooth muscle cell (hUASMC) model to investigate agonist-stimulated ERK1/2 and AKT activation adaptive to pregnancy. METHODS: Primary UAs were collected from hysterectomies of late pregnant (LP) and nonpregnant (NP) women. After endothelium removal by collagenase digestion, mechanically isolated smooth muscle were minced and digested with 0.1% collagenase. The hUASMC were collected and cultured in DMEM-10%FCS-1% antibiotics. The cells were characterized by the expression of endothelial vs. smooth muscle cell marker proteins. The LP and NP hUASMC were treated with 10 nM estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2), 10ng/ml FGF2 or VEGF, or vehicle for 5 min. Cellular proteins were harvested for analyzing activation of ERK1/2 and AKT by immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphor-ERK1/2 and phosphor-AKT. RESULTS: hUASMC was positive of SM-\u03b1-actin (>99%), but negative of endothelial cell markers, and displayed typical spindle-like shape in culture. LP and NP hUASMC expressed comparable estrogen receptors (ERalpha and ERbeta) up to 5 passages in culture.

While the trajectories of uterine transcriptome changes in the term and RU486 models were similar, LPS-induced PTL involved upregulation of a unique set of proinflammatory genes whose expression was not altered in term labor or RU486 induced PTL. We identified 357 human-mouse orthologs differentially expressed in human myometrium collected prior to and following spontaneous term labor (Chan Y.W. et al. 2014 ) and in the murine models datasets. Orthogonal partial least squares modeling of human transcriptome data against the murine datasets showed positive correlations between gene changes associated with both progesterone withdrawal (r=0.74, p=0.01) and inflammation (r=0.92, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: While the acquisition of a laboring phenotype in the mouse can be achieved through activation of inflammatory genes these changes are not a requisite of labor itself. However, human labor exhibits myometrial gene changes associated with both progesterone withdrawal and inflammatory activation. (VECs) has been shown to involve NF-\u03baB activation, the role of AP-1 in mediating NLR-driven inflammation in these cells has yet to be elucidated. METHODS: VECs derived from the VK E6/E7 cell line (ATCC \u00a9 ) were grown to confluence as monolayers in keratinocyte-serum free medium (K-SFM) containing 5ng/ml recombinant epidermal growth factor and 50ug/ml bovine pituitary extract. Morphology and cell viability was confirmed through visual assessment at 100x magnification. Cells were serum starved with DMEM medium with 1% fetal calf serum for 12 h prior to stimulation with the NOD1 ligand, \u01b3-D-Glu-mDAP (iE-DAP) and the NOD2 ligand, Muramyl dipeptide (MDP) at concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5g/ml. Cells were treated for 30min, 2h and 24h. Western blotting of protein extracts was performed using antibodies raised against the phosphorylated NF-\u03baB and AP-1 subunits p-65 and c-Jun. RESULTS: Treatment of VECs with the NOD1 ligand (iE-DAP) and NOD2 ligand (MDP) resulted in a rapid, transient increase in phosphorylation of p-65 which peaked at 30min post treatment before decreasing at 2h and returning to basal levels at 24h. In contrast, NOD1 and NOD2 stimulation lead to a rapid increase (30 min) in phosphorylated c-Jun that persisted 24h post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates that AP-1 is a critical modulator of NLR-induced inflammatory signalling in VECs. Transient NF-\u03baB activation by NLR stimulation may indicate its involvement in early response inflammatory signalling. In contrast, persistent activation of AP-1 identifies its potential as a novel strategic target for the modulation of inflammatory pathways at the frontier of the innate immune system associated with infection/inflammatory associated preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: 1) One-third to one half of all early sPTB have subclinical intra-amniotic inflammation; 2) The absence of inflammation has a higher specificity (94% to 86%); 3) Intra-amniotic inflammation precedes early sPTB; 4) It is unknown if intra-amniotic inflammation is due to infection or other causes; 5) The clinical significance of silent intraamniotic inflammation associated with delivery at term is not know. , CST II (L.gasseri) or CST IV (low levels of Lactobacillus spp. and high levels of BV-associated species) prevalence were identified between women with and without yeast infection. CONCLUSIONS: Yeast infection in pregnancy is not associated with major alteration of vaginal bacterial community structure. However, L.jensenii appears to be negatively associated with yeast infection in pregnancy indicating a possible protective role. Consistent with this notion, a strain of L.jensenii has been previously shown to produce a bacteriocin-like compound against C. albicans. Further studies will be required to elucidate if modulation of the vaginal microbiome to promote a bacterial community protective against yeast and microbial infections would improve neonatal outcomes.

From our data we can conclude that the availability of a lactobacilli treatment, in addition to standard antibiotic therapy allows a good colonization, improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing preterm birth. An asymptomatic short cervix detected in midtrimester is a major risk factor for subsequent preterm birth (PTB), and progesterone supplementation by way of vaginal pessary has been shown to effectively reduce PTB rates in these high-risk pregnancies. The vaginal microbiome has previously been characterized in healthy pregnancy and shown to increase in Lactobacillus spp. dominance and stability, while vaginal dysbiosis is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. This study aimed to investigate the impact of progesterone intervention on the vaginal microbiome in high-risk pregnancy with a short cervix. METHODS: Women with a prior PTB (<37weeks) attending cervical length (CL) screening before 18 weeks gestation were prospectively recruited. Serial high vaginal sampling (HVS) was performed at initial screening and longitudinally (22, 28 and 34 weeks follow up). Women with a CL of <25mm at initial screening before 18 weeks were prescribed vaginal progesterone 400mg/OD until 34 weeks. Characterization of the vaginal microbiome was performed using MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons (V1-V3). Ward hierarchical clustering analysis classified samples into community state types (CSTs). Microbial profiles were compared between short (<25mm) and non-short cervix groups, and the impact of progesterone supplementation on the microbiome was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 67 pregnant women with a prior PTB consented to recruitment and underwent CL screening. Of these 25 received progesterone for a CL <25mm before 18 weeks (mean CL = 21mm v 32mm control; n=42, P<0.01). PTB rates (<37weeks) were higher in women receiving progesterone (32%, 8/25 v Control: 5%, 2/42; P=0.004). Prior to progesterone intervention, a short cervix was associated with slightly higher prevalence of CST IV (deficient in Lactobacillus spp.) compared to controls (12% v 2%, P=0.14). Progesterone intervention was not associated with any significant modulation of vaginal bacterial communities during pregnancy. Similarly, no significant differences in vaginal microbiota were detected between women receiving progesterone who delivered at term versus preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Progesterone supplementation does not have any adverse impact upon the vaginal microbiome during pregnancy in those women at high risk of preterm birth with a short cervix. Our data indicates that the action of progesterone in the prevention of preterm birth is not via modulation of vaginal microbial communities. ",

The current study investigates how DMA produces its anti-inflammatory effect. METHODS: Using in vitro and ex vivo models, we tested whether DMA suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and human placental explants from term Cesarean deliveries and TNFa-induced JEG-3 cells. We investigated if DMA's effect on cytokine expression involves inhibition of the NF-kB and MAPK pathways, using Western blotting. Finally, we co-transfected HEK 293 cells overexpressing TLR4 receptors with NF-kB-Luc, AP-1-Luc, and CEBP-Luc reporter plasmids with Renilla-Luc control plasmid to further distinguish the effect of DMA on these pathways. RESULTS: DMA suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells and human placental explants and TNFa-induced JEG-3 cells. Specifically, DMA abolished up-regulation of TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) seen in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Similarly, we found that DMA abrogated up-regulation of TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, as well as IL-8 in LPS-stimulated human placental explants. In TNFa-stimulated JEG-3 cells, DMA attenuated IL-6. DMA inhibited IKBa degradation in RAW 264.7 cells, while there was no change found in the expression of phosphorylated and native forms of downstream proteins in the MAPK pathway p-38, ERK or JNK. Finally, DMA attenuated luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with the NF-kB-Luc and Renilla-luc plasmid, while no effect was observed in the AP-1-Luc and CEBP-Luc transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our previous in vivo data and the new in-vitro and ex-vivo data presented here underscore the anti-inflammatory activity of DMA via its effect on the NF-kB pathway. INTRODUCTION: Exposure to prenatal inflammation is associated with poor neurobehavioral outcomes in offspring. A common route of exposure is intrauterine inflammation (IUI), which is often linked with preterm birth. Hippocampal development may be particularly vulnerable to an inflammatory insult as this region remains highly neurogenic in perinatal and postnatal life, a time when most neurogenesis is complete. These studies were performed to test the hypothesis that aberrant hippocampal development is a mechanism by which exposure to IUI may lead to adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. METHODS: CD-1 timed pregnant mice received intrauterine injections of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [50\u00b5g/100\u00b5L] or saline at embryonic day 15. Pups born at term were culled at postnatal day 3 (P3), injected with BrdU at P7 and P8, and transcardially perfused at either P14 (LPS n=10; saline n=8) or P28 (LPS n=6; saline n=6). One or two pups were analyzed per dam at each time-point. Brains were cryosectioned at 50\u00b5m and immunostained with antibodies against BrdU (proliferation), NeuN (neurons), GFAP (astrocytes), Iba1 (microglia), Prox1 (granule cells), and Cleaved Caspase-3 (apoptosis). RESULTS: IUI had no effect on hippocampal astrocyte or microglia density. However, pups exposed to IUI had significantly reduced neurogenesis at P7 (p=0.023) compared to controls. In addition, there were fewer granule cells in the dentate gyrus of LPS-exposed mice (6% reduction at P14, p=0.094; 19% reduction at P28, p=0.002) compared to controls. Exposure to IUI had no effect on apoptosis at P14 or P28. Ectopic migration of granule cells was observed in LPS-exposed mice at P14; however this phenotype was not present at P28. * Figure( It has been previously shown that there is an increased risk of cesarean section among multiparous women as interpregnancy interval increases. One possible explanation for the increased cesarean rate is that the progess of labor may vary with interbirth interval, such that with longer interbirth intervals, labor curves of multiparous women more closely resemble those of nulliparous women. We sought to define labor curves among a cohort of multiparous women who had successful vaginal deliveries after varying interbirth intervals.",

Cervical length was set to 25mm, and the pessary hole diameter was set to 32mm. Loading, material properties, and FE solving was done in FEBio 2.3.1. Models were constructed with and without a pessary. An intrauterine pressure of 1 kPa was applied inside the fetal membrane while the pessary was fixed. RESULTS: Application of a cervical pessary in the computer simulation results in the reduction of the high stretch zone (>10%) near the internal os ( Fig 1C) . This effect is coupled with increased stresses (1D) and accompanying stretch (1C) on the exterior of the cervix and lower uterine segment where there is contact with the pessary. * Figure( s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: We show that the pessary can reduce cervical stretch near the internal os, which is the first area to fail in premature cervical shortening. The biological response of the cervix to increased stresses near pessary contact, however, has not been determined.

Longitudinal muscle strips (2\u00d72\u00d710 mm) were prepared and mounted vertically in tissue baths to measure contractility. The tissue baths were aerated with a gas mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% CO2. The pH was kept at 7.4 and the temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b0C. A resting tension of 2g was initially applied. After establishment of rhythmic contractions in 10 ml Kreb's solution, levobupivacaine hydrochloride (1.5 ug/ ml and 15 ug/ml) was added to the baths. Changes in the amplitude (peak force) of contractions and area under contractions curves (AUC) were recorded for 20 minutes and changes in amplitude and AUC calculated as % change from recordings made prior to addition of levobupivacaine. RESULTS: It took 1-2 hours for uterine strips to achieve spontaneous phasic contractions. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride at concentration of 1.5 ug/ml had no effect (P>0.05) on the contractions of isolated human term myometrium, while levobupivacaine hydrochloride at concentration of 15 ug/ml significantly reduced (P<0.05) the amplitude (peak force) of contractions (11.09\u00b10.93% decrease) and AUC (8.55\u00b12.09 % decrease) compared with the control value. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride dose-dependently suppresses myometrial contractions immediately after treatment in vitro but the concentration required for the inhibition is much higher (15 fold) than the clinically relevant plasma concentration after low-dose epidural administration. 2. The inhibitory action of high concentration levobupivacaine hydrochloride on uterine contractility is unlikely to be significant in the setting of low-dose epidural analgesia in labor. In the pregnant uterus CASP3 activation is accompanied by increased non-apoptotic signaling, allowing the uterine myocyte to avoid CASP3 mediated apoptotic cell death. In other systems it has been demonstrated that preconditioning cells with small insults of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress prior to a major insult acts paradoxically to enhance cell viability through an up-regulation of anti-apoptotic signaling. Therefore we speculate that pregnancy associated preconditioning events, such as implantation, hypertrophy and hypoxia may allow the pregnant myometrium to harness the tocolytic potential of CASP2 while avoiding apoptosis. METHODS: Immortalized human myometrial cells (hTERT-HM) were exposed to a major ER stress induced insult, tunicamycin (TM) (5\u00b5g/ ml, 24hr), in the absence or presence of ER stress preconditioning (TM, 0.1\u00b5g/ml, 24hr). Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted, the ERSR, CASP3 activation, PARP cleavage and anti-apoptotic signaling associated markers were analyzed utilizing western blotting and Proteome profiler antibody arrays. TUNEL and cell viability assays were performed to examine apoptotic indices. RESULTS: Preconditioned and non-preconditioned hTERT-HM cells both exhibited a significant increase in CASP3 activation in comparison to controls. Markers of apoptosis, PARP cleavage and TUNEL staining, were elevated in the non-preconditioned cells while similar between the preconditioned and control cells. The anti-apoptotic markers Mcl-1, XIAP, and TNRF1 were significantly upregulated in preconditioned cells. Conclusively, cell viability assays exhibited increased cell survival in preconditioned cells versus non-preconditioned treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that preconditioning-induced anti-apoptotic signaling capacitates the human uterine myocyte to avoid CASP3 mediated apoptotic cell death. We speculate that pregnant uteri that fail to precondition appropriately or experience an exaggerated insult in the absence of proper preconditioning, may be at increased risk for premature uterine contractions and pregnancy loss. Bipedalism in humans has required regionalization of myometrial function with a contracted lower uterine segment (LUS) and a relaxed fundus (FUN) during pregnancy to prevent fetal pressure on the cervix and reversal of this phenotype during labour. Using RNAsequencing technology, we have identified that the HoxA13 gene is highly expressed in LUS prior to term labour and plays a key role in contributing to the regionalization of myometrium phenotype. However, the mechanism by which HoxA13 controls myometrium contractility remains unclear. METHODS: Human myometrial cell line (hTERT) and monocyte cell line (THP-1) were used in this study. Gene microarray analyses, real-time PCR, immunoblotting, cell migration and invasion assays were performed to characterize the signaling that controls the expression of contraction associated proteins (CAPs) in myometrial cells. RESULTS: Gene microarray analyses revealed that HoxA13 transcriptome in myometrial cells contains immune response genes including IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 as well as two CAPs (Cox2 and Connexin43). We showed that IL-1b was responsible for the upregulation of IL-6, IL-8, Cox-2 and Cx43 expression by HoxA13 and that blocking IL-1b with its inhibitor abolished these HoxA13 actions. HoxA13-induced IL-1b can stimulate recruitment of monocytes to myometrial cells, which in turn amplified secretion of IL-1b, IL-6 and IL-8 through a mutual feed-forward loop between theses cell types. As a result, Cox-2 expression was dramatically boosted in myometrial cells. CONCLUSIONS: HoxA13 enhances myometrial cell contractility through stimulating myometrial cells to secrete IL-1beta, resulting in increased CAP expression. HoxA13-induced IL-1beta also prompts monocyte recruitment to myometrial cells and further amplifies CAP expression.",

METHODS: Primary cultured myocytes were treated with IL1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 to assess the effect on hsa-miR-146b-3p and hsa-miR-146a-5p expression. Electroporation transfection was used to knockdown and overexpress the p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF\u03baB) to ascertain the impact on IL1\u03b2 mediated specific microRNA expression. Hsa-miR-146b-3p and hsa-miR-146a-5p expression within myocytes was also manipulated with specific microRNA inhibitors and mimics and the resultant downstream expression of p65 and NF\u03baB regulated genes was assessed (n=7, all experiments).",

            "text": "Myocytes treated with IL1\u03b2 demonstrated increased expression of hsa-miR-146b-3p, but hsa-miR-146a-5p levels were unaltered. Treatment with TNF\u03b1 did not affect expression of either microRNA. Expression of hsa-miR-146b-3p in response to IL1\u03b2 was suppressed in cells with p65 targeted knockdown, whilst expression was potentiated in cells with p65 overexpression. Translation of p-p65 and COX2 proteins was increased in cells transfected with hsa-miR-146b-3p mimics, however this effect was not observed with respect to hsa-miR-146a-5p. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest hsa-miR-146b-3p is regulated by NF\u03baB in human myocytes and that this microRNA, in turn, regulates NF\u03baB dependent genes. Hsa-miR-146b-3p has recently been implicated in regulating mRNA levels of TRAF6 and IRAKI, key modulatory proteins of NF\u03baB activation. Understanding the biological pathways underlying human parturition is key to the development of novel therapeutics to better prevent preterm, or induce post-mature, labor. Obese parturients are at significant risk of prolonged and dysfunctional labour and emergency caesarean delivery. As the mechanism is currently unknown a translational animal model of maternal obesity is warranted. Our group recently identified that dietary HFHC induced-adiposity leads to dysfunctional uterine contractions ex-vivo and decreased uterine contractile-associated protein expression during labour in the rat. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of HFHC induced adiposity on uterine contractile activity in vivo and the effects it has on timing and length of labour. METHODS: 12 female Wistar rats were fed either a control chow (CON n=6) or HFHC (n=6) diet ad libitum for 6 weeks. Animals were then mated, and maintained on their respective diet throughout pregnancy and labour. On day 9 of gestation a pressure sensitive telemetry probe was surgically inserted between the 3rd and 4th pup in the uterine horn of highest gravidity using aseptic techniques. Following 5 days recovery, intrauterine pressure (IUP) and contraction frequency (FC) were recorded continuously until established labour (birth of the 5 th pup). Statistical analysis was by ANOVA (mixed between-within subject analysis) at the P<0.05 significance level. RESULTS: HFHC fed rats exhibited earlier and significant increases in IUP and CF compared to CON rats (P= 0.026 and P=0.013 respectively); illustrated in Figures 1A & 1B. The duration of increased contractile activity at term was approximately 12 hours longer in HFHC compared to CON rats, indicating prolonged labour with adiposity. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: These in vivo findings provide evidence to suggest we have a good translational model of maternal obesity that can help elucidate the mechanism(s) governing prolonged and dysfunctional labour and possible diet and or drug therapy to improve contractile activity in obese women.",

            "text": "Placental Glucose Transporter (GLUT)-1 Is Down-Regulated in Preeclampsia. INTRODUCTION: Transplacental fetal glucose supply is predominantly regulated by glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1). Altered expression and/or function of GLUT1 may affect the intrauterine environment, which could compromise fetal development and potentially lead to fetal programming with its long-term consequences. Until now it is unknown if placental GLUT1 is affected by pre-eclampsia (PE). We therefore aimed to address the hypothesis that PE leads to altered expression and function of placental GLUT1. METHODS: Placentae were obtained after elective caesarean sections following normal pregnancy and from pregnancies affected by preeclampsia. Syncytial basal membrane (BM) and apical microvillus membrane (MVM) fractions were prepared from syncytiotrophoblast. GLUT1 protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis and mRNA levels were quantified by qPCR. Radio-labeled glucose up-take assay using placental-derived syncytial microvesicles was established to analyze GLUT1 function. RESULTS: GLUT1 protein expression was significantly down-regulated in PE placentae compared to controls, while the mRNA expression was unchanged. The functional assay in syncytial microvesicles showed a significantly decreased glucose transport activity in pre-eclampsia compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows for the first time that in pre-eclampsia, placental GLUT1 is down-regulated on protein level and that placental GLUT1-mediated glucose transport activity is decreased. Further, these data show that in pre-eclampsia GLUT1-mediated transplacental glucose transport is regulated on the apical side of the syncytiotrophoblast. This altered expression pattern may have an impact on maternofetal glucose supply, which in turn may affect long-term outcome of both the mother and her child. Our aim was to determine if inter-pregnancy interval (IPI) contributes to birth weight in pregnancies subsequent to a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia.",

LSU Health Sciences Center -Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Corin is a serine protease that converts pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) to ANP, a cardiac hormone that regulates salt-water balance and reduces blood pressure. Increased maternal corin levels were found in women with preeclampsia (PE). However, whether altered corin levels associated with altered ANP receptor expression occur in PE is not known. In this study, we determined maternal plasma corin and pro-ANP levels in normal and PE pregnancies. ANP receptor expression in maternal vessels was evaluated in normotensive and PE pregnant women. METHODS: Maternal plasma concentrations of corin and pro-ANP were measured by ELISA in 197 pregnant women (84 normotensive, 16 pregnancy complicated with chronic hypertension (CHT), 11 mild PE and 86 severe PE). Maternal vessel expression of ANP receptors NPRA and NPRC was examined by immunostaining of paraffin embedded subcutaneous fat tissue sections. Data are analyzed by ANOVA or unpaired t-test and a p level <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Maternal plasma corin concentrations were significantly higher in mild PE (2.78\u00b10.67ng/ml) and severe PE (2.53\u00b10.18ng/ml) than in normotensive (1.58\u00b10.08ng/ml) and CHT (1.55\u00b10.20ng/ml) pregnant groups, p<0.001. Corin levels were not different between normotensive and CHT groups. Maternal pro-ANP concentrations were significantly increased in CHT (1.59\u00b10.53ng/ml) and severe PE (1.42\u00b10.24ng/ml) than in normotensive (0.48\u00b10.06ng/ml) and mild PE (0.52\u00b10.09ng/ml) groups, p<0.01. NPRA expression was not different in maternal vessels between normal and PE, but NPRC expression was markedly increased in maternal vessel endothelium in PE compared to that from normal pregnant controls. CONCLUSIONS: NPRC is a clearance receptor for ANP. Increased maternal corin and pro-ANP levels together with up-regulation of NPRC expression in maternal vessel endothelium in severe PE indicate that aberrant ANP pathway signaling might result in increased maternal corin and pro-ANP levels and contribute to vascular dysfunction in PE. The differences in maternal pro-ANP and corin levels between CHT and PE may represent different regulatory mechanism related to the pathophysiology in CHT and PE. The ability to identify women at increased risk of developing preeclampsia may lead to the reduction of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality through the administration of early interventions. The objective of this study is to determine if women that develop preeclampsia during the second half of pregnancy demonstrate distinct first-trimester serum lipid profiles as compared to controls. The identification of unique lipid profiles may reveal novel biomarkers with the potential to predict the development of this pregnancy disorder.",

Women that developed preeclampsia at any gestational age were compared to unaffected controls. Serum samples from patients in the control and preeclamptic groups were matched within 3 days of gestational age. Maternal serum samples obtained between 11-14 weeks of gestation were analyzed for ninety distinct lipid species. Sample analysis was performed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify associations between lipid species and the development of preeclampsia. RESULTS: Serum of 41 patients with preeclampsia was compared with 41 controls. Data was adjusted for maternal BMI, pre-gestational diabetes and African American race. First trimester serum from women that developed preeclampsia demonstrated increased levels of arachidonic acid (p=0.033) and three distinct lysophosphatidylcholine species (LPC 16:0, p=0.005, LPC 18:0, p=0.002 and LPC 20:4, p=0.034). Furthermore, serum from women that developed early preeclampsia demonstrated decreased levels of lauric acid (p=0.029) and myristic acid (p=0.036) but increased amounts of arachidonic acid (p=0.005) and two species of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 14:1, p=0.024 and LPC 20:4, p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that first-trimester serum lipid profiles are distinct in women that develop preeclampsia in the second half of pregnancy and may be useful in screening for this disorder. The lipid species identified in this study may provide insight into the pathogenesis of preeclampsia and will be used in future prospective studies aimed at the early identification of women that develop this disorder. INTRODUCTION: Syndecan-1 (Sdc1) is a transmembrane proteoglycan and part of the endothelial glycocalyx. It aids in the regulation of inflammatory cytokines, angiogenesis and anticoagulation. A prior study reported increased serum Sdc1 during normal pregnancy, although a normal range has not been established. We hypothesized that serum Sdc1 increases in gestational weeks (wks) 11-13 due to the physiologic endothelial changes of pregnancy. METHODS: We analyzed dried blood samples from 300 randomly selected women (n=300 total, 100 each from gestational wks 11, 12, and 13) who delivered in the NSLIJ Health System. Blood spots were obtained from PerkinElmer/NTD. Eluted blood was assessed for Sdc1 levels by ELISA (R&D Systems). Subjects were segregated by gestational age in days (GA) and maternal weight in 20lb increments (wt) at the time the blood was obtained. GA-specific medians were determined by linear regression of median Sdc1 values vs. GA. Multiples of the median (MoMs)=Sdc1/respective GA-specific regressed median. To assess Sdc1 association with maternal wt, a log-log regression of median MoM vs. mean maternal wt values for each wt group was determined. Results were weighted based on the number of patients in each group. RESULTS: A progressive and significant increase in median circulating Sdc1 levels was observed from GA 77-97 days (p<0.001). *Figure(s) will be available online. A decrease in Sdc1 MoM was found with increasing maternal wt, and it was statistically significant (p=0.028). Based on the regression formulas, the expected median Sdc1 values rose from 63 to 119pg/ml between GA 77-97 days, while MoM values decreased from 1.22MoMs at 100lbs to 0.86MoMs at 200lbs (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Serum syndecan-1 has a significant increase during wks 11-13 of pregnancy. Elucidating the range of serum syndecan-1 at the time of the first trimester screen will enable future studies to evaluate its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",

INTRODUCTION: Increases in circulating VEGF and TNF have been linked to preeclampsia-related endothelial dysfunction. While most studies seek to understand the effect of each of these factors on endothelial cell function individually and at single arbitrary doses, and this may be necessary to study associated cell signaling, it fails to recognize the complex interplay between multiple circulating factors activating their respective signaling cascades at the same time. In this study, we use ATP-stimulated sustained Ca2+ signaling to assay endothelial cell function following exposure to combinations of VEGF and TNF using a high-throughput plate reader platform. Based on data from VEGF and TNF treatments in isolation, we hypothesize that at physiologic doses VEGF will attempt to promote ATP-stimulated Ca2+ signaling, but TNF will counteract it to produce a neutral effect. At pathophysiologic doses, we hypothesize that the combination will be a potent inhibitor or sustained Ca2+. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown on 96 well plates to >90% confluence. HUVEC were loaded with Fura-2 AM dye (for Ca2+) and treated with VEGF-165 and TNFa at 0, 0. INTRODUCTION: An imbalance between pro-and anti-angiogenic factors has been associated with the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Progesterone regulates the production of pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF. We seek to characterize the effects of progesterone and its major metabolites, 16\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (16\u03b1-OHP) and 6\u03b2-hydroxyprogesterone (6\u03b2-OHP), on angiogenesis. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to model angiogenesis in a matrigel tube formation assay. HUVECs were grown in full media to establish stable cultures. Cells were pretreated with 1uM progesterone, 16\u03b1-OHP, 6\u03b2-OHP, or left untreated (control) for 24 hours to induce genomic-level effects. Cells were then transferred to matrigel with charcoal-stripped media supplemented with 10nM estradiol and the respective progestin treatment. Tube formation was quantified at 6 and 24 hours by light microscopy and normalized to controls to assess degree of angiogenesis. Replicates of the matrigel tube formation assay were performed (n=9) to allow comparison between treatments using a two-tailed t-test. RESULTS: HUVEC cells in the control group demonstrated formation of 53 tubes at 6 hours and 27 tubes at 24 hours (mean values). Relative to the control group at 6 hours, progesterone treated cells demonstrated 163% tube formation, 16\u03b1-OHP treated cells demonstrated 431% tube formation, and 6\u03b2-OHP treated cells demonstrated 227% tube formation *Figure(s) will be available online. HUVEC tube formation declined by 24 hours to 77% (relative to control) in the progesterone group, 198% in the 16\u03b1-OHP, and 100% in the 6\u03b2-OHP group. At 6 hours, 16\u03b1-OHP treatment resulted in a significant increase in tube formation compared to progesterone treatment (p=0.0017), while 6\u03b2-OHP treatment was not significantly different (p=0.10). Matrigel tube formation remained significantly elevated at 24 hours in the 16\u03b1-OHP treatment group when compared to progesterone (p=0.0007). CONCLUSIONS: The major progesterone metabolites 16\u03b1-OHP and 6\u03b2-OHP have divergent effects on angiogenesis. Inter-individual variability in progesterone metabolism may affect the relative levels of metabolites and, hence, the propensity for angiogenesis.",

Damage can be detected by greater penetration of red blood cells into the glycocalyx. We hypothesized that glycocalyx damage would be present in women with preeclampsia. METHODS: Women with preeclampsia (n=9) or a normotensive pregnancy (n=17) were examined prior to delivery. Red blood cells flowing through sublingual vessels were imaged using sidestream darkfield imaging. The width of the portion of the glycocalyx that was permeable to red blood cells (perfused boundary region) and the percentage of vessels that were filled with red blood cells were calculated by Glycocheck software. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed to examine the effects of preeclampsia after adjusting for vessel diameter. RESULTS: Glycocalyx health was worse in women with preeclampsia, when compared to normotensive pregnant women. The width of the perfused boundary region was greater in women with preeclampsia (2.48 vs. 2.29 microns, p=0.005), while the percentage of vessel segments that were filled with red blood cells was lower (55% vs. 60%, p=0.005).

The underlying pathophysiology involves maternal systemic vascular and endothelial dysfunction associated with circulating antiangiogenic factors, though the specific etiology of the disease remains elusive. Our objectives were to investigate the maternal endothelium in preeclampsia by exploring the expression of genes involved with endothelial function in a novel platform of maternal primary endothelial cells and to investigate whether soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) can mimic the preeclamptic phenotype. METHODS: Adipose tissue was sampled at the time of caesarean section from both normal and PE patients. Maternal microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) were isolated by tissue digestion and CD31 magnetic Dynabeads. Cell purity was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry for CD31 and von Willebrand factor detection. qPCR and Western analyses were used to determine relative gene and protein expression. RESULTS: Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence confirmed the isolated MVEC were homogeneous endothelial cell populations. Western analyses revealed vascular endothelial growth factor activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and ERK in primary MVEC. qPCR and western analyses were performed for 30 targets and revealed significantly altered mRNA levels of various genes involved with angiogenesis and blood pressure control in PE MVEC (including sFlt1, endoglin, VEGFR2, placental growth factor, endocan, angiotensin AT1 receptor, apelin, endothelin and its receptors and prostacyclin synthase) as compared to MVEC from normal pregnancies. MVEC from normal pregnancies were treated with sFlt1 and TNF\u03b1 to explore if they could mimic/create the PE phenotype. Treated MVEC exhibited altered gene expression compared to untreated cells, notably in sFlt1, prostacyclin synthase, AT1 receptor and endothelin. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we have successfully isolated endothelial cells from maternal tissue as a novel tool to investigate the pathophysiology of PE. MVEC from PE patients exhibit upregulation of vasoconstriction factors and downregulation of factors associated with vasodilatation, which likely contributes to hypertension and other manifestations of PE. Interestingly, the differences in gene expression persist in culture and may explain the long term endothelial dysfunction observed in patients with severe PE.",

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with TNF\u03b1 (0.1 -10 ng/ml) for 24hrs for mRNA isolation; in 96-well Matrigel coated plates for tube formation in presence of TNF\u03b1 (1ng/ ml) with or without ADM2 (10 -7 M); or in 16-well lab-tek chambers and treated with ADM2 for 2 min for proximity ligation assay (PLA). Tube lengths were quantified under phase contrast microscope in 4 random 4x power fields per well with Image J software. PLA was used to identify the associations between ADM2 and CRLR, and CRLR and RAMP2 in HUVECs. Expression of mRNA was assessed by real time PCR. RESULTS: 1) TNF\u03b1 decreases the expression of CRLR and RAMP2 in HUVECs (P<0.05), 2) TNF\u03b1 inhibits the tube formation and ADM2 reverses this effect of TNF-\u03b1 in HUVECs (P<0.05), 3) ADM2 interacts with CRLR in HUVEC cells, 4) Treatment with ADM2 (10 -7 M) increases cell surface association of ADM2 with CRLR and CRLR with RAMP2 in HUVECs. CONCLUSIONS: ADM2 supports endothelial cell functions via associating with its receptor components CRLR and RAMP2 and inhibiting the anti-angiogenic effect of TNF\u03b1 in endothelial cells.",

INTRODUCTION: Implantation is known to be a critical period for human preeclampsia (PE) pathogenesis. We have already established a new breed of PE model mouse using CD40L gene-transfection at implantation. Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin (sEng) are important humoral factors for the human PE pathogenesis. On the other hand, renin-angiotensin system is reportedly activated in PE. Angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1) is involved in the pathogenesis and the subtype 2 (AT2) can antagonize the effect of AT1. Then, we evaluated the effect of AT2 agonist (C21) on the humoral factors in PE model mouse. METHODS: Blastocysts collected from pregnant ICR mice were incubated with adenovirus including CD40L gene and transferred into the uterine horns of pseudopregnant ICR mice. An osmotic pump was placed subcutaneously on the dorsal side with C21 or saline. Blood pressure was measured using the tail cuff method and urine samples were collected using metabolism cage for measuring albumin concentration. On e17.5, uterus and placenta was retrieved from the mice and the weight was measured. Peripheral blood was collected by cardiopuncture. Plasma concentration of sFlt and sEng was measured using ELISA. RESULTS: In CD40L mice, blood pressure was significantly increased (125 \u00b1 1 mmHg vs. 108 \u00b1 4 mmHg) and the concentration of albuminuria was significantly increased (4135.01 \u00b1 724.69 mg/g vs. 1251.39 \u00b1 230.21 mg/g). The increase was improved by treatment with C21. The weight of neonates and placentas was increased by treatment with C21. Plasma concentration of sFlt and sEng was significantly increased in CD40L mice and decreased by treatment with C21. CONCLUSIONS: C21 had a favorable influence on the phenotype of PE model mouse suggesting, it is thought that AT1 and AT2 play a critical role on the pathogenesis of PE.",

University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PET) complicates 3% of pregnancies and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality (1). Placental Growth Factor (PlGF) has previously been reported to be highly sensitive diagnostic biomarker of PET in singleton pregnancies (2). Women with multiple pregnancy have a 2 to 3 fold increased risk for the development of PET (3). In multiple pregnancies there is a larger placental mass and normal reference ranges do not apply. The aim of this on-going study is to define reference values for PlGF in twin pregnancies. METHODS: This is a prospective cross sectional study of multiple pregnancies from 12 to 36+6 weeks' gestation. A 4ml EDTA blood sample is taken from women attending the multiple pregnancy clinic. Blood is centrifuged and plasma stored at -82 C. Maternal demographic and pregnancy outcome data is recorded. PlGF is assessed using the ALERE Triage platform. Mean values were calculated and plotted against gestational age at sampling. *Figure(s) will be available online. RESULTS: The mean PlGF value in those pregnancies affected by hypertensive complications was 46.6 pg/ml while the mean PlGF value in those not affected was 432pg/ml (p<0.05). Recruitment is ongoing and we aim to sample 150 women at multiple time points. CONCLUSIONS: PlGF concentrations are higher in twin pregnancies than in singletons. Low PlGF in a multiple pregnancy has a high correlation with adverse outcomes maternal hypertensive disorders and IUGR. ",

AJ Vaught, 1 E Gavriilaki, 2 N Hueppchen, 1 K Blakemore, 1 SM Seifert, 1 S York, 2 RA Brodsky. 2 1 JHUSOM, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2 JHUSOM, Baltimore, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: While the pathogenesis of HELLP syndrome is unclear, its clinical features suggest a link to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a disease of excessive alternative complement pathway (APC) activation. To test the hypothesis that these conditions are similar due to complement activation, we utilized a functional complement assay, the modified Ham test recently described for aHUS diagnosis. METHODS: Women (>23 weeks) with classic HELLP, atypical HELLP, preeclampsia with severe features, women with normal pregnancies and non-pregnant controls were recruited. Sera were collected and sent blinded to the laboratory. Furthermore, we tested the in vitro ability of eculizumab (ECU) to inhibit APC activation as it does in aHUS. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Student t-test and oneway ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction or nonparametric tests were used when appropriate. RESULTS: 14 women with classic or atypical HELLP, 7 women with severe preeclampsia, 11 pregnant controls, and 8 non pregnant controls provided sera. There was increased APC activation in the modified Ham test, represented as significantly higher percentage of non-viable cells/ cell death in classic and atypical HELLP compared to healthy pregnancies (34.3+24.6% and 26.0+14.8% versus 4.1\u00b17.3%, p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively), with no difference between healthy pregnant and non pregnant controls (4.1\u00b17.3% versus 3.3\u00b13.36%, p=0.100). Although there was no difference between classic HELLP and severe preeclampsia (34.3\u00b124.6% versus 13.0\u00b111.7% p=0.074) there is a trend towards less cell killing. In the ROC analysis, cell death above 20.5% was determined as the diagnostic threshold for classic or atypical HELLP with 78.6% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity. Mixing HELLP sera with ECU resulted in a significant decrease of cell death (p=0.007), suggesting successful complement inhibition similar to that in aHUS. CONCLUSIONS: HELLP can be considered a disease of excessive APC comparable to aHUS. The clinical implications of the proposed similarities in the underlying pathophysiology are significant, as aHUS management has progressed to a treatable condition via C5 monoclonal antibody inhibition. The modified Ham test is a promising tool to identify such pregnant women with HELLP characterized by upregulation in APC whom may benefit from complement inhibition. We aimed to determine the association of prepregnancy cardiovascular measures with the risk of fetal growth restriction in subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: 80 women underwent detailed cardiovascular assessment prior to planned pregnancy. Blood pressure was measured with continuous non-invasive tonometric radial artery monitoring. Plasma volume (PV) was determined using the Evans blue dye method. Cardiac output (CO), VO 2 max, body fat %, uterine blood flow (UBF), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and \u03b1and \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness were also examined. Birth outcomes were obtained via chart review. Small for gestational age (SGA) infants were defined as weighing less than the 10 th percentile for gestational age (GA) at delivery. Univariate and stepwise multivariate regressions were used to determine associations of cardiovascular variables with having an SGA infant in subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 30.8 \u00b1 4.3 years, with mean BMI of 25.5 \u00b1 6.0 kg/m 2 . 51 women (64%) were nulliparous at study entry. 29 (36%) had a history of preterm preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy. All pregnancies were singletons. Mean GA at delivery was 39.0 \u00b1 2.2 weeks with mean birth weight of 3253 \u00b1 666 g. 11 infants were SGA. In univariate analysis, lower PV corrected for BMI and higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) were associated with delivery of an SGA infant (p=.019, p<.001). Women with a history of preeclampsia were more likely to deliver an SGA infant (LR 3.97, p=.046). With multivariate stepwise regression, SGA was predicted by MAP (OR per mm Hg 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.24) and \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness (OR per mm Hg 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.995, p=.038). PV was no longer an independent contributor in the stepwise model. Prepregnancy CO, VO 2 max, body fat %, UBF, PWV and \u03b1-adrenergic responsiveness were not found to be independent contributors to SGA. CONCLUSIONS: We found that low prepregnancy plasma volume and decreased \u03b2-adrenergic responsiveness are associated with future risk of fetal growth restriction. This is mediated, in part, through effects on maternal blood pressure. This underscores the importance of maternal vascular health for placental perfusion and optimal fetal growth.",

Genetic testing was completed for 67% of patients. ECA were identified in 33% of cases. Detection rate of reflex-CMA and anticipated-CMA were significantly higher than G-banding (23% and 34% vs 14% respectively, p<0.001 for both).

CONCLUSIONS: Fetuses of Type I diabetic patients exhibited altered diabetes and obesity hormone profiles. Elevated glucagon concentrations may reflect rapidly fluctuating fetal blood glucose concentrations and a stress response. Insulin antagonizes the release of visfatin and the low concentrations noted in this cohort may reflect a mechanism for fetal lung immaturity in the newborns of diabetic patients.",

            "text": "How ). The distinction between fetuses who are truly growth restricted from those who aren't is essential. We investigated differences in clinical outcome between the two definitions. METHODS: From a large prospective cohort study we included live singleton births with data available on 2 nd trimester estimated fetal weight (EFW) and birth weight (n=7959). Fetuses were classified as growth restricted if the difference between 2 nd trimester EFW and birth weight was at least 40 percentiles. Fetuses born with a birth weight below the 10 th percentile were classified as SGA. As outcome measurements accelerated growth at 2 years (increase in weight of \u2265 0.67 SD) and cardiovascular health at 6 years were assessed. Ultrasound is a valuable, non-invasive tool used to monitor growth of the human fetus and diagnose pathologies such as intrauterine growth restriction. Murine models have emerged as a valuable tool for fetal and perinatal studies, as genetic and environmental manipulations are simple to perform. Development of a normal sonographic murine fetal growth pattern is necessary to determine abnormalities in mouse models of growth restriction. Our objective is to use non-invasive ultrasound methods to develop a standardized fetal viability and grow curve that allows for comparison and study of abnormal growth patterns. METHODS: Using high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS), we quantified embryonic and placental morphometry in pregnant C57/129 mice from embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5) through E18.5 using VisualSonics Vevo 2100 (MS550S transducer). Measurements included fetal biometry, placental volume and amniotic fluid index. Fetal size and placental weight were obtained to correlate the ultrasound measurements. RESULTS: On each gestational day a total of 12 dams were monitored with HFUS, with an average of 90-100 embryos examined per embryonic day. Measurements included non-pregnant endometrial thickness (ET), early pregnancy ET (E0.5-5.5), early implantation site volume (E6.5-9.5), cardiac activity (E9.5-18.5), umbilical cord flow (E10.5-18.5), crown-rump length (E10.5-14.5), placental volume, amniotic fluid, and abdominal circumference (E14.5-E18.5). Normal fetal growth patterns from implantation until parturition were defined and used as a standard to determine the presence/severity of abnormal murine fetal growth phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive ultrasound methods can be utilized to develop standardized fetal growth curves for comparison and study of murine fetal growth patterns. This permits accurate evaluation of abnormal physiological fetal and placental growth in murine models of disease. As murine models continue as a tool for human fetal and perinatal studies, identifying reliable and non-invasive methods of fetal growth measurements will allow for improved models of fetal growth pathologies.",

Traditional coupling detection techniques, like mutual information and synchrogram were carried out to define features for the coupling effect from different aspects. All features were integrated together to define a high dimensional index for each mother-fetus pair. Clustering algorithm like kernel K-mean was carried out to identify the pairs with high coupling effect. Gap statistics was applied to confirm if there is more than one cluster.

Jacquelyn Walejko, 1 Andrew Antolic, 2 Maureen Keller-Wood, 2 Arthur Edison. 3 1 Univ of FL, Gainesville, FL, USA; 2 Univ of FL, Gainesville, FL, USA; 3 Univ of GA, Athens, GA, USA. INTRODUCTION: During late gestation, the fetal heart relies primarily on glucose and lactate to support rapid growth and development. The Keller-Wood laboratory has shown in the ovine model that maternal elevations in cortisol lead to fetal mortality during the peripartum period. Hyperplasia of the fetal heart was observed in fetuses exposed to excess cortisol and transcriptomic analysis revealed alterations in fetal cardiac metabolism. Although it is known that the fetal heart undergoes a metabolic switch to utilizing fatty acids as a neonate, little else is known about metabolic changes of the heart during this period. Therefore, I proposed to utilize the sheep model of pregnancy to investigate metabolic differences of the fetal heart at labor onset compared to the neonatal heart immediately following birth. METHODS: 70 heart samples were collected from the left and right ventricles and intraventricular septum in 14 fetuses following labor onset and 10 neonatal lambs immediately following birth. HR-MAS proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR) spectroscopy was conducted on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer to gain metabolic profiles of heart samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine differences in metabolites between groups. Significance of metabolites was determined using a student's t-test of the area under the metabolite peak(s) of probabilistic quotient normalized spectra. RESULTS: PCA reveals separation of heart tissue samples between neonates and fetuses at labor onset. A t-test of normalized spectra revealed that lactate, glutamine, myo-inositol and alanine are significantly increased (p<0.05) in fetal heart tissue while 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) is significantly increased (p<0.05) in neonatal heart tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Elevations of lactate and myo-inositol (produced from glucose-6-phosphate), along with glutamine and alanine, suggest that glycolysis and gluconeogenic pathways are active in the term fetal heart. Increased levels of 3HB in the neonatal heart suggests that the onset of the switch in substrate utilization occurs during labor and delivery. This provides evidence that labor onset marks a time of rapid metabolic changes in the fetal heart, suggesting that perturbations in this metabolism may contribute to stillbirth during the peripartum period, or later life cardiomyopathies. . Several obstetrical events have been associated with HIE requiring HT. We aim to identify obstetrical characteristics associated with adverse outcomes (perinatal death or severe neurologic injury) compared with infants with normal outcome at pediatric follow up. METHODS: Using a neonatal database infants diagnosed with HIE that underwent HT from 2009 to 2014 were identified. We reviewed the cases with available pediatric follow up. Maternal characteristics associated with adverse outcomes were compared to those with normal neurologic outcome. Statistical analysis was done with t-test and chi-square. RESULTS: A total of 45 babies had HT for HIE, of these 32 had follow up after birth (6 months-5 years of age). 15 patients had adverse outcomes and 17 had normal neurologic outcome at pediatric follow up. Parity, gestational age, demographics and other maternal characteristics were similar between groups. Birth weight, cord pH and Apgar score at 10 minutes were also similar. Rates of hypertensive disorders and diabetes were not different. Obstetric events such as abruption, cord prolapse and non-reassuring fetal heart tones were not more frequently seen in either group. A composite data of acute sentinel events included abruption, cord prolapse, maternal cardio-respiratory arrest, and severe abdominal trauma was compared between groups. Although these events were seen more frequently in the group with severe injury, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, obstetrical characteristics of neonates with HIE treated with HT at our institution do not appear to be different in infants with normal or abnormal outcomes at pediatric follow up. However, we recognize the limitations of our sample size and our propensity for type 2 error. Further studies with larger sample size are warranted. INTRODUCTION: Triclosan (TCS: 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol) is a synthetic antibacterial compound that inhibits bacterial fatty acid (FA) synthesis by enoyl reductase. Although this enzyme is not expressed in humans, TCS has been linked to reduced fetal growth in humans and rodents. The structural similarity of TCS to estrogen has suggested it might disrupt estrogen signaling; however transcriptomic analysis of TCS actions in ovine fetal tissues indicated little overlap with the differential expression of genes by either estradiol (25 of 1313 DEG) or estrogen antagonist ICI181,782 (67 of 187 DEG).",

The data were analyzed with R with modeling in Webgestalt and Cytoscape. P<0.05 was accepted as significant with adjustment for multiple testing in the transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: In placenta, maternal TCS exposure for 2 days downregulated metabolic pathways, notably those involved in oxidoreductase activity, mitochondrial activity, and cholesterol (8 genes including the ratelimiting step HMG-COA), steroid (STAR, CYP17B12, CYP19A1) and prostaglandin synthesis (PTGS) and increased pathways associated with T cell activation and hemopoiesis. FA elongation enzyme genes were also reduced, as was FAT/CD36, which is a membrane transporter for PUFAs. Transcriptomics in the fetal hypothalamus indicated increased expression of both the orexigenic (AGRP and NPY) and anorexic (POMC) neuropeptides; this upregulation was validated using qPCR. Expression of other hypothalamic neurohormones or neuropeptides, were also increased: GHRH, GNRH, PRLH and somatostatin (SST) as was expression of genes associated with mitosis, cell cycle and ribosomes (53, 17, 30 DEG).",

Michal A Elovitz, Guillermo Barila, Michael Hester, Natalia Tulina, Amy G Brown. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Exposure to prenatal inflammation is associated with adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. We have previously demonstrated that low dose intrauterine inflammation leads to fetal brain injury (FBI). These studies tested the hypothesis that intrauterine inflammation alters the metabolomic profile in the fetal brain (FB) and amniotic fluid (AF) of exposed fetuses as mechanism by which FBI occurs. METHODS: Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (50 \u00b5g/dam,n=8) or saline (n=8) on E15. 6 & 48 hours post-injection, FB and AF were harvested. Samples were extracted and prepared for analyses using a standard extraction solvent method (Metabolon). Global biochemical profiles were determined using GC/MS and UPLC MS/MS. ANOVA was used to detect differences in biochemicals between the groups. Euclidean clustering, Principal Component Analyses, and Random Forrest plotting were performed. Levels of xanthine were assessed by an enzymatic assay to confirm findings from the metabolic profiling and to investigate if these changes persisted at 48 hours. RESULTS: A significant number of biochemicals in FB and AF were altered in LPS exposed fetuses ( Figure 1 ). *Figure(s) will be available online.",

Hypoxanthine and xanthine were 22-and 10-fold increased in the AF of LPS-exposed fetuses. ELISA confirmed the increase in xanthine in AF at 6 hrs and found that it persisted at 48 hours (P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to low dose intrauterine inflammation creates a catabolic state in the FB and a failure of appropriate energy utilization. These changes begin to ascribe mechanisms by which exposure to inflammation leads to FBI. These changes are evident in the AF and may provide new tools to predict fetuses at risk for FBI. (R01HD076032) INTRODUCTION: Impact of subclinical fetal inflammation on brain development remains unclear. In adults, vagus nerve mediates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and Vx raises the setpoint for inflammatory response to LPS, thus increasing production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages. We studied the function of vagus nerve in fetal neuroinflammation hypothesizing that fetal and adult CAP behave similarly. METHODS: Ovine fetuses were surgically instrumented with vascular catheters w/o or w/ Vx. Shams received NaCl and no Vx (n=10); controls received LPS (400 ng IV to the fetus) and no Vx (n=10); 4 fetuses were subjected to Vx followed by LPS. Brains were collected 54h post LPS. Iba1+ immunofluorescence intensity was quantified in 8 high power fields per animal using ImagePro in the following brain regions: convexial cortical grey matter layers 1-3, 4-6 (CGM46); thalamus; periventricular white matter (PVWM); hippocampal subregions CA1, CA234 and dentate gyrus. Next, we evaluated microglia cells of which size contribute to the Iba1 signal depending on the treatment: we set a cell size threshold at 36 uM 2 based on the empirical observation of a size at which a qualitative change in cell morphology occurred. RESULTS: LPS resulted in no change of Iba1+ signal (DOI: 10.3389/ fncel.2015.00294); Vx+LPS resulted in a surprising reduction of Iba1+ signal intensity in thalamus (p=0.05), PVWM (p=0.01) and CA234 (p=0.05). Notably, in CA1, CA234 and CGM46 number and length of dendrites were also decreased in the Vx+LPS group animals (p=0.001, p=0.02 and p=0.04, respectively). In CA1, fractal dimension was decreased (p=0.01). In all brain regions, this decrease of Iba1 signal due to Vx was entirely mediated by microglia with cell size smaller than 36 uM 2 . CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasize an important phenotypical feature of microglia that needs to be accounted for quantitatively: their morphometry. Unlike in adults, fetal microglia appear to down-regulate in response to withdrawal of cholinergic input despite the exposure to low-dose endotoxin. The function of cholinergic signalling in the developing brain, in particular in microglial cells as major players in the brain inflammatory response warrants further study.",

The objective of this study was to assess the differences in fetal brain activity pre and post-MgSO4 administration. METHODS: Eight women in spontaneous preterm labor were enrolled with gestational ages of 27-32 weeks. A baseline 30 min fetal magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording was obtained for each patient. A 4 gram MgSO4 bolus was administered via intravenous infusion followed by a second fetal recording of MEG about 60 min later. The MEG activity was quantified using spectral power analysis and the relative power was obtained in each of the frequency bands: delta (0.5-4Hz); theta (4-8Hz); alpha (8-13Hz)and beta (13-25Hz). The power in these frequency bands were compared for pre and post MgSO4 administration. RESULTS: Fetal MEG activity was successfully recorded in seven of the eight subjects. The maximum power (~ 1 pT/sqrt Hz) was observed in the lower frequency band. Figure 1 shows that the normalized relative power was concentrated in the delta band in both pre and post recordings.",

INTRODUCTION: Low-dose LPS triggers an increase in Iba1 intensity in the terminal ileum in near-term fetal sheep and that increase is correlated to a subset of HRV measures suggesting a potential to detect incipient gut inflammation non-invasively in utero using FHR monitoring to predict NEC. Here we address the questions 1) are these macrophages of M1 (pro-inflammatory, CD11c) or M2 (anti-inflammatory, CD206) phenotype; 2) does this exposure lead to increase in gut leakiness (occludin) and 3) do HRV measures correlate uniquely to gut's and not another organ's inflammation. We hypothesized that LPS will recruit M1, but not M2, macrophages and a gut M1 macrophages-specific subset of HRV measures will be identified.",

Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected with vehicle or T propionate (TP) (0.5 mg/kg/day from gestation day 15-19) to increase plasma T levels twofold, similar to that observed in clinical conditions like preeclampsia. In the offspring, at 6 months of age, mean arterial pressure was recorded using telemetry system; plasma levels of aldosterone, angiotensin-II and vasopressin levels were measured by ELISA; serum and urine Na + , K + levels were measured; small resistance arteries were isolated to determine vascular response to angiotensin II (in a wire myograph) and vasopressin and adrenals were used to determine expression of mRNA transcripts of steroidogenic genes. RESULTS: T exposure during prenatal life significantly increased arterial pressure in female adult offspring. Aldosterone levels were lower (70.27 \u00b1 10.22 vs 172.07\u00b123.87 pg/mL in controls) whereas plasma angiotensin II levels were higher in T females (1.05\u00b10.05 vs 0.65\u00b10.07 ng/mL in controls).

The mRNA levels of CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) was decreased in the adrenals of T females. Despite decrease in plasma aldosterone levels in T females, serum and urine Na + and K + levels were similar to that in controls. Vascular contractile response to vasopressin was unaffected but responses to angiotensin II in mesenteric arteries were enhanced in T offspring (logEC 50 = -9.04\u00b10.10; E max = 60.9\u00b16.93) compared with control (logEC 50 = -8.56\u00b10.08; E max = 33.3\u00b17.95).",

Junfei Li, 1,2 Shanshan Yang, 1,3 Dongbin Xie, 1,3 Geoffrey D Clarke, 2 Peter W Nathanielsz, 1,3 Cun Li. Mitochondrial respiration affects energy balance, and therefore weight gain and loss. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that mitochondrial respiration plays a role in the developmental programming of metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Virgin CD1 mice were fed either high fat diet (34.9% fat, HF group) or regular chow (5.8% fat, SF group) for 3 months before breeding. After weaning, pups in both groups were placed on a regular chow. At 6 months of age, tissues associated with metabolic function were collected (brown (BAT), subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissues, as well as liver and muscle) . Mitochondrial respiration was assessed using high-resolution respirometry. Total respiration (TR) and UCP1-dependent respiration (UCP1-R) were determined in adipose tissues, while ATP-producing respiration (ATPR) and respiratory control ratio (RCR) were calculated for liver and muscle. Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney test were used as appropriate (significance: P<0.05) RESULTS: TR and UCP1-R were significantly higher in BAT from HF males (P=0.005 and 0.02, respectively) and HF females (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively) when compared to SF. UCP1-R was significantly lower in SAT (P=0.04) from HF males and in VAT (P=0.04) from HF females. In HF males livers, ATPR and RCR was significantly higher (P=0.04 and 0.007, respectively), while in HF females both parameters were significantly lower (P=0.03 and 0.0001) when compared to SF groups ( Figure) . In muscle ATPR was significantly higher in HF males (P=0.02), no differences were determined in females. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a gender-specific role for altered mitochondrial respiration in developmental programming of metabolic syndrome. *Figure(s) will be available online. Human epidemiological studies have shown positive associations between urinary BPA levels and the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disease in adults. However, little is known about the effects of maternal exposure to BPA on offspring fatty acid metabolism or lipid synthesis pathways. Using a metabolomics approach, we determined the effects of maternal exposure to BPA during pregnancy and lactation on offspring plasma and liver fatty acid profiles, and on chain elongation pathways that promote energy storage. We hypothesized that maternal BPA alters offspring lipogenesis in favor of increased triglyceride synthesis. METHODS: Female rats had access to drinking water (control group) or drinking water containing BPA (5mg/L; BPA group) two weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Standardized litters were nursed by the same dam. At end of the nursing period (3 weeks), plasma and liver tissue were collected from male and female offspring for fatty acid extraction and analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS). GC/MS peaks were used to calculate the desaturation index (DI: oleate/stearate) and the elongation index (EI: stearate/palmitate). Protein abundance of the liver enzymes stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) and elongation of very long chain fatty acid-like family member 6 (ELOVL6) were determined by Western Blotting. Data were compared by Student's T-test. RESULTS: Compared with controls, female BPA offspring demonstrated increased plasma (33\u00b13 vs 14\u00b13 mg/dL; P<0.05) and liver (0.83\u00b10.05 vs 0.56\u00b10.04 mg/dL/mg tissue; P<0.05) triglycerides, along with an increased DI in plasma (0.44\u00b10.07 vs 0.22\u00b10.05; P<0.05) and an increased EI in liver (1.37\u00b10.07 vs 1.14\u00b10.05; P<0.05). In contrast, male BPA offspring did not exhibit any differences in triglyceride concentrations or fatty acid indices compared to controls. There were no differences in the liver protein abundance of SCD-1 or ELOVL6. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that maternal BPA has sex-specific effects on offspring liver fatty acid metabolism. Increased elongation and desaturation of fatty acids may promote energy storage in the form of increased triglyceride synthesis in female offspring exposed to BPA perinatally. (2011) INTRODUCTION: FGR is a risk factor for later adverse health outcomes including heart disease, diabetes, and neurodevelopmental disorders, with greater risk in those with postnatal catch-up growth. MNR in guinea pigs results in asymmetric FGR with less restriction in brain size than that of the liver as often observed in human FGR. We sought to determine whether MNR in guinea pigs leading to FGR results in neonatal catch-up growth and the extent to which it is organ-specific with implications for later life disease risk. METHODS: Guinea pig sows were fed ad libitum (Control=13) or 70% of the control diet pre-pregnancy, increased to 90% at mid-pregnancy (MNR=14). Animals continued on their respective diets until weaning at ~14 days postnatal when MNR sows/neonates were switched to the control diet. Birth weights and weekly neonatal weights were obtained on all liveborn offspring (Control=38, MNR=35). At 23-27 days, full necropsy was undertaken in representative appropriate for gestational age (AGA)-Control neonates (N=18) and FGR-MNR neonates (N=17) using birth weights of >95gm or <85gm, respectively, which ~ the 20 th and 10 th percentiles for the weight distribution of all Control fetuses. Data are presented as means\u00b1SEM. RESULTS: FGR-MNR neonates were 35% smaller at birth than the AGA-Control neonates, 71\u00b12 vs 110\u00b12 gm*, while at necropsy FGR-MNR neonates were only 15% smaller, 263\u00b110 vs 310\u00b17 gm*. FGR-MNR organ weights at necropsy were also smaller than that of the AGA-Controls, but less so for the brain -5%* and liver -10%*, similar for the kidneys -15%*, and greater for the heart -22%*, gonads -23%*, and pancreas -28%*. As such, organ/body weight ratios for the FGR-MNR neonates were increased for the brain 12%* and liver 7%*, unchanged for the kidneys, and decreased for the heart 8%, gonads 10%, and pancreas 12%*(*p<.05, nonpaired t test). CONCLUSIONS: MNR in guinea pigs leads to FGR offspring with catch-up growth in the early neonate period. Despite a degree of \"brain sparing\" the brain is still at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. The livers catch-up from those with FGR-MNR in utero which may increase glucose output and increase susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Conversely FGR-MNR neonatal hearts, pancreases and gonads, appear to have reduced growth which could increase vulnerability for later life disease.",

Placental insufficiency causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to reduced amino acid (AA), glucose and oxygen supply. These deficiencies decrease glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and lower beta-cell mass and pancreatic vascularity. We have shown that AA supplementation to IUGR fetuses increases GSIS, but improvements in pancreas morphology have not been tested. Our hypothesis was that chronically increasing fetal AA supply in experimental IUGR fetal sheep will increase islet size, beta-cell mass, and pancreatic vascularity. METHODS: Singleton, IUGR sheep fetuses were intravenously infused with a complete AA mixture (IUGR-AA, n=9) for 10\u00b11 days; targeted to increase fetal branched chain AA concentrations by ~50%. Fetal arterial oxygen, and plasma AA, insulin, glucose, glucagon, cortisol, norepinephrine (NE), and IGF-1 were measured.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a rat model of vitamin D-deficiency alters maternalpup interactions and affective, cognitive and social behaviors in the adult offspring. METHODS: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were placed on either a vitamin D control (2,195 IU/kg) or deficient (0 IU/kg) diet for five weeks prior to and during pregnancy and lactation. Offspring were subsequently weaned on to the control diet. Quality of maternal care (licking and grooming) was video monitored from postnatal days (PND) 3-8 and pup ultrasonic vocalizations recorded at PND12. At ~PND120 male offspring were run through a battery of behavioral tests to assess anxiety, depression and social-like behaviors as well as cognitive function. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency elicited poorer quality maternal care in comparison to controls with a 52% reduction (p<0.05) in licking and grooming of the pups at PND3. Pup ultrasonic vocalizations, which are crucial for maternal-pup interactions, were increased dramatically (3.5-fold, p<0.001) due to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency in early life caused no apparent alteration in adult anxiety or depressive-like behaviors while adult social-like behaviors (assessed by social interaction test) were impaired. While no differences in learning were apparent in the object recognition test, the more cognitively demanding object-inplace test revealed decreased discrimination in adult offspring exposed to vitamin D deficiency in early life in comparison to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal vitamin D deficiency profoundly alters rat maternal-pup interactions which, in conjunction with the well-known effects of vitamin D on neurodevelopment, alters future neuropsychiatric health outcomes. Indeed, vitamin D deficiency in early life resulted in altered social and impaired cognitive behaviors. This work highlights the importance of understanding adequate levels of maternal vitamin D for offspring neurodevelopment and later neuropsychiatric outcomes. INTRODUCTION: Current evidence suggest that prenatal exposure to a number of factors such as inflammation, valproic acid, oxidative stress, pollution or gestational diabetes increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Thyroid hormones are critical to neurodevelopment and many regulate many of the genes implicated in autism, however, the association of maternal hypothyroidism in pregnancy with autism is poorly understood. METHODS: Medical records from 594,638 women and their children who delivered at 14 KPSC hospitals between 1991 and 2013 were abstracted, of which 406,465 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria to form a retrospective cohort. Screening for hypothyroidism in pregnancy and autism in the offspring is standard in the KPSC system and the association of maternal hypothyroidism with development of ASD in the offspring was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Women diagnosed with hypothyroidism during pregnancy were at increased risk for having a child with ASD before and after adjusting for confounders, however, results did not reach statistical significance when the hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the 2 nd trimester. Stratified analyses revealed that hypothyroidism in pregnancy increased the risk of ASD for both boys and girls. However, diagnosis in only in the 3 rd trimester increased the risk for boys and diagnosis in the 1 st trimester increased the risk of ASD for girls. Timing of maternal hypothyroidism also showed significant heterogeneity by race with white and Asian offspring being at highest risk for ASD when hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the 3 rd trimester, other/multiple race children when hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the 1 st trimester, and Hispanic children when the hypothyroidism was diagnosed in the 2 nd trimester. No association between maternal hypothyroidism and development of ASD in the offspring was detected for African-Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism in pregnancy significantly increases the risk of ASD in the offspring. Timing of diagnosis in pregnancy also affects the risk for ASD in a gender and race-dependent manner.",

INTRODUCTION: FGR is a risk factor for developmental brain disorders including ADHD, schizophrenia and autism with risk directly proportional to the severity of FGR. Studies in FGR guinea pigs show brain morphology and neuronal connectivity are altered, but there is no information on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates as a potential screening test to predict which FGR newborns will develop adverse cognitive outcomes. We hypothesize that MRI will be able to identify developmental abnormalities in brain structure to predict the presence and extent of brain injury in FGR guinea pig offspring. METHODS: Guinea pig sows were fed ad libitum (Control) or 70% of the control diet pre-pregnancy, increasing to 90% at mid-pregnancy (MNR). Animals delivered near/at term with one male and/or female selected from each litter to undergo anatomical MRI at 21-25 days and necropsy 48hrs later for growth measures and brain morphology. Whole brain, hippocampal (HC), and lateral ventricle (LV) volumes were imaged using a 9.4T magnet and scored by manual segmentation or connected threshold grower tool on ImageJ. Significance was assumed for p<0.05. RESULTS: FGR-MNR neonates (N=17) were 35% smaller at birth than the appropriate for gestational age (AGA)-Control neonates (N=18), 71\u00b11.8 vs 110\u00b12.3gm; however, at necropsy FGR-MNR neonates were only 17% smaller. FGR-MNR brain weights at necropsy were 5% smaller than AGA-Control values as were MRI brain volumes with both of these measurements well correlated, r=0.6. FGR-MNR neonates showed a decrease in HC volume by 15% and LV volume by 33%, with both positively correlated to birth weight, r=0.5 and 0.36, respectively. As such, HC/brain volume ratios were decreased by 8% (p<0.01), while LV/brain volume ratios were decreased by 20% (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: MNR in guinea pigs leads to FGR neonates with rapid \"catch-up growth\", but brains continue to be smaller despite a degree of \"brain sparing\". These neonates have decreased HC/brain volume ratios on MRI indicating selective hippocampal vulnerability as a possible biomarker for later cognitive impairment. LV volumes were also variably decreased relative to brain volumes suggesting that other brain areas might be undergoing reactive increases in growth as additional markers for aberrant brain development in these FGR neonates.",

            "text": "Epigenetic In hypothalamic tissue (appetite regulatory site), SGA newborns exhibit an increase in appetite (AgRP; agouti-related protein) vs satiety (POMC; pro-opiomelanocortin) neuropeptides. In culture, SGA hypothalamic neural stem cells (NSCs) demonstrate reduced proliferation and neuronal differentiation, and consistent with tissue expression, the neuronal differentiation is preferentially biased towards AgRP versus POMC neurons. DNA methylation (DNA methyltransferase; DNMT1) regulates neurogenesis by maintaining NSC proliferation and suppressing premature differentiation. Once differentiation ensues, DNMT1 preferentially inhibits neuronal and promotes astroglial fate. We hypothesized that the programmed dysfunction of NSC proliferation and differentiation in SGA offspring is epigenetically mediated via DNMT1. METHODS: Control dams received ad libitum food, whereas study dams were 50% food-restricted from pregnancy day 10 to term to create SGA newborns. Primary hypothalamic NSCs from 1 day old SGA and Controls newborns were cultured in complete or differentiation media and transfected with nonspecific or DNMT1-specific siRNA (20 nM). At day 5 of siRNA transfection, NSC proliferation and protein expression of specific markers of NSC (nestin), neuroproliferative factor (Hes1), neurons (Tuj1) and astrocytes (GFAP) were determined. RESULTS: Under basal conditions, SGA NSCs exhibited decreased DNMT1 and reduced proliferation and neurogenesis, but increased GFAP, as compared to controls. DNMT1 siRNA markedly decreased protein expression of DNMT1, confirming silencing. In both SGA and controls in complete media, DNMT1 siRNA inhibited NPC proliferation (0.5-fold), consistent with reduced expression of nestin (0.5-fold) and Hes1 (0.4fold). In differentiation media, DNMT1 siRNA decreased expression of Tuj1 (0.6-fold) but increased GFAP (1.4-fold). CONCLUSIONS: In SGA newborns, impaired neurogenesis is epigenetically mediated via reduction in DNMT1 expression, via suppression of the neuroproliferative factor Hes1. Premature NSC differentiation to astrocytes limits neuronal differentiation, though with a preferential expression to appetite vs satiety neurons.

Endocannabinoids can act as substrates for enzymes of the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathways and can be utilized to generate other related compounds such as prostamides and prostanoids. The end products are indistinguishable by radioimmunoassay. Aim: To use mass spectrometry to identify unequivocally, products of endocannabinoid and eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways that are formed upon exposure to inflammatory stimuli, on human chorio-decidua. METHODS: Human chorio-decidual explants from term placentae (delivery by elective caesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion) were treated with either lipopolysaccharide derived from Escherichia coli (LPS; 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 \u00b5g/mL), interleukin 1beta (IL-1\u03b2;0, 0.1, 1, or 10 ng/mL) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1; 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ mL). The concentrations of eicosanoids (PGF2\u03b1-EA, PGE2-EA, PGF2\u03b1, PGE2, PGFM, AEA, 2-AG) generated by chorio-decidual explants (in explant culture media) were measured by LC-MS/MS in positive and negative modes.",

Statistical analyses: Statistical differences were determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. CONCLUSIONS: These findings create doubt about the interpretation of data on prostaglandin biosynthesis in intrauterine tissues from pregnant women especially in the presence of an infection. The possibility is raised that separation of these products might reduce variability in results and lead to potential uses for their measurement in the diagnosis of preterm labour. This study focussed on chorio-decidual productions of endocannabinoid and eicosanoid biosynthetic pathways further research is required to determine productions following treatments with the base substrates (e.g. arachidonic acid) and production by amniotic membranes. INTRODUCTION: Several studies have implicated increased levels of placental and decidual endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with the onset of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, disrupted placental morphogenesis and defective placenta invasion. The onset of term labor has also been associated with an increased ER stress response (ERSR) in the placental, decidual and uterine compartments. Preliminary data from our laboratory has shown that the pregnant uterus experiences and adapts to ER stress across gestation. Moreover, this demonstrates that modulating the uterine ERSR plays a critical role in regulating gestational length in a uterine myocyte caspase 3 (CASP3), dependent manner. However to date the function of placental and decidual ER stress remains undetermined. METHODS: Placental tissues were obtained from CD1 mice at gestation days (E) 8-19 and those undergoing an ER stress induced preterm birth at E17 as a result of administration of Tunicamycin (1.0mg/kg) (1). Cellular fractions were prepared and expression of ER stress markers BiP, CHOP and cleaved (CL) CASP3, the apoptotic markers CL PARP and mitochondrial cytochrome c (CYCS) release were assessed by Western blot. Immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL assays were also performed on OCT and 4% formaldehyde fixed placental tissues.",

In contrast CLCASP3 levels, which increased early-mid gestation, declined to undetectable levels as term approached. Indeed CASP3 activation in the placenta was found to be apoptotic in nature, and indicated by increased TUNEL activity, isolated to the trophoblast giant cells. However with the onset of preterm labor at E16.5 apoptotic cells in response to TM reappear in the decidual compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our preliminary data we propose that the spatial and temporal nature of the placental/decidual ERSR and CASP3 activation during pregnancy and preterm birth suggests that placental trophoblast and/or decidual cells may also have the capacity to secrete factors such as DAMPs that propagate an ER stress response in a local and a systemic manner. These data also demonstrate that the uterine and placental ERSR and CASP activation profiles are distinct and regulated independently of each other. ",

Vesicles were fluorescently labelled and injected into groups of 4-6 female CD1 mice via the tail vein. After 2 minutes, 30 minutes or 24 hours, fluorescence in the brain, thymus, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys was quantified using an IVIS Kinetic Imager at 605/640nm. Mesenteric resistance artery function was assessed using wire myography. Statistical significance was assessed by the Fisher Exact test and two-way ANOVA. A p value<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Placental micro-EVs were detected in the lungs, while nano-EVs were detected in the lungs, liver and kidneys two minutes post-injection (p=0.026). At 30 minutes, the distribution of nano-EVs was unchanged whereas, micro-EVs remained in the lungs but had also spread to the liver and kidneys. By 24 hours, micro-EVs remained only in the liver and kidneys while nano-EVs were cleared from the kidneys but remained in the lungs and liver (p=0.005). There was no significant effect of nano-EVs (either 30 minutes or 24 hour post-injection) on the ability of mesenteric arteries to vasoconstrict or undergo endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, in response to U46619, acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside respectively (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: While the existence of placental EVs has been known for over 120 years, the cells/organs that these EVs interact with in vivo are still unclear. For the first time, this study shows distinctive distribution patterns of placental micro-and nano-EVs in vivo. Preliminary work indicates that nano-EVs from normal placentae do not affect resistance artery function, at least in non-pregnant animals. HSD3\u03b21 is a key enzyme in the placental steroidogenesis. LIFR plays an important role in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. Initial invasion and plugging of uterine arteries by trophoblast cells generates hypoxic condition in the utero-placental unit with a pO 2 about 2%. As gestation advances unplugging of the uterine arteries increases blood flow and oxygen levels with a pO 2 about 8%. Pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes are known to be associated with chronic hypoxia. If variations in O 2 levels modulate the expression of HSD3\u03b21 and LIFR essential for steroidogenesis and trophoblast development respectively is not known. We hypothesized that priming with hypoxia followed by oxygenation alters the expression of HSD3\u03b21 and LIFR. We examined the role of O 2 on the expression of these genes using first trimester derived trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SV neo. METHODS: HTR-8/SV neo cells were cultured at ambient O 2 , 5% CO 2 in a humidified chamber for 48 hours to obtain 50% confluency in 6-well plates and divided in to two sets. One group of cells was allowed to grow at 2% or 8% O 2 levels for 48 and 72 hours. Other group of cells was allowed to grow at 2% O 2 for 24 hours followed by at 8% O 2 for an additional 48 and 72 hours.Cells were harvested and lysed for total RNA and proteins. Expression of HSD3\u03b21 and LIFR were assessed by qPCR and Western blot. All the experiments were done in triplicates. The student t-Test or one way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis and a p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Priming with hypoxia (2% O 2 ) followed by oxygenation (8% O 2 ) significantly downregulated the HSD3\u03b21 mRNA and protein expressions. Prolonged exposure (72h) to 2% and 8% O 2 or priming followed by prolonged oxygenation significantly downregulated HSD3\u03b21 mRNA whereas only prolonged hypoxia decreased HSD3\u03b21protein levels. Exposure to 8% O 2 or priming with hypoxia followed by oxygenation significantly upregulated the expression of LIFR mRNA and protein expressions. Prolonged oxygenation or priming with hypoxia followed by prolonged oxygenation significantly decreased the expression of LIFR mRNA and protein.",

In this study, we investigated the correlation between fractal dimension and clinical parameters in pregnancies with small for gestational age (SGA) fetuses.

PVSMC relaxation was significantly increased in cells treated with VD+losartan vs. losartan alone (p<0.05). VDR expression was increased in PVSMC treated with VD.

CONCLUSIONS: VD could reduce PVSMC contraction-induced by Ang II and potentiate relaxation effect mediated by losartan. Because MYPT1 is the major subunit involved in myosin light chain phosphatase in VSMC and also essential for vasodilation caused by NO, phosphorylation of MYPT1 Ser507 induced by losartan or VD could be a cellular mechanism of VD mediated PVSMC relaxation. (PNMS) is associated with reduced type 2 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid deshydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD2) and type 1 glucose transporter (GLUT1). Cortisol exerts its action by binding to glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GR-\u03b1) that acts as a transcription factor. The enzyme 11\u03b2-HSD2 protects the fetus from adverse cortisol levels from the mother by converting cortisol to inactive cortisone. This study aims to determine if the placenta mediates the effects of disaster-related PNMS (i.e., 2011 Queensland Flooding, Australia) on placental endocrine function. We hypothesize that: (i) Increased PNMS will be associated with lower placental 11\u03b2-HSD2 gene expression which will be moderated by fetal sex; and (ii) Increased PNMS will be associated with a lower placental index (fetal weight to placental weight) which will be moderated by placental 11\u03b2-HSD2, GLUT-1 and/or GR-\u03b1 gene expression.",

Placental villi (trophoblastic tissues) from 96 placentas were processed and samples flash frozen immediately after delivery. Gene expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR. Regression and moderation were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Results indicate that a higher level of subjective distress is associated with greater 11\u03b2-HSD2 gene expression in male fetuses and lower 11\u03b2-HSD2 gene expression in female fetuses (\u2206R 2 =0.074). Results also indicate that high levels of objective hardship coupled with high levels of 11\u03b2-HSD2 gene expression (R 2 =0.092), low levels of GLUT-1 gene expression (R 2 =0,126), or low levels of GR-\u03b1 gene expression (R 2 =0.117) is associated with higher placental index. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that disaster-related PNMS influences placental gene expression in a sex dependent manner. These changes in placental gene/protein expression demonstrate the different survival strategies of the feto-placental unit in case of PNMS depending on fetal sex. Decidual invasion usually is controlled by placental microenvironment, although invasive disorders might arise due to different causes. These pathologies have minimal data regarding biomarkers, treatment or their physiopathology, most of them resulting in high morbidity and mortality. One potential invasive-related molecule in the placental microenvironment is versican, which is a proteoglycan with four different isoforms, known to participate on healthy and neoplastic cells migration and invasion. Hence, it was aimed to disclose the expression and localization of versican in healthy and pathological placentas and associate to probable functions. METHODS: Samples from first trimester, premature and term placenta, as well as from placenta accreta, invasive mole, choriocarcinoma and preeclampsia were characterized and immunolocalized for versican with two different antibodies, one for total versican and other to V0/V1 isoforms. RT-PCR assay was performed to further isoforms expression within the different samples.",

The antibody for total versican presented similar patterns of staining, with the addition of myometrial and ECM positivity, as well as choriocarcinoma cells staining. RT-PCR confirmed the immunolocalization findings and added differential isoforms expression amid the studied pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: The versican V1 isoform localization only in invasive EVT cells from placenta accreta indicates a possible role on this pathology, representing the first report of a specific molecule expressed only during placenta accreta EVT invasion. Furthermore, versican V1 isoform could be used as specific biomarker for placenta accreta, which could help in predictive and final diagnosis, applied to all invasive grades of the disease. (TMIGD1) is a newly identified cell adhesion molecule that mediates cell-cell interactions, and is mainly expressed in the kidney and colon. In renal epithelial cells, TMIGD1 regulates cell proliferation and migration. TMIGD1 expression was also found to be downregulated in human colon tumors. Given previous evidence that placental invasion shares certain characteristics with the process of tumor metastasis, we elected to study the role of TMIGD1 during placentation. We hypothesize that TMIGD1 is expressed in trophoblast cells and regulates cell migration during placental invasion. METHODS: Placental samples were collected at the time of elective pregnancy terminations. TMIGD1 localization in trophoblast was visualized using immunofluorescence (IF). The immortalized trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo was cultured and processed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to detect TMIGD1 gene expression using GAPDH as an internal control. cDNA obtained through reverse transcription of RNA from kidney tubular epithelial cells served as an external control. We overexpressed TMIGD1 in HTR8/SVneo cells using a retroviral vector. RESULTS: TMIGD1 mRNA expression in HTR8/SVneo cells was 3.5% of that in kidney tubular epithelium, which expresses the highest TMIGD1 levels of all tissues tested. IF results showed TMIGD1 protein expression in trophoblast cells of first and second trimester placental tissue. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed for the first time that TMIGD1 is expressed in trophoblast cells and provide a basis for studying the potential role of TMIGD1 in cell migration. Our modified human trophoblast cell line overexpressing TMIGD1 may be used to investigate TMIGD1 effects on trophoblast activity.

These decidual NK (dNK) cells possess unique phenotypical and functional properties and are considered regulators of remodeling of the maternal fetal interface. Here we investigate if the dNK cells have the ability to \"remember\" pregnancy. METHODS: FACS analysis was performed on dNK cells for NK cell receptors, among other factors. We performed RNAseq analysis on the NKG2C+ dNK cells for various genes related to angiogenesis, immune modulation and growth factors production. For the most highly expressed genes, results were also validated by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Among the factors examined, we observed in particular expansion of NKG2C+ dNK population in parous women. dNK cells from parous women express NKG2C in significantly higher percentages as compared with NK cells from nulliparous women. In NKG2C+ cells we observed an upregulation of various genes related to angiogenesis, immune modulation and growth factors production, validated by real-time PCR. These results were independent of maternal CMV immunity status. CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time that dNK cells display a memory response and that this specific subpopulation of NK cells is expanded upon a second encounter with a semi-allogeneic fetus. This finding may give insight to the etiology of preeclampsia with increased risk in first pregnancy. The result of this process impacts not only placental defense against viral pathogens but also likely impacts implantation as well as the placenta's capacity to systemically regulate maternal physiology through direct interactions and the production of proteins and shedding of exosomes We have previously shown that tetraspanins regulate HIV-induced cellcell fusion, as ablation of CD9, CD81, and CD63 enhances the formation of multinucleate syncytium. Others have shown that trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cell lines express CD9 and CD81. Further, evidence exists suggesting that CD9 may regulate the expression of syncytin-1, which is implicated in cytotrophoblast fusion and is a membrane protein originating from the co-opted envelope gene of human endogenous retrovirus-W (HERV-W).",

CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes that the relative expression of C19MC miRNAs is regulated by the microenvironmental milieu in trophoblast cells and in exosomes released by these cells. We, therefore, hypothesize that in response to metabolic challenges, trophoblast cells specifically package C19MC miRNA into the exosomes they release. Maternal vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes including small-forgestational-age infants. Placental amino acid transport activity is pivotal for fetal growth and recent studies show that maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and vitamin D binding protein levels were positively associated with placental expression of certain amino acid transporter genes, suggesting that placental amino acid transport may be regulated by maternal vitamin D and vitamin D-binding protein. We hypothesized that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 increases the gene expression of amino acid transporters and stimulates placental amino acid transport activity in cultured primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells. METHODS: Term placental tissue was collected from healthy pregnant women undergoing elective Cesarean section. PHT cells were isolated and at 66 hour in culture, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 . At 90 hours of culture, System A and system L amino acid transport activities were assessed by measuring uptake of 14 C-methyl-aminoisobutyric acid and 3 H-leucine respectively. RNA was isolated from cell lysates and mRNA expression of system A and system L isoforms was determined by Q-PCR. Data are presented as mean + SEM. Statistical significance was determined either by Student's t-test or by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test. RESULTS: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 at 1.0 nM increased System A (+23%, P<0.001) and System L activity (+26%, P<0.05). Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 significantly increased SNAT2 mRNA expression, but not SNAT1 and SNAT4. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 did not influence the expression of LAT1 or LAT2 mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that physiological concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 promote amino acid transport in cultured PHT cells. Given that fetal growth is linked to amino acid availability, these observations implicate effects on placental amino acid transport as one possible mechanism underlying the association between maternal vitamin D status and fetal growth.",

Placental CPT1 was positively correlated with placental AC (total AC: R=0.52, P=0.03). Neonatal body fat was negatively correlated with AC of long-chain essential fatty acids in the placenta, linoleate (R= -0.51, P=0.03) and alpha-linolenate (R= -0.50, P=0.03), but was not related to AC in the cord blood. CONCLUSIONS: As fatty acid oxidation in the fetus is low, cord plasma AC likely reflect spillover from the placenta. Placental AC correlated positively with CPT1, reflecting the role of this mitochondrial enzyme in AC synthesis. Maternal obesity was associated with lower placental CPT1 and AC, suggesting that placental fatty acid oxidation is impaired in these women. Placental oxidation of long-chain essential fatty acids was low in neonates with high fat accrual. We propose that mitochondrial dysfunction impairs fatty acid oxidation in placentas of obese women, leading to high neonatal fat deposition. and early-onset preeclampsia. The ER plays a central role in synthesis and folding of secretory and membrane proteins. We demonstrated in a transgenic murine model with high basal protein synthesis that ER stress is induced specifically in the endocrine region of the placenta, and associated with FGR. As the mutation is present in the fetus as well as the placenta, we are unable to conclude whether the FGR outcome arose from placental ER stress. Therefore, a new transgenic model was generated in which ER stress is specifically activated in the junctional zone of the murine placenta. METHODS: Perk is one of three proximity sensors in the ER stress response pathway and on activation phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, attenuating protein translation upon stress. Spongiotrophoblast-specific Perk knockout (Sp-Perk-/-) animals were generated by crossing Tpbpa-Cre and Perk fl/fl mice. As the degree of ER stress is minimal in the placenta of Sp-Perk -/mice under normal conditions, hypoxia was used to exacerbate ER stress in the junctional zone. Mice were housed at 13% O 2 from E0.5 to E18.5in accordance with the UK Home Office Animals Act 1986. Animals were culled and placental and fetal weights measured. Placental tissue was snapfrozen for western blotting or fixed in either glutaraldehyde for electron microscopy or paraformaldehyde for lectin staining and stereology. RESULTS: Reduced eIF2a phosphorylation in the junctional zone confirmed successful knockout of Perk. Electron microscopy showed ER stress induced by the mutation was confined to the spongiotrophoblast. Lectin staining revealed accumulation of anomalous glycoproteins aggregates in the mutant junctional zone. Placental efficiency was reduced in the mutants (a heavier placenta without change in fetal weight). Stereological analysis revealed the junctional zone of the mutant was enlarged, suggesting a compensatory response. Finally, the incidence of embryonic loss was doubled in females carrying mutant litters. CONCLUSIONS: Perturbation of placental endocrine function diminishes placental efficiency. Although there was no change in fetal weight, the incidence of embryonic loss was enhanced indicating a potential adverse effect on fetal development.

INTRODUCTION: Chorioamnionitis (CA) increases the risk of the newborn to suffer from long term sequelae, including brain injury. CA is assumed to mostly arise from ascending genitourinary tract infections caused by pathogens such as group B streptococcus (GBS), one of the most common bacteria colonizing pregnant women. We previously showed a key role of interleukine (IL)-1 \u03b2 in the induction of CA in a rat model of maternal immune activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from E. coli. Since LPS and GBS share some toll-like receptor's signaling pathways, we hypothesized that IL-1\u03b2 is a key player in the development of GBS-induced CA. The goal of this study is to uncover the IL-1\u03b2 driven inflammatory mediators underlying GBS-induced CA. METHODS: Dams were injected intraperitoneally with inactivated GBS (10 9 CFU/100 \u00b5L/12 h, n=3-5) or sterile saline (control group, n=2-3) from gestational day 19 to 21. Cesareans were performed at different time points (from 1 h to 72 h) after the first injection to collect placentas, maternal blood, and fetal blood. To assess cells and molecules involved in inflammatory response to GBS, proteins titration (ELISA) and histological analysis (immunohistochemistry and cell count) were performed. The t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. Resveratrol is a nutritional supplement with antiinflammatory properties that may be useful for preventing inflammationmediated pregnancy complications. However, its effects on placental cytokine production are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of resveratrol on basal and bacteria-stimulated production on biomarkers with known or suspected roles in adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Placental explant cultures were established from women, not in labor, undergoing term elective Cesarean sections. Cultures were treated with 0, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 \u00b5M resveratrol in the presence or absence of 10 7 CFU/ml heat-killed E. coli overnight. Conditioned medium was harvested and concentrations of pro-(IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, HO-1, and sgp130) cytokines were quantified by immunoassay.",

CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol does not possess exclusively antiinflammatory or pro-inflammatory properties in our culture system and results are highly dose-dependent. These results suggest that resveratrol may have limited use for preventing adverse pregnancy associated with placental inflammation. Maternal malarial infection leads to poor perinatal outcomes including low birth weight from preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Primigravidas are more susceptible to these complications. In placental malaria (PM), Plasmodium falciparum infected red blood cells cause an inflammatory response in the placenta that may interfere with maternal-fetal interchange, leading to poor growth. In viral and bacterial infections, the type I interferon (IFN) pathway plays an immunomodulatory role, controlling the inflammatory response. However, its role in PM is unknown. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study to investigate the role of the type I IFN response in PM. We obtained 40 whole placental biopsies from a cohort of women delivering at Tororo District Hospital, Uganda, an area of high malaria endemicity with 40% prevalence of PM at the time of delivery. Quantitative PCR analysis was performed to explore the expression profile of genes in the anti-inflammatory type I (IFN-b, MX-1, and IL-10) and the proinflammatory type II (IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-6) IFN pathways. We also investigated the relationship between the expression of these cytokines and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 18 had PM and 22 were uninfected. We found a 4-fold increase in IFN-b and IL-10 expression in multigravidas with PM, when compared to gravidity-matched, uninfected controls. This effect was not observed in primigravidas. The expression of MX-1, IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-6 did not change. Linear regression analysis showed a positive association between IFN-b levels and higher birth weights (p=0.006). There was no association between the expression of these genes and gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: In PM, the type I IFN pathway is differentially regulated in primigravidas as compared to multigravidas. Upregulation of the type I IFN pathway in multigravidas suggested a gravidity-dependent anti-inflammatory response to infection. The association between IFN-b expression and higher birth weight implicated a protective role for type I IFNs in the pathogenesis of intrauterine growth restriction. (GBS) infection is one of the major causes of chorioamnionitis, which is associated with preterm births and perinatal brain injuries leading to cognitive impairments such as autism spectrum disorder. Our hypothesis is that end-gestational GBS infection of the dams has a deleterious neurodevelopmental impact on uninfected offspring through a maternofetal inflammatory response. Our goal was to study, with a rat model, the impact of maternal GBS infection on the placental and neurodevelopmental features in the offspring. METHODS: Dams were inoculated on gestational day (G)19 with live serotype Ia GBS (10 8 CFU). C-sections were performed at G21 and G22 to collect placentas, maternal and fetal blood. The maternofetal inflammatory response was studied by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Behavioral tests were performed from P7 to P40 to assess autistic-like behavior. Brains were collected at postnatal (P)40 for histological studies. Magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging were executed on young adult rats. RESULTS: GBS-infection of placentas resulted in sex dichotomic developmental impairments manifested as autistic-like behavior in males: impairments in communication, social interactions, and sensory integration. GBS-infected dams displayed chorioamnionitis characterized by a higher infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells in males. Increased titers of interleukine-1\u03b2 were detected in the maternal blood, the placentas, and in the male fetuses' blood following GBS infection. GBS-exposed males showed a reduced thickness of periventricular white matter. Trend toward a decreased mean fractional anisotropy, estimating alterations of white matter organization, was observed in the corpus callosum of GBS-exposed males. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to live GBS induces maternofetal immune activation resulting in neurodevelopmental and behavioral abnormalities recapitulating those of human ASD, including sex dichotomy and neurobehavioral phenotype. Placental inflammation and white matter injuries will be further characterized by ongoing studies. Little is known about the challenges that women experience while seeking care for their fibroids. The purpose of this study was to assess women's perceptions of the care they received during evaluation of their fibroids. METHODS: Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids were recruited from an academic medical center and the larger community. Women completed one-on-one, semi-structured interviews, a demographic survey and a health literacy assessment. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach and uploaded to NVivo for thematic coding. Three coders independently identified major themes and sub-themes. RESULTS: Sixty women completed the study. The mean age of participants was 43 \u00b1 6.8 years. 61.7% self-identified as Black, 25% as White, 8.3% as Hispanic and 5% as Asian. The kappa amongst coders was 0.94. Most of our study participants reported negative health care interactions during their fibroid evaluation. A minority of women (28%) reported a lack of pressure to obtain any treatment despite this being a cohort of women with symptomatic fibroids. Disparities in two major subthemes were identified: pressure to obtain surgery and poor interactions with medical providers. Of the women who reported pressure to obtain surgery, black women (72%) experienced disproportionately higher rates of pressure to obtain hysterectomies and perceived this pressure as negative. The majority of them sought second opinions, most were nulliparous, and all self-identified as single. Finally, black and Hispanic women (74%) reported higher rates of poor interactions with medical providers in comparison to 21% of white women. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of women reported negative health care experiences during their fibroid evaluation. Although women predominately expressed displeasure with feeling forced to pursue surgery, a significant minority also expressed displeasure with being encouraged to not pursue any treatment. The experiences of our study participants highlight the critical role of physician-patient shared decision making during medical evaluation. Our findings support the need for initiatives that foster trust between physicians and patients and research aimed at understanding the health seeking behaviors of women with fibroids.",

Most early phase analgesic trials, however, only investigate men and increasingly employ sensitive measures of the pain experience such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain. Here we used fMRI to investigate whether the cerebral response to pain depends on the sex of the participants and hormonal status of female volunteers. METHODS: Non-hormone using, pain-free subjects were recruited (12 women; 14 men). 3T fMRI brain scans were performed using noxious thermal stimulation of the left arm, individually calibrated to a pain intensity of 5/10. Blood was drawn post-scan and batch analysed for a steroid hormone profile. Women underwent 3 scans, on days 1-2, 10-12, 20-22 of their menstrual cycle (order randomized); men had a single scan. Data from the women were subdivided dependent on their hormonal state at the time of the scan: low estradiol, low progesterone (LELP); high estradiol, low progesterone (HELP); high estradiol, high progesterone (HEHP). Men were compared to women in each state. Data were analysed with FSL (FMRIB Software Library) using a general linear modeling approach, thresholded at Z>2.3, p<0.05.

Comparing men to HEHP women greater activation was seen in the insula, caudate, putamen and inferior frontal gyrus of men and in the left amygdala and hippocampus of women. CONCLUSIONS: Despite no difference in noxious input, sex differences in the affective component of pain (unpleasantness) and the cerebral response were seen when estradiol and progesterone were either both low or both high. These findings suggest that central mechanisms generating the experience of pain differ dependent on hormonal state. To optimize the identification of effective analgesics for women, we propose that early stage clinical trials include women, particularly those in a low estradiol low progesterone state.

METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey of US women was conducted in the US. All women completed a prevalence screener; women who reported EM diagnosis or EM-related symptoms were eligible to complete the full survey. This analysis focused on HRQL (measured by EHP-30; a disease specific instrument that assess five domains of HRQL) among women who reported EM diagnosis aged 18-49. Women who had uterine fibroids or hysterectomy were excluded. Univariate comparisons were completed using T-tests and multivariate regression was used to assess the differential impact of EM symptoms on HRQL. All analyses were weighted to be nationally representative. Endometriosis affects 10% of women of reproductive age and often goes undiagnosed for years. We sought to develop noninvasive biomarkers of endometriosis to aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of the disease. miRNAs (non-coding RNAs of ~22 nucleotides in length) are candidates for non-invasive diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. We have previously identified several miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Here we use a mouse model to identify members of the let-7 miRNA family that may serve as serum biomarkers of endometriosis. METHODS: Murine experimental endometriosis was surgically induced in C57/Bl6 mice, while controls received sham surgery. Total RNA was extracted from the serum of endometriosis (n=17) and sham (n=11) mice and evaluated for relative expression of let-7a,b,c,d, e, f and g via RT-qPCR. miR-23a was measured as an internal control.

The identification of let-7 family miRNAs as serum biomarkers in both humans and the mouse model described here indicates that this group of miRNAs has as high potential as clinical biomarkers of endometriosis.

Furthermore, we study the effect of Substance P (SP) on NK cells in various human ex vivo models, as this neuropeptide is elevated in EM and involved in pain perception. Finally, we study the link between NK cells and inflammatory pain in various experimental models including an endometrial explant model using multicolour flow cytometry, CyTOF, and multiparametric analysis of soluble pain-associated mediators. RESULTS: Our preliminary results indicate that unique NK cells are present in PF of women with EM and that blockade of checkpoint inhibitory receptors allows such NK cells to clear autologous endometrial stromal cells ex vivo. Furthermore, elevated numbers of activated NK cells are found in the PF of experimental models of inflammatory pain. Human NK cells express SP receptors and SP stimulation enhances NK cell cytotoxicity against certain target cells, but has a marginal effect on cytokine release. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that a better understanding of the various phenotypes and functions of NK cells in endometriosis associated pain will help to identify new therapeutic strategies to treat not only endometriosis itself, but also to reveal new targets/pathways addressing pain and novel means to enhance pregnancy success. Endometriosis is a non-malignant disorder which affects 10-15% of women and is associated with debilitating pelvic pain and impaired fertility. Progesterone (P) resistance is commonly observed in women with endometriosis. Expression of PR particularly PR-B is significantly lower in the ectopic endometrium in patients with endometriosis due to hypermethylation of the PR-B promoter. We have previously reported that mice overexpressing the intracellular domain of Notch1 (N1ICD) display impaired Pgr expression due to hypermethylation of exon1 of the Pgr gene, which is mediated by the complex of Notch1 target transcriptional factor PU.1 and Dnmt3b. METHODS: IHC and qPCR were used to detect the expression level of members of the Notch signaling pathway in endometriotic and endometrial tissue of women and baboons with or without disease. Endometrial Epithelial Cells (EEC) were used for in vitro determination of mechanisms. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza) was used to inhibit DNA methyltransferase activation. RESULTS: Expression of NOTCH1 and JAG2, but not other Notch receptors or ligands, are significantly increased in the ectopic lesions compared to the eutopic endometrium in both women and baboons with endometriosis. The increase was most evident on the epithelium. Expression of PU.1 was also increased in endometriotic tissues in same set of samples. Expression levels of PU.1 and NOTCH1 were significantly correlated (R=0.9353, p<0.0001). Overexpression of N1ICD in EEC cells results in a decrease of PR-B and an increase in PU.1 which correlates with the decrease in PR-B expression in endometriotic tissues as a consequence of hyper-methylation. Furthermore, inhibition of methylation by 5-Aza treatment in N1ICD overexpressing cells reversed the suppression of PR-B expression but had no effect on PU.1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: NOTCH1 and its ligand JAG2 are significantly upregulated in endometriotic lesions, specifically in epithelial cells which is associated with an increase in PU.1 expression. We propose that the N1ICD regulated increase in PU.1 expression enriches the recruitment of DNMT3B on the PGR promoter, resulting in a decrease in PR-B expression which may contribute to P-resistance in endometriosis.

The use of LCM allowed a proper and reproducible separation of target cell populations as indicated by the evidence of cell type-specific hypermethylation (transcriptional silencing) of stromal cell markers in the epithelial cell fraction and vice versa. We are currently expanding our systematic methylation profiling in these distinct cell populations, collected from patients with endometriosis and control individuals, and will present resulting data. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are expected to improve our knowledge about the pathogenesis of endometriosis and may contribute to the identification of new therapeutic targets or potential biomarkers for early stage diagnosis in endometriosis. There is emerging evidence that interactions between MCs and nerves may play a role in activation of pain pathways in women with endometriosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the phenotype of tissue resident peritoneal MCs in women with chronic pelvic pain with and without endometriosis. METHODS: Tissue biopsies (endometriotic lesions and peritoneum) and peritoneal fluid (PF) were collected from 20 women attending a pelvic pain clinic (n=10 with endometriosis and n=10 with no obvious underlying pathology). Concentrations of tryptase, chymase and histamine in PF were measured by ELISA. The phenotype of the MCs was investigated by immunofluorescent colocalization of tryptase and chymase. RESULTS: Histamine, tryptase and chymase were detected in PF and MCs were identified on cytospins. Concentrations of histamine were higher in women with pain without endometriosis and concentrations of chymase were higher in women with stage II/IV endometriosis. MCs were present in both the peritoneum and in endometriotic lesions of women with and without endometriosis, and appeared highly activated. The predominant protease in MCs in these tissue sites was chymase (MCs were immunonegative for typtase); chymase staining was detected inside and surrounding MCs. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed the presence of numerous chymase positive MCs in the peritoneal wall of women suffering from pelvic pain irrespective of a diagnosis of endometriosis. MC-derived proteases were readily detected in PF. This study highlights a potential role for MCs in activation of nerves and suggests inhibitors of chymase could offer potential as a therapy for chronic pelvic pain.

It is associated with moderate to severe pelvic and abdominal pain symptoms, subfertility and a marked reduction in health-related quality of life. In many endometriosis patients relevant co-morbidity with affective disorders like depression or anxiety are described. It is well known that these conditions have a worsening effect on pain perception on chronic pain patients and might explain the strong negative impact on quality of life observed in endometriosis-pain patients. In the last decades CNS research provided for identification and development of drugs for treatment of affective disorders various robust animal models. Whereas several studies are demonstrating biological and histopathological similarities of endometriosis rodent models with the human situation, the behavioral characterization of these models was never performed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the anxiety/depression-related behaviors in an endometriosis mouse model.",

An increased percentage of time spent in the closed arm in the EPM and an increased latency to take up food in the NEIFS in comparison to sham operated control animals are indicative of an increased anxiety in mice with endometriosis. No effects were observed on locomotion or pain assays either in sham or endometriosis animals. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, an increase in anxiety-like behaviors was observed in a mouse model of endometriosis, suggesting that the presence of endometriosis lesions in the abdominal cavity could, similarly to patients, induce profound psychopathological changes/impairments in mice. These readouts might provide additional tools for preclinical identification of mechanisms relevant for development of endometriosis related symptoms. has recently identified 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with endometriosis. Seven of the identified variants, distributed in six loci, are located in or near (within 50 kb) the following genes: WNT4, GREB1, FN1, ID4, CDKN2B-AS1 (that is part of a locus comprising CDKN2A and CDKN2B) and VEZT. The aim of our study was to investigate potential differences in endometrial RNA expression of target genes residing in loci found to be associated with endometriosis through GWA studies. METHODS: Eutopic endometrial samples from 12 endometriosis patients and 11 controls were collected, excluding subjects under estroprogestins. Samples were dissected and cultured for 5 days to obtain only stromal cell-derived RNA. Gene expression analysis was perfomed by Nanostring nCounter System that allows to quantify the exact number of RNA copies without any additional step of reverse transcription or amplification. Sixteen different transcripts from genes located near the identified SNPs were analyzed in each sample at the same time.",

When compared to patient-matched myometrium, placebo-treated leiomyomas demonstrated elevated expression of highly expressed contractile proteins, while ulipristal-treated leiomyomas demonstrated decreased expression of these contractile proteins. The alterations identified by RNAseq were confirmed by qRT-PCR to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Immortalized human leiomyoma cultures treated with ulipristal were used for further confirmation, both by quantitative RT-PCR and by western blot to confirm that alterations in template translated to altered protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Ulipristal alters intracellular contractile smooth muscle protein expression, decreasing the excessive production of these components. These findings provide further insight into the mechanism of leiomyoma development, as the extracellular and intracellular environment share aberrant characteristics. In addition, improvement with ulipristal suggests that the alterations are regulated by a common pathway.",

Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids or leiomyoma affect millions of reproductive age women worldwide. We and others have recently found that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for uterine fibroids. Additionally, reduced or loss of vitamin D receptor (VDR) protein expression was observed in uterine fibroids as compared to normal myometrium. However, a direct role of VDR in uterine fibroid development is yet to be determined. The objective is to study the role of VDR in the regulation of human uterine smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro. METHODS: VDR gene expression was knocked down in immortalized human uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMC) using a lentivirus-based VDR-gene-specific RNA interference (RNAi) strategy. Lentiviruses harboring VDR-specific short shRNA sequences or non-functional scrambled control shRNA, generated in human embryonic kidney cells (293T), were used to infect UtSMC cells. Infected cells were selected with 0.5 \u00b5g/ml puromycin and then resistant cell populations were further characterized. RESULTS: Western blot analysis showed that VDR knockdown cells expressed markedly reduced levels of VDR (approximately 60% reduction) as compared to scrambled control cells. VDR knockdown cells concurrently expressed higher levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1), and progesterone receptors (PR-A and PR-B) as compared to scrambled control cells. Similarly, VDR knockdown cells showed induced levels of TGF\u03b2RII while compared with scrambled control cells. The levels of phospho-Smad2 and Smad2 were also induced in VDR knockdown cells. VDR knockdown cells also showed increased levels of extracellular matrix production of fibronectin and collagen type 1, as well as elevated levels of cell growth-related proliferating cells nuclear antigen (PCNA). Furthermore, VDR knockdown cells showed higher levels of proliferation when compared with scrambled control cells. These findings suggest that silencing VDR expression in myometrial smooth muscle cells elicits a fibrotic process including an increase in myometrial cell proliferation, induction of sex steroid receptors, activation of TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling, and promotion of ECM production. CONCLUSIONS: VDR may play an important role in maintaining the normal uterine smooth muscle cell phenotype, and thus destruction of this gene expression (by silencing) induces the proliferation of human uterine smooth muscle cells. Support: Georgia Regents University (GRU) startup package, and NIH/NICHD R01 HD046228. . Urine, feces, whole blood, and plasma were collected at intervals up to 21 days post-dose for determination of mass balance, pharmacokinetic evaluation of vilaprisan, and metabolite profiling. Total radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Vilaprisan plasma concentrations and metabolite profiling of plasma, urine, and feces were assessed by chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods. Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), laboratory parameters and vital signs (including electrocardiography and blood pressure). RESULTS: Vilaprisan was rapidly absorbed, reaching a mean maximum plasma concentration of 24.9 \u00b5g/L at 1-2 hours post-dose. The geometric mean terminal half-life was 31.6 hours. In total, 86.6% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces in the 21 days after dosing. After day 17, less than 0.1% of the total administered radioactivity dose was excreted in urine and feces per day, indicating excretion was almost complete. Excretion mainly occurred via feces (73.5% \u00b1 3.70 of administered dose); 13.1% \u00b1 1.70 was excreted via urine. Based on geometric mean area under the plasma concentration time curve, 28.0% of [ 14 C]-vilaprisan-associated total radioactivity in plasma was attributed to unchanged vilaprisan and 72.0% to its metabolites. The most frequent drug-related AEs were headache (50.0%) and constipation (33.3%); no clinically relevant treatment-related changes in laboratory values or vital signs were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Vilaprisan was rapidly absorbed after oral administration in women; 28.0% of total radioactivity in plasma was associated with unchanged compound. Excretion, predominantly via the fecal route, was largely complete after 17 days. INTRODUCTION: S100A8 is a calcium binding protein present in the circulation. Its concentration is increased during inflammation and/or infection. Early pregnancy loss and recurrent miscarriage in spontaneous conceptions have been associated with elevated S100A8 levels. We evaluated the potential of S100A8 as a predictive biomarker of IVF outcome prior to cycle initiation. METHODS: Sera from 139 women who underwent an IVF cycle -27 with a term delivery, 20 with a preterm birth, 22 with a biochemical pregnancy, 30 with a spontaneous abortion, 32 who did not become pregnant and 30 with an ectopic pregnancy -were retrospectively assayed for S100A8 and other mediators of inflammation by ELISA. Patient selection was random and solely based on the availability of sera obtained prior to cycle initiation. Associations between outcome and S100A8 level were analyzed by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests.",

The human uterus is a dynamic organ of the female reproductive tract that is extensively remodeled in response to the ovarian steroid hormones; estrogen and progesterone. Limitations to current model systems attenuate progress to understanding mechanisms associated with these changes. Tissue explants are complex and short-lived in culture while rodent models have limited translatability to the human condition. The goal of this study was to create a novel 3D model of the human endometrium that will lead to a better understanding of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. METHODS: Uterine tissues from hysterectomy cases were subjected to an increasing concentration (0.01% -0.1%) of SDS at 4 0 C over the course of 72 hours followed by another 24 hours in 1% Triton x 100 to decellularize the tissue. DNase1 and RNase were used to further digest nuclear contents and the scaffolds were extensively rinsed in PBS. For recellularization, endometrial cells were obtained by collagenase digestion of endometrial tissue and further expanded on 2D plates in DMEM/F12 containing 10%FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Expanded cells were seeded onto the decellularized scaffolds in a transwell insert and allowed to reconstitute over time.

            "text": "Stromal Endometrial dysfunction has been documented in polycystic ovarian syndrome and obesity. It is unclear if these changes are due to insulin resistance (IR), unopposed estrogen or both. In vitro studies have shown that insulin can interfere with decidualization in response to estrogen and progesterone. However, the endometrial impact of IR in vivo has not been well studied. We hypothesize that gene expression in the endometrium may be altered in women with evidence of IR or glucose intolerance. METHODS: Endometrial receptivity was examined in a hormone replacement cycle with oral estrogen & vaginal progesterone. Endometrial biopsy was performed day 6 of progesterone and sent for analysis using the endometrial receptivity array (ERA\u00ae). Insulin resistance (IR) was defined as fasting insulin > 9.0 mIU/L, fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL, HgA1c > 5.6%, or HOMA-IR > 2.4. The ERA is a customized array of 238 genes shown to be associated with endometrial receptivity. The ERA provides an assessment of the endometrium as \"receptive\" or \"non-receptive\" using a computational predictor. The frequency of non-receptive endometrium in IR patients was compared to women with normal metabolic testing using chi square. RESULTS: 67 infertile women completed endometrial sampling with a median age of 37.1 years in both groups. During the establishment of pregnancy, the endometrium undergoes dynamic remodelling in order to establish a 'receptive' microenvironment. Decidualization, a key part of this process, is characterised by differentiation of endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESF) which secrete factors that regulate implantation and placental development. We recently discovered that during decidualization ESF synthesise androgens which modulate the expression of endometrial receptivity and decidualization markers. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is abundant in the circulation and can act as a precursor to bioactive androgens but whether changes in the bioavailability of DHEA can affect endometrial function is not known. Circulating concentrations of DHEA decline precipitously with age which may contribute to reduced fertility in older women. Utilisation of circulating DHEA within target tissues requires local action of the enzyme 3\u03b2HSD which we have previously reported is expressed in ESF. We hypothesised that modulating the bioavailability of DHEA could alter local tissue androgen concentrations and impact on decidualization and endometrial receptivity. METHODS: Primary human endometrial stromal cells were isolated from endometrial biopsies collected from women during the proliferative phase of the cycle (n=18). In vitro decidualization was induced by treatment with progesterone and cAMP; some cells were co-treated with a physiological dose of DHEA (10nM) or with the 3\u03b2HSD inhibitor Trilostane. The expression of decidualization markers and putative androgen-regulated receptivity genes was assessed by qPCR and ELISA. RESULTS: Inhibition of 3\u03b2HSD by Trilostane significantly reduced secretion of the decidualization marker IGFBP-1 (p<0.001) and expression of the receptivity marker osteopontin (SPP1; p<0.01). Addition of DHEA to decidualised ESF increased testosterone biosynthesis (p<0.001) and was associated with increased expression of IGFBP1 and SPP1 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that changes in the bioavailability of DHEA impact on the expression of decidualization and endometrial receptivity markers. These findings suggest a previously unrecognised role for tissue androgen bioavailability in the regulation of the endometrium which may impact on the establishment of pregnancy in women. Menstruation, an inflammatory process characterised by tissue breakdown and bleeding, is triggered by falling progesterone (P 4 ) concentrations. Resolution of inflammation post-menses is critical to appropriate endometrial repair. We hypothesise this is partly mediated by the local action of glucocorticoids and will be reflected in altered expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target genes. Here we test this hypothesis in a mouse model of induced menstruation and subsequent endometrial repair. METHODS: Ovariectomised C57Bl/6 mice underwent induced menstruation, with P 4 withdrawal effecting menstrual-like endometrial changes. RNA was extracted from uteri (n=24) at 0h, 8h, 16h and 24h after P 4 withdrawal. Differential mRNA levels of 84 known GR target genes were investigated using a customised PCR array. Data were normalised to 6 housekeeping controls and analysed by 2-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons tests to 0h samples. Differentially-expressed mRNAs were validated by qPCR in larger time-point cohorts (n=36).",

FKBP51 immunoreactivity was decreased 8h and 24h after P 4 withdrawal in C57Bl/6 mice relative to 0h, and was decreased in Hsd11b1 -/mice at 8h and 24h relative to C57Bl/6 controls at the same time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased FKBP51 expression is consistent with reduced glucocorticoid action, which, while expected in Hsd11b1 -/mice, is surprising in early menstrual remodelling (24h) in C57Bl/6 controls. Whilst these data provide evidence for glucocorticoid-mediated mRNA changes during endometrial remodelling at menses, further work is warranted to elucidate the relationship. The correct acquisition of the endometrial receptive status is a key factor limiting the success of assisted reproductive technologies. The aim of this study was to identify the differential protein expression patterns of endometrial receptivity using the iTRAQ technology comparing three different models: receptive endometrium from fertile donors, refractory endometrium induced by the presence of an intrauterine device (IUD), and patients with recurrent implantation failure (RIF). METHODS: Human endometrial samples (n=28) were collected from fertile donors (n=10), IUD carriers (n=10), and RIF patients with at least 3 previous IVF failures (n=8) at the same day during the window of implantation (WOI) (Hormonal Replacement Therapy; P+5). Protein identification and quantification were performed using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification analysis (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometry (MS). Statistical analyses were carried using an ANOVA and T-test (pairwise comparisons) analyses. Validation by Western blot (WB) was performed for the plastin 2 (PLSL) and ribosomal protein S4, X-linked (RS4X) proteins. RESULTS: iTRAQ analysis identified 1,873 differentially expressed proteins among the three conditions. ANOVA analysis revealed 188 significant proteins, while t-test showed 133 statistically significant proteins between control vs. IUD endometria. RIF vs. IUD comparison revealed 158 significant proteins and 54 differentially expressed were shared between the two comparisons. Surprisingly, no differential expressed protein was found between control vs. RIF groups. Validation by WB for PLSL and RS4X confirmed our iTRAQ results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrate a clear differential proteomic profile between receptive endometria compared with IUD endometria, showing the key proteins to achieve the endometrial receptivity status. No proteomic differences were detected between RIF patients and fertile donors, suggesting that the endometrium in RIF is not pathologic by itself, reinforcing the hypothesis of a WOI displacement. Previous studies have reported the successful in vitro secondary follicle growth (IVFG) of rhesus monkey ovaries using low dose FSH (0.3 or 3 ng/mL) and long-term culture (up to 5 weeks). However, it is still uncertain in regard to the optimal culture duration and effective dose of treated gonadotropins applicable to the IVFG of rhesus pre-antral follicles. Recently, we have reported that FSH to LH ratios affect the in vitro growth of murine ovarian follicles. We aimed to investigate whether gonadotropin ratios affect the efficiency of rhesus follicular growth in vitro. METHODS: Ovaries were collected from six necropsied rhesus macaques (4-9 years) and pre-antral follicles were retrieved and cultured for 14 days using 200 mIU/mL FSH.

Succinate dehydrogenase subunit-D (SDHD) is part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that plays a role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and leads to the stabilization of HIF-1\u03b1. Here we studied the effect of miR-210 on the expression of SDHD and other hypoxia related genes in primary human granulosa cells (hGLC). METHODS: Primary hGLC were isolated from follicular fluid aspirates collected during IVF cycle. Cells were transfected with either synthetic miR 210 precursors or specific inhibitor. 72 hours post transfection the mRNA expression levels of several hypoxia induced genes (EDN-2, VEGF, SDHD and GPD1L) were assayed using real time PCR with the specific primers under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. RESULTS: Hypoxia increased (up to 4 folds) endogenous miR-210 levels in time-dependent manner. Elevated miR-210 correlated with stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 protein. The dependency of miR-210 expression on HIF-1\u03b1 protein was proven by the successful knockdown (90% less then scrambled siRNA) of HIF-1\u03b1. These siRNA molecules significantly reduced miR-210 down to undetectable levels in hypoxic conditions. miR-210 overexpression (700 fold increase compared to controls) significantly augmented EDN-2 and VEGF mRNA in SVOG and EDN-2 in hGLC. A mirror image response was observed with miR-210 inhibition. Transfection of hGLC with miR-210 inhibitor reduced its levels 50 folds and the mRNA levels of EDN-2. We found that miR-210 overexpression suppresses SDHD, while the antagoMir elevated its mRNA levels in both SVOG and hGLC, suggesting that SDHD is indeed a target of miR-210 in hGLCs.",

RESULTS: No significant changes in CD83 expression in B-and T-cells from Thymus, Inguinal-or Paraaortal lymph nodes were observed.

However, the highest percentage of CD83 positive splenic B-cells as well as their subtypes (Marginal and Follicular Zone B cells) was observed at the end of pregnancy (day 18). Remarkably, lymphocytes from day 18 of pregnancy showed a significantly higher release of sCD83 after in-vitro stimulation with LPS, PMA and Ionomycin compared to non-pregnant mice. Additionally, stimulated B cells from day 18 of pregnancy revealed the strongest upregulation of the membrane-bound form of CD83.

Olivia J Heidecke, Damian O Muzzio, Anne Tungler, Katrin RH Packhauser, Carolin Weinhold, Marek Zygmunt. Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany. INTRODUCTION: Since gender differences in susceptibility to bacterial infections in newborns have been previously described, gender-specific hormonal modulation of the immune response was postulated. hCG, an early pregnancy hormone produced by the syncytiotrophoblastand a potent immune-modulator was shown to be differently expressed in male and female pregnancies. Therefore, we hypothesised that hCG might be responsible for these differences. METHODS: Cord blood samples from 21 male and 18 female newborns were used in the initial study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and stained for multiple extra-and intracellular markers. The relative numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations were measured by flow cytometry and analysed by FlowJo software. Isolated cord blood PBMCs also were cultivated for 48h either with or in the absence of hCG and/or LPS. Different activation marker of immune cells were examined by ELISA. RESULTS: B-and T-cell populations of newborn males and females were subjected to initial comparison whereby significant gender differences were found in follicular T-helper cells, hematopoietic stem cells and B1-cells. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is not only rooted on estrogen dependence for growth, but also maintained by local and systemic inflammation. It is well established that endometriosis patients have higher proinflammatory cytokines in peritoneal fluid and aberrantly behaving macrophages, dendritic and NK cells isolated from lesions and peripheral blood. Research indicates that disturbed immune regulation in patients fails to mount a proper immune response to self-tissue in the peritoneal cavity. Here, we profiled 594 immune-related genes in endometrium (eutopic) and endometriosis (ectopic) samples from patients and compared it to normal endometrium to identify gene-signatures unique to endometriosis. METHODS: Matched eutopic and ectopic tissue from endometriosis patients (n=8), and normal endometrium from control women (n=8) were obtained at Greenville Hospital and University of North Carolina (USA) respectively. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was isolated. After normalizing to 100ng/sample, the nCounter GX Human Immunology Kit (Nanostring) was used to profile 594 immunerelated genes.",

We found that genes associated with T cell activation, cell adhesion, inflammation, and complement activation including IL18R1, IL18, SELL, PTGER4, ICAM1, and C7 were significantly increased in ectopic tissue compared to eutopic and normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analyses indicate that ectopic lesions display unique profile of genes that regulate inflammation and immunity compared to matched eutopic and normal samples. Unique gene expression is also observed in eutopic endometrium compared to normal endometrium samples. Further analyses are needed to understand the intricate relationship between genes that will uniquely identify endometriosis as a disease.

However, chronodisruption was negatively associated with the # of excess embryos cryopreserved (3.7\u00b13.1 vs. 2.3\u00b11.5, p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chronodisruption may negatively impact IVF outcomes as evidenced by fewer excess embryos cryopreserved among women defined as chronodisrupted in this study. The impact of longstanding chronodisruption on pregnancy outcomes is unknown, but having fewer excess embryos to cryopreserve can impact cumulative pregnancy rates with IVF. live birth. The highest pregnancy rates were in the control group followed by the tubal, and ovulatory respectively, while the unexplained group failed to become pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: The serum E2 level was within normal follicular phase for normal unstimulated women, while the FF level was 6 times serum level, but differs between the control and infertile group, where the control had a higher response than infertile one. The ovulatory group response to ovarian stimulation was the highest. The high P level in the infertile group may indicate an increased activity of LH before ovulation that may hinder IVF Success. The control group had the lowest level and a better response. The unexplained group responded better than tubal or ovulatory groups. This study confirms the presence of special mechanisms concentrating the steroid hormones, which might work within the granulosa cells, and that hormone levels differ based on the etiology of infertility with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Inadequate receptivity of the endometrium is a major cause of unexplained infertility and implantation failure. Microarrays has been widely used to determine the genes involved in uterine receptivity generating a wide gene lists with known and unknown potential roles in this critical process. Recently, novel biomarkers, which were not previously linked to endometrial physiology, have been identified using RNA-Seq approach. METHODS: In order to investigate their potential role in endometrial receptivity we evaluated OVGP1, MRAP2, ZCCHC12, and HAP1 gene expression in human endometrial biopsies (EB) from patients undergoing IVF treatment using real-time PCR analysis. GAPDH and Actin B were used as housekeeping genes. All patients had a history of regular menstrual cycles and did not receive any hormonal preparation in the 3 months prior to the IVF cycle. Women with endometrial pathology or with any hormonal alteration were not included. EB were collected on the day 21 of the cycle preceding ovarian stimulation from women with unexplained fertility (study group n=4) and women with male infertility (control group n 4). RESULTS: Interestingly, a significant increased expression of MRAP2 was found in women with unexplained infertility when compared to the control group (fold change >1.4 and p value <0.005). CONCLUSIONS: MRAP2 encodes for a small transmembrane protein that modulates melanocortin receptors signaling reduced receptors responsiveness to alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone. Among these receptors MC5R is expressed in uterus and its interaction with its binding hormone results in immune-mediated inflammation modulation, thus reducing NF-Kb activation and inhibiting the antigen stimulated lymphocytes proliferation. Our preliminary finding of the overexpression of MRAP2, resulting in a reduced response of MC5R and therefore in a reduced anti-inflammatory activity of melanocortin system, suggests an involvement of this system in impaired endometrial receptivity of women with unexplained infertility. Moreover, this methodology is usually associated to serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels, which in fact reflects the amount of small antral follicles (2-8mm). Therefore, some papers tried to evaluate the efficacy of both 2-D and 3-D technologies regarding antral follicle count. However, none utilized an appropriated study design and also did not compared both 2 and 3-D to AMH.",

All patients were evaluated using the same ultra-sound equipment (Voluson, General electric, USA) and performed by the same investigator (PF) using SonoAVC for 3-D AFC. Furthermore, all patients were submitted to 2-D AFC using the same ultrasound machine in the same day (day-3 of regular cycle), only follicles from 2 to 8mm were considered for AFC. Serum AMH was collected also during day-3 and using a DSL Gen II kit. The potential immunological effect of GnRH and its analogues has been studied. We aim to investigate the effect of GnRH analogues to peripheral blood lymphocytes. METHODS: PBMCs were treated with different doses of GnRH agonist (Buserelin acetate) and antagonist (Cetrorelix acetate) of 0.1, 1, 5 and 10\u00b5M for 4 hour culture. TH1, TH2 and TH17 cell levels were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results were compared between GnRH agonist and antagonist, among different doses. And the effect of GnRH agonist were compared according to IVF histories (Group I;women who underwent IVF-ET cycles within 6 months, Group II;women who underwent FET cycles within 6 months, Group III;women who had no IVF-ET or FET cycles within 6 months). RESULTS: TNF-a/IL-10 TH cell ratios were significantly increased in PBMCs treated with 1, 5 and 10 \u00b5M GnRH agonist for 4 hour culture when compared to controls (p=0.006, 0.014 and 0.030). GnRH antagonist increased IFN-g/IL-10 TH cell ratios as compared with controls (p=0.005). TH17 cell levels in PBMCs treated with 1 and 5 \u00b5M were significantly lower than those of 10 \u00b5M GnRH antagonist . When the effects of GnRH-agonist and -antagonist were compared, TNF-a, IFN-g and IL-10 producing TH cell levels, and IFN-g/IL-10 TH cell ratios were significantly different. When the effect of GnRH agonist in 4 hour culture were compared according to patients' IVF histories, TNF-a producing TH cell levels were different between those of Group II and those of Group III (p=0.008). TH17 cell levels were significantly different among the Groups (p=.000), those of Group I were significantly lower than those of Group II and III. CONCLUSIONS: GnRH analogues led to pro-inflammatory changes in T helper cell subpopulations. The pro-inflammatory effect was different between GnRH agonist and antagonist.

The incidence of associated factors did not differ between nulliparous (n=77) and multiparous (n=67) women. Reproductive outcomes were similar, independent of chronological age and parity. A third of women successfully conceived and achieved a live birth. 17% of couples next conception ended in another pregnancy loss. Surprisingly, the major outcome was not another pregnancy loss, but an inability to conceive in almost 50% of couples (Table 1) . CONCLUSIONS: RPL may not be a distinct clinical diagnosis, but a continuum, sometimes prematurely, of progressively decreased fecundity and DOR resulting in increased aneuploidy, pregnancy loss and ultimately an inability to conceive. The prognosis of RPL is often optimistic, provided conception occurs. AMH assessment is important in evaluation, diagnosis and counseling in RPL. In the adjusted continuous analysis, there was no association between repeat length and development of good quality blastocyst, or reaching blastocyst transfer. Furthermore, cycles with low-low repeats showed no difference in good quality blastocyst development, achieving blastocyst transfer, vitrification of excess embryos, or live birth, relative to cycles associated with normal-normal repeat numbers (table 1) .

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of FP in women with DOCK8, GATA2, and PI3K related immunodeficiencies performed through a multidisciplinary approach without infectious complications.

Support: Intramural NIH We hypothesize that resistance to PARP inhibition is linked to OvCA CSC function. Our objective was to analyze the effect of PARP inhibition on the OvCa CSC population. METHODS: OVCAR4 and CaOV4 cell lines and cell lines derived from primary human serous carcinomas obtained with IRB approval were treated in vitro with olaparib. The CSC phenotype was then assessed 72 hours post treatment by flow cytometric analysis of CD133, CD44 and CD117 marker expression, RT-PCR analysis of stemness gene expression, extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA) to determine sphere formation frequency and cell cycle analysis and PKH26 staining to evaluate proliferation and viability. RESULTS: Treatment with olaparib increased CD133 and CD117 expression relative to expression in untreated cells (p <0.001) and similarly led to upregulation of genes involved in stem cell function (Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2) and multidrug efflux (ABCG2). ELDA revealed an increase in the frequency of sphere formation following olaparib treatment relative to that observed with vehicle treated cells. An increase in CSC number was observed following olaparib treatment with no effect on the viability of non-CSCs. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a mechanism associated with PARP inhibitor resistance in OvCa and highlight the possibility that inhibition of PARP will lead to increased CSC proliferation and subsequent tumor resurgence.

In order to estimate the strength of current evidence and existence of potential biases in the literature, we performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses studying the association between obesity and gynaecological cancer incidence and mortality. METHODS: After systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database, 12 publications containing altogether 47 metaanalyses of incidence or mortality from breast, cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer were eligible for analysis. For each meta-analysis, we: calculated both fixed and random effect summary estimates; 95% prediction intervals (PI) for the random effects estimates; used the Cochran Q test and the I2 metric of inconsistency with 95% CI to asses heterogeneity; used the Egger's test and an estimate of a theoretical study of infinite sample size by extrapolating the Egger's regression line to study small study effect; tested for excess significance by comparing the number of studies that had the power to have significant results to the number of studies that showed significant results RESULTS: In 18 of the 47 meta-analyses obesity or weight gain showed strong association (P<0.001) in both fixed and random effects models. Most studied associations, however, showed hints of significant heterogeneity, excess significance, small study effects, or the 95% PI did not exclude the null value. Only 2 meta-analyses, between excess weight gain and increased incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer, met all these criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Most summary meta-analytic estimates showed nominally significant results (p<0.05) for the association between obesity and the risk of developing gynaecological cancer. Only two associations, however, had highly significant results and no hints of biases. These results underline the substantial uncertainty around nominally significant associations, but do not necessarily mean that only these two associations are true. The large observed heterogeneity and biases in many of the included studies do, however, suggest that some of these observed associations could well be inflated or false positives.

Cells were cultured in a pretreated 24 well plate containing inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, with a modified embryonic stem cell medium. Separately, freshly isolated cells were transduced overnight using a GFP lentiviral vector(MOI:50) in a cytokine cocktail with or without rapamycin, and then cultured as above. Cells were analyzed after 7 days in culture using flow cytometry, PCR array or differentiated in a semi solid medium. RESULTS: All freshly isolated progenitors were positive for hematopoietic stem cell markers (CD117,Sca1,CD45,n=6). After 7 days in culture there was an average 5.1-6.2 fold increase in the progenitor numbers with no difference between the groups, (p=0.64,ANOVA). Their multipotency was maintained. Transduction efficiency was significantly higher in FL and AF progenitors using cytokines alone compared to cytokines and rapamycin (37.4%vs 9%,p<0.05); there was no difference in transduction efficiency in the adult BM progenitors(p=0.36). All semi solid cultures had hematopoietic colonies from the three hematopoietic lineages. PCR array analysis of each group demonstrated up-regulated hematopoietic genes compared to control fresh FL progenitors(n=3 in each array group,p<0.05). Transduction did not affect cell proliferation, multipotency nor hematopoietic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Culturing fetal and adult hematopoietic stem cells with and without gene transfer in embryonic stem cell conditions maintains a high expansion fold, multipotency and allows efficient gene transfer. This is a promising approach for autologous stem cell/gene therapy in utero and postnatally.",

In human placenta, this function is provided by a unique, multinucleated lineage called syncytiotrophoblast.

This is accomplished by an underlying progenitor population of cytotrophoblast cells that stop propagating, and fuse into the overlying syncytiotrophoblast. Exactly how cytotrophoblast cells leave their progenitor state and commence cell fusion is not well understood.",

METHODS: Expression of OVOL1 was analyzed in human placenta at four gestational ages (6, 8, 12, and 39 weeks) by a combination of RT-PCR and two-plex in situ hybridization. Analysis of in vitro trophoblast differentiation was conducted in BeWo trophoblast cells stimulated with 8-bromo cyclic adenosine monophosphate, human embryonic stem cells treated with bone morphogenetic protein 4, and primary cytotrophoblast cells. To modulate OVOL1 expression, lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs that target OVOL1 were used. RESULTS: OVOL1 expression was identified in a defined subset of cytotrophoblast cells in human placenta. When trophoblast cells were exposed to differentiation conditions, OVOL1 was robustly induced in several models of human trophoblast differentiation. Disruption of OVOL1 inhibited the capacity of trophoblast cells to differentiate. OVOL1 expression inversely correlated with expression of MYC, ID1, TP63, and ASCL2, which are factors associated with maintenance of cytotrophoblast progenitor traits, and specifically bound to hexametric sequences (CCGTTA) upstream of each of MYC, ID1, TP63, and ASCL2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal an important function of OVOL1 as a regulator of genes that maintain cytotrophoblast progenitor traits. This work was supported by NIH HD020676 and HD079850. ",

However the majority of mTert-GFP + cells in the endometrium were CD45 + leukocytes (0.36 \u00b1 0.07% of total cells in the stromal compartment by microscopy). mTert-GFP + epithelial cells and leukocytes were depleted in the absence of ovarian hormones, however non-leukocytic (CD45 -) mTert-GFP + cells in the stromal compartment were maintained. The CD45 -mTert-GFP + population is largely composed of cells expressing the endothelial markers CD31 and von Willebrand factor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the endometrial epithelium and vasculature are foci of stem/progenitor activity and provide a system to investigate molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial regeneration and repair. We also note that measures of total endometrial telomerase activity are likely to reflect immune cell infiltration rather than telomerase activity due to much rarer progenitor populations. Eight percent of childhood cancer survivors will undergo premature menopause by age 40. An intervention to restore normal hormonal and even reproductive function to women who have suffered chemotherapy induced ovarian failure would be a tremendous step in treating these patients. The aims of this study were to establish and validate a mouse model of chemotherapy induced ovarian failure and to test the ability of murine granulosa cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (mGriPSCs) to serve as a treatment to preserve hormonal function. METHODS: Baseline serum estrogen (E2) levels were measured from five week old female nude mice by ELISA (Day 0). Two weeks later, mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with either sterile PBS (n=5) or a mixture of busulfan (12 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) (n=10). Repeat serum E2 levels were measured on Day 28 and Day 42. On Day 52, mice in the chemotherapy arm were injected into the mammary fat pad with either PBS (n=3), unsorted embryonic bodies (n=3), or sorted mGriPSCs (n=3). Estrogen levels were measured again 3 weeks later. Mice were then euthanized, and the ovaries were examined histologically. RESULTS: By day 28, chemotherapy treated mice had an accelerated drop in estrogen production compared to untreated controls (75% decrease vs. 47% decrease, p=0.004). By day 63, estrogen levels were undetectable in mice treated with chemotherapy followed by unsorted embryonic bodies or PBS, and the ovaries showed reduced follicle numbers. In contrast, mice injected with mGriPSCs had serum estrogen levels and ovaries comparable to age-matched mice that had not seen chemotherapy. Due to the advance of uterine transplantation, bioengineering could provide a solution for patients with severe uterine factor infertility. To bioengineer organs we could build them up from scratch using biomaterials or replace the cells of the organs to avoid rejection using the technique of decellularization(DC) and recellularization(RC). The aim of this study is to investigate two different protocols of DC assessing the viability of the remaining biological uterine scaffolds for RC. METHODS: Two DC assays based on fresh or freeze/thawed (n=3) pig uteri using chemical and/or physical agents were compared. To determine the efficiency of both protocols H&E and DAPI staining, DNA quantification and fragment size by electrophoresis were used. The integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture was assessed by Masson's Trichrome, Alcian blue, TEM, SEM and IF for col-I, col-IV, fibronectin, elastin and laminin. Quantification of these 5 proteins were performed by WB. The integrity of the 3D vascular tree was assessed with a corrosion casting assay using resin. RC experiments were done using human endometrium SP cell lines in the scaffold material generated by both protocols. RESULTS: Both protocols successfully achieved efficient DC assessed by histological analysis that revealed the absence of cellular components, and no visible staining of cellular DNA. The original amount of DNA dropped to 9.06% and 2.65% for the fresh and freeze/thaw protocol, respectively. ECM showed a retention of the signal for GAGs and collagens in both protocols, which was further corroborated by the IF results. There was a decrease in total protein amount to 3.19% and 1.09%, respectively. After assessment of the ultrastructure (TEM and SEM), and the general morphology we concluded that the fresh protocol produced a more uniform scaffold. Further studies concerning recellularization and the integrity of the 3D vascular tree are still being performed CONCLUSIONS: We have established a robust protocol for the successful DC of the pig uterus. The resulting scaffold material created by the fresh protocol is useful for subsequent recellularization. ",

RESULTS: Of 32 women interviewed, 17 have migrated for work. 25 were currently married. Of those, 19 women were using no contraceptive method, 2 were using highly effective methods, 1 was currently pregnant. The remainder of women were using either a lower efficacy, or a traditional contraceptive method. More than half reported having at least one abortion as a method of contraception. Women's narratives reveal low contraceptive knowledge and utilization, high healthcare illiteracy, and struggles with fertility and family planning. CONCLUSIONS: To date, little is known about family planning needs of the Tajik migrant population, or how labor migration changes family planning and reproductive health needs of women in the region. Given the large number of Tajik migrants, this will serve to build intervention strategies and improve access to reproductive healthcare, which can further be applied to other migrant populations around the world.

CONCLUSIONS: While physicians working on a night float call system were significantly more likely to have patients with a prior cesarean undergo TOLAC and achieve VBAC, their patients also were also more likely to experience maternal and neonatal morbidity. Chronic fetal hypoxemia is a common pregnancy complication that is associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and respiratory distress syndrome at birth, the extent of which likely depends on the duration, severity and timing of the hypoxic insult. Here, we compared effects on molecular pathways regulating lung maturation following fetal exposure to chronic hypoxemia throughout gestation in the placentally restricted (PR) fetus (early hypoxemia) versus maternal chronic hypoxia (MCH) for the last third of gestation (late hypoxemia). METHODS: Control (C, n=11) and PR (n=8; induced by carunclectomy) sheep fetuses were evaluated at 133d gestation (term ~145d) in cohort 1 (early hypoxemia). In cohort 2, pregnant sheep were exposed to normoxia (N, n=8) or MCH (n=7; 10% O 2 ) from 105-138d gestation and fetuses were studied at 138d (late hypoxemia). Fetal lung expression of genes regulating hypoxia signalling, oxidative stress, lung liquid reabsorption and surfactant maturation were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are the normalised mRNA expression ratio (Log2 fold change) from respective control for each cohort. RESULTS: Early and late hypoxemia promoted similar IUGR (Fig. 1) . While early hypoxemia decreased the fold change expression of genes regulating surfactant maturation, late hypoxia increased the fold change expression of genes regulating hypoxia signalling, antioxidants, lung liquid reabsorption and surfactant maturation (Fig. 1) .",

METHODS: Women who required manual placental removal following vaginal delivery from 9/1/2005 to 10/31/2008 (pre-protocol) and from 11/1/2008 to 6/1/2014 (post-protocol) were identified. Women who had a cesarean delivery, multiple gestations, or delivery prior to 24 weeks gestation were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between the two epochs. Rates of manual removal of the placenta pre-protocol were compared those post-protocol. RESULTS: There were a total of 70,619 vaginal deliveries over the study period. Of these, 265 (0.38%) had a retained placenta. There were no differences between the pre-and post-protocol groups in maternal age ( In adjusted analyses at <20 weeks, higher LP concentrations and large particle size were associated with lower odds of PTB (LDL-total, HDLlarge, LDL-large) and SPTB (LDL-large). At 24-29 weeks, high VLDL concentrations and large particle size were associated with lower odds of PTB and SPTB; high HDL concentrations and medium particle size were associated with higher odds of PTB. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Women with PTB have different LP profiles in early pregnancy and mid-gestation compared to those delivering at term. These differences can be further refined by NMR, suggesting particle size is a component of LP characterization in assessing risk for prematurity. . Early diagnosis of women at high-risk of subsequent PTB would facilitate targeted, personalised monitoring and treatment strategies. Assessment of cervical length by ultrasound sonography can be used to triage patients into PTB risk categories but is expensive, time consuming and lacks the discriminatory power to be used for low risk population screening. Metabolic phenotyping of easily accessible biofluids such as urine may allow objective biochemical classification of pathophysiological states associated with PTB risk. METHODS: 1 H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to profile urine samples collected longitudinally at three different time points of gestation (12, 16, and 20 weeks) from women who experienced uncomplicated, term delivery (n=138) or preterm delivery (n=23). Cervical length was measured using transvaginal ultrasound at each time of collection. Spectra were analysed using a combination of multivariate modelling approaches including Knowledge Discovery by Accuracy Maximization (KODAMA) and partial least squares (PLS). Metabolites were identified and quantified by in-house software. RESULTS: Identification and quantitation of >60 urinary metabolites were performed across the patient cohort. Using KODAMA three distinct urine metabolic phenotypes were identified *Figure(s) will be available online. , one of which exhibited a significantly higher risk of subsequent PTB (P<0.05, Wald test). Using supervised modelling, urine metabolic signatures predictive of cervical shortening could also be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic profiling of urine collected in the early 2 nd trimester permits stratification of patients at risk of cervical shortening and preterm birth. Early identification of high-risk patients would permit improved patient triaging and facilitate personalised treatment approaches. Despite life-saving benefits on fetal lung maturation, there is concern that antenatal glucocorticoid therapy (AGT) may have adverse side-effects on fetal growth and the developing cardiovascular system. However, most of these studies including our own have been in animal models of control pregnancy, leaving a paucity of information on possible adverse effects of AGT in animal models of complicated pregnancy (de Vries et al. JCI 117:1058 , 2007 Herrera et al. PLoS ONE 5:e.9250, 2010) . Chronic fetal hypoxia is a common consequence of complicated pregnancy, and therefore will affect many fetuses who receive AGT. Here, we investigated effects on fetal growth and cardiac function of human clinically-relevant AGT following normoxic or hypoxic development in the chick embryo, the only model to isolate the direct effects of therapy on the fetus independent of effects on the mother and placenta. METHODS: Fertilized chicken eggs were divided into 4 groups: normoxia (N), hypoxia (H, 14% O 2 from d1 ; term~21d), normoxia dexamethasone (ND) and hypoxia dexamethasone (HD). In D groups, 0.1mg/kg dexamethasone was injected into the air cell on d14 (0.67 gestation). At d19, following euthanasia and biometry, cardiac function was established in a Langendorff preparation. A separate cohort was perfusion fixed (4% paraformaldehyde at 2.66kPa) at d19 for stereological analysis of cardiac structure.",

However, dexamethasone resulted in similar dilated cardiomyopathy in normoxic and hypoxic embryos (Fig. 1D) . CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic development exacerbates some of the adverse direct effects of AGT on fetal growth and cardiac function. MicroRNAs are small, single-stranded molecules that control gene expression by regulating mRNA stability and transcription. Upon excretion into plasma, they remain in a stable, cell-free state where they can be assayed and used as potential bio-markers. We aimed to identify and characterize circulating maternal plasma microRNAs in healthy pregnancy from 12 to 22 weeks, and then evaluate if specific microRNAs were altered in women who experienced subsequent cervical shortening and preterm delivery. METHODS: Maternal plasma samples and cervical length measurements were collected from women at three time-points in mid-pregnancy: 12-14+6, 15-17+6 and 19-21+6 weeks gestation. Samples were categorised into those from women who experienced: 1) Uncomplicated pregnancies without cervical shortening (n=48 samples); 2) cervical shortening followed by term delivery (n=30 samples) and 3) cervical shortening and preterm delivery <34 weeks gestation (n=25 samples). nCounter microRNA plasma profiling was used to compare expression of specific microRNAs between the phenotypic groups at each time point. Candidate miRNAs were validated using real-time polymerase chain reaction in the original and a second independent cohort (n=96 samples). RESULTS: Fifty-six miRNAs were expressed in more than half of the plasma samples at any time point and the profile was stable across gestation in uncomplicated pregnancies. Levels of nine microRNAs were significantly higher in plasma from women who went on to exhibit cervical shortening, regardless of gestation at delivery: hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-150-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-185-5p, hsa-miR-191-5p, hsa-miR-19b-3p and hsa-miR-23a-3p.

Neonatal complications included light-for-dates (n=8), heavy-for-dates (n=4), hypoglycemia (n=8), hyperbilirubinemia (n=5), and congenital anomalies (n=3). Placental pathology could be obtained in 21 cases, in which 18 had GDM, 2 had type 1 DM, and 1 had type 2 DM. Eleven of them had a preterm delivery and the rest of them were term. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress syndrome (n=2), transient tachypnea of the newborn (n=1), light-for-dates (n=3), hypoglycemia (n=3), and congenital anomaly (n=2). The pathologies were villitis of unknown etiology (n=4), inflammation (n=3), maternal vessel thrombosis (n=4), fetal vessel thrombosis (n=2), peripheral infarction (n=2), single umbilical artery (n=2), chorangiosis (n=2), intervillous fibrin deposition (n=1), hemorrhagic endovasculitis (n=1), and intervillositis (n=1); normal histology was also noted (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: About three-quarters of women with glucose intolerance during pregnancy exhibited placental pathology, even with live births. Placental dysfunction might lead to fetal compromise in women with glucose intolerance. (GDM) is associated with disturbances in maternal lipid metabolism, and hypertriacylglycerolemia in GDM has been related to a significant risk of having neonate that are large for gestational age, and been considered a stronger predictor of overgrowth than glucose levels. We recently discovered that both adrenomedullin (AM) and its receptors expression in omental adipose tissues from GDM were greater than from normal pregnant women at term. However the role of AM in pathophysiology of GDM and the mechanisms involved remains to be established. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the role of AM in the transition from lipid storage to lipolysis and gene expressions involved in fatty acid uptake and intracellular transport. METHODS: Human preadipocyte cultures were used to assess the influence of AM and its antagonist AM22-52 on glycerol production and relative gene expressions. RESULTS: Analysis of lipolysis indicates that glycerol release into the medium was significantly increased by exposure of the adipocytes to AM in a time-and dose-dependent manner. This anti-adipogenic property of AM was accompanied by substantial suppression of metabolic markers and key transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). Further, the enhancement of AM on lipolysis was blocked by Erk inhibitor (PD98059), but not by Akt inhibitor (LY294002) and PKA inhibitor (H-89). Moreover, insulin (100 nM), a known suppressor of lipolysis, is able to inhibit AM-induced lipolysis up to 1 hour of AM incubation but this effect was lost with prolonged AM treatment. In addition, treatment with AM antagonist AM 22-52 (1\u00b5M) not only attenuates AM-mediated lipolysis by suppressing Erk signaling pathways, but also inhibits TNF\u03b1-stimulated lipolysis. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that AM increases lipolysis through inhibition of PPAR and DGAT1 in the human preadipocytes. These effects are mediated by Erk, but not by Akt and PKA pathways. Both AM-and TNF-\u03b1-induced lipolysis are inhibited by AM antagonist AM 22-52. We therefore suggest that elevated AM and or TNF-\u03b1 in GDM would increase lipolysis resulting infetal excess adiposity and overgrowth, and use of AM antagonist may be beneficial. (GDM) is defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with first recognition or onset during pregnancy. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is known for its regulatory role in cellular energy metabolism and AMPK activators have been used to manage diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesized that AMPK may also beneficial in GDM. METHODS: 50 full term pregnancies (25 GDM and 25 normal) who selected non-labored caesarean delivery at the department of Obstetrics, the first affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University were recruited in this study. The expression of mRNA and protein were determined by q-PCR and western blotting respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in placenta were assessed by measuring GSH and GSSG. RESULTS: q-PCR identified no differences in AMPK transcription in placentas from normal and GDM pregnancies. However, Western blots indicated that AMPK phosphorylation decreased 23% in GDM placentas (n=6, p<0.001), and downstream ACC phosphorylation was reduced 35% in the GDM group (n=4, p<0.05), suggesting that AMPK-ACC signaling (associated with lipid metabolism and glucose uptake) is compromised in GDM placentas. Phosphor-PPAR\u03b3 was reduced 24% in GDM vs. normal (n=6, p<0.001), which implies that lipogenesis is also disturbed. In addition, Akt phosphorylation was decreased 65% in GDM placentas (n=6, p<0.01), whilst mTOR phosphorylation was reduced by 47% (n=6, p<0.001); impaired Akt-mTOR signaling suggests inhibition of protein synthesis. Moreover, ERK phosphorylation was enhanced 58% in GDM compared to normal placentas (n=6, p<0.001). In addition, the ratio of GSH/GSSG was significantly reduced in GDM placentas (1.63\u00b10.36 vs 3.72\u00b10.43, n=6, p<0.005),indicating elevated ROS level and oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: Placental AMPK activation is suppressed in GDM, and thus its related metabolic activities are likely to be compromised. The disturbance of AMPK mediated glucose and lipid metabolism could be the reason for oxidative stress in placenta, which will further lead to inflammation. Modulation of glucose and metabolism by targeting AMPK could be a promising therapeutic strategy for GDM.",

Lis maternity Hospital, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. INTRODUCTION: Decreasing insulin requirements in late gestation have been associated in earlier studies with placental dysfunction and consequential poor obstetrical outcome. We aimed to assess whether decreasing insulin demands are related to adverse perinatal outcome. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included healthy pregnant women with singleton gestation, diagnosed with GDM requiring insulin to maintain proper glucose control. The study population was divided into group A -characterized by insulin dosage reduction of at least 30 % during a 2 weeks period in the third trimester and a control group (B) with steady or increasing insulin dose to maintain a euglycemic state. The primary outcome was a composite of clinical situations that imply feto-placental dysfunction which included one or more of the following: 1. Fetal growth restriction 2. Oligohydramnios 3. Emergent cs due to category 2-3 monitor. The secondary outcome measures were: NICU admission, Apgar score \u22647 at 5', arterial cord blood pH \u2264 7.1, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia and a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes (one or more of : respiratory morbidity, cerebral morbidity, phototherapy, need for blood transfusion, NEC , or death). RESULTS: Group A was composed of 101 women and group B was composed of 203 women . Maternal demographic characteristics were similar between groups. The groups did not differ in any aspect of GDM diagnostic characteristics (GCT results, OGTT results, or HbA1C). Both groups consumed similar daily doses of insulin; 28.3\u00b117.1 IU for group A and 27.9\u00b114.2 IU in group B (p=0.26). A significant decline of 45.5 % in insulin consumption was noted among women from group A. Total cessation on insulin treatment was reported in 17% of women in group A compared with none in group B (P<0.001). The primary outcome (composite placental dysfunction) did not differ between the groups (8.3% vs. 8.4%, p=0.61). There were no between-group differences in any of the secondary outcomes including gestational age at delivery, labor induction rate, mean birth weight, CS rate, FGR<10% or in any of the immediate neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Diminished insulin requirements during the last trimester of pregnancy was not associated with adverse obstetrical or neonatal outcome and its significance as a warning sign for placental dysfunction should be reconsidered. In humans, most of the progesterone required for the maintenance of pregnancy is generated in the placenta. Progesterone receptor knock out mice indicated that progesterone negatively regulates pancreatic \u03b2-cell proliferation and glucose homeostasis. It has been reported that women with GDM have elevated serum progesterone levels compared to normal pregnant women. However, if the expression of placental steroidogenic enzymes are also altered in GDM patients is not known. In the present study we analyzed the expression levels of steroidogenic enzymes in term placentas obtained from normal and GDM patients.",

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the obligatory vaccineinduced IL-6 inflammatory response is altered by race and BMI. Further research is needed to characterize differences in cytokine response to vaccination and correlate this response to pregnancy outcomes. Given the growing burden of diabetes in underserved communities and the complexity of diabetes self-management during pregnancy, the objective was to develop and pilot test a theory-driven curriculum of text messaging for diabetes support and education during pregnancy. METHODS: Mixed methods, prospective study of pregnant women with pregestational or gestational diabetes receiving prenatal care at a public-funded academic clinic. Prior work yielded a model of diabetes self-management barriers and support factors. Cognitive Load Theory, the Health Belief Model and Theory of Self-Efficacy served as framework for a 30-week curriculum addressing these barriers. Participants received three one-way text messages per week during pregnancy. Self-efficacy was measured at baseline and completion using the Perceived Diabetes Self-Management Scale and Diabetes Empowerment Scale. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were performed at enrollment to identify diabetes barriers and at study exit to provide program feedback. Self-efficacy scores were analyzed using paired t-tests and interview data using qualitative theme generation. RESULTS: Of 30 enrolled pregnant women with diabetes, 29 have completed the pilot study to date. Self-efficacy scores were not statistically significantly different between baseline and exit testing. Qualitative analysis of interview data yielded several critical themes. Participants confirmed the model of barriers developed in prior work with a different population. Regarding the intervention, participants consistently reported the text messaging program provided enhanced motivation for diabetes self-care, reduced diabetes-related social isolation, increased perceived diabetes-associated knowledge, enhanced comfort with the health care team, and reduced the logistical burdens of diabetes during pregnancy. Participants requested enhanced interactive and customizable features in future tool iterations. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with diabetes who were enrolled in a pilot study of a text messaging curriculum for diabetes support described enhanced motivation, knowledge, and comfort with diabetes self-care activities as a result of the health education intervention. Next steps include enhancing the interactive features of the tool, scaling up to a \"high tech\" replicable mobile health application, and investigating the effect of the tool on perinatal outcomes.

Patients were referred to the study website either in-person by a physician, or using a flier promising an e-gift card incentive for enrollment. Outcomes included visiting the study website, clicking to begin an online intervention, and smoking status at a four-week follow-up. RESULTS: Participant enrollment was higher following direct vs. flier recruitment (95% vs 16.7%, p < .001). A total of 113 participants enrolled in the study. Of the 100 participants referred to one or more interventions, 84 (84%) clicked to pursue at least one of them, and actual participation in at least one evidence-based approach was high (37.2% signed up for and received smoking cessation text messages, and 61.5% watched an online motivational video). However, participants referred to \u2265 1 intervention were less likely to proceed with any intervention referral (but this difference did not reach significance; 90.5% vs 76.7%, OR = 2.9, p= .088). Quit attempts (88.4% vs. 66.7%, OR = 3.8) and 7-day point-prevalence abstinence, confirmed with cotinine (24.6% vs 11.1%, OR = 2.6) were higher in participants referred to an intervention, but these differences also did not reach significance, probably in relation to small n, limited power, despite large ORs. CONCLUSIONS: In-person physician referral to an online resource is more effective than flier-based referral, even with incentives. Most patients who visited the website chose to pursue at least one intervention; they were more likely to do so when offered only a single option. Although intervention effects in this study were not significant, their magnitude is highly encouraging. Wound morbidity is an expensive and inconvenient complication, occurring in up to 10% of high risk patients undergoing cesarean delivery. It is of importance to determine the most effective, safest closure method to decrease patient morbidity. Although use of staples decreases closure time, a meta-analysis demonstrated a significant 2-fold increase in wound separation. Absorbable subcuticular staples may combine the advantage of reduced closure time with decreased incidence of wound separation. The only published study of cesarean deliveries utilizing subcuticular staples found a significant reduction in wound morbidity and closure time compared to traditional staples. However, there was significant group heterogeneity. Therefore the purpose of the current study was to determine if there was a significant difference in wound complications among traditional closure techniques versus subcuticular staple closure.",

            "text": "The current study is a retrospective cohort study of cesarean sections performed from January through September of 2014. Medical records were reviewed and data including the patient demographics, comorbidities, closure type and wound complications were recorded. Patients with incomplete data were excluded. Data were analyzed with ANOVA or Fisher Exact test, according to data type. RESULTS: Of the 186 patients identified, 176 patients were included in the data analysis (n=83 suture, n=49 traditional staple, n=44 subcuticular staple). The groups were similar in all demographic categories, labor prior to delivery, blood loss, and medical and pregnancy related comorbidities. The incidence of complications among the suture and subcuticular staple closure was not significantly different (3.6% vs 0%, p=0.3), however there were significantly less complications in the suture and subcuticular suture closure groups when compared to traditional staple closure (14.3%) (p=0.03 and p=0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Herein we report the first study in patients undergoing cesarean section demonstrating a decreased incidence of composite wound complications in subcuticular staple closure versus traditional staple closure in a homogenous group of patients. Absorbable subcuticular staple closure represents a convenient, safe and cost-effective closure technique for cesarean section. The majority of patients (94%) had thermal burns. Mean body surface area burned (for 2 nd and 3 rd degree burns) was 4%. The median systolic blood pressure on admission was 130mmHg and median heart rate was 102 (both elevated as compared to pregnancy normals). A majority of patients were not screened at admission for alcohol consumption (73%), but were screened for drug use (91%). Of those screened, 1 out of 18 patients was positive for alcohol and 6 out of 60 were positive for drug use. Only 61% of patients were asked whether the burn was the result of abuse, and of those, 100% stated it was not. Fifteen percent were intubated. Median hospital stay was 2 days. Four patients (6%) required delivery during admission, of which 3 delivered vaginally. One maternal death was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Fortunately, the incidence of burns is rare during pregnancy and most patients burned less than five percent of their body surface area. The need for delivery and maternal mortality were rare. A more thorough evaluation of etiology would identify preventable causes of burn injury such as alcohol and abuse. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment in women with low-risk thrombophilias (LRT) and many are treated with anticoagulation prophylaxis. Few studies exist evaluating maternal (MAT) and neonatal (NEO) outcomes of patients with LRT on prophylaxis. Our objective was to compare rates of MAT and NEO outcomes in women with LRT on different prophylactic anticoagulation regimens. We hypothesized that MAT and NEO outcomes will be superior with the traditional prophylactic LMWH therapy when compared to other regimens. METHODS: Retrospective cohort comparing 3 groups with LRT on prophylactic anticoagulation at two medical centers: low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), LMWH + low dose aspirin (ASA), and ASA only. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Chi-square test or ANOVA F-test. Composite maternal outcome: mode of delivery, venous thromboembolism, bleeding complications, ICU admission, death, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, abruption, or number of postpartum hospital days. Neonatal composite outcome: NICU admission, IUFD, SGA, RDS, or 1 or 5-min Apgar < 7. Univariate analyses using a simple logistic regression and multivariate analyses using logistic regression with a backward elimination models were performed. Adjusted odds ratios were then calculated along with corresponding confidence intervals. RESULTS: 106 patients on LMWH, 289 on LMWH + ASA, and 97 on ASA only were analyzed. Maternal characteristics were similar among groups except indication for anticoagulation and gestational age (GA) at delivery. Univariate analysis: composite maternal outcomes were not different among groups (p=0.7). ASA cohort had greater rate of preeclampsia. Composite neonatal outcomes were not different among groups (p=0.7). Infants in ASA cohort were delivered at later GA and weighed more at delivery. Multivariate regression analyses were adjusted for treatment, factor V Leiden heterozygosity, and GA at delivery (comparisons are to the ASA group). Adverse maternal outcomes were not associated with anticoagulation regimens (LMWH aOR 1.3; 95% CI 0.3-4.7; p=0.7; LMWH + ASA aOR 0.9; 95% CI 0.3-3.0, p=0.9) nor were adverse neonatal outcomes (LMWH aOR 0.7; 95% CI 0.4-1.8; p=0.6; LMWH plus ASA aOR 0.7; 95% CI 0.4-1.5; p=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic anticoagulation regimens in low risk thrombophilias did not impact adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes.",

METHODS: Data from a prospective cohort of women delivering at 13 academically affiliated U.S. hospitals over a 3-year period was used. All data were abstracted by trained research personnel. Postpartum maternal infection and proven early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) were determined according to previously validated criteria. The hospitals were categorized according to whether they monitored handwashing during the study period, and according to their compliance rates. The association between handwashing monitoring and infectious morbidity was determined using univariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: 23,430 women delivered in hospitals that monitored handwashing compliance, and 30,224 delivered in hospitals that did not. Women delivering in hospitals that did not monitor were younger, delivered at a slightly later gestational age, had longer second stage, were less likely to be nulliparous, have gestational diabetes and PROM, and more likely to be non-Hispanic white and Hispanic, and smokers. On univariate analysis, EOS was significantly more frequent in hospitals that monitored versus those that did not (0.3% vs 0.2%, p=.04), but maternal postpartum infectious morbidity was not different. No differences were found on multivariable analysis (Table 1) . Maternal and neonatal infectious outcomes were not different for those with <90% or >90% compliance when compared with the no monitoring group (Table 2) . To determine whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics is associated with a reduced risk of endometritis in women who undergo prolonged intrauterine balloon tamponade for management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). METHODS: All women who had a PPH and underwent placement of an intrauterine balloon between 2007 and 2014 were identified. Women were excluded if the intrauterine balloon was removed in <8 hours or if they ultimately required a peripartum hysterectomy. Prophylactic antibiotics were considered to have been given if at least one dose of antibiotics was given post-balloon placement with no other indication. The primary outcome was endometritis, which was defined as documented uterine tenderness with a postpartum temperature >100.4\u00b0F. Univariable analyses were performed and multivariable logistic regression was used to control for potential confounding. RESULTS: 263 women who underwent placement of an intrauterine balloon for management of PPH were included in the cohort. 233 (88.6%) received prophylactic antibiotics. Characteristics of women stratified by receipt of antibiotics are shown in the The rate of endometritis was similar in the group who received prophylactic antibiotics compared to the group who did not receive prophylactic antibiotics. This finding persisted (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 0.29-4.00) after adjusting for administration of misoprostol as an uterotonic agent and the total time the intrauterine balloon remained in situ. This study had 80% power to detect a relative risk for endometritis of 3.2 associated with prophylactic antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic antibiotics did not change the rate of endometritis in women who underwent prolonged placement of an intrauterine balloon for management of PPH. Although overt thyroid dysfunction is known to lead to fertility issues, subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid autoimmunity and their relationship to time to pregnancy has not been examined. Thus, our objective was to examine the association between pre-pregnancy antithyroid antibodies and subclinical hypothyroidism and time to conception in a cohort of women. METHODS: Prospective cohort study from a multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preconception low-dose aspirin to prevent pregnancy loss among healthy fertile women, ages 18-40 years old (n=1228). Measurements for TSH, fT4, anti-thyroglubulin antibody (anti-TG) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) were taken at baseline. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess fecundability odds ratios (FOR), adjusting for age and BMI and accounting for both left truncation and right censoring. RESULTS: Women with a TSH > 2.5 mIU/L were not more likely to have a longer time to conceive when compared to women whose TSH was < 2.5 mIU/L (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76, 1.16). Similarly, women with thyroid autoimmunity did not have a significant delay in pregnancy compared to those without (HR 1.04; 95% CI 0.80, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Women with a history of 1 or 2 prior pregnancy losses with subclinical hypothyroidism, did not have a longer time to pregnancy. Additionally, women with thyroid autoimmunity did not have an increase in time to pregnancy. Figure 1 shows the PTB rate over time, revealing no significant difference, despite evolving progesterone treatment practices. *Figure(s) will be available online. There were 2,068 deliveries to women with a prior history of PTB, of whom 27.8% had a recurrent PTB. The rate of subsequent spontaneous PTB (29.6%, vs. 28.6%), and of gestational age (GA) at subsequent PTB (34+1wks vs. 34+3wks) was similar in the years before and after progesterone therapy became standard. Women who recieved progesterone in a subsequent pregnancy had earlier PTB in their prior pregnancy than women who were not treated (average GA of 30+5 weeks, vs. 35 weeks). There was no significant difference in recurrent PTB rate between women who recieved progesterone and those who did not, even when the analysis was limited to women with prior PTB \u2264 34 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal the absence of a significant effect of progesterone treament on reduction of PTB rates in the setting of an already low baseline rate. A progesterone effect on recurrent spontaneous PTB may have been obscured by the higher risk for earlier delivery in the treated population, and by the fact that 2/3 of our PTBs occur >34 weeks, when progesterone therapy may not be of benefit.",

            "text": "The The most common mental health complications experienced by pregnant and post partum women are depression, stress and anxiety with a prevalence of 15-25%. If untreated, 70% of women with prenatal depression continue to experience symptoms postpartum. Only a few women seek help or engage in treatment. Perinatal mental health problems can occur at any time from conception through to the first year after delivery and can contribute to adverse outcomes for women and infants as well as partners and other family members. The purpose of this population based study, was to identify women, who screened positive for perinatal mental health issues and to assess the ability of the medical personnel to manage such patients. METHODS: An enhanced, screening questionnaire was used, which included questions regarding previous mental health illness, mental health professional involvement, inpatients stays, attempted self harm and family history. A total of 1066 women were screened at booking over a period of three months. For the medical and midwifery personnel an online questionnaire was sent out and the responses were collected and analyzed 6 weeks later. Lactobacilli produce lactic acid to kill bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other potential pathogens. NGAL release from epithelial cells inhibits growth of BV-related bacteria by iron sequestration. Greater estrogen production in multiparous women may account for the higher levels of most mediators in these women as compared to primiparous women. Higher D-lactic acid levels in vaginal fluid from primiparous women indicate the preferential presence of Lactobacilli that produce this isomer -L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri. In contrast, L. iners only produces L-lactic acid. The elevated level of hyaluronan PP probably promotes cervical and uterine remodeling. On the other hand, obesity is also characterized by elevated adenosine plasma levels. However, there are no data regarding adenosine levels in overweight/obese pregnant women. METHODS: Normal weight and overweight/obese non-pregnant and pregnant women were included in this study. After written nformed consent, record of clinical data, self-reported food ingestion during the last 24 hours (3 days other than weekend with at least one week apart) and blood samples were taken from each patient. Plasma adenosine levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, whereas biochemical parameters including glucose, total proteins and lipid profile by using standard colorimetric assays. RESULTS: Adenosine plasma levels were 1.8 fold higher in pregnant women (n=30) than non-pregnant women (n=30) (p<0.0001). Overweight/ obese pregnant women (n=18) exhibited higher value than pregnant (n=12, p=0.04) or non-pregnant women with normal weight (n=23, p=0.0005). When weight-gain during pregnancy was considered, pregnant women with elevated weight-gain exhibited significantly higher (1.7 fold, p=0.03) adenosine levels than those with appropriated weight-gain; whereas differences were not statistically significant with those women with low weight-gain. Correlative analysis showed significant association between body mass index and adenosine only in pregnant women (r=0.39, 95%IC 0.03 to 0.67, p=0.02). On the other hand, estimated polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) consumption was negatively correlated to adenosine plasma levels only in non-pregnant women (r=-0.33, 95%IC -0.61 to 0.03, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Normal pregnancy is associated with high adenosine plasma levels, which are further elevated in pregnant women with overweight/obesity. Relevance of this finding for adenosine-mediated cardiovascular and metabolic adaptions during pregnancy require further investigation. Fondecyt 1140586 financed this study.",

INTRODUCTION: Obesity is associated with chronic mild inflammation and higher gestational risks. Periodontal diseases (PD), i.e gingivitis (G) and periodontitis (P) may also represent a source of low-grade systemic inflammation potentially impairing pregnancy outcomes. We showed increased oral inflammation in obese (OB) vs normal weight (NW) pregnant women. Few studies investigated saliva (S) biomarkers in pregnant women. Here we analyzed C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in S of pregnant women with different pre-pregnancy BMI, investigating their association with plasma CRP and with PD METHODS: 53 singleton pregnancies (13 NW, BMI 18-24.9; 40 OB, BMI\u226530) were studied at 3rd trimester. Periodontal status was assessed by oral clinical examination in 21 OB and 13 NW. P: at least 4 teeth with pockets \u22654 mm. G: soft and/or calcified bacterial plaque and/ or gingival bleeding in 4 or more teeth. In 28 women (13NW,15OB) unstimulated S-samples were collected for analysis of CRP (ELISA) and TAC (AntiOxidant Assay). CRP was also measured in 44 (10NW,34OB) plasma samples (ELISA) RESULTS: S-CRP levels were significantly related with BMI (p=0.04;R=0.42). TAC was significantly higher in OB vs NW (p=0.01) and significantly correlated with S-CRP (p=0.00;R=0.70). Plasma CRP levels were significantly increased in OBvsNW (p=0.00), correlating with both S-CRP (p=0.00;R=0.85) and TAC (p=0.01;R=0.52).90% OB and 38% NW had PD (P/G). PD in healthy-NW did not enhance molecular values, while in OB tended to increase CRP/TAC vs healthy NW, reaching significance for plasma CRP (p=0.017) CONCLUSIONS: Chronic mild inflammation was reported in many OB tissues, but nothing is known about markers in S of OB pregnant women, which might represent an effective non-invasive diagnostic tool.",

Here, both S/plasma CRP correlated with S-TAC, which was significantly increased in OB. This suggests the induction of a systemic antioxidant response detectable in OB-S. and methoxyestradiols (2-ME 2 , 4ME 2 ) activate uterine artery endothelium function during pregnancy by increasing endothelial cell proliferation and stimulating production of PGI 2 . During late pregnancy the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) plays a significant role in mediating increases in uterine blood flow. Moreover, E 2 increases NO production in uterine artery endothelial cells (UAECs); however it is unknown whether the E 2 metabolites, 2-OHE 2 , 4-OHE 2 , 2-ME 2 , and 4ME 2 also increase NO production in these cells. We hypothesize that the E 2 metabolites will induce NO production in UAECs derived from pregnant (P-), but not from nonpregnant (NP-) sheep and that these responses are mediated via estrogen receptors or adrenergic receptors. METHODS: UAECs were obtained from NP (Luteal; n=4) and late P (120-130d, term=147d; n=4) sheep. P-UAECs and NP-UAECs were treated with vehicle, E 2 [10nM] or 2-OHE 2 , 4-OHE 2 , 2-ME 2 , or 4ME 2 [0.1, 1, 10, or 100nM] for 0, 5, 10, or 20 min. To determine if adrenergic or estrogen receptors mediate the production of NOx induced by the E 2 metabolites, P-UAECs were pre-treated with [10\u00b5m] phentolamine, propranolol, or ICI182,780 followed by agonist treatments. Media were collected and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total NOx production was determined as the sum of nitrites and nitrates detected. RESULTS: E 2 and its metabolites induced pregnancy specific stimulation of NOx production since enhanced NO production was observed only in PUAECs, but not in NP-UAECs. E 2 [10nM], 2-OHE 2 and 4-OHE 2 [0.1 and10nM] significantly increased (P<0.05) total NOx production 1.5-1.8 fold of control. However, 2-ME 2 and 4-ME 2 did not significantly altered NOx production except at the highest dose of [100nM]. The E 2 , 2-OHE 2 and 4-OHE 2 -induced NOx increases were abrogated by ICI182,780 (P<0.05), but not with either alpha or beta adrenergic receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that E 2 and its metabolites are important for regulation of uterine blood flow and vasodilatation during pregnancy by stimulating NO production.

INTRODUCTION: Uterine myometrium vasculature undergoes massive expansion via angiogenesis during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in association with endogenous estrogens. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), biosynthesized from L-cysteine by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), has been recently accepted as a new gasotransmitter that stimulates angiogenesis. However, it is unknown if H 2 S biosynthesis is associated with human myometrial angiogenesis and correlates with endogenous estrogens during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. METHODS: Myometrium tissues were obtained from hysterectomies from women with different endogenous estrogens (5-7/per group), including late pregnant (very high estrogens), premenopausal in the proliferative (high estrogens) and secretory (low estrogens) phases of the menstrual cycle, and postmenopausal (very low estrogens) women.",

Sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy and images were analyzed for cellular CBS and CSE proteins, angiogenesis, and vessel maturation. Tissue levels of CBS and CSE mRNA and protein were analyzed by real-time PCR and immunoblotting and H 2 S was measured by methylene blue assay. RESULTS: The average number, length, diameter, and cross-sectional area of myometrial vessels displayed greatest in pregnancy, high in proliferative, low in secretory and lowest in postmenopausal women. Pregnant myometrial vessels were also positively associated with the greatest number of NG2 + /PDGFR\u03b2 + pericytes. CBS mRNA and protein were highly expressed in myometrial myocytes and blood vessels; their levels and H 2 S production in the myometrium displayed similar patterns to angiogenesis. CSE expression was unaltered during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Human myometrial angiogenesis and vessel maturation (pericyte recruitment) in pregnancy are associated with endogenous estrogens and enhanced H 2 S biosynthesis via upregulating CBS but not CSE expression in myocytes and blood vessels (funded by NIH RO1 HL70562). The uterine cervix undergoes a ripening process leading to dilation necessary for delivery of the fetus. Ripening is complex and prostaglandins, PGE2 in particular, play a critical role. The cervix is innervated by sensory fibers, creating a potential role for neurogenic inflammation in this process. SP and CGRP are primary neuropeptides in sensory pain fibers and have been localized by immunocytochemistry in the cervix. Fibroblasts are the primary cell type in cervical stroma and integral in regulating cervical integrity. We have found that HCFs express CGRP and SP receptors. In the present study we hypothesized that CGRP and/or SP regulate expression of key genes mediating prostaglandin synthesis. METHODS: HCFs were prepared and characterized. HCFs were treated with SP or CGRP (10 ng) for 4, 8 and 24 hours and mRNA for prostaglandin G/H synthase 2 (PGHS2), prostaglandin E synthase 1 (PGES1), prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS) and prostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH) was quantified via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR Women with excess, compared with appropriate, GWG had proportionately greater accrual of fat mass (88%, 9.0 kg v. 4.8 kg) rather than fat free mass (31%, 10.7 kg v. 8.2 kg). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Among normal weight women, both FM and FFM accrual were associated with excess, compared with appropriate, GWG. The greater proportion of fat mass, compared with fat free mass, accrual -most of which is water -helps explain why excess GWG even in normal weight women is a significant risk factor for postpartum obesity in women.

Levels of ER\u03b2, but not ER\u03b1 and GPER, mRNA and protein were significantly greater in pregnant vs. nonpregnant uterine arteries. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and GPER protein were highly expressed in pregnant uterine artery and localized to endothelium and smooth muscle. CONCLUSIONS: All ER isoforms are highly expressed in the human uterine artery endothelium and smooth muscle cells, with upregulated ER\u03b2 expression in pregnancy, implicating a critical role of ER\u03b2 in estrogen-induced uterine vasodilation (funded by NIH RO1 HL70562 and AHA PRE18570033). The age at which women deliver their first child has increased steadily in recent years, particularly in Western societies. Advanced maternal age (\u226535 years) is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the impact of aging on vascular adaptations to pregnancy that might continue postpartum and compromise the cardiovascular health of the mother long-term. We hypothesized that pregnancy at an advanced maternal age would lead to endothelial dysfunction in postpartum life. METHODS: Aged female Sprague Dawley rats (9 months; approximately equivalent to a 35 year old woman) were mated with young males. Dams were allowed to deliver and nurse their offspring until weaning at 3 weeks. Vascular function was assessed in mesenteric arteries from dams at 3 months postpartum or aged-matched, never pregnant controls. Endothelial function was assessed using wire myography to investigate responses to methylcholine (MCh) in the absence or presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, indomethacin or endotheliumderived hyperpolarization. RESULTS: At three months postpartum in dams who had been pregnant at an advanced maternal age, vascular responses to MCh were decreased (pEC 50 : 7.92\u00b10.10) when compared to never pregnant aged-matched controls (pEC 50 : 7.49\u00b10.09; p=0.011). This was accompanied by reduced nitric oxide-induced vasodilation (L-NAME pEC 50 : 7.29\u00b10.10, not significant in aged postpartum and 7.22\u00b10.06, p<0.001 in aged never pregnant) and an increase in prostaglandin-mediated vasoconstriction (indomethacin pEC 50 : 7.95\u00b10.07, p<0.05 in aged postpartum and 7.99\u00b10.13, not ssignificant in aged never pregnant). In addition, there was a tendency for increased vasodilation in the presence of SOD; suggesting increased oxidative stress in the postpartum group. CONCLUSIONS: In a rat model of advanced maternal age, postpartum dams exhibited endothelial dysfunction when compared to aged, never pregnant controls which included altered nitric oxide and prostaglandin pathways. An increased constrictive phenotype may predispose mothers of an advanced maternal age to cardiovascular disease.",

INTRODUCTION: Lactation is association with improved long term cardiovascular and metabolic outcome in the mother. Using a wellcharacterized murine model, we have previously shown that the effect of lactation is direct and specific. The objective of this study was to investigate the oxytocin (OXT) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) system as a potential mechanism for this beneficial effect. METHODS: Following delivery, CD-1 female mice were randomly divided into 2 groups: lactated (L; n=7), and nonlactated (NL; pups were removed after birth, n= 11). At 6 months post delivery, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), heart and hypothalamus tissue were collected. OXT plasma levels were determined using Luminex magnetic bead technology. OXT, OXTR, GATA4, eNOS and GLUT4 mRNA levels were measured quantitative real time RT-PCR. Student t test was used for statistical analysis (significance P \u2264.05). RESULTS: OXT plasma levels were significantly lower in NL group (P=0.04). OXT and eNOS expression were increased (P= 0.04 for both genes) and OXTR decreased (P=0.03) in the aorta from the NL group compared with L. OXT and eNOS expression were reduced in the heart of NL mothers (P= 0.05 and 0.04, respectively, Figure) . OXT and GLUT4 expression were lower in the VAT from the NL group (P= 0.04 and, 0.05 respectively). No differences were found in the hypothalamus tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Lactation alters gene expression in the maternal vasculature and adipocites, and this favorable profile could in part explain its long term health benefits. *Figure(s) will be available online. We recently found a slightly higher renal filtration fraction 10 years postpartum by radioactive tracer measurement in a well-controlled small cohort after PE (Toering 2015, Am J Physiol Renal Physiol), suggesting hyperfiltration as a possible mechanism of late renal damage. To test the latter hypothesis, we studied renal function in formerly PE women in a larger cohort.",

Data are presented as median (25-75 percentile) or as odds-ratio (95% CI). RESULTS: eGFR was not different between fPE and fHP women [97 (85-110) vs 95 (86-105) ml/min/1.73 m 2 ]. However, examination of the distribution of the eGFR in both groups revealed a significant shift to high-normal eGFR values in fPE women compared to fHP women (p=0.02) with an odds-ratio for having a GFR >110 ml/min/1.73m 2 of 1.6 (1.1-2.4) in fPE women. This odds-ratio was maintained after correction for age, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio and systolic blood pressure.

            "text": "We demonstrated a shift of eGFR distribution to the high-normal range and slightly higher protein excretion in formerly earlyonset PE women 10 years postpartum. A high-normal GFR represents a relative state of hyperfiltration, which is a predictor, and mechanism of long-term renal damage in animal models and human diabetes. Our finding is in line with our previous finding of a higher filtration fraction and suggests that hyperfiltration might contribute to the increased risk of ESRD risk after PE. Long-term follow-up studies are required to investigate whether high-normal eGFR can be used as a screening marker for ESRD after PE. They have previously been shown to play a modulatory role in pathways leading to labor onset, and oxytocin (OT) was found to alter the expression of a unique set of myometrial miRNAs including hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-196b-3p and hsa-miR-876-5p. Although hsa-miR-196b-3p and hsa-miR-876-5p have no experimentally validated gene targets reported to date, hsa-miR-146a-5p has been validated to target NF-\u03baB activity as well as IL-8, TLR2 and TLR4 expression. These results suggest a further role for OT as a signalling molecule involved in the regulation of gene expression during parturition. Oxytocin receptor (OTR) antagonists have been used therapeutically for the management of labour. In this study we have investigated whether the orally active OTR antagonist, OBE001, can inhibit the OT-driven change in the expression of miRNAs hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-876-5p and hsa-miR-196b-3p in human myometrial smooth muscle cells. METHODS: QRT-PCR was used to quantify the expression of candidate miRNAs with the miRCURY LNA kit (Exiqon) with 0.05 ng complementary DNA. LNA assays were custom designed for miRNAs of interest: hsa-miR-146b-3p (204374), hsa-miR-196b-3p (204619), and hsa-miR-876-5p (204527). MiRNA expression data were normalized to 5S ribosomal RNA (203906). RESULTS: Consistent with previous observations, OT down-regulated the expression of hsa-miR-146a-5p and hsa-miR-196b-3p after 2 h of stimulation, and hsa-miR-876-5p after 1 h. Presence of OBE001 reversed this effect of OT on all three miRNAs in a dose-dependent manner. Morever, prolonged exposure to OBE001 (4 h, 6 h and 24 h) led to slight increase in the expression of these miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the typical role of OTR antagonists in inhibiting OT-driven myometrial contractions, OBE001 also reduced OT-induced changes in miRNA expression which target proinflammatory genes. This study shows the importance of an OTR antagonist being able to inhibit both the labour-associated inflammatory and contractile effects of OT. To examine the controversial relationship between thrombophilia and adverse pregnancy outcomes, complicated by a high rate of tobacco abuse, in a West Virginia obstetric population. METHODS: Retrospective study of obstetric patients from a maternalfetal medicine clinic who delivered between January 2009 and December 2013. Maternal characteristic, pregnancy, and birth outcome data were linked to a clinic ultrasound database. Medical records were examined to record missing data and prenatal thromboprophylaxis regimens. Outcomes were compared among four groups: thrombophilia and tobacco use, thrombophilia and no tobacco, no thrombophlia and tobacco use, and no thrombophilia and no tobacco use.",

Thromboprophylaxis included: low molecular weight heparin, aspirin, unfractionated heparin, folic acid, and combinations of these. Smokers with thrombophilia were most likely to experience preterm birth and deliver low birthweight neonates (p=0.00 1 and p<0.001, respectively). While women with thrombophilia who smoked had higher rates of PROM, they had significantly lower rates of HELLP and placental abruption. Women with thrombophilia who received thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy had lower rates of adverse birth outcomes, reaching significance for preterm birth <32 weeks gestation (4.2% vs. 21.1%, p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Women who have a diagnosis of thrombophilia and smoke during pregnancy may be more likely to experience adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight neonates and preterm birth; these women may receive more benefit from thromboprophylaxis treatment during pregnancy than their non-smoking counterparts. We developed a mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics approach that identified two serum protein biomarkers predictive of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) risk. Here we present sPTB classification performance derived from the immunoassay measure of these proteins using specimens collected within the 19-21 weeks gestational age window of the Proteomic Assessment of Preterm Risk (PAPR) study.

In a nested case:control (1:2) study, representative samples from the PAPR trial were analyzed by ELISAs using the highest performing antibody pairs. sPTB classification performance was calculated using the 57 subjects in the cohort and 34 subjects within a Body Mass Index (BMI) restricted subset. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated from the point on the ROC curve where the sum of each value was maximal. RESULTS: Correlation between ELISA and MS-based measurements of IBP4 and SHBG were calculated for several antibody pairs, with the best performing sets giving Pearson r values of 0.86 and 0.84 respectively. These antibodies also gave highly reproducible ELISA data; intraplate CVs for IBP4 and SHBG were 4.4% and 7.0% respectively. ELISA-based classifier scores resulted in AUCs of 0.82 and 0.72 with and without the BMI restriction. Recently, we defined the functional relevance of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ERSR) and its associated unfolded protein response (UPR) in regulating gestational length. We demonstrated that across gestation an increase in the ERSR and caspase 3/7 (CASP3/7) activation disables the ability of the uterine myocyte to contract effectively. At term, an increase in the adaptive UPR limits the tocolytic activity of CASP3/7 permitting the induction of labor. However, an exaggerated ERSR or inappropriate UPR predisposes the quiescent uterus to an increasingly contractile phenotype allowing the initiation of preterm labor (1). The goal of this study is to examine whether circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can be utilized as a surrogate tissue across gestation to recapitulate the ERSR profile observed in pregnant uterus and therefore serve as a predictive biomarker for term and preterm labor. METHODS: PBMC's and uterine tissues were obtained from pregnant CD1 mice (E6-E19) and those undergoing an ER stress induced preterm birth by administration of Tunicamycin (TM; 0, 0.2, 1.0 mg/kg). PBMC and uterine protein extracts were prepared and the markers of ERSR were evaluated by immunoblotting and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunoblot analyses revealed that ERSR-UPR and CASP3 activation maintained a gestationally regulated profile in the PBMC's, which recapitulated that of pregnant uterus, where dramatic increases in the ERSR were found between E6-E13, which declined towards term. In the context of our TM induced preterm birth model, which is triggered by a precociously diminished uterine ERSR (1), the PBMCs also demonstrated a dramatic decrease in ERSR markers prior to the onset of preterm birth. Our preliminary flow cytometry analysis of the PMBCs suggested that the T-lymphocyte population is responsible for the PBMC-ERSR signature prior to preterm birth.",

S) is a tocolytic produced endogenously from substrate L-Cysteine (L-Cys) by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE). L-Cys is degraded by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO). CBS, CSE, and CDO are expressed in the murine myometrium and in pregnancy, as well as in placenta. Previous data from our lab show uterine CSE expression is significantly increased at labor while CDO expression is markedly decreased. Placental CBS/ CSE expression increases as pregnancy progresses, while CDO expression remains unchanged. We hypothesized that decreased L-Cys degradation during labor favors H 2 S production. Thus, we examined the L-Cys and transulfuration metabolites within the myometrium and placenta using metabolomic analysis. METHODS: Myometrium and placentae were collected from timedpregnant nulliparous C57/BL6 mice. Tissue was harvested daily from gestational day 15-19 and at labor. Uterus from one animal or placentae from a whole litter was homogenized in ice-cold extraction buffer containing methanol, acetonitrile, and water at a ratio of 5:3:1.

In the myometrium, cystine and thiosulfate were elevated as labor approached, whereas metabolites of L-Cys degradation including cysteine sulfinic acid, taurine, and hypotaurine were markedly decreased in pregnancy and labor. Placental metabolites of L-Cys degradation remained unchanged throughout pregnancy and labor, and thiosulfate levels were below the limit of detection. CONCLUSIONS: Increased transulfuration intermediates and L-Cys in the myometrium during pregnancy and labor show myometriumspecific increase in L-Cys. Together with our previous report of increased myometrial CSE expression at term, the enzyme expression and substrate availability suggest increased H 2 S production as gestation progresses. The stable placental metabolomic profile indicates that H 2 S production may be regulated in a compartment-specific manner and serve specific novel functions at the maternal-fetal interface. Adiponectin is a protein hormone secreted by adipose tissue and the placenta. Its concentration in serum is inversely proportional to body weight. In pregnancy, maternal circulating adiponectin levels are inversely related to neonatal birthweight. Infusion of exogenous adiponectin into pregnant mice induces a subsequent decrease in fetal growth rate. These negative effects have been shown to be due to the inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by adiponectin. mTORC1 promotes transcription of genes involved in protein synthesis and immune modulation and the expression of placental nutrient transporters. Given the apparent influence of adiponectin on nutrition, we evaluated whether its concentration in mid-trimester amniotic fluid could be a predictive biomarker of pregnancy outcome. METHODS: Amniotic fluid from 858 women who underwent a clinically indicated amniocentesis at 15-18 weeks gestation was evaluated. Adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA. Pregnancy outcome data were obtained after completion of all testing. The Mann-Whitney and Spearman rank correlation tests were used to assess associations. RESULTS: Preterm delivery (18-36 weeks gestation) occurred in 82 (9.6%) of the subjects. The median (range) adiponectin concentration in ng/ml was 18.2 (1.8-355) in women who delivered preterm vs. 4.1 (0-256) in women delivering at term (p<0.0001). Median levels were higher in neonates born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (30.1 ng/ml) than in neonates with normal weight (4.3 ng/ml) (p<0.05). There were negative correlations between adiponectin concentration and gestational age at delivery (p<0.0001) and neonatal birthweight (p<0.0001). There were no associations between amniotic fluid adiponectin levels and gestational age at amniocentesis, maternal age, maternal body mass index, fetal gender or race. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated adiponectin in mid-trimester amniotic fluid is a sensitive biomarker of subsequent preterm delivery and IUGR. Further analysis is necessary to determine whether the inhibition of mTORC1 and/ or other properties of adiponectin are involved in increased susceptibility to these adverse pregnancy complications. (PTB) is the world's leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality. It has been suggested that perinatal programming by stress may increase PTB risk. We have shown that ancestral stress augments PTB risk and is linked with changes in the miR-200 family and targets (Stat5b, Zeb1 and 2) in rat uterus. We propose a two-hit hypothesis in which prenatal stressors affect the expression of genes involved in IL-1 signaling, the stress response or identified as miR-200 family targets differently when combined than either hit alone. METHODS: Long-Evans dams (F0 generation) were exposed to external (swimming/restraint) and immune stress (IL-1\u03b2 injection, 5\u00b5g/kg/day, i.p.) on gestational days 12-18 and 17-delivery respectively. Rats were split into no stress/saline (NS/S), stress/saline (S/S), no stress/IL-1\u03b2 (NS/ IL-1\u03b2), stress/IL-1\u03b2 (S/IL-1\u03b2), n=3-6 each. Female offspring (F1) were tested behaviourally, raised to adulthood, sacrificed and tissues collected. mRNA abundance in uterus, hippocampus was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR of Stat5b, Zeb1/2, IL-1 receptors and accessory proteins Il-1r1/2 and acp/acpb, Crh and its receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor Nc3r1, Hsd11b1/2 and housekeeping gene Cyclophilin. One-way ANOVA or equivalent with post-hoc testing, p<0.05. RESULTS: Administration of S/IL-1\u03b2 to F0 dams decreased the uterine expression Stat5b mRNA in F1 compared to S/S offspring (p<0.05) and of Crhr1 versus NS/IL-1\u03b2 and S/S (p<0.01/<0.05), as well as Il-1racp overall (p<0.05). Hsd11b1 expression in uterus was downregulated in S/IL-1\u03b2 vs NS/IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.01). In hippocampus, reduced Il-1r1 mRNA expression was seen in NS/IL-1\u03b2 and S/IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.01/<0.05) vs control as well as decreased Nc3r1 mRNA abundance in S/IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.05). Hsd11b2 mRNA was lower in S/S and NS/IL-1\u03b2 (p<0.05) than NS/S. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal stressors have an effect on F1 uterine and hippocampal mRNA levels of mediators of the stress and inflammatory response, known to be involved in pregnancy and parturition. Our findings suggest ancestral stress may be transferred to offspring increasing their \"stress state\" possibly through epigenetic changes programming physiologic responses and pregnancy outcomes e.g. PTB. The first two trimesters of pregnancy are characterised by a range of biochemical, cardiovascular and physiological changes, which are reflected in the maternal plasma metabolome. We hypothesise that the pathophysiological events that precede cervical shortening and preterm birth have their origins in the first and early second trimesters, which will be reflected in perturbations of the normal metabolic trajectory. Analysis of the metabolome at this stage of pregnancy can provide a window for biomarker identification and patient stratification. METHODS: Plasma samples and detailed clinical metadata were collected at 12, 16 and 20 weeks gestation from pregnant women from a mixed ethnic background who experience a normal term (n=245) or preterm (n=52) delivery. 1 H-NMR spectra were acquired for samples using standard 1D and 2D pulse sequences. Spectra were processed, calibrated to TSP and analysed using multivariate statistical approaches. Metabolites of interest were identified using S-BASE (Bruker BioSpin) as well as in-house and public databases. RESULTS: Modelling of the plasma metabolic profiles by partial least squares analysis (PLS) revealed perturbations in the metabolome at 12 weeks associated with the gestational age at the time of delivery. Patients who ultimately developed cervical shortening (<25mm, 14 to 22 weeks) or delivered preterm (<37 weeks) were characterised by different plasma metabolic trajectories between 12-20 weeks compared to those who experienced normal, uncomplicated pregnancies. The plasma metabolome was most discriminatory at the 12 and 20 weeks timepoint with convergence at 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The maternal plasma metabolome undergoes characteristic alterations during the early 2 nd trimester that are predictive of later cervical shortening and delivery before 37 gestational weeks. Analysis of the plasma metabolome by NMR offers a rapid and relatively inexpensive means of monitoring and stratifying pregnant populations on the basis of preterm birth risk. We recently reported the efficacy of a noncompetitive interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, termed 101.10, in preventing preterm birth (PTB) associated with inflammation/infection in mice (Nadeau-Vall\u00e9e et al., J Immunol, 2015) . However, the possible deleterious outcomes in prolonging gestation in the case of chorioamnionitis has been raised. Considering the anti-inflammatory effects of 101.10 observed in gestational tissue, we hypothesize that not only can 101.10 prolong gestation in case of chorioamnionitis, but also protects the fetus from neonatal mortality/morbidity. METHODS: Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice at gestational day 16.5 received 101.10 (1mg/Kg/12h), Kineret (4mg/Kg/12h) or vehicle followed by a single 1 \u00b5g intrauterine IL-1\u03b2 injection. Biochemical analysis were performed on fetal/pups tissues 24h post-IL-1 (amniotic fluids and placenta), at birth (circulating leukocytes, lungs, intestines, brains and eyes) and histological analysis were performed at post-term day (PT) 15 (lungs and guts). RESULTS: The 101.10 decreased neonatal mortality rates (induced by IL-1) by 60% (p<0.001); Kineret was ineffective. The maternal administration of 101.10 significantly inhibited the transcriptional induction (IL-1induced) of a panel of key pro-inflammatory genes in placentas and circulating leukocytes of the newborn. Levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-8 in amniotic fluids and organs of the newborn were significantly lesser (p<0.05) in pups from 101.10-treated dams. The 101.10 was more effective than Kineret (p<0.05) at decreasing inflammation in each biochemical assay. Tissue integrity of the lung and the intestines (ileum/colon) were preserved by the maternal administration of 101.10. CONCLUSIONS: 101.10 is the first anti-IL-1 agent that shows efficacy at prolonging gestation shortened by inflammation, and we herein report its efficacy to improve neonatal and developmental outcomes conveyed by the exposition to inflammation during gestation.",

INTRODUCTION: Thyroid disease has been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. Our recent meta-analysis showed a significant association between both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and preterm birth. A biological mechanism by which thyroid disease might cause preterm birth has not been elucidated. Previously TSH receptor (TSHR) was identified in trophoblast and endometrium thus it represents another pathway by which thyroid may affect pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate TSHR in reproductive tissues and an intracellular mechanism whereby TSH might affect uterine contractility in pregnancy. METHODS: Placenta samples and myometrial samples were collected in women undergoing elective (not in labour, NIL, n=16) and emergency Caesarean Sections (in labour, IL, n=13).Non-pregnant myometrium was also obtained. Real-time RTPCR was used to determine mRNA expression, while protein expression was investigated with Western Blot and immunostaining. A myometrial cell culture model was used to investigate the response to incubation in different concentrations of TSH. An ELISA was used to determine cAMP production in the cell culture model. RESULTS: TSHR mRNA expression was significantly lower in the IL group compared with the NIL and NP groups (P = 0.0003). TSHR Protein expression was lower in the IL group (P = 0.028). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of TSHR throughout the myometrium in a generalised cytoplasmic distribution in both NIL and IL. In placenta, there was no significant difference with labour status however TSHR expression increased significantly with gestation. Tissue culture with NIL tissue demonstrated a decrease in TSHR mRNA with TSH incubation (p=0.02 ANOVA). This result was not seen in the IL tissue cultures. Myometrial cultures incubated in TSH incubation produced a significant biphasic response in intracellular cAMP compared to control. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of TSH receptors in human pregnant myometrium . The significant decrease in TSHR with labour suggests that TSH or the similarly structured hCG may be involved in uterine quiescence. Effects on cAMP in the model suggest a possible mechanism. The role of TSHR in human parturition deserves further investigation. We have previously identified that estrogen plus progesterone substantially stimulate the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), which stimulates leiomyoma stem cell proliferation. Silibinin is a natural non-toxic polyphenolic flavonoid with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties. Our goal is to determine the effects of silibinin on RANKL expression in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells.",

            "text": "We isolated leiomyoma smooth muscle cells from fresh fibroid tissue and maintained these cells in primary culture (n=3). The cells were treated with vehicle or varying doses of silibinin (30, 60, or 90mM) for 24, 48, or 72 hours respectively, in the absence of estradiol and the progesterone agonist R5020. The total RNA was extracted and the real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of RANKL, estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1), progesterone receptor (PR), and the proliferation marker and RANKL target, cyclin D1. RESULTS: Silibinin reduced RANKL expression in a dose-dependent manner with the most significant change observed at 60mM (up to 60%-fold decrease, p<0.05). Silibinin-dependent inhibition of RANKL expression occurred as early as within 24 hours, peaked after 48 hours of treatment and persisted at 72 hours. CylinD1 is a known downstream target of RANKL-activated signaling pathway. Silibinin significantly decreased cyclin D1 mRNA levels in a dose-and time-course dependent manner by up to 80%-fold change (p<0.05). There was no significant change in ER\u03b1 and PR expression with exposure to silibinin, suggesting that silibinin specifically regulates RANKL expression in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells. CONCLUSIONS: Silibinin is an effective inhibitor of RANKL expression and its proliferative activity in leiomyoma smooth muscle cells. Thus silibinin might be a potential medical treatment option for uterine leiomyoma. Multiple lines of evidence support the premise that parturition is mediated by pro-inflammatory events; our laboratory has proposed that these events are initiated by the increase in cell-free fetal DNA at term. IL10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) has been proposed to play a \"fail-safe\" role by inhibiting the untimely activation of the proinflammatory events leading to parturition. Progesterone (P4) is known to delay parturition, and to extend gestation in the pregnant mouse by several days. These studies sought to test the hypothesis that P4 delays parturition by maintaining significant levels of IL10 in gestational tissues. METHODS: Using placentas from P4 treated and control pregnant C57BL/6 mice, we assessed the production of IL10 and IL6 in placental tissue. In the treatment arm, pregnant B6 mice were injected with P4 (1mg in 100uL sesame oil) on gestational day (gd) 16-20; controls were injected with 100uL of sesame oil daily until delivery. Treated and control mice were euthanized, and specimens collected on gd 17-20 (with parturition occurring on gd 18-19 in control mice). Samples collected included maternal plasma, fetuses, placentas, and fetal membranes. IL10 and IL6 levels were measures in homogenized placental tissue using ELISA assays; subsequently the cytokine results were normalized for homogenate protein concentration. RESULTS: Samples were collected for 34 mice (25 treated, 9 controls). As expected, control mice delivered on gd 18-19, and P4 treatment prevented parturition to beyond gd 20. In treated mice, P4 not only prevented the anticipated nadir of IL10 at term, but significantly increased IL10 levels in placental tissue (gd18 control = 7.5pg/mg protein vs. gd20 P4 = 9.3pg/mg, p=0.01). A modest increase in IL6 levels also was observed in P4 treated mice by gd 20 (gd17-18 controls = 2.2pg/mg protein vs. gd20 P4 = 3.1pg/mg, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These studies confirm that the prolongation of gestation in P4 treated mice is associated with a sustained increase in IL10 in placental tissue. In contrast, P4 treatment did not prevent a modest increase in IL6 levels during prolonged gestation. Our data support the hypothesis that P4 functions through immunomodulary mechanisms at the level of the placenta to prolong gestation. INTRODUCTION: Abruption is associated with increased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the decidua and chorion. Previously, we and others showed that IL-8 and IL-6, neutrophil and macrophage chemoattractant/activators, respectively, are increased in abruptionrelated preterm birth and that excess thrombin generated from decidual cell expressed tissue factor induces expression of cytokines in cultured decidual cells (DCs). Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) induce leukocyte differentiation. Specifically, granulocyte monocyte (GM)-CSF targets neutrophils and monocytes whereas granulocyte (G)-CSF and monocyte (M)-CSF target neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. We hypothesize that thrombin induces decidual cell mRNA and protein expression of these CSFs to contribute to increased neutrophil and macrophage numbers and activation in the decidua of abruption associated preterm birth. METHODS: Confluent DCs isolated from term placenta were cultured in DME media containing estradiol (E 2 , 10 -8 M) or E 2 +medroxyprogesterone acetate(MPA) for 7 days then switched to serum free media containing E 2 or E 2 +MPA for 24 h. Thereafter, expression of CSFs was evaluated in leukocyte-free term DCs(n=4) incubated with E 2 (10 -8 M; control) or with E 2 +MPA (10 -7 M) to mimic the steroid milieu of pregnancy \u00b1 thrombin(1 IU/mL) for 6 and 24 h followed by qRT-PCR and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure mRNA and secreted levels of CSFs.",

Recently, we found that mice with the odontogenic Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g: an important odontogenic pathogen) infection (P.g mice) could be useful as animal models for chronic inflammation-induced preterm delivery because the average gestational period was 18.3 days (vs 20.5 days in normal mice).

High titred virus was injected intravenously at birth to neonatal female C57BL/6 J-Tyr c-2J mice to achieve luciferase expression predominantly in the liver (to monitor systemic inflammatory response). Luciferase expression was monitored continuously by whole body bioluminescence imaging.

TET2 is a DNA de-methylating enzyme found in leukocytes that enhances gene expression. We hypothesized that TET2 activity is mediated by a protease feed-forward mechanism whereby macrophage and neutrophil secretion of proteases act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to signal TET2 priming of proximal immune cells through protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1). METHODS: THP-1 cells, a monocyte/macrophage-like cell line, were cultured and differentiated into macrophages with PMA. Cells were then treated with heat-killed Lactobacillus crispatus or Fusobacterium nucleatum at 10:1, 50:1 and 100:1 (bacteria:cells) or neutrophil elastase (0.0033, 0.033, and 0.33 U/ml) to generate dose response curves. Experimental groups were also pretreated with PAR-1 inhibitor (1 \u00b5M, SCH-79797). Activation of TET2 was evaluated by its nuclear translocation using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Inflammatory response was evaluated by IL-8 production. RESULTS: Treatment of THP-1 cells with L. crispatus or Fusobacterium showed a dose-response elevation in IL-8, which was inhibited by pretreatment with PAR-1 inhibitor. L. crispatus, a beneficial bacterial species associated with vaginal health, produced a smaller increase in IL-8 than the potential pathogen, Fusobacterium. Concurrent with increases in IL-8 there was a dose-dependent translocation of TET2 from the cytosol to the nucleus, which was prevented by PAR-1 inhibitor. Treatment with elastase also produced a dose-dependent increase in IL-8 and TET2 nuclear translocation, both of which were prevented by PAR-1 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate protease activation of PAR-1 as a critical step in the regulation of inflammation and demonstrate a new protease feed-forward mechanism for innate immune function, presumably via epigenetic mechanisms. Given recent findings that both term and preterm labor are at least in part regulated by inflammation, PAR-1 becomes an attractive therapeutic target. HL069851, P60MD00256 ",

Recent data shows the stroma at the internal os contains about 60% cervical smooth muscle cell (CSMCs) and that these cells may function as a sphincter. We sought to determine if women with a history of PCR have altered CSMC behavior -specifically cell viability and proliferation. METHODS: Using IRB-approved protocols, CSMC were isolated from cervical tissue obtained prior to cerclage from 6 pregnant women (14-16wks) with a history of PCR resulting in preterm birth [PTB] <28 weeks (study group) and 6 gestational-age matched controls (CTL) undergoing pregnancy termination.

Linear regression models based on the methods of generalized estimated equations were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: CSMC from women with a history of PCR exhibited: 1) higher rates of apoptosis vs CTL (73% vs 62% respectively, Fig. 1) and 2) more cells in the G 0 /G 1 phase vs CTL (84% vs 76% respectively, P<0.001) and less cells in the S phase vs CTL (6% vs 10%, respectively, P<0.001) and mitotic phase vs CTL (9% vs 13%, respectively, P<0.001). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: CSMC from women with a history of PCR exhibit decreased cell viability and proliferation compared to women without a history of PCR. Further studies are needed to evaluate how increased CSMC apoptosis may activate premature cervical remodeling. These discoveries will help illuminate understanding of how resident cervical stromal cells such as CSMC may activate cervical remodeling leading to spontaneous preterm birth. (MOD Prematurity Research at PENN) Preterm labor (PTL) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) are immediate causes of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and although these complications are known to be inflammatory syndromes, the physiopathological mechanisms underlying their development are not completely elucidated yet. The transcription factor NF-\u03baB is the major pathway activated during intraamniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) leading to the production of inflammatory mediators that culminate in PTB. Histological chorioamnionitis (hCAM) is an important feature of the IAI commonly observed in PTB. New data support a role for the lysine methyltransferase DOT1L protein (disruptor of telomeric silencing 1 -like protein) as a prominent effector of NF-\u03baB activity. It is possible that differential gene expression of DOT1L could be associated to hCAM. The aim of this study was to compare gene expression of DOT1L in amniochorion membranes from women with or without hCAM that underwent PTB. METHODS: Amniochorion membranes from women with PTB with hCAM (n=22) and without hCAM (n=31) were submitted to total RNA extraction (RNA Spin Mini Isolation -GE) and cDNA was obtained using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression of DOT1L was evaluated by real time PCR using Sybr Green (Applied Biosystems) and PPIA (peptidylprolyl isomerase A) was used as housekeeping gene. Gene expression was calculated using \u2206\u2206Ct method and the results were compared between groups by Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The expression of DOT1L was significantly lower in women who presented hCAM (median 0.99, 0.41-2.30) when compared to those without hCAM (median 1.94, 0.95-4.65) (p=0.048).",

The Raman spectral changes associated with the late ripening and dilation phases have not yet been investigated in mice or humans. Furthermore, the effects of infection-induced (LPS) or progesterone withdrawal-induced (RU486) remodeling compared to term remodeling have not been studied. METHODS: Mice: For LPS or RU486 treated mice, Raman spectra were acquired prior to treatment on gestation day 15 and then every two hours until delivery. Controls were measured starting at noon on gestation day 19 and then every two hours until natural delivery. Human patients: Four pregnant patients scheduled for term labor induction at Vanderbilt Medical Center were recruited in order to observe the most significant amount of changes in the shortest time frame. Raman spectra were measured in four hour intervals before and after labor induction until rupture of membranes. Results were analyzed using generalized linear models for longitudinal data analysis. RESULTS: LPS-treated mice displayed significantly different spectra (p<0.05) over the course of labor compared to the wild type and RU486 mice in regions of the spectrum associated with ECM proteins. The RU486 much more closely mimicked the changes observed in the term group. In the human studies, there was a higher range of variability between subjects, however, broadening of ECM protein peaks was observed as labor progressed. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo Raman spectroscopy has proven sensitive to identifying unique spectral changes in the cervix of preterm birth mouse models compared to term parturition. LPS-treated mice had particularly unique signatures which could be clinically useful for identifying patients with infection-associated preterm labor. Furthermore, spectral changes were observed in the majority of the induction patients as they neared parturition, suggesting that Raman spectroscopy may be a valuable tool for assessing patients with threatened preterm labor.

Compared to miR-neg, the percent of Ecto cells in G0/G1 was increased with miR-143 (76.4 vs 62.2%, p=0.005) and miR-145 (71.8 vs 62.2%, p=0.03) transfection while the percent of cells in S phase (miR-143: p=0.001, miR-145: p=0.025) and G2/M phase (miR-143: p=0.009, miR-145: p=0.004) were decreased by both miRNAs. miR-143 transfected Endo cells resulted in G0/G1 arrest while miR-145 resulted in S phase arrest. Compared to miR-neg, the percent of Endo cells in G0/G1 was increased with miR-143 (78.6 vs 67.6%, p=0.001) and decreased in S phase (p=0.018) and G2/M (p=0.011). The percent of Endo cells in S phase was increased by miR-145 (32.2 vs 21.6%, p=0.02) and decreased in G0/G1 (p=0.023) and G2/M (p=0.015). miR-143 and miR-145 transfected Ecto and Endo cells show significantly decreased expression in several cell cycle regulator genes including CDK1, PRC1, PLK1, CDK6 and CCND2. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that miR-143 and miR-145 contribute to the breakdown of the cervical epithelial barrier by inhibiting cell proliferation at different stages of the cell cycle due to the direct repression of cell cycle regulator genes. These results provide further evidence that miRNAs play a significant role in regulating cervical remodeling and thus could contribute to the premature cervical remodeling associated with PTB.

Quinton W Guerrero, 1 Lindsey C Drehfal, 1 Helen Feltovich, 1,2 Timothy J Hall. 1 1 University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA; 2 Intermountain Healthcare, Provo, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Previous reports of acoustic attenuation values in the cervix had high estimate variance. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy images have demonstrated layers of aligned collagen that vary along the length of the cervix, and accounting for this structural heterogeneity significantly reduces attenuation estimate variance. We have developed a robust ultrasound method that detects the presence of aligned acoustic scattering sources, can quantify their dominant orientation, and can indicate their degree of organization. We report here the first tests of these methods in the human cervix and show that these ultrasound measures appear consistent with attenuation estimates and observations in SHG images of the same specimens. METHODS: Cervix specimens were obtained from premenopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign reasons. There were three groups of women: those unripened (n=5), those experiencing uterine bleeding (ie increased endogenous prostaglandins, n=5), and those given 400 \u00b5g of misoprostol 10-12 hours prior to surgery (ie exogenous prostaglandin administration, n=4). The specimens were positioned with the endocervical canal parallel to the face of an ultrasound transducer and radiofrequency echo signals were collected with the acoustic beams steered from -40 o to +40 o in steps of 4 o . Calibrated power spectra were used to quantify differences in echo signal power with changes in beam steering angle (backscatter anisotropy). The internal os and external os locations were used to group parameter estimates among specimens based on the fractional distance from the external os. Backscatter anisotropy, and the steering angle at which the maximum backscattered power was observed, were used to determine the orientation of the underlying scattering sources (collagen structure). RESULTS: At the distal end, the collagen alignment is parallel to the endocervical canal, but the alignment tilts to about 30 o (consistent with the conjecture of a tightly wound helix) from the mid-distal to proximal end. Total backscattered power does not change significantly along the length of the cervix. There were no significant differences in these parameters with ripened state or parity (consistent with animal models where microstructure breaks down just prior to delivery). CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the presence of spatially-dependent aligned collagen in the cervix and thus promising for monitoring cervical change.",

            "text": "Healing of the Ruptured Amnion: Mechanistic Insights. Haruta Mogami, Jesus F Acevedo, Ruth Ann Word. University of TX Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA. INTRODUCTION: Preterm rupture of membrane (PROM) is a major cause of preterm birth. Clinically, however, there are cases that PROM is spontaneously healed and pregnancy continues until term. These cases of spontaneous healing are usually unrelated to infection. In this study, we created a new in vivo model of non-infectious preterm rupture of membrane, and investigated the mechanisms of healing. METHODS: Uterus and fetal membrane of pregnant mice were punctured with a sterile 26G needle by laparotomy under general anesthesia at 15 days post coitum. In each uterus, \u00bd of gestational sacs were punctured and \u00bd were not (control). Fetal membranes were collected at 2, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after puncture. RESULTS: Significant amounts of amniotic fluid leaked at the time of puncture, and, at each time point of sampling, the volume of amniotic fluid was significantly decreased in punctured group compared with control. Interestingly, membrane puncture did not cause preterm birth. Using stereomicroscopy, closure of puncture sites in the fetal membrane was observed after 72 hours. Healing of amnion was also confirmed histologically. Puncture resulted in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines: IL1\u03b2 (9-fold), IL6 (34-fold), and TNF (20-fold) mRNA after 2 hours. Expression of epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2, which are involved in the healing of adult skin wound healing, however, did not change in mouse fetal membrane. COX2, a rate-limiting enzyme of prostaglandin synthesis, mRNA was also increased by 8-fold at 2 hours. Since amnion is the principal tissue for the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the effect of PGE2 to wound healing was analyzed in primary amnion cells. Interestingly, PGE2 dose-dependently inhibited closure of amnion mesenchymal cells in wound healing scratch assay. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanisms of wound healing differ in fetal amnion compared with adult skin. Whereas Egf,Fgf2, and PGE2 are important mediators of wound healing in adult skin, the growth factors were not expressed in wounded amnion cells, and PGE2 inhibited wound healing in amnion mesenchymal cells. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines was induced dramatically despite the absence of infection. We suggest that our new in vivo PROM model may serve to elucidate the mechanism of healing process of ruptured membranes with or without infection. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is an inflammatory cytokine implicated in the onset of labor. The gap junction protein connexin-43 is thought to influence uterine contractility and is known to be modulated by progesterone. However, the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on connexin-43 expression in uterine smooth muscle cells (UtSMC) has not previously been characterized. Our objective was to investigate the effects of major progestogens on connexin-43 expression in the setting of TNF-\u03b1 induced inflammation in UtSMC. METHODS: Primary human UtSMC were grown to 60-70% confluence after allowing 24 hours for cell adherence. UtSMC were pre-treated with progesterone (P4), 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (HPC), and progesterone metabolites 16\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone (16\u03b1-OHP) and 6\u03b2-hydroxyprogesterone (6\u03b2-OHP) at 1\u00b5M for 24 hours. A subset of UtSMC were exposed to TNF-\u03b1 (10ng/mL) for 2 hours to elicit an acute inflammatory response. UtSMC treated with DMSO +/-TNF-\u03b1 served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Connexin-43 protein levels were determined by western blot over three experiments and densitometry was performed using ImageJ software. Data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's least significant difference test (GraphPad Prism, La Jolla, CA). RESULTS: Connexin-43 protein levels in UtSMC treated with DMSO+TNF-\u03b1 (positive control) demonstrated an 88 +/-32% (mean +/-SEM) increase compared to DMSO-only negative control. TNF-\u03b1 treatment increased connexin-43 protein levels by 33% in the progesterone treatment group and by 25% in the 16\u03b1-OHP treatment group compared to pre-treated UtSMC without TNF-\u03b1 exposure. No significant change in connexin-43 protein levels was observed in the HPC (3% decrease) or 6\u03b2-OHP (<1% decrease) groups. Compared to the DMSO+TNF-\u03b1 (positive control) group, pre-treatment with HPC (p=0.04) and 6\u03b2-OHP (p=0.03), but not progesterone (p=0.14) or 16\u03b1-OHP (p=0.10), significantly mitigated the increase in connexin-43. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-\u03b1 stimulation increases connexin-43 protein expression in UtSMC. The observed increase in connexin-43 was repressed by pre-treatment of UtSMC with specific progestogens (HPC, 6\u03b2-OHP). Progestogen treatment may decrease the ability of TNF-\u03b1 mediated inflammation in human UtSMC to progress to uterine contractility.",

University of Nevada School of Medicine, Reno, NV, USA. INTRODUCTION: Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of physiological processes including parturition. Fluctuations in NO concentration have been hypothesized to contribute to the timing and onset of labor. The role of NO during pregnancy is disparate from other smooth muscles because NO-mediated relaxation in the myometrium is independent of cGMP. Therefore, events such as specific protein S-nitrosation likely mediate the effects of NO in myometrium. We hypothesize that endogenous NO passages cell membranes as glutathione-NO (GSNO) in a transporter-dependent fashion. METHODS: Real time fluorescence spectrometry for visualization of intracellular NO accumulation in the cell following addition of an NO donor was measured using DAF-FM, an NO sensitive fluorophore. Studies were performed on telomerized and freshly isolated uterine smooth muscle cells. A microplate based assay was developed for high throughput screening of DAF-NO fluorescence. Molecular mechanisms for NO-mediated relaxation in myometrium were investigated using blockade of candidate pathways for NO entry. RESULTS: Addition of GSNO to cultured myometrial cells loaded with DAF-FM demonstrated increasing intracellular fluorescence with a time to peak of 3-5 minutes for both freshly isolated and cultured cells. . A fluorescent signal intensity dependent GSNO concentration effect curve was established in the telomerized cell line and for freshly isolated myocytes with an effective concentration 50% of 3 uM. Blockade of the amino acid transporter gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase by acivicin at uM concentrations prevents GSNO-mediated fluorescence in both freshly isolated and cultured myometrial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that endogenous sources of NO may be transported into smooth muscle cells in the form of GSNO via an acivicin-sensitive transport mechanism.",

Current tocolytics used to inhibit uterine contractions, and uterotonics used for PPH, are limited by their short duration of benefit and undesirable off-target effects (primarily vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)). We developed: 1) a dual-addition Ca 2+mobilization assay to allow dual-detection of agonists (uterotonics) of Ca 2+ -mobilization and antagonists (tocolytics) of oxytocin(OT)-induced Ca 2+ -mobilization in a single screen, and 2) a comparative screen for UT-myo selectivity. METHODS: Primary uterine myometrium (UT-myo) cells were isolated from day 19 pregnant mice. A 384-well Ca 2+ -assay (Fluo-4AM) was performed and optimized as a primary high-throughput screening assay. Using an automated Functional Drug Discovery System, cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (vehicle), 10uM atosiban (known antagonist; negative control) or 10\u00b5M compounds, followed by OT (known agonist). Hit-compounds were identified by using Z\u00b4-statistic. Hit-compounds were tested in a comparative screen using primary mouse aorta VSMCs under identical dual-addition assay conditions as the primary screen. The dosereleationship of hit-compounds was examined by performing 10-point, 3-fold titrations in the primary screen RESULTS: This primary assay is robust, reproducible (Z\u00b4=0.73), and displayed excellent performance in a pilot screen of 2,727 compounds from the Spectrum Collection, NIH Clinical I and II Collections. The pilot screen revealed the reliability (n=7) of primary UT-myo cells and a confirmed hit-rate of 1.80% for agonist and 1.39% for antagonist compounds. Concentration-dependent responses of hit-compounds demonstrated an EC 50 \u226410\u00b5M for 7 hit-agonist compounds and 21 hitantagonist compounds. Using a secondary ex vivo assay, we established that four representative hit-antagonists (benzobromarone, dipryidamole, fenoterol and nisoldipine) are potent, selective inhibitors of uterine contractility at different IC 50 values. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies present the first large-scale drug discovery strategy to identify potent and selective small molecules for pre-clinical development aimed at PTL and PPH.",

Yanmin Jiang, 1 Hari Kishore Annavarapu, 1 Patrick W Keller, 1 Robert Garfield, 2 Ruth Ann Word. 1 1 University of TX Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA; 2 GuangZhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China. INTRODUCTION: PGF2\u03b1 is believed to play an important role in myometrial contractions of labor. Since inflammation and progesterone receptor (PR) function represent a common pathway involved in both term and preterm labor, we investigated the mechanisms by which PGs alter myometrial responses to inflammatory stimuli. METHODS: Highly differentiated primary human myometrial cells from nonpregnant and pregnant women were used. Gene expression was analyzed by RT-qPCR. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were analyzed for NFkB (p65), progesterone receptor isoforms, and COX2 by immunoblotting. H3 and \u03b1-tubulin were used to normalize protein input. RESULTS: In myometrial cells, IL-1\u03b2 treatment (0.008 -1 ng/ml for 6 -24 h) increased IL-8 mRNA (500-fold, P<0.01) and COX-2 (55-fold, P<0.01) in a dose-and time-dependent manner. COX-2 protein levels were also increased (40-fold, 6h). Although PGF2\u03b1 (100 \u00b5M) alone increased COX-2 only 2-fold, PGF2\u03b1 amplified IL-1\u03b2-induced increases in COX-2 mRNA (from 55-to 96-fold, p < 0.01) and protein (from 40-to 136-fold). This synergism of PGF2\u03b1 with IL-1\u03b2 was not due to amplified NFkB activation because PGF2\u03b1 did not activate NFKB and even suppressed IL-1-induced nuclear translocation of p65. This suppression of IL-1\u03b2induced NFKB activation was reflected by suppression of IL-1\u03b2-induced increases in Il-8 (from 535-fold to 410-fold, p < 0.01). To determine if PGF2\u03b1-IL-1\u03b2 synergistic activation of COX-2 involved loss of PR, the effect of IL-1\u03b2, PGF2\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2+PGF2\u03b1 on PR-A and -B mRNA and protein was quantified. IL-1\u03b2 suppressed PR mRNA and nuclear PR-A (10-fold) and PR-B (2-fold). PGF2\u03b1 also decreased PR-A (2-fold), but did not alter IL-1\u03b2-induced downregulation of PR appreciably. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that, in myometrial cells, PGF2\u03b1 synergizes with IL-1\u03b2 to increase COX-2 mRNA and protein through NFKB-and PR-independent mechanisms. We conclude, therefore, that prostaglandins modify myometrial responses to inflammatory stimuli through complex cellular pathways. Mechanical strain is an important signal to the pregnant myometrium, which must expand to accommodate the developing fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid. Rapid uterine distension greatly increases the risk of preterm labor (Gardner et al., 1995; Hill et al., 1987; Lackman et al., 2001) and mechanical forces are known to regulate gene expression, cell growth, and contractility (Wu et al., 2008) . We subjected isolated human myometrial tissue to mechanical stretch to identify changes in the phosphoproteome of pregnant human myometrial cells in response to mechanical stretch. We detected several components of the mTOR signaling pathway that were differentially phosphorylated in response to stretch. Since recent literature has implicated mTOR signaling in regulating birth timing (Hirota et al., 2011) , we performed experiments to test the following hypotheses: 1) mTOR signaling increases in response to stretch in pregnant human myometrial cells and tissue and 2) alterations in myometrial mTOR activity might be associated with some cases of preterm labor. METHODS: . Uterine biopsies were obtained with IRB approval and written informed consent from mothers undergoing Cesarean section and transported to the laboratory in physiological buffer for immediate processing. Freshly isolated term myometrial tissue was frozen immediately or dissected into strips and mounted vertically in tissue baths and tested for the ability to contract in response to KCl. Strips were left unstretched or stretched to 10g tension and snap frozen. Telomerized pregnant human uterine smooth muscle cells (PHUSMC-hTRT) were grown in the presence of estrogen and progesterone and submitted to biaxial stretch. Protein was extracted from cells and tissue and mTOR expression and phosphorylation was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: We confirmed phosphorylation of mTOR in response to mechanical stretch in both human myometrial tissue and cultured myometrial cells (p<0.05).We observed increased mTOR expression in samples from term laboring, term nonlaboring, preterm laboring, and preterm nonlaboring myometrium compared to nonpregnant myometrium. but did not observe significant changes in phospho-mTOR between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest human myometrial cells respond to mechanical stretch by activation of mTOR signaling. Labor is characterized by a shift from a quiescent uterus to an activated uterus, with increased myometrial sensitivity to uterotonins (e.g. oxytocin). This activation is led by uterine activation proteins (UAPs), which are a family of proteins essential for labor and delivery. UAPs are promising targets for the prevention of preterm birth (PTB). We hereby describe a novel UAP, Neuromedin U Receptor 2 (NmU-R2). METHODS: Gestational tissue biopsies from pregnant women were used to study the expression of NmU-R2 and its ligands neuromedin U (NmU) and neuromedin S (NmS) whereas pregnant mice were used to explore the role and mechanism of action of NmU-R2. RESULTS: NmU-R2, NmU and NmS are found to be expressed in human gestational tissues and their expression considerably increases with gestation age and labor. NmU is uterotonic ex vivo in murine tissues, and dose-dependently triggers labor by acting specifically via NmU-R2. The uterine expression of NmU and to a greater extent of NmS and NmU-R2 rises near term, to peak during labor, and rapidly decreases postpartum; accordingly, contractile effects of NmU increase with gestational age. NmU-and NmS-induced contraction is associated with increased receptor-coupled Ca ++ transients in myometrial smooth muscle cells. NmU-R2 and NmS are upregulated in vivo in response to pro-inflammatory IL-1\u03b2. Concordantly, in vivo knock-down of NmU-R2 prevents pro-inflammatory LPS-induced PTB. Consistently, LPS also induced NmS expression in human cytotrophoblast; correspondingly decidua of women with chorioamnionitis that delivered vaginally preterm had significantly higher expression of NmS compared to those without chorioaminonitis. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our data suggest an important role for NmU-R2 and its ligands NmU and NmS in term labor and PTB triggered by chorioamnionitis. NmU-R2 therefore represents an interesting target for the prevention of PTB.",

Jaclyn M Ferro, 1,2 Sasha Sabir, 1,2 Jocelyn Tolentino, 1,2 Avi Hameroff, 1,2 Mudar Dalloul, 1 Cassandra Charles, 1 Ozgul Muneyyirci-Delale. 1,2 1 SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA; 2 Kings County Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: Several studies have observed a decrease in placental production of progesterone in patients who develop preeclampsia (PREE). 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC) is currently used in the prevention of preterm delivery; however it may potentially negate the inflammatory factors that have been implicated in PREE by maintaining normal progesterone levels. In this study, we examined the incidence of PREE, pregnancy outcomes and morbidities in patients at risk for preterm delivery receiving progesterone supplementation (P4) throughout the course of their pregnancy compared to controls who did not. METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective chart review of women with singleton gestations who took P4 injections secondary to a risk of preterm delivery during their pregnancy and those who did not receive P4 were selected at random without knowing the outcome of their pregnancy to serve as controls. Multiple pregnancy-related variables were collected and assessed. Data were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t-test, Chisquare and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Study population of 88 pregnant women between the ages of 18 and 43 years: 58 who received P4 and 30 controls who didn't. There was no statistical significance difference in demographics between the two groups. None of the subjects were noted to have developed gestational hypertension, while 9.1% developed gestational diabetes mellitus. During labor, the P4 group had a lower maximum systolic blood pressure (p=0.0146) and a lower maximum diastolic blood pressure (p<0.001) than the control group. Patients who received P4 during their pregnancy were less likely to develop PREE (p=0.0036). At the time of delivery, there was a statistically significant difference in gestational age observed between both groups (p=0.0053).On average, the progesterone group delivered at 37.0 + 4.4 weeks of gestation versus the control group at 39.4 + 1.4 weeks of gestation. CONCLUSIONS: Progesterone supplementation demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure and a decrease in the incidence of preeclampsia in pregnancy. These findings suggest progesterone supplementation may be a potential utility for the prevention of preeclampsia in patients at increased risk for its development. Additional investigations need to be executed with a larger study to fortify these results.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-specific syndrome characterized by placental dysfunction, an angiogenic imbalance and hypercoagulability. In sera from women with PE, levels of thrombomodulin (TM) are downregulated. TM is essential for the maintenance of endothelium; it inhibits inflammatory pathways and coagulation. TM dysregulation causes inflammatory disorders and thromboembolism. Women pregnant after oocyte donation (OD) have a higher risk to develop PE. The pathophysiology of PE presumably differs between autologous pregnancies and OD pregnancies. We aimed to investigate TM expression in placentas from patients with PE after OD, and in placentas from women with healthy, autologous pregnancies and from women with healthy OD pregnancies, and correlate this with parameters of inflammation and coagulation. METHODS: Placentas from 57 OD pregnancies were studied, of which 15 pregnancies were complicated by PE. Placentas from 40 healthy autologous pregnancies were collected as controls. Immunohistochemical staining for TM was performed and syncytiotrophoblast staining patterns were scored as diffuse, focal or absent. Placental mRNA expression was measured for TM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), Factor VIII (FVIII) and tissue factor (TF) with qPCR. RESULTS: TM protein expression was lower in the placenta in OD pregnancies compared with autologous pregnancies (p<0.001). TM protein expression in OD pregnancies was more frequently decreased in women with PE (68.8%) compared to women without PE (56.1%). Placental mRNA expression of TM was 2-fold lower in women with PE after OD compared with both control groups (P<0.005). Placental TM mRNA expression correlated positively with ICAM1, FVIII and TF. CONCLUSIONS: Placental TM protein expression is downregulated in pregnancies with and without PE after OD, and placenta TM mRNA expression is downregulated in pregnancies complicated by PE after OD. Downregulation of TM in OD pregnancies suggests a possible mechanism that causes a higher predisposition for PE in OD pregnancies. The correlation of TM with ICAM, FVIII and TF suggests that this might be caused by dysregulation of anti-coagulation and antiinflammatory mechanisms. This study shows the relevance of endothelial maintenance in placental pathology in OD; further research on the role of vasculoprotective proteins in OD and in the development of placental pathology is warranted.",

Hua Lou, 1,2 Juanjuan Wu, 1 Augustine Rajakumar, 1 Neil Sidell. 1 1 Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; 2 Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is a major complication of pregnancy in which the placenta is known to have shallow implantation into the decidua. Studies have implicated sFlt1, a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor protein, in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia through its ability to bind with VEGF and thereby neutralize its angiogenic functions. Although many studies have been carried out involving the levels of sFlt1 in the villous placenta, its presence and action in the endometrium has, to our knowledge, not been reported. In this study, we are seeking to understand the regulation and action of sFlt1 in human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) Aim: To investigate sFlt's potential regulation during in vitro decidualization METHODS: sFlt levels were assessed by Western blot or ELISA in the culture supernatant of primary and immortalized HESC. Decidualization of HESC was induced by adding a cocktail of estrogen, progesterone and cAMP (EPC) for 4, 8 and 12 days. sFlt1 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: sFlt1 was detected in the culture supernatant of HESC. sFlt1 production was totally abrogated during decidualization induced by the EPC cocktail. This effect coincided with an increased production of VEGF and prolactin, and cellular morphology changes characteristic of the decidualization. Although estrogen and progesterone are critical players during decidualization, our results indicated that cAMP is the dominant factor which causes suppression of sFlt production; both dibutyryl-cAMP and 8-bromo-cAMP alone significantly inhibited sFlt by 4 days, with complete loss of detection by day 8. Consistent with these in vitro results, we found that decidua isolated from placental basal plate tissue after normal pregnancy produced much less sFlt compared with non-decidualized HESC (isolated from the endometrium of nonpregnant woman). CONCLUSIONS: HESC synthesize and secrete measurable quantities of sFlt1 that is downregulated during decidualization as a result of increased intracellular cAMP levels. These findings may have important implications in diseases such as preeclampsia that involve abnormal decidualization and angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface. Studies are underway to understand the precise mechanisms of sFlt1 reduction by cAMP in the endometrium.",

Benjamin P Luscher, 1,2 Camilla Marini, 1,2,3 Daniel V Surbek, 1,2 Marc Baumann. 1,2 1 University Hospital of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 2 University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 3 University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. INTRODUCTION: High uric acid levels during pregnancy could lead to the development of gestational diseases, such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and gestational diabetes. Moreover the risk for the child to develop diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases is increased too in these conditions. Unfortunately, the role of the main placental uric acid transporter GLUT9 and the effect of uric acid on placental and foetal development are still not well understood. Our study wants to shed new insights into the role of GLUT9 for placental uric acid transport in order to consider GLUT9 like a possible target to develop novel drugs to reduce gestational diseases following hyperuricemia. METHODS: To understand the effect of foetal hyperuricemia on foetal and placental development we use a systemic GLUT9 KO mouse model. Six-week-old female GLUT9 (+/-) mice, maintained on regular chow diet, were mated with GLUT9 (+/-) male mice. After the mating the diet was changed to regular chow diet plus inosine, which lead to hyperuricemia in GLUT9 (-/-) foetuses, but not in the mothers. At postnatal day 8 we weighted the pups daily to check their development. RESULTS: We observed a normal Mendel ratio for the pups from the mating of heterozygous parents. The GLUT9 KO pups have a significant reduced body weight, starting from postnatal day 12, compared to the wild type and heterozygous pups. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of the foetus to high uric acid levels leads to differential postnatal weight development. This indicates that uric acid has the potential to affect the foetus and its development after birth. This observation contributes to the hypothesis that uric acid is not just a side product of pre-eclampsia but actively contributes to the effect of the disease leading to abnormal development in mice.",

            "text": "The lack of uniform recurrence of preeclampsia despite evidence of familial inheritance remains an enigma. We have suggested that pregnancy initiates vascular remodeling that reduces risk for recurrent hypertensive disease when the inter-pregnancy interval is short. Here we hypothesized that the interval between pregnancies would be inversely associated with mean arterial pressure differences, across trimesters, when the first pregnancy is complicated by preeclampsia. METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of existing medical records. We reviewed records of 172 nulliparous women diagnosed with preeclampsia who went on to have a second pregnancy at our institution. We examined factors that could influence blood pressure and risk of preeclampsia including maternal age, BMI, smoking and associated medical disorders. We recorded blood pressure from each pregnancy, segregated by trimester, and noted recurrence of hypertensive complications. Antepartum mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was compared between pregnancies examining differences as a function of interpregnancy interval. RESULTS: Overall inter-pregnancy interval (IPI) was negatively associated with reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between pregnancies (p=0.04). MAP during the third trimester decreased significantly between first and second pregnancies across all subject groups (IPI <24 months: -5.7 mm Hg, p<0.0001; IPI 24-48 months: -4.5 mmHg, p<0.0001; IPI >48 months -3.4 mm Hg: p=0.03). The recurrence rate of preeclampsia did not vary significantly with inter-pregnancy interval (p=0.21), although the trend was towards greater recurrence with greater inter-pregnancy interval. CONCLUSIONS: The interval between pregnancies, when the first pregnancy is complicated by preeclampsia, influences MAP in the second pregnancy. Shorter IPI resulted in greater reduction in MAP. This evidence of vascular remodeling, and the associated increase in vascular compliance, could contribute to the reduced risk of recurrent preeclampsia when the inter-pregnancy interval is short. Smoking in pregnancy has been associated with a reduction in the risk of preeclampsia (PE). We sought to determine if there is a significant difference in maternal mean arterial pressures (MAP) across pregnancy for women who quit smoking compared to those who continue to smoke. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, we examined the medical records of 215 women who completed a series of prospective, randomized smoking cessation studies examining the efficacy of contingency management on smoking cessation during pregnancy. We excluded women lost to follow-up, with multiple gestation, incomplete records, or blood pressures retrievable from only a single trimester. We identified blood pressure measurements throughout pregnancy and calculated average MAP for gestational age in3 week intervals. Differences in MAP among the quit status groups (defined as first trimester quit (Q1), second trimester quit (Q2), third trimester quit (Q3) and continued smoking (CS)), were examined over gestational intervals using repeated measures analysis of covariance. Covariates included BMI, preexisting hypertension and diabetes. Statistical significance was defined as P<.05. RESULTS: Women from all quit status groups demonstrated increased MAP with advancing pregnancy (p<.001). There was an impact of the timing of smoking cessation on this pattern (p=.02). MAP at term (>37 weeks) of women who quit smoking in the first trimester was found to be significantly higher than those who quit in the second or third trimesters and those who continued to smoke (Q1: 97.4 + 2.6, Q2: 87.8 + 1.6, Q3: 84.6 + 2.4, CS: 86.0 + 0.8 mm Hg, mean + s.e.m.). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking cessation during the first trimester of pregnancy is significantly associated with increased MAP at term. This finding is consistent with the reduction in term PE associated with maternal smoking and suggests a reversible component.",

INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is the major disorder of human pregnancy manifested by pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria, and in severe cases, by renal and liver failure. PE affects 5-8% of all pregnancies, causing nearly 40% of premature births worldwide. The pathological process of PE begins with shallow trophoblast invasion and reduced uteroplacental perfusion that results in angiogenic imbalance and maternal systemic inflammatory response. There is growing evidence for involvement of bioactive lipids, ceramide (Cer) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and their synthetic/metabolic enzymes in trophoblast differentiation & invasion, placental angiogenesis; all cellular and physiological processes necessary to establish healthy placenta.We hypothesize that dysregulation of Cer-S1P rheostat during early placentation process may have effect on downstream signaling under hypoxia and may contribute to the onset of the disease. METHODS: Hypoxia was induced in JAR cells and human chorionic explants by oxygen deprivation (1% & 8% O2) for 3, 6, 16 and 24 hours. Protein and mRNA levels were determined by Western blot and real-time PCR. NSMase activity was measured by HPLC using exogenous substrate C6-NBD-sphingomyelin. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that synthetic/metabolic pathways of S1P and Cer are altered in human term placentae and chorionic villous explants of PE patients as compared to control subjects. Sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) and S1P receptors (S1PR1, -3) mRNA and protein are down-regulated in PE placentae and villous explants, suggesting that they might be involved in challenged angiogenesis in PE. Furthermore, SPHK1 is strongly up-regulated in our in vitro and in vivo models of placental hypoxia (1% O2), pointing to the potential role of SPHK1 pathway in human early placentation process. On the other hand, ceramide synthase 5 (CerS5) of de novo pathway is up-regulated in PE placentae, while neutral sphingomyelinase expression and enzymatic activity is decreased in PE placental speicemen. These results suggest that pro-apoptotic Cer is augmented via de novo pathway in PE complicated pregnancies, while NSMase-derived ceramide may serve other functions. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that bioactive sphingolipids and their synthetic/metabolic pathways may contribute to pathogenesis of preeclampsia and may serve in the future as novel early biomarkers of this disease.",

Tu'uhevaha J Kaitu'u-Lino, Roxanne Hastie, Fiona C Brownfoot, Natalie J Hannan, Ping Cannon, Laura Tuohey, Stephen Tong. Dept of O&G, University of Melbourne, Heidelberg, Australia. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy associated with increased placental secretion of anti-angiogenic factor sFlt1. We have previously shown Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) is reduced in preeclamptic placentas, and silencing ATF3 increases sFlt1 production. Surprisingly, silencing ATF3 only affected sFlt-1 protein secretion, but did not affect sFlt1 mRNA expression. This suggests the effects of ATF3 on sFlt1 release may be mediated via a post-transcriptional mechanism. We examined whether ATF3 affects the expression of Rab11a and Arf1, proteins previously been shown to be involved in sFlt-1 transport out of JEG3 (trophoblast) cells. METHODS: Brefeldin A, a chemical blocker of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi protein transport was administered to primary trophoblast at increasing doses (0-10nM) and sFlt1 secretion assessed by ELISA. To assess whether Rab11a and Arf1 are critical to sFlt1 release in primary trophoblast, they were both silenced using siRNAs. sFlt1 secretion was measured by ELISA, and sFlt1 mRNA measured by qPCR. Furthermore we silenced ATF3 expression in primary trophoblast and measured Rab11a and Arf1 mRNA expression. RESULTS: Adding Brefeldin A to primary trophoblast dose-dependently reduced sFlt1, confirming that sFlt1 secretion is regulated via Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport in primary placental cells. Silencing both cargo proteins reduced sFlt-1 secretion: silencing Rab11a reduced sFlt-1 secretion by 40% from baseline, but did not change sFlt-1 mRNA expression, and silencing Arf1 reduced sFlt-1 secretion by 35%. Intriguingly, silencing ATF3 in primary trophoblast significantly increased Arf1 and Rab11a mRNA expression, as expected (Figure 1 ). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: ATF3 increases sFlt1 secretion by inhibiting the expression of the cargo proteins Rab11a and Arf1 in primary trophoblast. Hence, we have identified a post-transcriptional mechanism of sFlt-1 regulation likely to occur in preeclampsia: reduced ATF3 expression derepresses Rab11a and Arf1, leading to increased sFlt-1 secretion. INTRODUCTION: Sdc1, a transmembrane proteoglycan of the endothelial glycocalyx, regulates inflammation and angiogenesis, and is a marker of endothelial damage. Maternal serum Sdc1 increases during normal pregnancy, with higher levels in HELLP syndrome. Decreased placental Sdc1 observed in preeclampsia(PE) and fetal growth restriction(FGR) may be associated with abnormal trophoblastic invasion. We previously identified the normal range for 1st trimester Sdc1 levels, but the association of Sdc1 with APOs is unknown. We hypothesized that 1st trimester serum Sdc1 would be aberrant in women with APOs compared to controls.",

Cases (APOs, n=119) were included for singleton pregnancies with PE or FGR who delivered at 20-36 6/7wks and had 1st trimester screens by PerkinElmer/NTD labs with stored blood cards. Exclusions: cancer, placenta accreta, and chronic hypertension <20 wks. For each case, 2 controls (n=238) were identified at the same gestational week and ethnicity. Sdc1 levels were assessed by ELISA (R&D Systems . We previously reported increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunostaining in the glomeruli of a mouse model of PE with renal endotheliosis and proteinuria, demonstrated by VE-cadherin fragments in the urine. This suggests VEGF may disrupt glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) barrier function leading to proteinuria. We hypothesize 1) VEGF staining is elevated in glomerular endotheliosis in a mouse model of PE, 2) GEnCs have VEGF receptors and surface proteins common to endothelial adherens and tight junctions. 3) That GEnCs exposed to VEGF demonstrate degradation of barrier function. METHODS: Histo/cytochemistry: Kidneys from pregnant \u2640hAGT x \u2642hREN transgenic crosses were fixed at D17, when proteinuria and glomerular endotheliosis are also observed, and stained for VEGF using a standard protocol. GEnCs from female C57BL/6 mice (Creative Bioarray) were incubated with antibodies to VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VE-cadherin, connexin-43, ZO-1, or alpha-catenin. Protein expression was analyzed by western blot. GEnC were grown on 96 well electrode plates and treated with VEGF. Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) system monitoring continued for 24 hours post treatment RESULTS: Glomerular VEGF staining was elevated in the kidney of a mouse model of PE compared to controls at D17. In control GEnCs, immunocytochemistry and western blotting confirmed the presence of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and junctional proteins known to be sensitive to VEGFR2 mediated degradation. Preliminary ECIS data shows that GEnC barrier resistance is decreased by 20% following VEGF treatment. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in VEGF staining in conjunction with glomerular endotheliosis and VE-cadherin fragments in the urine suggests VEGF signaling may play a role in the development of proteinuria in a mouse model of PE. Preliminary findings suggest VEGF receptors and junctional proteins mediate endothelial barrier function and VEGF may be involved in deterioration of the cell barrier as demonstrated by the ECIS system with VEGF treatment in GEnC. We will examine cytochemical changes that parallel the loss in barrier function following VEGF treatment and use these assays to identify drugs capable of rescuing GEnC monolayer integrity. ",

Whereas the MMPinhibitor GM6001 reduced bigET-mediated constriction by 46% in uterine arteries from wild-type mice, the effect of GM6001 was ablated when Treg cells were depleted. Maximal ET-1-induced constriction in the uterine artery was similar for control and Treg-depleted mice (% of phenylephrine maximal constriction, wild-type+DT: 108.0\u00b16.3, Foxp3-DTR+DT: 92.25\u00b110.94; P=0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Treg cell depletion caused increased fetal resorption but did not affect uterine artery blood flow velocity. Contrary to our hypothesis, MMP-induced conversion of bigET-1 to active ET-1 was reduced only in wild-type mice, suggesting dysregulation of the bigETmediated conversion pathways following Treg depletion. Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt1) and its soluble form, sFlt1, are generated by alternative splicing, and multiple splice variants of sFlt1 have been reported in the placenta -primarily sFlt1-i13 and sFlt1-e15a (also known as sFlt1-14). Although increase in placental sFlt1 production has been implicated as a cause of preeclampsia, the different cell types that produce these splice variants both in normal and preeclamptic placentas are not fully characterized. METHODS: Placental bed biopsies from around the center of the placenta and full-thickness placental samples were collected from preeclamptic (n=12) and gestational age-matched normal (n=15) subjects undergoing cesarean section delivery. Flt1, sFlt1-i13, and sFlt1-e15a mRNAs from basal plate and different regions of placenta were analyzed by qRT-PCR, and frozen tissue sections were examined for localization of thesemRNAs by in situ hybridization (ISH). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for identification of trophoblasts (cytokeratin 7) and proliferating cells (Ki-67). RESULTS: qPCR analysis revealed that sFlt1-i13 is the most abundantly expressed sFlt1 transcript in the placenta and that the levels of both sFlt1-i13 (p<0.01) and sFlt1-e15a (p<0.05) are significantly higher in the basal plate than in the villous regions. Although both sFlt1-i13 and sFlt1-e15a levels were significantly increased in preeclampsia, primarily in the basal plates, the sFlt1-i13 level was 4.2-fold higher than that of sFlt1-e15a. ISH results were consistent with the qPCR data, with the most abundant expression of sFlt1-i13 mRNA in extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) in the basal plate and a dramatic increase in signal intensity in EVTs at the basal plate in preeclamptic samples. sFlt1-i13 and sFlt1-e15a mRNAs were also expressed in the villous region, but the signals were highly focal. There were also significant (p<0.01) increases in cellularity, proliferation index (Ki-67-positive cells), and thickness of the sFlt1-expressing EVT cell layer in the basal plate in preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sFlt1-i13 is the most abundantly expressed sFlt1 transcript in the placenta and that the expansion of the sFlt1-i13-producing EVT layer in the basal plate in preeclampsia is the primary contributor to the increases in sFlt1 levels in preeclampsia.

After 72hr, supernatants were collected and measured by ELISA for the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8; and the Nalp3 agonist, uric acid. RESULTS: aPL alone increased trophoblast IL-1\u03b2 secretion by 2.6\u00b10.3fold compared to the NT control (p<0.001), while MDP alone had no effect on IL-1\u03b2. aPL and MDP in combination significantly and synergistically augmented trophoblast IL-1\u03b2 secretion to 6.9\u00b11.0 fold compared to aPL alone (p<0.001). aPL alone significantly increased trophoblast uric acid by 1.4-fold compared to the control (p<0.001). MDP had no effect on trophoblast uric acid, ether alone or in combination with aPL. aPL alone significantly increased trophoblast IL-8 secretion by 2.5\u00b10.3 fold compared to the control; MDP alone had a similar effect increasing IL-8 secretion by 2.0\u00b10.2-fold (p<0.001). Together, aPL and MDP had an additive effect by significantly increasing IL-8 secretion by 1.7\u00b10.2-fold compared to aPL alone (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial MDP sensitizes the trophoblast to aPL, leading to an exaggerated IL-1\u03b2 response, and contributes to increased IL-8 secretion. MDP-augmented aPL-driven IL-1\u03b2 secretion is triggered downstream of uric acid production. Together, our data suggests that a bacterial infection at the maternal-fetal interface may exacerbate the impact aPL have on placental inflammation and, thus, on pregnancy outcome. were significantly higher in the PE group than the GH and NC groups, both as an absolute value (medians 16, 6 and 8 mg/dL; p=0.012) and as an A1M/creatinine ratio >13 mg/g (66.7%, 9.1% and 35%; p=0.01).

The parent trial included singleton gestations without suspected anomalies and excluded those with baseline chronic hypertension; 5 patients were lost to follow-up in the parent trial. The current study included all women with outcome data in the parent trial kept in their original intention to treat groups by 17-OHPC exposure. The incidence of our primary outcome, a composite of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, was compared between exposure groups. We further assessed the incidence of delivery for HDP.

Epidemiological investigations have shown an association between treatment with SSRIs/SNRIs and congenital heart defects. However, these effects are controversial and the underlying molecular pathway remains unclear. The placenta serves as an early source of serotonin, which is critical in fetal development. We hypothesized that treatment with venlafaxine (the most prescribed SNRI) during pregnancy increases risks of fetal heart defects and alters placental and fetal heart serotonin system METHODS: Timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged daily with venlafaxine hydrochloride (0, 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day; n = 13-22) from gestation day (GD) 8 to 20.

We found a net placental uptake of cholesterol from HDL but not LDL. The arterio-venous difference for HDL was 0.014 (SD 0.04) mmol/l, p<0,001 and for LDL 0.016 (SD 0.13) mmol/l, p=0,178. CONCLUSIONS: A gestational change in maternal HDL cholesterol, but not in LDL, is an independent determinant of placental and birth weights. An increase in HDL cholesterol was associated with birth weight less than average, whereas a decrease in HDL cholesterol was associated with birth weight above average. In line with these findings a net placental uptake of HDL cholesterol was found, but unexpectedly no uptake of LDL. We suggest that maternal HDL is a major source of exogenous cholesterol in the human placenta. Maternal BMI is a determinant of neonatal body fat, which differs between the genders. Pregnancy is characterized by physiological metabolic adaptations such as gestational weight gain, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. These adaptions are modified by maternal BMI.

IUGR fetal livers also have increased LDHA and PDK4 expression, yet metabolites associated with lactate production and decreased glucose oxidation have not been measured. We hypothesized that IUGR livers would have increased uptake of lactate and glucogenic amino acids and decreased substrate oxidation that support HGP. METHODS: Placental insufficiency and IUGR fetal sheep were produced by exposure of ewe to hyperthermia. We used NMR metabolomics in control (CON) and IUGR fetal livers collected after saline infusion or 3h insulin-clamp (n=4 each). We used chronic hepatic catheters to measure blood flow and net flux of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, amino acids, and oxygen across the left liver lobe in CON (n=7) and IUGR (n=4) fetuses. RESULTS: IUGR fetuses weighed 40% less and had lower oxygen and plasma glucose and insulin and higher lactate levels (P<0.05). IUGR livers had decreased concentrations of adenine+adenosine, nucleotides, choline, glutathione, succinate, acetate, and Glu and increased Gln, Ala, lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, branched chain amino acids (BCAA), and bile acids (P<0.05). Insulin-clamp CON and IUGR livers had decreased concentrations of glucose, acetate, and Asp and increased creatine and choline (P<0.05). Hepatic blood flow, adjusted for liver weight, was not different, yet hepatic oxygen uptake was 50% lower in IUGR fetuses (P<0.05). IUGR fetuses had hepatic glucose output (-10 umol/min/100g) whereas CON fetuses had hepatic glucose uptake (12 umol/min/100g, P<0.05). There were no differences in hepatic lactate uptake or pyruvate release. IUGR fetuses had decreased hepatic uptake of Gly, Ala, Met, Leu, Phe, and Lys (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased hepatic oxygen uptake in the IUGR fetus supports decreased substrate oxidation, consistent with lower uptake rates of amino acids, nucleotides (energy status), and TCA cycle metabolites (succinate, acetate). Increased hepatic concentrations of lactate, Ala, Glu, Gln, and BCAA during saline and insulin-clamp conditions support persistent HGP. We speculate that glucogenic substrates are produced or alternatively metabolized in the liver, spared from oxidation, and used to fuel HGP in the IUGR fetus. Repetitive UCOs with worsening acidemia are associated with increased risk of fetal brain injury and lasting neurological deficits. Existing non-invasive methods for detection of fetal acidemia are not reliable. Hence, new approaches to understanding fetal cardiovascular and metabolic responses to labour-like UCOs are needed to develop and refine our detection tools.",

Figure 2 depicts metabolic changes over several hours, matching experimental values. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Our model successfully reproduces salient features observed in fetal sheep experiments of UCO including FHR biphasic behaviour, MABP and pH decline, and increased levels of lactate and CO2. We demonstrate the dependence of acidosis on the total duration of UCOs, rather than individual events, matching experimental evidence. The simplified metabolic model is able to reproduce measured changes in pH, lactate, and glucose in continuous time, rather than through intermittent sampling. In an ovine model of maternal stress, maternal treatment with 1mg/kg/day cortisol beginning at day 120 of gestation resulted in hyperplastic fetal hearts with Purkinje cell apoptosis at 130d gestation and increased stillbirth at term (~145 days). Gene expression changes indicate altered glucose metabolism and decreased mitochondria in the heart. Epicardial adipose tissue (EPAT) and the heart share a common blood supply. We hypothesized that deleterious endocrine and metabolic effects in EPAT occur. These may contribute to cardiac dysfunction and fetal demise in the face of increased fetal cortisol or altered substrates due to maternal hypercortisolemia and hyperglycemia. METHODS: EPAT from fetuses of cortisol treated (CORT) or vehicle (CON) ewes were immunostained for the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (Abcam ab46545) (n=9/group) and transcriptomic analysis of EPAT (n=8 CON, 7 CORT) were performed. qPCR confirmed the transcriptomic results. Transcriptomic data obtained using Agilent products and methods were analyzed with R with modeling in Webgestalt and Cytoscape. P<0.05 was accepted as significant with adjustment for multiple testing in the transcriptomic analyses. RESULTS: Lipid peroxidation staining, expressed as % of total EPAT area, was increased in CORT vs CON from 16\u00b11 to 23\u00b13%. Of 185 differentially regulated genes, the 83 upregulated genes are associated with immune function, (e,g. macrophage differentiation, complementcoagulation) and negative regulation of fatty acid transport, but neither adipocyte size nor the number of macrophages in EPAT was altered by CORT. The downregulated genes are associated with protein metabolism e.g. translation, protein localization to organelle but response to fructose stimulus was also an overrepresented biological process in these genes. Endocrine responses in EPAT to CORT were not apparent. CONCLUSIONS: CORT increased lipid peroxidation and immune activation in fetal EPAT. Complement components of adipose tissue have been linked to decreased insulin dependent fatty acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis (Gauvreau et al Mol. Immunol. 51 (2012) 73-81). We conclude that maternal stress may predispose the fetal heart to damage from lipid peroxidation products and increased fatty acids in the coronary circulation. Reduction of oxygen content of inspired gas in pregnant sheep decreases both maternal and fetal partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2). The reflex chemoreceptor response in the mother stimulates hyperventilation, which decreases arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in mother and fetus. We have previously reported that, 1 hour after the onset of a 30 min period of hypoxia (HH, reduction in fetal PaO2 to approximately 10 mm Hg), there was an increase in gene expression in the fetal hypothalamus that reflected immune activation and inflammation. We designed the present experiment to quantify gene expression in toll-like receptor pathways involved in the inflammatory response 1 day after the HH and whether ketamine, a known antagonist of the NMDA receptor, ameliorates the inflammatory response. METHODS: Using chronically-catheterized, time-dated, pregnant ewes and their fetuses, we induced 30 min of hypoxia (98 to 56 mmHg in mother and 17 to 10 mm Hg in fetus) by infusion of nitrogen into the maternal trachea. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after the stimulus, and fetal tissues were dissected and snap-frozen. Fetal brains were bisected, with half subjected to further regional dissection and half fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. After extraction of mRNA, Real-time PCR was used to detect abudance of mRNA for 14 genes (CXCL10, CD14, TLR2, TLR4, NFKB1, MYD88, TNF, IL1B,  PTGS2, CRH, CASP8, OAS1 , NFKBIA, PTX3) using specific primers. RESULTS: Ketamine treatment alone (in normoxic fetuses) reduced mRNA abundance for TLR2, TLR4, MYD88, and PTGS2 in the fetal hypothalamus. HH increased the mRNA abundance of CXCL10, TLR2, CD14, NFKBIA, IL1B, PTGS2, CRH, and CASP8 * Figure(s) will be available online.",

(pCRH) is an area of interest and importance because the amount and rate of change in pCRH production over pregnancy is associated with pregnancy and child health outcomes. Unlike in the case of the HPA-axis, cortisol is hypothesized to regulate pCRH production in a feed-forward manner. Therefore, our objective was to examine the association of maternal cortisol in mid gestation with the pCRH production from mid to late gestation. METHODS: 118 participants in a prospective cohort study of pregnancy and birth outcomes were assessed between 12-20 weeks and 32-35 weeks gestation. At visit 1 maternal saliva samples were collected over 4 consecutive days: at awakening, +30 and +60 minutes post awakening, noon, 4pm and 8pm for quantification of maternal free (unbound) cortisol. The cortisol area under the curve (AUC) using all samples (except the +30 and +60 samples) was calculated for each day and averaged across all 4 days. pCRH was measured by RIA in maternal blood collected at visits 1 and 2. The relationship of maternal cortisol with pCRH was evaluated using multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: Higher maternal cortisol (AUC) in the second trimester was associated with higher pCRH in the third trimester (standardized beta [\u03b2]=0.19, p=0.02), as well as with a greater increase in pCRH from the second to third trimester (\u03b2=0.20, p=0.02). These relationships remained significant after adjusting for weeks gestation at biosample collection, as well as maternal age, income, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, obstetric complications, and sex of the baby. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that maternal cortisol regulates human placental CRH production in a positive manner, thereby supporting a linkage between stress-related physiology in the maternal and fetal compartments. INTRODUCTION: Fetal infection is a major contributor to brain injury with neurodevelopmental sequelae. It is crucial to develop treatments for at-risk fetuses. This requires understanding the dynamics of fetal immune response to infection. We studied the effects of perturbation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) in fetal sheep. We hypothesized that the up regulation of CAP will suppress the inflammatory responses secondary to noxious stimuli, thereby, diminishing the likelihood of antenatal brain injury. METHODS: Chronically instrumented near-term ovine fetuses were given NaCl (n=9) or LPS IV (400 or 800 ng/d for 2d, n=12 and 5, respectively) and monitored 54h for changes in cardiovascular responses, ileum/cerebral blood flow (CBF, using colour microsphere technique), and systemic inflammation (IL-6, ELISA). To down regulate CAP, fetuses underwent bilateral cervical vagotomy (Vx) followed by LPS400 (n=5) or 800 (n=5). To selectively up regulate efferent or afferent CAP, fetuses, in addition to Vx and LPS400, underwent either efferent or afferent cervical bilateral vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) +/-10 min around the first LPS injection, at 6, 24, 30 and 48h (n=9 and 7, respectively). Centralization of blood flow due to sepsis was defined as the ratio of cerebral to ileum blood flow. GEE modeling was used and results are reported for p<0.05. RESULTS: At 3h, in Vx+LPS400 IL-6 levels increased vs LPS400 by 65%. Afferent VNS had similar effects at Day 1 and, uniquely, also on Day 2, thus abolishing the habituation effect due to second LPS dose seen in other groups. Afferent VNS diminished diastolic blood pressure (dBP) by 23% at 27h compared to LPS400. Blood flow centralization in response to LPS was decreased at 24h by 50% in LPS800, but not LPS400 nor Vx+LPS400, groups and in Vx+LPS800, efferent or afferent VNS groups. CONCLUSIONS: dBP drop in afferent VNS group may be due to central inhibition of sympathetic outflow by vagus. Despite dBP drop and the protracted action of pro-inflammatory cytokines in afferent VNS group, the centralization response was similarly diminished with the higher (800) LPS dose or any of vagus nerve manipulations. Retained cerebral autoregulation likely compensated for these responses to afferent VNS. The role of vagus nerve in immunological memory and the asymmetric effects on control of inflammation require further study.",

Hydrocephalus affects up to 3/1000 births and is a significant cause of perinatal and pediatric morbidity and mortality despite surgical treatments. Hydrocephalus is increasingly recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Primary cilia play a critical role in CNS development. The incidence of ventriculomegaly is higher in patients with Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), a primary ciliopathy, than in the general population. We use a BBS mouse model to explore molecular mechanisms underlying hydrocephalus with the goal of facilitating noninvasive treatment.

We characterized disease onset and progression by quantifying ventricular and total brain areas of H&E-stained sections from embryonic day 17 (E17) to birth (P0) (n\u22653 per group and genotype). We performed Evans blue dye studies in P0 and adult mice (n\u22655 per group and genotype) to determine whether the hydrocephalus is communicating or obstructive. To examine whether impaired apoptosis of neural progenitor cells is involved in the pathophysiology, we performed TUNEL assays in periventricular regions early in the development of hydrocephalus (n\u22653 per group and genotype). Finally, we measured CSF electrolytes, glucose, and osmolality in adult mice (n\u22655 per group and genotype). RESULTS: Ventriculomegaly in BBS3 KO mice appears as early as E17 (p<0.05, Student's t test). Impaired flow of Evans blue dye is seen in 60% of P0 KO pups and 100% of adult KO mice, consistent with obstructive hydrocephalus. An approximately 40% decrease in apoptosis of cells in the cerebellar ventricular zone is seen in KO compared to WT (p<0.05, ANOVA and Tukey tests). Adult CSF composition is the same between KO and controls, although glucose is diminished in KO animals (p<0.001 by Welch t test). CONCLUSIONS: BBS3 KO mice develop fetal-onset hydrocephalus that progresses to a severe form of obstructive hydrocephalus. These KO mice display a significant reduction in apoptosis in periventricular regions relative to controls, suggesting an accumulation of neural progenitor cells. Further studies are needed to determine whether the accumulation of these cells underlies obstructive hydrocephalus in BBS. Gestational diabetes is a pathological state where the fetus is exposed to hyperglycemia during a critical developmental window that increases the risk for metabolic and age-related diseases. Implication of cellular stress in both aging and metabolic dysfunction is well established, however, the impact of high glucose on oxidative stress mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesize that hyperglycemia in utero alters the stress response of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). METHODS: MSCs were collected from umbilical cord of term large for gestational age infants of women with gestational diabetes (LGA-GDM, n=6) and appropriate growth, non-diabetic controls (Control, n=6). To measure specific effects of hyperglycemia, MSC of controls exposed to 5 days of high glucose (25mM) were added for comparison (Control-HG, n=4). To determine response to cellular stress (H2O2 treatment), we measured DNA damage (Comet Assay), levels of reactive oxygen species ( CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine exposure to hyperglycemia via maternal gestational diabetes demonstrates early protective responses to oxidative stress. While these early effects appear beneficial, we propose that repeated hyper-activation over time leads to deleterious effects and may help explain a mechanism for the development of metabolic and age-related diseases earlier in life.",

However, sex-based differences in genes involved in metabolism after BPA exposure have not been well characterized. METHODS: Pregnant CD-1 mice were treated with BPA or vehicle control on days 9-18 of gestation. Six weeks after birth, female offspring were ovariectomized. Female and male pups were subsequently treated with 300 ng estradiol (E2) or vehicle (ip). An Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0 ST microarray was conducted to determine differentially expressed genes between the treated and controls. Liver gene expression was analyzed to determine differentially expressed genes due to fetal BPA exposure in both males and females. qRT-PCR was used to quantify differences in gene expression and altered protein expression was confirmed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Fetal BPA exposure altered liver gene expression, including genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and transportation, in both female and male mice. In the female livers, 113 genes were determined to be differentially regulated between the mice treated with BPA compared to the control mice (70 downregulated, and 43 upregulated). In the male livers, 47 genes were differentially expressed between the mice in the BPA treated group and the control group (32 upregulated and 15 downregulated). We selected 12 genes in females (such as G6pc, Cox1, and Nucb2) and 7 genes in males (including Cox1, Cyp21a1, and Sort1) for further validation. Estrogen receptor alpha and beta gene expression was upregulated in females and downregulated in males. Expression in response to estradiol treatment was enhanced in females and repressed in males. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to demonstrate programming of gene expression in the liver as a sexually dimorphic response to BPA exposure in utero. BPA exposure induces an enhanced response to estrogens in females, versus a repressed response in males. This aberrant response to estrogens is a potential mechanism for explaining the increased incidence of estrogen related metabolic disorders and obesity seen after exposure to endocrine disruptors.",

RESULTS: HF females had reduced glucose tolerance, weighed more throughout pregnancy and had greater adiposity (P < 0.01 for all), as expected. At 17 days of gestation, HF females had 21% lower circulating corticosterone (CORT) levels than LF females (P < 0.01). Interestingly, HF male fetuses had 20% higher plasma CORT than LF male fetuses (P = 0.04), with no effect of maternal diet in female fetuses (P = 0.12). The contrast between maternal and fetal male CORT patterns suggested that 11\u03b2-HSD2 was downregulated in the placentae of male fetuses of HF mothers, allowing increased transfer of maternal CORT. Alternatively, placental 11\u03b2-HSD1, which converts inactive glucocorticoids to their active form, might be upregulated. However, we observed no effect of maternal diet on placental expression of 11\u03b2-HSD1 or 2 mRNA (P > 0.26 for both). There was no effect of maternal diet on fetal mass, placental mass, or fetal/ placental mass ratio (P > 0.26 for all).

Allopurinol (5 mg.kg -1 ) or vehicle (4M NaOH, 0.2\u00b5l) was injected daily into the air cell for 6 days. One cohort was investigated as embryos at 19 days. Another was allowed to hatch and raised until adulthood at 6 months. Adult birds were chronically instrumented under anaesthesia with catheters and a femoral Transonic flow probe to determine in vivo cardiovascular function. In both chick embryos and adult birds, femoral vessels were tested by wire myography with acetylcholine (Ach) \u00b1 the NOS inhibitor, LNAME, to determine NO-dependent relaxation. RESULTS: Hypoxic development impaired NO-dependent femoral relaxation in the chick embryo ( Fig. 1 a & b) . By adulthood, offspring of hypoxic incubation showed compensatory changes in NO biology, reflected ex vivo by enhanced NO-dependent femoral relaxation (c), and in vivo increased circulating NO-bioavailability (d) associated with decreased peripheral vascular resistance (e) and arterial blood pressure (e). Treatment of hypoxic embryos with allopurinol rescued the NO-dependent vasorelaxation in the chick embryo and normalised cardiovascular function at adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: This model isolates the direct contribution of XOderived oxidative stress in programming alterations in NO biology in adulthood following development under hypoxic conditions, giving insight to mechanism and intervention. INTRODUCTION: Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a liver disease that is characterized by hypercholanemia (increased serum bile acids (BA)) and dyslipidemia. We established that maternal cholestasis causes metabolic disease in the offspring. Specifically, we showed increased BMI and hip/waist girth in 16-year old children from cholestatic mothers. 18-week old females from cholestatic dams developed obesity and insulin resistance after a 6-week challenge with Western diet (WD). We hypothesize that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) treatment in pregnancy can prevent fetoplacental dyslipidemia and metabolic disease of the offspring. METHODS: Cholestatic mice (fed cholic acid; CA) were fed with UDCA during pregnancy and were either sacrificed on gestational day 18 or alternatively allowed to deliver offspring. Offspring were sacrificed at 18 weeks of age after being fed a normal chow (NC) diet or a WD for 6 weeks. Biochemical profile, lipid gene expression pathways and morphometry were assessed. Each group consisted of at least 4 animals. Data analysis was performed by unpaired Student t test or ANOVA (p<0.05). RESULTS: UDCA did not improve morphometry or hypercholanemia of the cholestatic mother and fetus. However, it reversed the CA feedinginduced elevation of tauro-conjugated BA in both maternal serum and liver. Unexpectedly, tauro-conjugated BA levels were increased in the fetal circulation of cholestatic mice compared to the maternal serum levels and this was not corrected by UDCA. Nonetheless, UDCA had a beneficial effect on circulating and hepatic cholesterol and free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations in the mother and this was consistent with the gene expression profile of hepatic TG/FFA de novo biosynthesis pathways.",

Significant GWAS findings were assessed by ExomeChip Microarray (ECM) with summed number of minor alleles of non-synonymous variants within the identified gene regions. Significant regions after multiple testing correction were tested against 17-and 20-year body mass index (BMI) and fasting lipids, glucose and insulin. Corrected mixed models were used for longitudinal biometry analyses; mixed models and multivariate regression were used to model adult phenotypes. RESULTS: Variation in novel gene regions within SLC39A11, ECHDC3, ANGPTL5 and LOXHD1 had significant associations with both fetal growth and adult metabolic phenotypes. Significant gene-environment interactions modulated the relationship between genotype and metabolic phenotype. Variants in SLC39A11 were associated with increased AC growth. Additionally, the associations with adult phenotypes were dependent upon birth weight (BW), with insulin resistance (HOMA-IR p=0.005, insulin p=0.004) occurring in those at the extremes of BW and dyslipidemia (HDL-C p=0.019) in those of low BW. CONCLUSIONS: Common genomic variants influence fetal growth and adult metabolic phenotypes and play roles in the developmental origins of the metabolic syndrome. Early life environmental influences of growth may further modulate the phenotypic expression of an individual's genotype. These gene-environment interactions could potentially be exploited as early life interventions for individuals at high genetic risk of adult metabolic disease. In the past 40 years, the use of plastics (e.g., water bottles) containing bisphenol A (BPA) has accelerated in parallel to obesity rates. Exposure to BPA is associated with increased adiposity, but the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. In rodents, adipose tissue overexpression of hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11\u03b2HSD1), which converts inactive to active corticosterone, results in adult obesity and metabolic syndrome. We hypothesized that perinatal BPA-mediated effects on glucocorticoid pathways contribute to offspring obesity, specifically through increased local adipose tissue glucocorticoid exposure or activation of the HPA axis. METHODS: Female rats had access to drinking water (control group) or drinking water containing BPA (5mg/L; BPA group) two weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. Standardized litters were nursed by the same dam. At 3 weeks of age, male offspring body weights and adiposity (DEXA) were evaluated, plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue were collected, and offspring were weaned with no further BPA treatment. HPA axis function was evaluated by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH; 10 \u00b5g/kg, i.p) challenge at 13 months. Plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations were determined by ELISA and protein abundance of the adipose glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and 11\u03b2HSD1 and 11\u03b2HSD2 enzymes were determined by Western Blot. Data were compared by two-way repeated measures ANOVA or Student's t-test, as appropriate. RESULTS: At 3 weeks of age, male BPA-offspring demonstrated increased body weights (53\u00b11 vs 46\u00b12 g; P<0.05) and body fat (9.7\u00b11.4 vs 6.6\u00b10.7 g; P<0.05). The protein abundance of 11\u03b2HSD2 was decreased (0.6-fold; P<0.05) in adipose tissue from BPA compared with control males, though there was no change in 11\u03b2HSD1 or GR expression. There were no differences in basal plasma concentrations of corticosterone between BPA and control male offspring at 3 weeks or 13 months, nor in the area under the curves for ACTH and corticosterone responses to CRH in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: BPA-exposed weanlings exhibit reduced adipose 11\u03b2HSD2, suggesting an enhanced local adipose corticosterone effect.",

            "text": "A maternal high fat (HF) diet and obesity during pregnancy influence the offspring's postnatal health. In our mouse model of obesity, maternal HF feeding alters blood pressure and heart size in the offspring. MicroRNAs are implicated in cardiac differentiation and remodelling and affect the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure and ischemic heart disease. We investigated whether the maternal HF diet alters miRNA expression within the fetal heart which may underlie the postnatal cardiovascular phenotype. METHODS: Female C57/BL6J mice were fed either a HF (45% kcal fat, n=4) or control chow (C, 7% kcal fat, n=4) diet 6 weeks prior to conception and throughout pregnancy. On day 16 of pregnancy dams were killed, fetuses collected and the fetal hearts dissected, snap frozen and stored at -80C. MicroRNA expression was measured using small RNA sequencing (Illumina miRNA-Seq, Expression Analysis, USA). Differential expression analysis identified both up and down-regulated miRNAs (p<0.05) and pathway analysis was carried out using DIANA miRPath. RESULTS: Thirty-three miRNAs were expressed differentially between both groups, including upregulation in HF of miR-470-5p, miR-299-3p, miR-574-5p and downregulation in HF of miR-29a-5p, miR-129-1-3p and miR-23a-5p. MicroRNA-regulated pathways potentially upregulated by a maternal HF diet include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, circadian rhythm and mTOR signalling. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified miRNAs that alter biological pathways linked to cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies in response to maternal HF feeding. This suggests that HF exposure during fetal development could alter the expression of miRNAs in the heart that may underlie the associated cardiovascular dysfunction in postnatal life. INTRODUCTION: Glucocorticoids (GC) play an important role in terminal differentiation of adipose tissue (AT) cells, in particular adipocytes. Exposure to abnormally high levels of GC in utero has been shown to be associated with changes in function and structure of different organs in the adult; one of the accepted mechanism underlying the concept of fetal programming. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is thought to be one of the important drivers of fetal programming. Micro RNA (miR), a particular species of non-cding RNA is one of the accepted mechanisms for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that antenatal exposure to abnormally high concentrations of GC alters the expression of miR, thus the development of white adipose tissue an ultimately AT function. METHODS: Pregnant sheep were treated with two IM doses of betamethasone (Beta, 0.17 mg/kg) or vehicle (V) 24-h apart at 80 days gestation and allowed to deliver at term. At 18 months of age omental adipose tissue was harvested. AT mRNA was extracted and cDNA libraries prepared. RNA Seq technology was used to characterize the sequence and annotation of miRs expressed in omental AT of adult female sheep. Data are expressed as Mean\u00b1SEM and were analyzed by t-test.",

METHODS: Pregnant rats were fed control (20% protein) or isocaloric low protein (LP) (6%) diet from gestational day 4 until delivery. Standard diet was given during lactation and to pups after weaning. Fasting rats received a primed constant rate infusion of [6,6-2 H 2 ] glucose. Blood samples were drawn during steady states after 4h of fasting and following a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Endogenous glucose production and a fraction of glucose derived from GNG pathway under fasting and euglycemic states were measured from steady state glucose enrichments after the infusion of [6,6-2 H 2 ] glucose and 2 H 2 O tracers utilizing GCMS methodology. GYG was determined by calculating the difference between total and GNG. Hepatic gene expression of molecules involved in GNG and GYG were quantified using qPCR. RESULTS: Liver regulates glucose homeostasis by increasing glucose production during fasting and suppressing during the fed state. Glucose production was normal during fasting (Males: 7.3 mg/kg*min in controls & 7.5mg/kg*min in LP offspring, Females: 12.4mg/kg*min in controls & 10.3 mg/kg*min in LP). However under the simulated fed condition, glucose production was suppressed in controls (Males: 5mg/kg*min & Females: 6mg/kg*min) but not in LP rats (Males: 7.3mg/kg*min & Females: 10.2mg/kg*min). Thus LP rats showed inefficient suppression of glucose production (Males: 31% in controls vs. 2% in LP; Females: 47% in controls vs. 0% in LP) in a simulated fed state. Differential analysis shows that suppression of both GNG and GYG under fed state is affected in these LP programmed rats. These effects were greater in females when compared to males. Further, key genes involved in these processes such as G6Pase, Pepck, pyruvate carboxylase and glycogen phosphorylase in liver are dysregulated. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows impaired suppression of hepatic glucose production via GNG and GYG in gestational LP programmed rats with greater effects on females. The age at which women deliver their first child is steadily increasing. Advanced maternal age (\u226535 years) is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although evidence suggests that the risk of cardiovascular disease is increased in offspring from compromised pregnancies, little is known about the impact of advanced maternal age on developmental programming of vascular function in the offspring.

METHODS: De-identified neonatal foreskins (n = 8) were collected immediately following planned circumcisions and were dissected to separate the epidermal/dermal and hypodermal layers. Primary dermal fibroblasts were isolated and grown in culture. One set of cells were grown in media specifically designed to induce adipogenesis. Following adipocyte differentiation, mRNA was extracted for quantification of markers of adipocyte differentiation (fatty acid binding protein 4, forkhead box 01, and fatty acid transport protein 4). Protein was also collected and levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 were assayed. Primary dermal fibroblasts (n=3) were stimulated with 100 nM insulin in order to evaluate insulin signaling in a second set of cultured cells. Data were analyzed by student's t test. RESULTS: Human neonatal foreskin primary fibroblasts differentiate into lipid-loaded cells when stimulated with an adipocyte differentiation cocktail. Further, mRNA levels of fatty acid binding protein 4, forkhead box 01, and fatty acid transport protein 4 were significantly elevated following adipogenesis (p < 0.05 for each comparison). Protein levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 were also significantly increased (P < 0.05).

The programming of many adult-diseases involves alterations in circulating fatty acid (FA) levels in the offspring. Maternal-fetal FA transfer is regulated by placental FA transporters. We previously showed that MTS exposure sex-specifically alters FA transporter expression in the rat. However, the effect of MTS on rat placental insufficiency, placental histology and fetal FA levels is unknown. We hypothesize that MTS exposure causes placental insufficiency, changes in placental histology, and sex-specific changes circulating fetal FA levels in the rat. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to tobacco smoke (MTS) or room air (Control) from E11 to term (E21). Fetal and placental weights were measured at birth. Umbilical arterial blood flow was measured via Doppler ultrasound on E15 and E21. Placental sections were used for histological examination. Fetal serum FA levels were measured using direct transesterification and gas chromatography. RESULTS: MTS decreased placental and pup weight of female and male offspring compared to sex-matched control. MTS reduced umbilical arterial flow at E15 and E21 in female, and male placenta compared to sex-matched controls. Female and male MTS placentas had smaller labyrinth layer size, retention of glycogen-rich cells and the presence of larger, immature appearing, trophoblastic giant cells. MTS did not significantly affect circulating fetal FA levels in female rat pups. However, MTS altered circulating fetal FA levels in male rat pups (decreased palmitoleic, oleic and docosapentaenoic acid, and increased docosatetraenoic acid). CONCLUSIONS: MTS exposure causes placental insufficiency, and changes in placental histology in female and male rat pups. Despite similar placental changes in both female and male rat pups, MTS sex-specifically alters circulating fetal FA levels in rat pups. We speculate that previously observed sex-specific differences in FA transporter expression may reflect sex-specific alterations in transcriptional regulation of transporters.",

            "text": "Lower In humans lower maternal vitamin D status has been associated with altered bone size and structure. The fetus is reliant on maternal vitamin D status, and vitamin D deficiency affects women before and during pregnancy. However, there is little information to date linking fetal vitamin D status to bone growth and structure during fetal life. METHODS: Welsh mountain ewes were fed 100% nutrient requirements (C, 2000 IU/kg vitamin D3, n= 9), or a similar diet lacking the vitamin D3 supplement (VDD, 0 IU/kg vitamin D, n=10) from 17 days prior to conception until post-mortem. At 126-130 days of gestation ewes and singleton fetuses were killed (pentobarbitone overdose IV). Maternal and fetal serum levels of the total 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25(OH)-D) were measured by HPLC tandem mass spectroscopy. 3-dimensional images of fetal femur, metatarsal and vertebra were captured using microcomputer tomography (SkyScan 1176 Bruker microCT). Data were analysed by student's t-test and linear regression with 25(OH)-D (adjusted for fetal age at post-mortem). RESULTS: Lower total fetal plasma 25(OH)-D concentration was associated with smaller trabecular thickness (B=0.0005, p=0.006, R 2 =0.363) and greater bone surface-to-volume ratio (B=-0.13, p=0.004, R 2 =0.390) in the fetal femur. In addition, lower total fetal plasma 25(OH)-D concentration was associated with greater fetal femur length (B=-0.078, p=0.016, R 2 =0.295). Bone length and structure were not significantly different between C and VDD groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that lower fetal 25(OH)-D concentrations were associated with longer length and reduced trabecular thickness in the fetal femur could indicate an adaptive response, whereby bone length is preserved at the expense of strength. Our previous observations in this model of altered femoral artery vasodilatation in VDD group fetuses suggest that this skeletal effect may be mediated in part by altered perfusion of the hind limb. Such an adaptive strategy could have implications for stature and skeletal strength in later life. IUGR is associated with down-regulation of placental amino acid (AA) transporter expression and activity at birth; however it is unknown whether these changes are a cause or a consequence of IUGR in the human. We hypothesized that placental AA transport capacity is reduced prior to the onset of reduced fetal growth, at gestational day (GD) 120 (0.65 of gestation) in baboons with maternal nutrient restriction (MNR). METHODS: Pregnant baboons were fed either a control (n=8) or MNR diet (70% of control diet, n=9) from GD30. At GD120, fetuses and placentas were collected. Microvillous (MVM) and basal (BM) plasma membrane vesicles were isolated. System A and system L transport activity was determined in MVM, and leucine transporter activity was assessed in BM using radiolabeled substrates. MVM AA transporter isoform expression (SNAT1, 2, LAT1, 2) was measured using western blots. Maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of AA were determined using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Fetal and placental weights were unaffected by MNR at GD120. MVM system A activity was reduced by 37% in MNR (p=0.03). MVM AA transporter protein expression was unchanged. MVM system L activity and BM leucine transporter activity were not significantly altered by MNR. Fetal plasma concentrations of the essential AA isoleucine and leucine were significantly reduced, while citrulline was increased (p<0.05) in MNR fetuses as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in plasma leucine and isoleucine in MNR fetuses may be caused by reduced activity of MVM system A, which is strongly coupled with the uptake of essential AA via system L. Placental AA transporter activity is reduced prior to onset of IUGR in MNR baboons at GD120 (0.65 of gestation). Reduced placental AA transport may therefore be a cause rather than a consequence of IUGR in non-human primates.",

Studies in FGR guinea pigs show aberrant hippocampal synapse formation and increased apoptosis, but there is no information on later neurobehavioural outcomes. We sought to determine whether MNR in guinea pigs leading to FGR offspring will impact neurobehavioural activity, thereby implicating early neuroanatomic disorder in later functional impairment with FGR. METHODS: Guinea pig sows were fed ad libitum (Control) or 70% of the control diet pre-pregnancy switching to 90% at mid-pregnancy (MNR) and continuing until weaning at ~14 days postnatal when MNR sows/neonates were switched to the control diet. At ~ 110 days postnatal, ie young adulthood, representative male and female offspring underwent open field monitoring of locomotor activity to assess anxiety-like behavior and Morris water maze (MWM) testing to assess spatial learning and memory retention with necropsy thereafter for neuroanatomic correlates.",

RESULTS: FGR-MNR offspring (n=3males/6females) were 28% smaller at birth than the appropriate for gestational age (AGA)-Control offspring (n=2males/6females), 77\u00b12 vs 107\u00b13 gm (p<.001), while at necropsy their weights were the same, 672\u00b147 vs 668\u00b122 gm. FGR-MNR adults showed a 4-fold reduction in ambulatory activity from that of the AGA-Controls (p<.05), and while vertical exploration was also reduced 4-fold in FGR-MNR adults, this was not significant. However, MWM testing of escape latency, escape success rate and distance traveled, showed that both animal groups were comparable in their ability to learn and re-learn the hidden platform location. CONCLUSIONS: MNR in guinea pigs leads to FGR offspring with catch-up growth during the neonatal/adolescent period. These FGR-MNR offspring show reduced open field locomotor activity into adulthood, although spatial learning and memory retention as assessed by MWM testing appear intact. Accordingly, aberrant neuroanatomic development in FGR guinea pigs, including that in the hippocampus, may underlie later inhibition of locomotor activity as the phenotypic expression for this outcome. In many preeclamptic (PE) pregnancies, maternal plasma is low in the placentally-produced angiokine \"placental growth factor\" (PGF). Offspring from PE pregnancies (PE-F1s) have unexplained higher risks for hypertension, cognitive impairment, and stroke. Pgf -/mice have reduced decidual and placental vascular branching and most experience stroke after common carotid artery occlusion. We hypothesized that PGF deficiency in mice or humans diminishes fetal brain vascular development impairing cognition and elevating stroke risk. METHODS: Pgf -/and Pgf +/+ brain vascular and structural anatomy were compared by whole mount immunohistochemistry, micro-CT, and MRI. Cognition and behaviour were assessed by paradigms testing depression, spatial learning, short and long term memory, activity, and anxiety. Ten pairs of PE-F1 or control children aged 7-10 were analysed for cognitive function (psychometrics, eye tracking) and brain structure through MRI/ MRA. Term maternal plasmas were analysed for PGF. RESULTS: Pgf -/brain vasculature was deficient from midgestation and abnormally patterned compared to Pgf +/+ . Cognitive and behavioural tests revealed numerous, sexually dimorphic impairments in Pgf -/mice. In PE-F1s, brain vascular radii were reduced in the occipital and parietal lobes compared to controls. PE-F1s had regional brain volume enlargements (cerebellum, brainstem, temporal lobe, and right and left amygdalae). PE-F1s showed functional impairments in working memory and visuospatial processing. PGF was 7x lower in maternal plasma from PE-F1s. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a formerly unknown link between PGF expression, brain vascular development, and cognitive function in mice. Child pilot study data suggest that a PE gestational experience associated with low maternal PGF also depresses brain vascular development. Development of predictive, image-based biomarkers to identify affected children would be valuable if these results are confirmed in a larger study. (1). We hypothesized that learning impairment involves the following mechanisms: 1) impaired spatial learning in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task; 2) hippocampal neuronal fine structure changes and 3) altered corticosterone production.",

INTRODUCTION: Melatonin in produced in human trophoblast cells and protects placenta against hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced oxidative and apoptosis damage, as observed in pregnancy disorders. Autophagy is an important pathway to degrade damaged cellular content. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that induces the expression of almost a hundred protective genes. Autophagy and Nrf2 pathways are related by positive feedback mechanisms. The objective of this study is to determine how melatonin modulates autophagy and NRF2 pathways to protect human trophoblast against H/R-damage. METHODS: Primary villous cytotrophoblasts (vCTB) isolated from normal term placenta were maintained in normoxia (8% O 2 ) during 72 h (to differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast (STB)) and then exposed to H/R (0.5% of O 2 (4 h)), or normoxia in presence or absence of 1 mM melatonin. Protein expression was analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: H/R and 1 mM melatonin induce by 1.5 fold (p<0.05) LC3B expression in STB *Figure(s) will be available online.

            "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Rosiglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 activator, induces the expression of a ROS scavenger key protein in trophoblast cells under hypoxia condition. It leads to enhanced cell survival, lower apoptosis rate and improved mitochondrial membrane potential. Our findings suggest that PPAR\u03b3 agonists such the Rosiglitazone might be considered as anti-oxidant therapeutic interventions for treatment of placental complications associated with oxidative stress, such as preeclampsia. In previous studies, we detected high levels of expression of the cardiovascular transcription factor, Nkx2-5 in trophoblast cells of human placenta from cases of early onset and severe pre-eclampsia (EOSPE). These elevations are highly correlated with increased expression of the Preeclampsia (PE) marker sFlt-1, and the expression of an mRNA splicing factor, Sam68, which potentially mediates sFlt-1 production. Activation of Nkx2-5 in placental trophoblasts may contribute to EOSPE severity through increased placental sFlt-1 production. Nkx2-5 is also required for normal extraembryonic vascular development. Nkx2-5 knockouts (KO) have abnormal amniotic vessel formation and are embryonic lethal at midgestation (E9.5-10.5). While fetal demise has been ascribed to cardiac defects arising from Nkx2-5's role in heart development, we wish to explore a potential role for Nkx2-5 in placental development, and whether enhanced placental expression of Nkx2-5 precipitates a PE-like syndrome. METHODS: Histological analysis of Nkx2-5 WT and KO embryos, analysis of Nkx2-5 placental expression; Nkx2-5 over-expression in mouse placental trophoblasts; qPCR assay of Nkx2.5 and target gene expression; sFlt-1 ELISA; urine protein ELISA. RESULTS: Placentae from Nkx2-5 KO embryos display simplified villous branching structure, abnormal migration of trophoblastic giant cells (TGC), and abnormal development of decidual vessels. Over-expression of Nkx2-5 in select mouse TGC cytotrophoblasts results in abnormal placental histology, elevation of placental Sam68 expression, higher maternal serum sFlt-1 levels and mild proteinuria as compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: Nkx2-5 plays a potential role in normal placental development. Elevated placental Nkx2-5 expression may play a direct role in the genesis of PE via regulation of placental Sam68 and sFlt-1 production, and may represent abnormal reactivation of a fetal developmental program. 2) . A role for \u03b12-ARs suppression of the anti-angiogenic effect of sFlt-1 was recently proposed, yet knowledge on involvement of \u03b12-AR in the function of the placenta has not been investigated. METHODS: Placental biopsies were collected from 41 women in the following groups: 1) sPE (n=9, GA[31\u00b11]wks); 2) sPE&IUGR (n=3, GA[29\u00b12]wks); 3) idiopathic IUGR (n=5, GA[30\u00b11]wks); 4) idiopathic preterm birth (iPTB, n=14, GA[31\u00b11]wks) and 5) healthy term controls (n=10, GA[39\u00b11]wks). Tissues were immunostained for \u03b12a-, \u03b12b-, \u03b12c-ARs and phosphorylated-ERK(1/2)(p-ERK). The impact of \u03b12c-AR on BeWo syncytialization induced by forskolin was studied in lentiviral \u03b12c-AR knock-down experiments. UK14,304 (An \u03b12-AR agonist) was used for pharmacologic stimulation. Expression of syncytins-1 and -2 (syncytialization markers) was assessed by qPCR. \u03b2hCG release was measured by ELISA as a reflection of trophoblastic secretory function. RESULTS: \u03b12aand \u03b12b-ARs localized to the myofibroblast layer of anchoring villous blood vessels. Interestingly, syncytio-, cyto-and extravillous trophoblasts all expressed significant levels of \u03b12c-ARs. p-ERK(1/2) labeling mirrored that of \u03b12-AR subtypes, suggesting receptor activation. sPE showed higher extravillous trophoblasts staining for the \u03b12c-AR both in the presence (p=0.03) or absence (p=0.04) of IUGR. \u03b12b and \u03b12c-AR had the highest gene expression in sPE with IUGR. \u03b12c-AR knockdown increased expression of syncytins-1 and -2, yet significantly decreased \u03b2hCG production under basal and forskolin-induced conditions (P<0.01).

Little is known about the progression of the pathology. It is generally assumed that AIP becomes more severe as pregnancy progresses. We tested this idea by examining whether the ultrasound diagnostic marker, the area of confluence (A con ), increases with gestational age (GA). We have shown that A con is correlated with AIP severity, and has 100% specificity for AIP at 32 weeks GA. 1 METHODS: We examined serial A con values in 11 cases of placenta previa with AIP (10 percreta, 1 accreta) studied at 3 or more GAs. Sagittal volumes capturing equivalent areas of the placental bed were selected for every visit. A con was measured as previously published, blinded to GA and diagnosis. 1 A con was normalized by log transformation and a generalized linear mixed model was used to test the relationship between GA and log(A con ), regressing on the intercept and GA with the patient as a random factor. RESULTS: Cases were delivered at 33 +4 weeks +days (range 28 +3 -36 +2 ). All mothers and babies were discharged in good condition. GAs at which serial A con was measured ranged from 19 +4 to 34 +6 weeks. We found no increase in log(A con ) over GA (p=0.47). CONCLUSIONS: While A con did not increase with advancing gestation, this study is under-powered to detect small trends. An assumed GAdependent increase in AIP severity is one of the reasons cited by clinicians for early delivery. The absence of increase in A con in this study suggests the disease stabilizes. Therefore delivery for this reason alone may be contra-indicated. In asymptomatic women, pregnancy could be extended, perhaps reducing neonatal complications due to prematurity. However maternal morbidity is the countervailing factor, given that 5 of these 11 cases had emergent delivery due to PPROM or bleeding. A con may be useful in such decision-making. Placentas of obese women have high levels of lipid accumulation leading to lipotoxicity and increased inflammation,which may contribute to fetal adiposity.Omega-3 fatty acids(n-3 FA) such as docosahexanoate(DHA) and eicosapentanoate(EPA) alter FA metabolism in hepatocytes by decreasing synthesis and esterification of FA,though their effect on placental tissue is largely unknown.We hypothesized that 1)FA esterification is higher in placentas of obese vs lean women;2) n-3 treatment will decrease FA esterification in isolated trophoblasts in vitro. METHODS: Fatty acid esterification (accumulation) was measured in isolated placental trophoblast cells collected at scheduled term Cesarean delivery in healthy lean (BMI:22.6\u00b11.5 kg/m 2 and GA 39\u00b10.6wks,n=6) and obese women (37.7\u00b17.1 kg/m 2 and GA 39.1\u00b10.3wks,n=13),following treatment with 3 H-Palmitate (PA,100 \u00b5M) with or without DHA(50\u00b5M) and/or EPA(50\u00b5M) for 18h.Student's t-test was used to assess differences between lean and obese groups before n-3 treatment.One-way ANOVA was used to determine the effect of n-3 treatment compared to lean control.

The circulating placental transcriptome was compared between women who delivered a growth restricted baby > 36 weeks and women who delivered a well grown term baby (n=12 x 2) using Illumina HT-12 microarrays. Differentially expressed placental specific genes were validated using PCR arrays (TLDA).

            "text": "Armand-Frappier, Laval, QC, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Depression during pregnancy occurs in about 20% of women, of which 13% take antidepressants. SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed antidepressants for pregnant women, although their effects on placental function have never been studied. A successful pregnancy depends on healthy placental development and function. The extravillous trophoblast cells (evTBs), which invade the uterine wall, are crucial for embryo implantation and the adaptation of maternal spiral arteries. Poor invasion/migration of evTBs can cause important pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia and possibly maternal and fetal mortality. The aim of this study was to determine whether SSRIs commonly used during pregnancy affect migratory and invasive properties of JEG3 cells, used as a model of the evTBs. METHODS: JEG3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0.03-10 \u00b5M) of fluoxetine, norfluoxetine or sertraline. Cell proliferation was monitored in real-time using a cell impedance-based xCELLigence \u00a9 system. JEG3 cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Migration was determined using a scratch test. Activities of metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 (markers of invasion) were determined by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Fluoxetine and sertraline significantly decreased JEG3 cell proliferation at 10 \u00b5M by 93% and 98%, respectively ([ Figure  1 ]-fluoxetine), compared to control, whereas norfluoxetine had no effect. Fluoxetine decreased the number of cells in the G2-M at 1 and 10 \u00b5M, and the number of cells in G0-G1 at 10 \u00b5M. None of the SSRIs affected JEG3 migration ([ Figure 2 ]-fluoxetine) or the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

Trophoblast cells undergo changes in integrin expression (switching) as they differentiate into highly invasive cells. The Kindlin proteins are integrin activators that help mediate integrin-mediated signaling. Thus, it was hypothesized that Kindlin-1 and -2 would be highly expressed in trophoblast cells and mediate trophoblast -ECM interactions necessary for proper development. METHODS: Following ethics approval and written informed consent, placental villous tissue was obtained from patients undergoing elective terminations by dilatation and curettage at week 8-11(n=10) and 12-14 (n=8) of gestation, and from term deliveries at 37-40 weeks (n=10). Tissues were fixed, processed, paraffin embedded and tissue sections utilized for immunofluorescence analysis with Kindlin-1 or Kindlin-2 specific antisera. Additionally, HTR8-SVneo trophoblast cells were cultivated under standard conditions in supplemented RPMI 1640 media. Cells were transfected with Kindlin-1 or -2 specific siRNA or non-targeting siRNA (control) and used in cell viability and cell-substrate attachment assays. RESULTS: In villous cytotrophoblast, Kindlin-1 and -2 were membrane localized continuously around individual cells or only in basement membrane-associated sites where cytotrophoblast fusion with syncytiotrophoblast had occurred. In contrast, both Kindlins were always membrane localized around individual extravillous trophoblast cells. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Kindlin-2 resulted in significantly decreased trophoblast-substrate attachment relative to control cells (p<0.05). Knockdown of Kindlin-2 also resulted in significantly decreased cell viability relative to cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both Kindlin-1 and -2 are highly expressed in villous cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast cells and Kindlin-2 modulates trophoblast-substrate adhesion. Kindlin-2 also appears to modulate substrate-dependent trophoblast cell viability.",

Notch signalling is evolutionarily conserved and critical for many biological processes including cell-fate determination and differentiation. Growing evidence implicates the Notch pathway in placental development. NOTCH has been associated with trophoblast differentiation and invasion in mice. We and others have previously shown that NOTCH pathway members are differentially expressed in placentas from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. Hence, we aimed to determine the role of NOTCH pathway in trophoblast and endothelial cell function in vitro. METHODS: HTR8/SVneo cells (first trimester extra villous trophoblast cell line) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) were treated with 5mM DAPT, a small molecule inhibitor of NOTCH, for 24 and 48 hours prior to running functional assays. NOTCH inhibition on (i) migration and invasion was tested using transwell assays; (ii) angiogenesis was assessed by matrigel tube formation assays. Effect of DAPT treatment on the downstream targets of NOTCH pathway was determined by by real-time PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: DAPT treatment inhibited the translocation of NICD (NOTCH Intracellular Domain) to the nucleus in HTR8/Svneo cells and had significantly lowered gene expressions of HES1 and HEY1 (both downstream targets of NOTCH), suggesting that treatment indeed inhibited Notch signaling. DAPT treatment significantly reduced invasion and migration of HTR8/SVneo cells in vitro. In addition, inhibition of NOTCH significantly inhibited the tube formation of HMECs. However, the treatment had no significant effect on cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the Notch pathway regulates trophoblast invasion and migration and angiogenesis. Given that NOTCH pathway members have already been shown to be deregulated in placentas from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia, a targeted induction of this pathway may have important therapeutic implications.",

Rbfox2, an RNA-binding protein, controls tissuespecific alternative splicing in diverse processes such as epithelial to mesenchyme transition and myoblast cell fusion. The placenta represents a singular system where two diverse activities of Rbfox2 regulation, cell invasion and cell fusion, may be studied. Our preliminary results suggest that Rbfox2, by conferring mRNA diversity, may act as a master regulator in trophoblast differentiation to either the fusion or invasive pathways. In this investigation we characterize the contribution of Rbfox2 to trophoblast differentiation in mouse and human placenta. METHODS: Rbfox2 immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence was performed on human and murine placental tissue sections in normal pregnancy and placental pathologies. Inhibition of Rbfox2 alternative splicing in isolated primary trophoblasts was evaluated by immunofluorescence and BhCG. RESULTS: Trophoblast lineage specific expression of Rbfox2 was observed in both normal and pathological human placentas. Rbfox2 is expressed in the progenitor cytotrophoblast, reduced in the terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblast and conversely, highly expressed in an increasing gradient of expression in the invasive trophoblasts. Reduced Rbfox2 expression was observed in fused primary trophoblast cell culture with inhibition of Rbfox2 upregulating BhCG production. Murine Rbfox2 expression changes as gestation progresses. As compared to normal pregnancy, decreased staining was observed in a spontaneous abortion prone model, and more intense staining observed in a preeclampsia model. CONCLUSIONS: Rbfox2, an alternative splicing factor, is differentially expressed in specific trophoblast cell lineages and may act as the molecular switch determining the trophoblast differentiation pathway with implications to several human pregnancy disorders including preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. INTRODUCTION: Placenta cell invasion mis-regulation is largely responsible for placental complications including accreta. Invasion processes are controlled by actin binding protein (ABP) mediated actin dynamic at invading cell edges. The ABP complexes profilin1/VASP pS157 promotes while cofilin1/VASP pS239 suppress cancer cell invasion via actin polymerization and stabilization, respectively. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid and dietary supplement, has been shown to alter invasive cellular phenotypes. We hypothesized ABP complexes are regulators of placenta cell invasion and are associated with placental disorders including accreta. Furthermore, we hypothesize that ABP are regulated DHA supplementation.",

These findings indicate a possible interaction of profilin1 with VASP pS157 and cofilin1 with VASP pS239 in regulation of invasive phenotypes of placenta cells and their modification by hyperoxia and DHA in attempt to reduce high invasion potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that DHA is modulating the relative expression and association of profilin1 with VASP pS157 and cofilin1 with VASP pS239 and thus invasive phenotype.

Changes in the perfusion pressure in the fetal compartment were continuously recorded. After the stabilization of perfusion, labetalol was infused at varying doses (150 -1,000 ng/ml) to the fetal and maternal compartments, and the changes in fetal perfusion pressure were assessed RESULTS: Labetalol infusion into the fetal compartment produced a dose-related decrease in the fetal perfusion pressure: with no effects at 150 ng/ml, a 6% decrease at 750 ng/ml, and maximal effect (9% decrease) observed at 1,000 ng/ml. However, labetalol infused into the maternal compartment, even 1,000 ng/ml, did not produce a reduction in fetal perfusion pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of labetalol into fetal circulation caused a dose-dependent decrease in fetal perfusion pressure with maximal effect observed at the 1mg/ml concentration. However, labetalol was ineffective in causing the changes in fetal perfusion pressure when administered to the maternal compartment of the placenta.

INTRODUCTION: Previously we demonstrated that maternal high fat diet (HFD) was associated with fetal growth restriction in both control C57BL/6J mice and mice deficient in the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT -/-), and increased blood pressure in pregnant COMT -/mice. This was associated with significant alterations in utero-placental perfusion. Given the key role of the placenta in both fetal growth and the development of preeclampsia, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of maternal HFD on placental gene expression. METHODS: Female C57BL6/J and COMT -/mice received normal diet (4% kcal from fat) or HFD (60% kcal from fat) for 8 weeks prior to mating (n=6-11). Placentas were collected at gestational day 18.5 and gene expressions determined using RT-PCR. Genes investigated included nutrient transporters (GLUT1, 2, 3 and 4, SNAT2 and 4, CD36 and DLK1), angiogenic (PlGF, VEGFR1 and 2) and inflammatory (TLR4, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) markers. RESULTS: Gene expression of nutrient transporters was significantly increased in placentas from mice fed a HFD, with a significant increase in GLUT1 (q=0.013) and CD36 (q=0.047) expression, and a trend towards increased GLUT3 (q=0.06) and SNAT2 (q=0.05) expression. There was also a significant increase in gene expression of the pro-angiogenic factor PlGF (q=0.027) and the inflammatory marker IL-1\u03b2 (q=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal high fat diet had a significant effect on placental nutrient transporters, with a significant increase in the expression of glucose and fatty acid transporters, and a trend towards an increase in amino acid transporters. This may be a compensatory measure to counteract the reduced utero-placental perfusion and associated fetal growth restriction previously observed. Increased PlGF gene expression may also be an attempt to increase placental efficiency.

RESULTS: Carbenoxolone did not affect placental and fetal body weights, but ELISA showed decreased estradiol levels on 19 and 21 dg and increased luteinizing hormone levels in maternal serum on all dg. The follicle stimulating hormone levels decreased on 16 and 19 dg, and increased on 21 dg. Carbenoxolone decreased ERa mRNA levels on 16 dg in both zones and its protein level on 19 dg in the labyrinth zone. However, carbenoxolone increased ERb mRNA levels on 19 and 21 dg and protein levels on 16 and 19 dg in the labyrinth zone.

Acute histologic chorioamnionitis (acute-HCA) was defined in the presence of inflammation in at least one placental compartment (i.e., choriodecidua [CD], amnion, umbilical cord or chorionic-plate), and ES-AIU and AS-AIU were defined in placental pathologic examination as follows; 1) ES-AIU: inflammation restricted to CD; and 2) AS-AIU: inflammation in amnion, umbilical cord or chorionic-plate beyond CD. 47,99,100,153, or 209 in the presence and absence of 10 7 CFU/ml heat-killed E. coli for 24 h. Conditioned medium was then harvested and concentrations of IL-1 \u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, sgp130, HO-1, IL-10, BDNF, and F 2 IsoP were quantified. RESULTS: For unstimulated cultures: all PBDEs, except PBDE-47, reduced IL-1\u03b2 production. BDNF concentrations were reduced by PBDE-47 (P = 0.026),-99 (P = 0.027), and -153 (P = 0.041). IL-10 production was enhanced by PBDE-99 (P =0.003), -153 (P < 0.001), and -209 (P = 0.023) and basal IL-6 and F 2 IsoP production was increased by PBDE-153 (P < 0.001). For cultures stimulated with E. coli: PBDE-47 increased IL-1\u03b2 production and PBDE-47 (P = 0.054), PBDE-153 (P = 0.019), and PBDE-209 (P = 0.064) reduced TNF-\u03b1 production. Bacteria-stimulated IL-6 production, however, was enhanced by all congeners except for PBDE-153. E. coli-stimulated IL-10 production was enhanced by all PBDE congeners except for PBDE-47. All PBDE congeners enhanced BDNF and F 2 IsoP production. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PBDE congeners vary in their effects on basal and bacteria-stimulated production on biomarkers of inflammation, neurodevelopment, and oxidative stress. They were most consistent at promoting IL-10, IL-6, BDNF production, and F 2 IsoP production by bacteria-stimulated cultures and with suppressing BDNF production by unstimulated cultures. Our objective was to address this conundrum by investigating the prevalence and diversity of microbiota present in various regions of the placenta METHODS: We obtained placentas from a cohort of 40 women from Barnes Jewish Hospital. Biopsies were sampled from the basal plate at the maternal-fetal interface; villous tissue, and the amniotic/chorionic plate. After extraction of genomic DNA, the hypervariable region 3 and 4 of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene was PCR-amplified by high-throughput Fluidigm technology. Amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina Mi-seq platform. Raw reads were quality filtered, distance matrices were denoised and the most significant Principal Coordinates Analysis eigenvectors extracted. Microbial communities in the basal plate, villous tissue, and fetal amniotic membranes were taxonomically mapped and assembled using QIIME v.1.7. Average pairwise-weighted UniFrac distance between communities, an estimate of beta diversity was calculated. RESULTS: High levels of interconnectedness were revealed within bacterial communities in the basal plate and within communities in the fetal membranes. However, the microbial profiles between each placental location revealed strong regional differences: Lactobacillus, a common vaginal microbial genus, was exclusively identified in the fetal membranes while the maternal basal plate harbored aerobic Gram-negative bacterial rods of the Ralstonia genus, which are non-fermenting species adapted to low-nutrient conditions and typically found in oral niches. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct microbiome clusters and unique bacterial genera found in the basal plate and the amniotic membranes suggests that microbiome in each placental location may originate from two different routes-oral and vaginal, respectively. Thus, placental microbiome studies should consider regional differences and host-microbial underpinnings which may affect maternal, fetal, and/or neonatal health and physiology. In clinical studies, cervical biopsy tissue specimens were collected from women before and after DMPA initiation, and assessed for changes in mucosal permeability. RESULTS: In the mouse model of intravaginal HSV-2 infection, we found MPA or LNG interaction with the progesterone receptor enhances susceptibility to viral infection by increasing genital mucosal permeability. These changes in mucosal permeability increased genital inflammation in uninfected mice by permitting infiltration of endogenous vaginal microbiota. Loss of barrier protection was not caused by mucosal thinning, but correlated with decreased genital tissue expression of desmosomal cadherins. Concomitant treatment of mice with DMPA and topical or systemic estrogen restored desmosomal cadherin expression and barrier protection, and made mice resistant to HSV-2. Remarkably, evaluation of cervical biopsies from women before and 1 month after starting DMPA revealed tissue inflammation, desmosomal cadherin expression, and mucosal permeability were altered by treatment in ways identical to the changes seen in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our work reveals DMPA and LNG impair the mucosal barrier, a first-line defense against all sexually transmitted pathogens, and implies that DMPA use is impeding efforts to curb the HIV epidemic. Discovery that concurrent use of DMPA and estrogen eliminates susceptibility to viral infection by restoring mucosal integrity however provides groundwork for a new contraceptive strategy less compromising of barrier protection.",

We also assess HA receptors, standard CD44 and RHAMM, in EECs and ESCs. METHODS: EECs (n=8) and ESCs (n=6) were isolated from menstrual endometrial biopsies from women with (N=5) and without (N=5) a diagnosis of endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy. RT-PCR was used to assess mRNA expression of HAS isoforms 1,2, and 3 as well as HYAL isoforms 1 and 2. Western analysis and densitometry were used for confirmatory protein detection and quantification. Standard CD44 and RHAMM were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot. Student T-test in Graph Pad Prism was used to analyze results. RESULTS: HAS1 was not detectable in EEC or ESCs from women with or without endometriosis. There was no significant difference in HAS 2 or 3 as well as HYAL 1 or 2 mRNA expression or protein levels in EECs or ESCs from women with or without endometriosis. Standard CD44 and RHAMM were expressed in both cell types and their expression did not differ in cells from women with or without endometriosis. The pain and extended inflammation in endometriosis, especially in the peritoneal cavity, is caused by an amplification of the immune response, ubiquitous production of pain mediators and by increased leucocyte recruitment. Macrophages are the most abundant cells in the peritoneal fluid of affected women, and accumulation of these cells in the cavity is determined by cycle phases, as suggested by the retrograde menstruation hypothesis. However, macrophage activation in the human peritoneal cavity is ill defined, and comprehensive studies dedicated to characterize the activation types of macrophages in endometriosis are scarce METHODS: In this study we evaluated at multiple levels the activation status of macrophages in the peritoneum of patients with endometriosis: at the mRNA level with up to date sequencing techniques and phenotypically using multiple colour FACS, mass cytometry (Cytof) and quadruple colour histology. In addition to evaluating peritoneal macrophages, in selected patients we compared the activation status of macrophages isolated from the endometrium and peritoneum as well as monocyte activation in blood, thereby retracing the axis of recruitment and activation in the disease.",

In the current study we characterized the in vitro and in vivo profile of a novel partial estrogen receptor destabilizer (pERD) identified in the frame of a compound optimization. METHODS: pERD (BAY-153) was tested on a) its in vitro ER antagonising activity b) induction of estrogen receptor degradation and c) selectivity against other nuclear hormone receptors. Effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis have been assessed by a test for ovarian stimulation and penetration across the blood brain barrier. In vivo (anti)-uterotrophic activity as well as impact on bone mass (in agonistic & antagonistic setting) have been studied. Finally pERD has been tested in two preclinical endometriosis models (rat & mice). RESULTS: BAY-153 demonstrated important preclinical pharmacological prerequisites for an application in endometriosis patients: High antagonistic activity on ER (ER\u03b1,\u03b2: IC 50 0.86nM, 3.25nM), partial destabilization of the ER and strong selectivity towards other nuclear hormone receptors. When tested for its interference with the HPG-axis, BAY-153 displayed no relevant induction of systemic estradiol levels (rat) and a very low to absent penetration of the brain (mouse). Remarkably, BAY-153 combines ER-destabilizing in vivo activity with bone protective potential and a dissociation of antagonistic activities at the uterus and bone level. Finally BAY-153 exhibited dose-dependent efficacy in two endometriosis models.",

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is characterized by the growth of endometrial epithelial and stromal cells outside the uterine cavity and is accompanied by an altered inflammatory environment. In epithelial malignancies senescent fibroblasts with a distinct inflammatory profile contribute to epithelial cell survival. Endometriotic stromal cells are progesterone resistance, do not decidualize and have an inflammatory response, mediated through NF\u03baB, that will have a paracrine effect within the lesion. These endometriotic stromal cells may be analogues to senescence fibroblast and influence epithelial cells differently to nonendometriotic stromal cell. We therefore propose an aberrant stromal cell inflammatory profile created by cells from women with endometriosis may contribute to the survival of endometriotic epithelial cells. METHODS: Primary endometrial stromal cells (ESC) isolated from women with and without endometriosis and immortalized endometrial/ endometriotic epithelial (EEC) cells lines (12Z, EME6/E6, Emosis) were used as in vitro models. NF\u03baB activation was determined by semiquantitative Western blot of phos-p65 and phos-p100. TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL8 and RANTES mRNA expression was determined via qPCR and cell viability determined by an MTS assay. RESULTS: Constitutive activation of the NF\u03baB p65 subunit was observed in ESC from non-endometriotic women, but not endometriotic women. TNF\u03b1 treatment produced a significant increase in TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL8, MCP1 and RANTES mRNA by endometriotic and non-endometriotic ESC, although with a distinct profile for each. TNF\u03b1, RANTES and IL6 had a significantly stronger induction in non-endometriotic ESC, whereas IL8 was significantly stronger in endometriotic ESC. Treatment of EEC with TNF\u03b1 resulted in a concentration dependent reduction in cell viability, whereas IL6 and IL8 increased cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: An aberrant basal activity of NF\u03baB leads to a distinct inflammatory profile of ESC from endometriotic women. This distinct profile leads to an increased production of cytokines, but with a reduced production of TNF\u03b1 compared to non-endometriotic women.",

Therefore, pERD has been tested in a first in human (FiH) clinical trial to assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and to predict efficacy by a modeling approach. METHODS: pERD and its main human metabolites M1/M16 have been tested on their antagonistic and agonistic activity at the ER and towards their in vivo efficacy by rat uterine growth in single dose and in combination of doses reflecting the exposure in women. In the FiH clinical study, 55 postmenopausal women each received single oral doses of 3 to 300 mg. pERD, M1 and M16 were determined in plasma using a LC-MS/MS method. Safety assessments included adverse events, laboratory parameters and ECG. Based on the preclinical and clinical results, simulations were performed to estimate the overall efficacy in humans. RESULTS: Oral administration of pERD and the main human metabolites M1/M16 to rats demonstrated a clear compromised antagonistic activity on the rat uterus exerted by partial ER agonistic activity of the two metabolites (p<0.0001). Single escalating oral doses of up to 300 mg to postmenopausal women were well tolerated. pERD exposure increased roughly dose-proportionally in plasma. The metabolites M1/M16 were exceeding the exposure of pERD. E max models could be developed to separately estimate the antagonistic effects of pERD and partial agonistic effects of M1/M16. Overall efficacy for different exposure ratios of pERD and metabolites were simulated suggesting that the overall antagonistic efficacy of pERD is substantially impaired by the metabolites at clinically relevant exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Simulations based on preclinical and early clinical data predict that the major metabolites of pERD compromise the antagonistic activity of pERD at the ER at clinically relevant doses, leading to a halt of further clinical development.",

The phenotype is reminiscent of eutopic endometrium in cases of endometriosis, where enhanced cytokine production, inflammation, reduced Cx43 and impaired decidual differentiation have been reported.

Supported by NIH grants T35 DK07400 and R21 HD78818. Red ginseng, especially Rg3, is known for its antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative effect, and recent discoveries indicate involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of red ginseng on endometriosis and to identify the target miRNA that are related to therapeutic effects of red ginseng on endometriosis. METHODS: Primary endometrial cell culture from patients with endometriosis and Ishikawa cell line was processed and incubated with RG extracts. Cell viability after different concentrations of RG extracts was evaluated using MTT assay. Cultured cell lines were treated with RG extract for 24 and 48 hours. After incubation, total RNAs were extracted and the proliferation, apoptosis, and fibrosis-related markers (Ki-67, Caspase3, and Col-1) were analyzed with real-time PCR. The results were statistically analyzed with SPSS ver.21. Further, total RNAs enriched with miRNAs were extracted before and after RG treatment and microRNA microarray analysis using Affemetrix's miRNA 4.0 was performed to evaluate miRNA changes associated with RG treatment; RESULTS: MTT assay on endometrial stromal cells with endometriosis revealed loss of viability at 0.8mg/ml of red ginseng extract for 48 hours. Therefore 0.4mg/ml of red ginseng extract was used for further analysis. The cell proliferation marker, Ki-67, and the fibrosis marker, Col-1, were significantly decreased in both stromal and Ishikawa cell lines after red ginseng treatment for 48 hours. MiRNA microarray revealed significant changes in several miRNAs after treatment. Among these miRNAs, mir-18b-5p, which is known to target connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), was significantly downregulated. Significantly decreased CTGF expressions were confirmed in endometrial stromal cells after 48 hours of RG treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Red ginseng was effective in alterations of proliferative and fibrotic characteristics of endometrial stromal cells. RG treatment appears to be strongly associated with inhibiting fibrosis. Moreover, this effect is presumed to be regulated by microRNAs. ), history of infertility (yes or no), and at least five years of documented clinical outcomes to evaluate for disease persistence and de novo presentation of breast cancer or adnexal cancer (ovary or fallopian tube). This yielded 180 cases for analysis. Negative controls were white non-Hispanic postmenopausal women with archived tissue biopsies for DNA and no history of endometriosis (n=177). DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue blocks and ID4 allelic discrimination was performed using Taqman. RESULTS: Infertility was more common in cases of severe endometriosis (12/52, 23%) than cases of mild endometriosis (7/128, 5%), Fisher exact p=0.001. Persistent endometriosis five years after index surgical staging was also more common in severe disease (37% vs 24%). The ID4 minor allele frequency in white controls was 0.40 (expected 0.39). The frequency was increased in endometriosis (0.45) and more so in severe disease (0.47), yielding an odds ratio of 1.6 [0.99-2.75], p=0.05. The ID4 variant was not associated with infertility or increased risk of persistent disease, but it may be a risk factor for breast/adnexal cancer (11% of CT/TT cases compared with 7% of CC homozygotes). CONCLUSIONS: ID4 is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates BRCA and is known to play a role in breast cancer. Although the functional significance of this allelic variant is unknown, we observed significant differences in allele frequency related to the severity of disease and possibly cancer risk.

However, the mechanism underlying activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in UFs is largely unknown. In this study, we used an in vitro cell culture model to investigate the role of polycomb protein EZH2 in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling of human UFs. METHODS: Immortalized human fibroid cells (HuLM), as well as human fibroid and adjacent myometrial tissues were used. Overexpression of EZH2 was performed using adenovirus expressing EZH2. RNA and protein expression was measured by quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. Nuclear extraction was prepared to determine the nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin. Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting. Selective inhibition of \u03b2-catenin was performed using ICG-001 compound. RESULTS: Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that expression levels of a subset of Wnt ligands and receptors are significantly increased in EZH2-HuLM cells compared to control cells (P<0.05). Importantly, both protein and RNA levels of \u03b2-catenin are markedly increased in EZH2-HuLM cells. Accumulation of \u03b2-catenin via translocation from cytoplasm into the nucleus was significantly increased in EZH2-HuLM cells as well. Further study indicated that the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin-regulated gene WISP1 are higher in EZH2-HuLM cells versus control (P<0.05). Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin using the compound ICG-001 decreased EZH2-induced increased cell proliferation. This effect is associated with decreased expression of \u03b2-catenin response gene WISP1 (P<0.05). At tissue level, higher RNA expression of WSP1 is observed in fibroid tissues as compared to adjacent myometrium samples, suggesting that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is activated in UFs.",

Eden R Cardozo, 1,2 Anatte E Karmon, 1,2 Leah Gatune, 1 Rosemary Foster, 1,2 Bo R Rueda, 1,2 Aaron K Styer. Although microRNA (miR) 21 is overexpressed in uterine fibroids relative to myometrium, the functional contribution of miR-21 to leiomyoma pathobiology remains unclear. Aberrant expression of miR-21 has been implicated as a regulator of fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation via transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling in human disease. However, the role of miR 21 in fibroid development and ECM formation (inclusive of TGF-\u00df mediators) has been incompletely studied. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of miR-21 overexpression on mediators of ECM formation in uterine fibroid cells. METHODS: An immmortalized fibroid cell line was infected with a SMARTchoice shMIMIC \u2122 lentiviral microRNA vector to achieve overexpression of miR 21a-5p. The relative expression of genes related to fibroid ECM formation were analyzed by RT-PCR and the resultant levels were compared to those determined in control cells infected with a lentivirus encoding a missense miR (NTC). Protein levels were evaluated by western blot. All experiments were performed with three biological replicates and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. A p-value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: MiR-21 overexpression resulted in an increase in gene expression of TGF-\u03b23 (p<0.01), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 (p=0.02) and MMP-11 (p<0.01) and a decrease in gene expression of fibronectin (FN1) (p<0.01), versican (p<0.01), collagen 1A1 (p=0.02) and connective tissue growth factor (p<0.01) compared to control. No significant change in TGF-\u03b2 receptor II expression was detected. Protein expression of TGF-\u03b23 was increased in miR-21 over-expressed cells (p<0.01) versus control. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-21 in uterine fibroid cells results in increased TGF-\u03b23 expression as well as changes in the expression of several genes involved in the extracellular matrix. These findings suggest that fibroid ECM formation may be mediated by miR 21 regulation of TGF\u03b23 and MMPs. Future studies will be necessary to delineate the mechanisms by which miR-21 influences ECM dysregulation in fibroids. INTRODUCTION: Uterine leiomyomas are common and symptomatic uterine tumors. The tumors demonstrate a disrupted retinoic acid pathway, with a reduced retinoic acid production proteins and increased breakdown enzymes, resulting in decreased endogenous retinoic acid. Treatment of leiomyoma cells with retinoic acid transformed the ECM phenotype to one that closely resembled myometrium. Ulipristal acetate (UPA) decreases leiomyoma volume, but it is unknown what impact UPA has on the retinoic acid metabolic pathway. We therefore hypothesized that UPA treatment increases endogenous retinoic acid and inhibits aberrant ECM formation. METHODS: Next generation sequencing (RNAseq) or genome-wide quantitative screening followed by western blot analysis for protein analysis, in surgical specimens of UPA-and placebo-treated leiomyomas.",

RESULTS: RNASeq data demonstrated that ulipristal acetate treated patient leiomyomas demonstrate a 4.61-fold downregulation of the transcripts of cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP26 family that are involved in catabolism of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1) involved in production of ATRA and is down regulated in fibroids demonstrated a 2-fold upregulation in UPA treated fibroid as compared to placebo group. An increase of 2-fold was observed in ATRA binding proteins CRABP1 and CRABP2 in UPA treated fibroids. This indicates an increase in endogenous ATRA on UPA treatment. We further observed a 2-fold downregulation of beta-catenin and related WNT pathway transcripts. Decrease in transcripts related to a decreased beta-catenin protein amount in most patients as observed by western blot analysis. We also demonstrated a 3-6-fold increased CYP26A1 protein in leiomyoma cells on treatment with gonadal hormones. Treatment of human 3-dimensional leiomyoma cultures with UPA confirmed that treatment resulted in increased ATRA concentration and increased ALD1A1, CRABP1, CRABP2, and decreased CYP26A1 protein concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Ulipristal functions, at least in part, by increasing retinoic acid exposure in human leiomyomas. Regulation of ATRA may therefore represent a critical step in controlling leiomyoma growth.",

Low sexual desire severity and Low sexual desire chart was assessed daily. T tests, Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests were analyzed. RESULTS: There was no significant difference among the studied variables in terms of confounding variables. The comparison of vitamin B1 group before the intervention with that after the intervention showed that vitamin B1 increased sexual desire (36%) significantly (P < 0.01). At the end of the quarter, 36% of the vitamin B1, 0.96% responded to placebo (P <0.1). Vitamin B1 was well tolerated and caused no side effects. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that vitamin B1 is effective in recovery of mental and physical symptoms of PMS such as Low sexual desire. Therefore, this vitamin can be used to reach a major goal of midwifery, that is, reduction of symptom severity of PMS -specially libido-without any side effects. Vitamin B1 is safe and effective drug therapies to treat Low sexual desire and it is known that most of the upper side is better tolerated.

HPV infects immature epithelial cells and requires autophagy to provide nutrients for its proliferation. The human hsp70 is a potent inhibitor and regulator of the extent of autophagy induction. We evaluated whether intracellular levels of hsp70 in cervicovaginal epithelial cells would be associated with detection of oncogenic HPV types as well as with abnormal Pap smears. METHODS: 42 women who came for their annual exam including a Pap smear were recruited (median age 42.5 years). Cervicovaginal epithelial cells were obtained with a cotton swab and deposited into sterile phosphate-buffered saline. Following centrifugation the pellet fraction containing epithelial cells was lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors. Aliquots were tested by ELISA for concentrations of hsp70 and for p62, an intracellular protein that is consumed during autophagy (high p62 = low autophagy). Clinical data was obtained after completion of the laboratory studies. High risk HPV was assessed by Aptima.Associations between hsp70 and clinical parameters were assayed by Student's t-test; associations between hsp70 and p62 were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation test.",

RESULTS: Exposure to purified MPO caused the spindles to thin and elongate along the pole-to-pole axis to over double the normal spindle length. In contrast, exposure to activated macrophages caused the spindles to shorten along the pole to pole axis, widen and expand to spherical shape. Although, our results show the deterioration in oocyte quality is likely to be caused by MPO in both cases, opposite movement along the pole to pole axis was noted after exposure to purified MPO versus macrophage co-culture.

However, after co-culture with activated macrophages, which produce higher amounts of MPO and importantly, other inflammatory cytokines and ROS, pericentrin is lost.

Pattern recognition and further quantification of these spindle morphologies may provide information as to the condition of the genetic material within the oocyte and serve as a biomarker for functional competence. This study investigated the effect of an isocaloric low protein (LP) diet with and without folate supplementation on the fluxes of cysteine and serine in the oocyte. These amino acids are critical for metabolic homeostasis because cysteine is the rate limiting amino acid for the synthesis of glutathione, the primary intracellular antioxidant. Serine provides the carbon skeleton for the synthesis of cysteine from methionine, and is a precursor for glycine, one of the amino acids that forms glutathione. METHODS: 24 rats were in three isocaloric dietary groups (n=8) for 40 days; control (C, 20%), low protein (LP, 6%) and low protein + folate (LPF, 6% + 5mg/kg folate). 15U of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin was given; 48h later animals underwent central catheterization under gas anesthesia. Isotopic tracers of 13C3-Serine and D2-Cysteine were infused as a 4h prime-constant rate. After sacrifice, germinal vesicle oocytes were denuded of cumulus cells. The rate of appearance of each traced amino acid was calculated using the tracer dilution method. ANOVA followed by post-hoc comparisons were performed. RESULTS: Preovulatory isocaloric protein restriction reduced the kinetics of oocyte serine and cysteine and folic acid supplementation rescued these changes. The flux of serine in the oocyte was significantly lower in the LP group compared to the LPF group (2133\u00b1191 vs. 3130\u00b1329; P<0.05) and trended lower compared to the control group (2722\u00b1215; P=0.06). The flux of cysteine in the oocyte was significantly reduced in both the LP and LPF groups compared to the control group (260\u00b126 and 255\u00b118 vs. 355\u00b123; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Preovulatory LP diet results in profound changes in oocyte amino acid metabolism. Serine flux is reduced which in turn impairs cysteine synthesis. Folate reversed the reduction in serine flux but cysteine production remained depressed, suggesting impaired glutathione synthesis and impaired oxidant-antioxidant homeostasis in the oocyte. These metabolic responses may affect the growth and development of oocytes. INTRODUCTION: As a model for stress in vivo, we hypothesize that clinically relevant AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) agonists may cause unwanted early pregnancy complications. Agonist types include pharma such as metformin and aspirin, and diet supplements (DS) such as bromo-3,3' diindolylmethane (BR-DIM) and resveratrol. To test this hypothesis, we cultured totipotent 2-cell mouse embryos with positive control stress hyperosmotic sorbitol or with experimentally and clinically relevant AMPK agonists. We then assayed for 1) the necessity and sufficiency of AMPK in mediating rapid potency loss (1hr), or 2) AMPK function via pharma and DS to affect culture of 2-cell embryos to blastocyst stage.",

We analyzed potency loss by immuno-fluorescence using previously published antibodies to Rex1 (Zfp-42) and Oct4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4) potency factors. RESULTS: Positive control, sorbitol stress decreases potency in mouse embryos and AMPK mediates stress-induced potency loss. The AMPK agonist metformin is sufficient to induce potency loss without stress. Nuclear Oct4 and Rex1 in 2-cell stage embryos undergo stress-induced loss that is decreased by the AMPK antagonist compound C. Preliminary data show that metformin and aspirin slow embryo growth in the 2 nd day, but cause embryo death by the 4 th day and these effects are completely reversed by compound C.This suggests that both metformin and aspirin act through AMPK to create morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically important pharma and DSs (e.g. metformin, aspirin, BR-DIM) are known to activate AMPK and a growing list of stem cell potency factors undergoes AMPK-dependent loss. Taken together the data suggests a possible toxicity range of single or multiple AMPK agonists prescribed to improve fertility or used by pregnant women ad hoc. AMPK appears to be the \"master regulatory\" enzyme that mediates stress-induced loss of potency factors in the totipotent 2 cell embryo that are important later in pluripotent ESCs and multipotent TSCs. We anticipate that AMPK agonists will mediate anabolic-to-catabolic shifts as in TSCs and this will slow growth of the embryo.",

INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRs) are highly conserved 9-22-nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that regulate more than 30% of the human genome. The endometrium is a steroid-hormone-responsive tissue that undergoes highly organized cyclic structural changes in preparation for embryo implantation. Here, we identified and investigated 17-\u03b2 estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) regulation of miRs in human endometrial stromal cells. Further, the effect of the widespread endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA), on these miRs was investigated. METHODS: Human endometrial stromal cells were serum-deprived for 16-24 h prior to treatment with vehicle, E2 (3 nM), P (100 nM) or E2+P for 16 h and subjected to miR microarray analysis in triplicate. RT-qPCR was performed to validate selected miRs. RESULTS: Several miRs were differentially expressed in the microarray based on treatment. Using biologic plausibility and fold-change, select miRs were validated in additional preps of primary stromal cells. Interestingly, E2 resulted in transient downregulation (3-fold, p=0.0004) of miR-let-7c at 8 h with return to baseline at 16 h. E2 also resulted in transient downregulation of miR-27b (5-fold, p=0.009) and miR-181b (2-fold, p=0.04). E2+P resulted in sustained increases of miR-181b (2.5-fold, p=0.04) and miR-let-7e (2-fold, p<0.01) at 24 h. In contrast with the negative effects of E2 on let-7c, miR-27b, and miR-181b; two miRNAs were transiently upregulated by E2 (miR-let-7e, 2-fold, p=0.08, 8h; miR-3613, 2-fold, p<0.02, 24 h). Similar to E2, BPA (3 -30 \u00b5M) resulted in transient downregulation (4-8 h) of miR-let 7c and miR-181b. BPA also downregulated miR-27b; but unlike E2, this downregulation was sustained and more profound (3.5-fold, p=0.006) at 24 h. The effects of BPA on miR-let-7e were also similar to E2 with significant transient upregulation at 8 h (2.5-fold, p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data indicate that E2 and P regulate miR profiles in endometrial stromal cells. E2-induced loss of miRlet-7c, miR-27b, and miR-181b may bring about increased expression of their predicted targets, IGFR-1, HOXA10, and osteopontin, respectively in endometrial stroma and thereby, promote endometrial growth and receptivity. The endocrine disruptor, BPA, exhibited effects similar to E2; but temporal relationships differed, suggesting that chronic exposure of endometrium to BPA may lead to dysfunctional endometrial cyclicity, implantation failure, or pregnancy loss. and 3. its production is up-regulated by TNF\u03b1 via NF-\u03baB signaling in endometrial epithelial cells. In normal pregnancy, the trophoblast releases TNF\u03b1 into the maternal circulation, leading to a controlled physiologic inflammation. However, abnormal inflammation due to elevated TNF\u03b1 has been associated with clinical miscarriages. We hypothesized that these two molecules can be measured in serum as a reflection of increased inflammation and can therefore be used as markers to predict implantation outcome. Objectives: 1) to measure luteal phase serum levels of MFG-E8 and TNF\u03b1 in women with recurrent pregnancy loss, repeated failed implantation in IVF (IF), and fertile controls (C); and to examine if TNF\u03b1 regulates MV secretion of MFG-E8 in vitro. METHODS: Serum levels of markers were measured by ELISA (n= 14 women). Ishikawa cells were treated or not with TNF\u03b1 (20 and 50 ng/ml for 3 days), and MVs isolated by ultracentrifugation of the culture media were subjected to immunoblotting, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and LC-ESI-MS/MS. RESULTS: Patients with IF showed higher levels of MFG-E8 and TNF\u03b1 as compared to C, increased over 2 times and 1.5 times, respectively. Ishikawa cell MVs secreted MFG-E8 was detected at 30kDa, and secretion was up-regulated by TNF\u03b1 (p<0.05). Furthermore, a specific peptide 1765.657048 was identified by MS/MS spectra with the sequence VTFLGLQHWVPELAR. These MVs were immobilized on mica substrate by AFM, and cross sectional imaging showed that MVs were approximately 115 nm in diameter. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data show that MFG-E8 and TNF\u03b1 levels in serum may be associated with defective or failed implantation, and that MFG-E8 MVs secretion in vitro is regulated by TNF\u03b1. The findings of this study could have major clinical impact and provide basis for potential therapeutic use of MFG-E8 and TNF\u03b1 analogues for implantation failure. Embryo implantation involves a complex sequence of events, and a large amount of molecules have been postulated to be involved in the interaction of embryo and endometrium. This study evaluated the endometrial expression of \u03b1-inhibin and betaglycan in the mid-secretory phase of women scheduled to in vitro fertilization (IVF) and tested whether these markers are associated with implantation failure.",

Previous work suggests that thrombin generation may play a pivotal role in development of these complications. Here, we investigated global gene expression profiles of human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) before and after decidualization and the effect of thrombin on these genomic changes. METHODS: HESCs from proliferative phase endometrium were treated with vehicle or thrombin at baseline or during decidualization with cAMP and MPA x 72 h. Next generation RNA sequencing was conducted in duplicate from two different cell preps. RESULTS: RNAseq data revealed massive changes in gene expression profiles during decidualization representing the following cell signaling pathways: cell cycle repair, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, ILK signaling, cAMP-mediated signaling, STAT3 pathways, \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, inhibition of MMPs, leukocyte extravasation, and oxidative stress response genes. As expected, and confirmed by qPCR in multiple cell preps, PRL was induced 9-fold as well as PRLR, IRS1, and JAK2. Likewise upregulation of IGF-1 and IGFBPs was confirmed including cell survival pathways and STAT3 signaling. Leukocyte activation and extravasation pathways were affected by induction of JAM2, ICAM-1, and CXCR4. Interestingly, thrombin altered decidualization-induced changes in gene expression with the most dramatic effects on IL-8 and IL-6. Specifically, thrombin (2U/ml) increased baseline IL-8 gene expression 33-fold (p < 0.001) in HESCs and 22-fold in decidualized cells (p < 0.001). IL-6 was increased from 1.0 \u00b1 0.5 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.25 RU/h36B4 at baseline and 2.5-fold during decidualization (p < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide insights regarding the predominant cell signaling pathways activated during decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells. Further, the results indicate that thrombin adversely affects decidualization in vitro primarily through increases in proinflammatory chemokines IL-8 and IL-6. We suggest that intrauterine bleeding and generation of thrombin accentuates leukocyte extravasation and endometrial inflammation, impairs decidualization, and endometrial support of early pregnancy.",

Tomohiko Murase, Satoko Osuka, Tomoko Nakamura, Sachiko Takikawa, Maki Goto, Akira Iwase, Fumitaka Kikkawa. Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Due to the remarkable progress of fertility preservation techniques, in recent years the autologous transplantation of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue has become possible. In the field of basic research, the development of ovarian follicles is being studied by adding various growth factors to human-or animal-derived ovarian tissue or isolated follicles. It has been reported that the early stages of follicular development can be promoted through the fragmentation of ovarian tissue. In this study, we fragmented murine ovarian tissue and evaluated the activation of primordial follicles and the development of early-stage follicles after cultivation in the presence of various growth factors, through the use of a new method with which ovarian tissue can be immunostained with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU).",

We think that this method will facilitate the evaluation of the effects of growth factors on in vitro cultures of human ovarian tissue in the future. Few reproductive events are more devastating to couples than recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), however, in less than 50% of losses there is no associated etiology found. Although sporadic pregnancy loss occurs in 10-15% of pregnancies, RPL is experienced in 2-5% of couples and even less often in younger women. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells of developing oocytes and has been shown to decrease in parallel with the physiologic decline of oocyte number and chromosomal normalcy, which is an objective quantification of ovarian age.",

Unique to this study is the additional evaluation of ovarian \"biologic age\" by assessment of serum AMH adjusted to chronologic age and ovulation status. RESULTS: Evaluation of 166 RPL couples disclosed the incidences of thyroid dysfunction, uterine anomalies or anti-phopholipid disorders were no higher that that in the general population. However, 5 of 166 women (3%), demonstrated chromosomal abnormalities and 47 of 166 women, or 28%, were diagnosed with ovulatory dysfunction by transvaginal ultrasound. In contrast to the low incidence of reproductive abnormalities identified by traditional evaluation, 116 patients (70%) had significantly decreased ovarian reserve, or premature ovarian aging, with AMH values more than 2 standard deviations below that of age adjusted expectations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that \"biologic ovarian age\" was significantly older than \"chronologic ovarian age\" and that AMH values are significantly lower in the majority of patients with RPL. These results may have significant implications for couples for any age and especially RPL couples. AMH assessment should be included in the initial evaluation of RPL and a low value should prompt a discussion of pre-implantation genetic evaluation. While women with RPL and/or low AMH are not necessarily infertile, they may be at an increased risk for both decreased fecundity and the potential long term health implications of subsequent premature menopause. We hypothesize that CD83 as well as sCD83 are involved in adaptation to pregnancy and regulate maternal immunologic response.",

We present an experimental workflow novel to reproductive biology for unbiased identification of decidual immune subsets by dimensionality reduction of highly-polychromatic flow cytometry. METHODS: Decidual specimens were dissected from human term placentas and mononuclear cells (MCs) were isolated by mechanical (GentleMACS) and enzymatic (2 mg/mL Collagenase 5, 0.2 mg/mL DNAse I) disruption. MCs labeled by flurochrome-conjugate antibodies against CD3, 4, 8, 11c, 14, 16, 19, 24, 25, 27, 34, 45, 45RA, 45RO, 56, 80, 94, 117, 123, 127, 161, 183, 184, 196, 197, 294, 336, 370 . Data acquisition was performed using BD Fortessa flow cytometer in a 4 laser (355nm, 405nm, 488nm, 562nm), 18 parameter (2 scatter and 16 fluorescent narrowband detectors) configuration. Manual data analysis was performed using FlowJo. Dimensionality reduction by Barnes-Hut modification of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and density-based k-means clustering was performed using the ACCENSE package (Shekar, K, et al. PNAS 111:202 Observational studies have demonstrated that the incidence and severity of sexually transmitted HIV infection increases in association with long acting progestin contraceptive use. It is suspected that progesterone alters the constitutive immune environment of the female reproductive tract (FRT) possibly by decreasing cytokine expression. We believe the type I interferon, interferon epsilon (IFN\u03b5), may play a role in this process but its localization and regulation by steroid hormones in human tissue from the FRT has not be established. METHODS: Endometrial, endocervical, ectocervical and vaginal tissue from 26 premenopausal women were obtained from non-malignant hysterectomy samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for IFN\u03b5, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) was performed to determine localization. Effects of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), and E2+P4 on IFN\u03b5 expression was measured in endometrial and vaginal tissue explant cultures using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and IHC. Two-tailed Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: IFN\u03b5 was detected in the epithelial layer of the vagina and ectocervix, specifically localized within the basal cell layer, and in endometrial and endocervical glandular epithelial cells. No IFN\u03b5 was detected in the stromal tissue of the FRT. IFN\u03b5 co-localized with ER and PR within endometrial and endocervical glandular cells but not vaginal and ectocervical squamous epithelial cells. IFN\u03b5 mRNA expression was found in all four tissue types. In endometrial tissue, IFN\u03b5 mRNA expression significantly decreased from baseline in the E2+P4 treatment group (p=0.004). Treatment with P4 also decreased IFN\u03b5 abundance, however this was not statistically different (p=0.064). Neither steroid affected IFN\u03b5 mRNA expression in vaginal tissue (p >0.648). CONCLUSIONS: Constitutive production of IFN\u03b5 occurs in the FRT. Direct hormonal control in the form of progesterone inhibition may exist in the endocervix and endometrium, however this may not be true in vagina and ectocervix. This may be a mechanism by which long acting progestin contraceptive use is associated with increased risk for HIV infection via the FRT.",

INTRODUCTION: An adequately regulated immune balance is vital for tolerance towards paternal antigens and therewith uncomplicated pregnancies. Studies have shown that the maternal immune system memorizes paternal antigens and with that possibly reduces the risk of pregnancy complications. This project aims to examine the short-and long-term effects of pregnancy on memory T cells. METHODS: Memory T cell subsets and their activation status were analyzed in peripheral blood of 14 women that were never pregnant (nulligravida), 13 women that were pregnant for the first time (primigravida), and 15 women with an uncomplicated pregnancy that delivered at least 6 months before blood withdrawal. Analysis was done using flow cytometry and populations were compared between the healthy volunteer groups using Mann-Whitney U-test; p<0.05. RESULTS: Frequencies of CD4+ memory cells (CD45R0+) were significantly higher in women that delivered compared to nulligravid women. In these women both central memory (CM; CD45R0+CCR7+) and effector memory (EM; CD45R0+CCR7-) cell frequencies were significantly higher. EM/CM ratios did not differ between women that delivered and nulligravid women, however, in the primigravid women a shift towards EM cells was seen. Compared to nulligravid women, proportions of activated (CD69+) cells in both memory cell subsets were significantly higher in pregnant women and in women that delivered.",

When the six 'failed' embryos were rebiopsied, three were found to have normal chromosomal status, increasing the ratio of diploid embryos from 20% to 35%. The ovarian follicular pool is progressively depleted leading to increased serum FSH levels and associated shortening of the follicular phase. We hypothesize that these changes are associated with increased expression of genes involved in folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis. Hence the objective of the study is to determine the changes in ovarian gene expression associated with aging. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice (N=12) were fed normal chow (NC) diet. At 20w of age, 6 mice were sacrificed. The remaining 6 mice continued their NC diet for another 12 weeks. At 32w of age, the remaining 6 mice were sacrificed. At the time of sacrifice, one ovary was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR for detecting the following genes: Gdf-9, Bmp-15, Foxl2, Gja1 (mouse homolog for human connexin 43), Fshr, B-fgf, Lhcgr, epiregulin, Star, Scc, Cyp19a1 (aromatase), Hsd3b1 (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and Cyp17a1 (17-alpha-hydroxylase).

However, unlike NC mice, they did not have an increase in expression of Scc, Hsd3b1, and Cyp17a1. CONCLUSIONS: HF diet, together with increased adiposity leads to blunted response of steroidogenic genes to SO. Lack of upregulation of Scc, Hsd3b1, and Cyp17a1 genes in the ovaries of mice fed high fat diet may contribute to the poorer response to COH seen with obesity. These changes may be responsible for decreased oocyte collection seen in HF diet and obesity.

However, there is considerable variability in follicular phase length, which may impact pregnancy. We hypothesize that a shortened or lengthened follicular phase will result in a decreased ongoing pregnancy rate, defined as \u226510 weeks of gestation. METHODS: This is an observational cohort study of prospectively collected data. Institutional IRB approval was obtained. Inclusion criteria: women with a history of 2 or more documented pregnancy losses < 10 wk size and a subsequent monitored pregnancy, seen in an academic RPL program between 2005 and 2012. All pregnancies were conceived with intercourse timed to the LH surge. The length of the follicular phase was defined as the number of days from the LMP to LH surge, inclusive. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy of \u226510 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) was performed. RESULTS: 131 pregnancies (110 women) were included in the analysis with a mean age of 35.5 yr (SD 3.6) and a mean of 3.9 prior pregnancy losses (SD 2.0). The ongoing pregnancy rate in this cohort was 62.6% (82/131). The mean follicular phase length in the cycle of conception was 15.6 days (SD 4.5). There was a higher ongoing pregnancy rate among women with a follicular phase of 13-15 days, however this difference did not reach statistical significance. The ongoing pregnancy rate was 53.9%, 72.6% and 57.4% among women with a follicular phase of < 13 days, 13-15 days and > 15 days respectively (p=0.16). Controlling for age and BMI did not significantly alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend toward a lower ongoing pregnancy rate in women with a shortened or lengthened follicular phase.

INTRODUCTION: Saline flush aspiration during oocyte retrieval has long been described as a method for increasing oocyte retrieval rates. Data has been mixed on the effectiveness of this practice and has yet to show a clear advantage or disadvantage to flush aspiration procedures. Our study focused on the possibility of hormonal side effects to flush aspiration. The flush aspiration process may disrupt the ability for granulosa cells to produce estrogen and progesterone effectively. This is the first study to our knowledge designed to examine if saline flush aspiration is associated with significant increase in oocytes retrieved and if this procedure could be associated with any significant changes in hormonal milieu post-retrieval. METHODS: Medical records review of UM infertility clinic patients ages 18 years and older undergoing IVF stimulation and trial transfers from 9/2014 to 1/2015. The data collected included: E2 level at day of HCG trigger, day of aspiration of oocyte, 24 hours post-retrieval and day of transfer; P4 level at day of HCG trigger, day of aspiration of oocyte, 24 hours post-retrieval and day of transfer; all points were compared for aspiration with saline flush versus non-flush.",

No statistical difference was noted in E2 level 24 hours post-retrieval (P-value 0.09, mean 0.79125 vs. 0.73818). However, in analysis of P4 values 24 hrs post retrieval statistical significance was seen in drop in P4 in flush versus non-flush aspiration (P=0.029)In further analysis, controlling for IVF protocol and analyzing only Lupron stimulation patients, there was no statistical difference in E2 on day of retrieval (P=0.27). However, there was statistically significant decrease in both E2 and P4 levels 24 hours after flush aspiration in comparison to non-flush aspiration groups (P=0.03, P=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Follicular aspiration flush did not increase the number of oocytes retrieved. Furthermore, there was significant drop in P4 levels in patients that underwent follicular flush 24 hrs post retrieval. In agonist protocol patients a significant drop was noted 24 hrs post retrieval in both E2 and P4. These significant hormonal changes could negatively impact pregnancy rates. Transfer of cryopreserved-warmed embryos into a uterus unaffected by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation has become common in recent years. There is limited information on the effect of embryo cryopreservation and warming on placental function. We sought to determine if cryopreserved-warmed embryos differed from fresh embryos in placental function, by comparing birth weight, preterm delivery rate, and preeclampsia rate between embryo transfer types.",

CONCLUSIONS: A reduction of Cx43 expression because of ceftriaxone means a corruption of the blood-testis barrier, which provides protection of microenvironment created by Sertoli cells, for the differentiation of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules.

Additionally, a questionnaire assessing barriers to referral was administered to providers seeing women for a new consultation by the MGH Cancer Center between August 2014 to July 2015. A one tailed t-test and chi-square were calculated using a p=0.05. RESULTS: A total of 6,895 women, aged 18-44, were seen at the MGH Cancer Center from December 2010 to August 2015. 4,367 of them were seen before the establishment of the Oncofertility Clinic and 2,528 after. Of those, a total of 150 were referred for fertility consultation, 74 before the clinic and 76 after. Since the clinic was founded, the mean time from booking to appointment decreased by 2.81 days, from 10.38 to 7.57 (p=.034). Furthermore, the percentage of cancer patients referred has increased from 1.7% to 3.01% (Chi-square = 12.95, p<0.01). Of the patients not referred, \"have children\" (38.9%) and \"treatment likely won't impact fertility\" (20.7%) were the leading causes. Only 2% of doctors cited \"not enough time for referral\" and none cited that \"fertility preservation would be unsafe.\" CONCLUSIONS: Despite the recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, not all female cancer patients of reproductive age are referred for fertility preservation consultation. Barriers cited include emergent need to start treatment, providers own lack of knowledge, poor prognosis, and already having children. In our cohort, we demonstrated that a dedicated Oncofertility Clinic increases physician referrals and decreases the mean time to consultation. Of those not referred, the safety, timeliness, and appropriateness of fertility preservation treatment appear to not be a factor in clinician decision-making. As fertility preservation options improve, establishing a dedicated oncofertility clinic is a crucial step in enhancing access to fertility preservation specialists. Under an approved Human Investigation Committee protocol, endometrial samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery for benign gynecological disorders. Endometrial cell suspensions containing stem cells cells were plated with the murine cardiomyocytes. Co-cultured cells were treated with differentiation medium containing 100 nM oxytocin (OT) for 2 weeks (10% FBS DMEM-F-12, 1% antibiotics-antimycotics, and 100 nM OT). Control endometrial cell suspensions containing stem cells were cultured in isolation and also received differentiation medium. Differentiation medium was replaced every 3 days. 14 days after differentiation, dsRed positive cardiomyocytes were separated from the differentiated endometrial stem cells cells via FACS. mRNA was extracted from the co-cultured and control cells using a Qiagen RNeasy kit, and expression of cardiomyocyte markers (NK2 Homeobox 5, Cardiac Troponin T and I, and ISL LIM Homeobox 2) was analyzed by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Co-culture with murine neonatal cardiomyocytes significantly increased the expression of NKX2.5, a transcription factor that regulates heart development and protects cardiomyocytes against cytotoxins, by 8-fold. Co-culture did not significantly affect the expression of ISL1, cTnI, or cTnT in comparison with differentiation medium alone. CONCLUSIONS: While the effect of oxytocin as a differentiation agent for EDSCs has been previously demonstrated, co-culture with murine cardiomyocytes may prove to be a useful tool in increasing efficiency of differentiation to a cardiomyocyte-like fate. EDSCs may offer a novel and easily accessible source of stem cells with vast clinical potential.",

We have identified p63 as a proliferative cytotrophoblast (CTB) stem cell marker in the early human placenta, and have shown that it is required for BMP4-induced differentiation of hPSCs into functional trophoblast (hCG-secreting syncytiotrophoblast/ STB and HLAG+ extravillous trophoblast/EVT). We have developed defined media for reproducible differentiation of hPSCs into bipotential p63+/CDX2+ CTB stem cells, and applied this protocol to both normal and Trisomy 21-hPSCs, showing that a trophoblast differentiation defect can be modeled using hPSCs. METHODS: Feeder-free hPSC lines were differentiated into CTB in minimal media plus 10 ng/ml BMP4 for 4-6 days (1st step). These cells were then replated into feeder-conditioned media with BMP4, and cultured for additional 6 days to terminally differentiate (2nd step). Differentiation was analyzed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR for lineagespecific markers, hCG ELISA for STB-specific hormone secretion, and immunohistochemistry for morphological evaluation. During the 2nd step, we also treated some cells with 5 ng/ml Activin A and assayed for morphologic and functional rescue of the T21 phenotype. (Table) . Risks for low Apgar scores and need for antibiotics, assisted ventilation, and surfactant therapy were similarly lower for older, compared to younger, mothers. Risk for seizures did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Risk for stillbirth was lower for women with twins aged 35 to 39 and >39 compared to women aged 18 to 34. Risk for early preterm birth (<32 weeks) was lower for older women as well, as was risk for several adverse outcomes associated with prematurity. Twin pregnancies for older women may involve similar risk as younger women. *Figure(s) will be available online. (Figure) . Gestational age retained significance in the adjusted model. Cumulative risk for stillbirth increased approximately 0.1% per week from 36 to <40 weeks gestational age, with higher rates of increase beyond 40 weeks gestation (Figure) . CONCLUSIONS: Determination of optimal delivery timing for pregnancies affected by chronic hypertension involves balancing risk for stillbirth with risk for adverse neonatal outcomes. Delivery after 40 weeks gestational age was associated with both increased risk for the composite adverse neonatal outcome and additional risk for stillbirth, suggesting that perinatal outcomes may be improved with delivery by estimated due date for this condition. *Figure(s) will be available online.

Singleton live births were linked to the birth certificates of their parents as well as their aunts and uncles (parental siblings) resulting in a cohort of 192,518 first born singleton children with both parents born in Utah, 6,786 (3.5%) of whom were born in breech presentation. Adjusted odds ratios were determined for an increased risk of breech presentation in first born children based on either their mother or father being born breech while controlling for gestational age at birth, maternal age, uterine malformations, amniotic fluid abnormalities, congenital anomalies, birth weight, parental education, and parental gestational age at birth. Additionally, interactions between parental sibling birth status and a child's risk for breech presentation were analyzed. RESULTS: If either parent was born breech, their first born child was significantly more likely to be delivered in breech presentation. Pts with IAS had significantly shorter Cx length at time of cerclage; 9.9 \u00b1 7 vs. 13.7 \u00b1 6.7mm (P = 0.025) and more frequently had Cx funneling (P = 0.022). Other baseline characteristics were largely similar. CONCLUSIONS: Despite associated differences in Cx funneling and shorter Cx, presence of IAS did not affect pregnancy outcome for gestational age (GA) at birth and neonatal birth weight. These results suggest that presence of IAS does not contraindicate use of optimally placed cerclage in asymptomatic pts who are candidates for cerclage.

Women who simultaneously received prostaglandins were excluded. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine whether a favorable cervical exam post-ripening was associated with VD as well as VD within 24 hours.

Inhibition of trans-signaling is mediated by soluble gp130 (sgp130) binding to the sIL6R. This study investigated the IL-6 trans-signaling pathway across the neonatal period in very preterm infants (<30 weeks) with and without BPD.

While the functional consequences remain to be investigated, these results indicate that fetal exposure to GC may have long-term, later life cardiovascular dysfunction. and merit further study to enable diagnosis and management of potential adverse outcomes.",

Ultrasound-derived fetal weight was adjusted by 21g per day of gestation that elapsed between ultrasound and delivery to arrive at the predicted birth weight. BMI was kept as a continuous variable and accuracy was calculated as the percentage of predicted weight to birth weight. Maternal race and diabetes status were also assessed. Linear regression analysis was conducted using STATA 12 RESULTS: 403 pregnant women met inclusion criteria. Age ranged from 13-44 years (Mean = 28.38, SD = 5.97). The average BMI was 32.62 (SD = 8.59). The majority of the women did not have diabetes (N = 300, 74%). The sample was primarily white (N = 166, 41%) and Hispanic (N = 147, 36%). Average neonatal weight at delivery was 3335.92g (SD = 585.46g). The average predicted weight of neonates at delivery was 3562.28g (SD = 531.88g). Based on regression analyses, as BMI increased, so did predicted weight (p < .000) and weight at delivery (p < .000). The accuracy of estimation of ultrasound-derived birth weight was not predicted by maternal BMI (p= .441). Maternal race and diabetes status were not associated with the accuracy of ultrasound in predicting birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Body Mass Index, race and presence of diabetes do not affect accuracy of ultrasound in prediction of birth weight.",

A prolonged second stage was associated with an increased risk of third and fourth degree lacerations after adjustment for confounders (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.14-3.89, p = 0.016). This association was seen with each additional hour in the second stage. Other predictors of third and fourth degree lacerations included operative delivery (aOR 6.34, 95% CI 3.34-12.07, p < 0.001) and Asian race (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.06-4, p = 0.032). Age, obesity, macrosomia, prenatal provider type (physician versus midwife), regional anesthesia, episiotomy and induction of labor were not associated with an increased risk of these lacerations. As expected, the risk of hemorrhage was increased with a prolonged second stage (aOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.35-5.52, p = 0.005). A trend towards an increased risk of chorioamnionitis was seen in our cohort; however, this did not reach statistical significance (aOR 1.51, 95% CI 0.92-2.49). CONCLUSIONS: Second stage length is associated with an increased incidence of third and fourth degree lacerations among term nulliparas as early as two hours into pushing. This study compares one group of low-risk, spontaneously conceived pregnancies with no antithrombotic treatment to a second consisting of high-risk, ART conceived pregnancies being treated with antithrombotics using LMWH and low-dose aspirin. While taking into consideration the statistically increased poor outcomes associated with infertility and ART pregnancies in general, it is our goal to study the effects of LMWH treatment on the incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes in ART conceived pregnancies in comparison to a cohort of spontaneously conceived low-risk pregnancies, not treated with antithrombotics. METHODS: 615 ART patients treated with anticoagulants were compared with 391 low-risk, untreated patients which were matched for age and time of delivery. All ART patients suffered from multifactorial thrombophilia diagnosed during infertility evaluation and were treated with 40mg daily of enoxaparin and 81mg daily of aspirin. The two groups were than compared for significant clinical outcomes including IUGR, PPROM, prematurity, preeclampsia, fetal death, abruptio placentae, fetal death, neonatal death.Data analysis was performed using simple regression, and one-way analysis of variance for comparison of the means of numerical continuous data, and X2 analysis categorical. Statistical significance was set at p value of <0.05 RESULTS: The incidence of preterm birth, IUGR, preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, and PPROM were significantly lower in the ART, anticoagulated study group in comparison to the control group. There was no statistically significant difference seen in the incidence of fetal demise or placental abruption. Administration of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) along with midtrimester cervical length screening are strategies to prevent recurrent preterm birth. Some providers continue cervical length screening beyond 24 weeks gestation, though data supporting this practice are limited. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cervical length screening beyond 24 weeks gestation in women with a prior preterm birth. METHODS: A decision analytic model was designed using TreeAge software to compare cost-effectiveness of cervical length screening and no cervical length screening beyond 24 weeks gestation in a theoretic cohort of 100,000 women with a singleton gestation and prior preterm birth who are treated with 17OHP in the current pregnancy. Cost, probability and utility estimates were derived from existing literature. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000/QALY. Secondary outcomes included deep venous thromboembolism (DVT), maternal death, neonatal demise and neonatal neurodevelopmental disability. Timing of antenatal corticosteroid administration was taken into consideration with each possible outcome. RESULTS: In our theoretic cohort, cervical length screening beyond 24 weeks gestation was not a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $553,768 per QALY. In addition, there would be 4,220 more DVTs and 4 more maternal deaths in women who are screened. Neonatal outcomes did not differ between the two groups (Table) .",

            "text": "This was a retrospective cohort study of young women enrolled in an adolescent-specific (ages 12-22 years) prenatal care program from 2009-2015. All young women seen in this clinic had urine toxicology screening at their first prenatal visit and completed a questionnaire for self-reported drug use. Women with their first prenatal visit before the legalization of marijuana in Colorado on January 1, 2014 were compared to women with their first prenatal visit after legalization. Chi-square was used to compare rates of urine positivity for marijuana in the two groups. The two groups were also compared for demographic characteristics and the use of tobacco and other drugs using t-tests and chi square as appropriate. Cohen's kappa coefficient measured concordance of reported use with positive urine toxicology screening. RESULTS: 1,698 young women were included; 1,148 before legalization and 550 after. Demographic characteristics of young women before and after legalization were not different with the exception of the percent of nulliparous women which was higher in the post-legalization group (74% versus 68%, p=0.016). The percentage of young women with a positive urine toxicology screen for marijuana was higher after legalization (16.2% versus 20.2%) [OR 1.3 (1.0-1.7), p=0.048]. The agreement between selfreported marijuana use and urine toxicology screening for marijuana was better after legalization (kappa = 0.191 before versus kappa = 0.504 after). CONCLUSIONS: Over 20% of pregnant teenagers had positive urine toxicology screens at entry to prenatal care in a state with legalized marijuana. Marijuana use was higher following legalization, even in a population that cannot legally access it. Agreement between self-report and urine toxicology results improved in a legalized environment which may allow for earlier education and intervention to decrease use. INTRODUCTION: Thyroid dysfunction has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes. However, less is known regarding subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and thyroid autoimmunity and their relationship to obstetrical events. Thus, our objective was to examine the association between pre-pregnancy anti-thyroid antibodies, subclinical hypothyroidism and preterm delivery (PTD), gestational diabetes (GDM), and preeclampsia. METHODS: Prospective cohort study from a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of preconception low-dose aspirin to prevent pregnancy loss among healthy fertile women (n=1228). Baseline levels of TSH, fT4, anti-thyroglubulin antibody (anti-TG) and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) were measured. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using generalized linear models adjusting for age and body mass index. [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] [2011] [2012] [2013] ) was used to identify pregnant patients with penetrating trauma injuries. Demographics, clinical variables on admission (including injury severity score, ISS), injury mechanism, and pregnancy and maternal outcomes were recorded and analyzed. ISS is an anatomical scoring system based on 6 body systems; higher scores indicate more severe injuries. Patients with SBP < 90mmHg were examined to determine if their outcomes were worse than those with SBP \u2265 90mmHg.",

This study sought to assess the prevalence of different microbial communities (community state type (CSTs)) at varying time points in pregnancy, to determine if there is an association between race and the frequency of CSTs, as well as protective low vaginal Ph and CSTS. METHODS: CV biospecimens from a prospective cohort of singleton pregnancies were collected at 3 time points, 16-20; 21-24; and 25-28 weeks. 177 women who delivered at term were randomly select from the parent cohort. Characterization of the microbiota was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. CSTs were determined using Support Vector machine classifier trained on 4000 vaginal samples. A cohort of non-pregnant (NP) women (n=173), frequency matched for race, were used to compare the effect of pregnancy on CST frequency. Bacterial taxa analyses were performed using mixed effects models to determine associations between specific bacteria and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: CSTs were stable throughout pregnancy. Frequency of CSTs was significantly different by race (Figure 1 ). * Figure( s) will be available online.",

Contrary to existing dogma, in pregnancy, an basic vaginal pH is not consistently correlated to the absence of Lactobacillus and may explain different host immune responses to microbial communities.

Logistic regression and linear regression were computed. RESULTS: We identified 379 women with standard ARV (NRTI + PI) and 27 women with alternative ARV (NRTI + nNRTI or II or NRTIs only) during the study period. There was no significant difference in the rate of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, prematurity, or mode of delivery among groups. Women on standard ARV were more inclined to choose permanent sterilization while those on alternative ARV opted for long-acting reversible contraception more frequently (adjusted P=0.001). We identified 21 MTCT cases (4.7% rate) during the study period; however, there was no significant difference in the rate of HIV infected infants among groups, 20/379 (5.2%) with maternal standard AVR and 1/27 (3.7%) with alternative ARV; P=0.3.

INTRODUCTION: Adaptations to pregnancy include physiological changes, which often can be associated with nausea and vomiting. This process can become a pathological state of hyperemesis gravidarum. The differential diagnosis includes twin gestation, molar pregnancy, and one recently described, hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome. This pathologic process occurs with chronic and frequent use of cannabis, usually seen with a smoking history longer than one year. Symptoms include severe cyclic vomiting, flushing, sweating, and pyrexia. Abstinence of cannabis resolves symptoms in 24-48 hours with intravenous hydration. The purpose of this case report is to bring to the attention of maternal and fetal medicine specialists to consider hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome in patients when hyperemesis gravidarum does not follow its usual clinical course. Hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome may be misdiagnosed or underreported in pregnancy. METHODS: This is a case report and literature review of hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome. RESULTS: Patient is a 21 year old primigravida with no history of drug use. The patient's first admission occurred at six weeks gestation followed by 13 admissions. The patient improved on each admission with intravenous hydration and antiemetics. At 30 weeks gestation, patient admitted to one week history of daily cannabis use. The hyperemesis severity was worsened by Helicobacter pylori infection which was incompletely treated during pregnancy secondary to non-compliance. Patient was diagnosed with hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome at 30 weeks gestation by gastroenterology physician. At 35 weeks gestation, the patient developed pre eclampsia and was induced into labor. Patient delivered a viable male infant weighing 2430 grams. Patient was discharged on postpartum day two. The patient was readmitted on postpartum day nine with intractable vomiting, tachycardia, and dehydration. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed with biopsies which were positive for inflammation and H. pylori. She received intravenous hydration, antiemetics, and discharged on hospital day two. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hyperemesis cannabinoid syndrome may be increasing in the general population, therefore it is important to draw attention in the obstetric population.",

INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D (VD) deficiency has been identified as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). On the other hand, VD supplementation is believed to have potential benefit in reducing CVDs and mortality risk. Increased endothelial (EC) microparticle (MP) shedding plays significant roles under oxidative stress in CVDs. In this study, we aimed to investigate if VD could protect EC to reduce MP release under oxidative stress condition and what cellular mechanisms is involved. METHODS: ECs were isolated from umbilical cord vein of normal term placentas. 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 was used as bioactive VD. ECs were grown in 6 well/plate and incubated under normoxic (5%CO 2 /95% air) or hypoxic (2%O 2 /5%CO 2 /93%N 2 ) conditions in the presence or absence of VD at 50nM for 48h. MP was then isolated from culture medium by a two-step centrifugation (400xg for 20min and 20,000xg for 60min) procedure. Total cellular protein was collected for protein expression. MP release was quantified by detection of annexin V positive binding by flow cytometry. TruCount was measured as internal control for each sample. Cell protein expression for VD receptor (VDR), Akt signaling pathway molecules total Akt, p-Akt ser473 and its downstream molecules heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOs) were determined by Western blot. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE and were analyzed by ANOVA and paired t-test. A p level < 0.05 was set as statistically significant. RESULTS: MP release was significantly increased in ECs when cultured under hypoxic condition compared to normoxic condition, p<0.01. In contrast, cells treated with VD released significantly less MP vs. untreated controls under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, p<0.05. For protein expression, VDR expression was down regulated in cells cultured under hypoxic condition but was upregulated in cells treated with VD under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. EC expression of Akt, p-Akt ser473 , HO-1, and eNOs were all reduced in cells cultured under hypoxic condition, which could be prevented when cells were treated with VD.",

Low protein (LP) diet during pregnancy results in reduced placental and fetal weights and programs hypertension in adult offspring and in these pregnant rats insulin levels were lower during late gestation. In this study we hypothesized that expansion of pancreas is impaired in pregnant rats fed LP diet due to disrupted function of local renin-angiotensin system. METHODS: Pregnant SD rats were fed a diet with 20% (control; CT) or 6% casein (LP) from Day 1 of pregnancy until sacrificed on Day 21 (n=6-10 rats/diet) and plasma was collected for insulin measurement by ELISA. Pancreatic islets were isolated and both mRNA and protein levels of Ace, Ace2, Agtr1a and Agtr2 were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. The effect of LP diet on these parameters was analyzed by one-way ANONA. RESULTS: 1) Plasma insulin levels were reduced (P < 0.05) by 2.3-fold in LP compared to CT group; 2) mRNA levels of Ace in pancreatic islets were unchanged in LP rats, while those of Ace2 were increased (P < 0.001) by 1.5-fold; 3) mRNA levels of Agtr1a were unchanged in LP rats, while those of Agtr2 were reduced (P < 0.001) by 5.5-fold; 4) The abundance of ACE protein was unchanged in LP rats, while the abundance of ACE2 was decreased (P < 0.05) by 1.7-fold; 5) The abundance of AGTR1 protein was unchanged in LP rats, while the abundance of AGTR2 was decreased (P < 0.05) by 2.1-fold. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased plasma angiotensin II levels in pregnant rats fed LP diet, the reduced expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor in pancreatic islets may cause impaired pancreatic expansion. Our objective is to determine the association of body composition with the development of preeclampsia and changes in endothelial function. Therefore, we hypothesize that women who develop preeclampsia will have reduced flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) and a greater percentage of central abdominal adipose tissue prior to pregnancy.",

However, women (n=20) who go on to develop preeclampsia have a greater percentage of total body fat (41.2\u00b12.5 vs 33.3\u00b11.5%;P<0.05) that is preferentially distributed in the android (43.2\u00b15.8 vs 32.4\u00b11.9%;P<0.04) and gynoid (50.4\u00b12.8 vs 41.5\u00b11.3%;P<0.02) regions.

Although FMD is associated with pre pregnancy body composition, we did not observe that pre pregnancy or early pregnancy FMD was associated with the subsequent development of preeclampsia.

Pregnancy is associated with maternal metabolic adaptations (increased cholesterol and triglycerides) that are essential for the growth of the fetus. In mammals, physiological and behavioral changes are driven via biological clocks entrained by the light-dark/restactivity cycles that define feeding time and body temperature. A number of oscillators are present in the peripheral organs that are synchronized by cues from the suprachiasmatic nucleus and impact metabolic pathways. We hypothesize that maternal metabolic adaptations fluctuate during the light dark cycle (LDC) and are differentially regulated in early and late pregnancy. METHODS: C57BL6 mice were sacrificed in early pregnancy (day 7 post-coitum (pcm)) and in later in pregnancy (day 14pcm) at 4-hour intervals over a 24-hour LDC. Mice collected on day 2pcm were used as controls. Metabolic and clock gene pathways were assessed. One-way ANOVA was performed to establish significant changes in LDC fluctuation at each stage of pregnancy and also at the same time-points at different stages of pregnancy (p<0.05).",

We demonstrated a significant increase of hepatic TG biosynthesis pathways on day 7 of pregnancy with a partial 'switch off' of these genes on day 14 of pregnancy and this was consistent with the free fatty acid (FFA) levels in the liver. However, day 14 of pregnancy was characterized by significantly increased levels of FA oxidation and transport pathways in the muscle, especially in the dark phase of the 24-hour cycle. This concurred with increased levels of FFA availability in the dark phase and it synchronized with peak gene expression patterns of the FA transport pathways in placenta and also FFA levels in the fetal liver. Interestingly, our data imply that liver metabolic actions in pregnancy are mediated by the Rev-erb-\u03b1 clock gene, whereas muscle metabolic activity is mediated by Rev-erb-\u03b2. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that maintenance of pregnancy and fetus development are facilitated by a liver to muscle gestational switch between early and late pregnancy. Creatine is an amino acid derivative required for the maintenance of intracellular ATP. Half of the adult daily requirement of creatine is obtained from a diet containing animal products. The rodent fetus relies upon placental transfer of creatine until late in pregnancy. Animal studies show that maternal creatine supplementation improves outcomes for offspring after birth asphyxia. Human placenta produces creatine (ex vivo) at term. However, creatine levels throughout normal human pregnancy are undefined. Therefore, we sought to determine creatine concentrations in maternal plasma and urine across gestation in a population of demographically diverse women, and to relate these to fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study of 284 women, plasma and urine were collected at 13, 18, 30 and 36 weeks gestation. Creatine was measured by enzymatic analysis. Statistical associations between maternal creatine, and change of creatine between 13 and 36 weeks with maternal factors and fetal growth parameters were assessed. RESULTS: Creatine concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than previous reports in non-pregnant women. Maternal creatine concentration was associated with parity, socioeconomic status, and maternal smoking, asthma, and body mass index. Higher maternal urine creatine concentration was negatively associated with birth of a small for gestational age (SGA) baby and positively associated with placental weight. After adjustment for confounders, there was a 17% reduced odds ratio (95% CI 0.72-0.85, p=0.007) of SGA for every 50\u00b5mol/L increase in urinary creatine. For every 50\u00b5mol/L change in urine creatine between 13 and 36 weeks there was an associated 5.2 g increase in placental weight (95% CI 1.26-9.10, p=0.01).",

The possibility that a simple urine test for creatine may identify women at risk of SGA warrants further investigation. The cause of gestational thrombocytopenia is unknown. Potential mechanisms include hemodilution and increased spleen size. We postulated that additional potential physiologic mechanisms may be either platelet pooling (higher platelet counts) or consumption (lower platelet counts) in the maternal intervillous space of the placenta. METHODS: Women ages 18-44, undergoing term, scheduled cesarean delivery without labor were enrolled. The placenta was placed in EDTA solution to prevent coagulation, and five blood samples from the maternal intervillous space were collected. We used a KB test to determine the amount of fetal blood contamination and then performed a CBC on the sample containing the lowest percentage of fetal blood. We used a paired t-test to compare maternal placental platelet count to the maternal peripheral venous platelet count performed on admission. RESULTS: 42 women consented, 2 were excluded due to delivery complications and sample clotting. Median age at delivery was 28; median gestational age was 39 weeks; median fetal blood contamination was 13.5%. Placental platelet counts were corrected for dilution by the EDTA solution using the ratio of peripheral blood hemoglobin to placental blood hemoglobin concentration. Differences between maternal placental and peripheral venous platelet counts were not statistically significant.

Coffee contains biologically active chemicals (e.g. caffeine) and natural phenols with antioxidant properties and potential health benefits such as caffeic (CA) and chlorogenic (CHLA) acid. Pregnant women are encouraged to limit their caffeine consumption during pregnancy, however the effects of CA and CHLA are unclear. Here we investigate the effects of CA and CHLA on myometrial artery function and test the hypothesis that they protect arteries from the effects of oxidative stress. METHODS: Human myometrial arteries (MAs; n=136) were isolated from biopsies collected at the time of elective Caesarean section from women (N=39) with uncomplicated pregnancies and mounted on a wire myograph as described previously (2). MA viability was determined with 120mM potassium solution (KPSS), arginine vasopressin (AVP; 10 -8 M) and bradykinin (10 -6 M). Dose-response curves to CA and CHLA (both 10 -8 -10 -5 M) were constructed to determine direct contractile or relaxatory (in the presence of AVP-induced contraction) effects. Effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ; 10 -4 M) and xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XA/XO; 10 -4 M) were determined in the presence / absence of CA / CHLA (10 -5 M; 15 minute incubation). Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. RESULTS: MA (n=136) diameters were 350\u00b111\u00b5m. MAs showed significant contraction (KPSS / AVP) and relaxation (BK) suggesting fully functioning smooth muscle and endothelial cells post-isolation and mounting. CA and CHLA did not significantly affect basal tone (P\u203a0.05; t-test) or induce relaxation of AVP pre-contracted MAs (P\u203a0.05; RM-ANOVA). Addition of H 2 O 2 and XA/XO produced triphasic responses in AVP-contracted MAs (transient relaxation / re-contraction / sustained relaxation at 15 minutes post-addition). Pre-incubation with CA or CHLA did not significantly alter the triphasic response to ROS application (P\u203a0.05; Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn's post-hoc test). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that short-term application of CA and CHLA does not provide protection to MAs from ROS-induced stimuli. Further studies will focus on chronic incubation of MAs with CA and CHLA. References: Obesity is one of the most powerful drivers for the onset and development several pregnancy complications with short and long term consequences on both the mother and the child. During pregnancy, the placenta releases exosomes into maternal circulation, however, the effect of maternal metabolic status on the exosomal profile across gestation has not been yet established. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from pregnant women at different times of gestation (10-38 weeks) from the Ochsner Baptist Medical Center (New Orleans, USA) and classified according to the body mass index (BMI) in lean (n=13, BMI 18.5-24.9 Kg/m 2 ), overweight (OW, n=13, Kg/m 2 ) and obese (n=15, BMI >30 Kg/m 2 ). Exosomes were isolated from plasma by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. The total number of exosome vesicles (EXO) and specific placenta-derived exosomes (PdE) were determined by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NanoSight\u2122) using quantum dots (Qdot\u2122) coupled with antibodies to CD63 or PLAP. Finally, only fluorescent particles were tracked and the exosomal profile was determined. RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed that EXO increased progressively across gestation from 10 to 38 weeks, and this was independent of the maternal BMI. The slopes of the fitted lines were significantly different (p<0.001) between obese and lean or overweight women (4.7 \u00b1 0.2, 4.3 \u00b1 0.57 and 7.49 \u00b1 0.8 for lean, OW and obese, respectively. Similarity, PdE increase across gestation in lean and overweight women, however, correlation analysis did not show a significant difference in obese women (p=0.083) across gestation. At late gestation (i.e. >30 weeks), EXO was significantly higher in obese women compared to lean and OW (1.94 \u00b1 0.88, 1.37 \u00b1 0.25 and 1.22 \u00b1 0.16 x10 9 vesicles/ml for obese, OW and lean, respectively). Finally, the contribution of PdE to the total exosomal population was significantly higher in obese women between 10-20 weeks compared lean and OW (26 \u00b1 3.7 %, 15 \u00b1 2.5 % and 11 \u00b1 3.4 % for obese, lean and OW, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal BMI was associated with higher levels of total and placenta-derived exosomes in maternal circulation. Placental exosomes may contribute to the proinflammatory state associated with obesity.",

INTRODUCTION: Placenta vascular formation is important for fetal growth and development. Among many factors, sex steroid hormones including estradiol and progesterone play an important role in placental vascularization. However, little is known about the role of androgens. Plasma testosterone levels are elevated in preeclampsia, PCOS mothers and pregnant African-American women, who often have fetal growth restriction. We previously showed that experimental increase in maternal testosterone levels cause fetal growth restriction, culminating eventually in adult onset hypertension that is more pronounced in males than females.",

We injected pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats with vehicle or testosterone propionate (TP; 0.5 mg/Kg/day from gestation day [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] to increase plasma testosterone level twofold, similar to that observed in clinical conditions like preeclampsia. On gestation day 20, we quantified uterine artery blood flow using micro-ultrasound, visualized utero-and feto-placental arterial network using x-ray microcomputed tomography, determined fetoplacental hypoxia using pimonidazole and hypoxiainducible factor 1\u03b1, and used Affymetrix array to determine changes in placental expression of genes involved in vascular development. . Mediation analyses showed that body mass index (BMI) at follow-up explained 50-80% of the observed differences. In 587 women with the placental syndromes 2nd trimester median PlGF was 194.6 pg/mL (90% range 71.2-502.2) and 7.8% had low PLGF. In this smaller group we could not demonstrate statistically significant differences in cardiac measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Low 2nd trimester PLGF is associated with cardiovascular findings 6 years after pregnancy that are known to be associated with cardiovascular diseases in later life. These associations are independent of adverse pregnancy outcomes and are partly explained by current BMI. To compensate for the increased demand for insulin during pregnancy, \u03b2-cell mass expands. This process does not occur properly in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Prior to \u03b2-cell expansion, the pancreas must also undergo vascular remodeling. Interactions between endothelial cells and \u03b2-cells are essential for enhancing insulin expression and supporting \u03b2-cell proliferation. Insufficient vascular remodeling in the pancreas contributes significantly to the development of type II diabetes, but this process has not been studied in the context of GDM. We hypothesized that pancreatic vasculature is reduced in GDM and that this reduction persists, contributing to an increased risk of type II diabetes.",

Briefly, C57Bl/6 mice were placed on either a control diet (CD) or a 45% kcal/fat, 17% kcal/sucrose diet 1 wk prior to and throughout pregnancy (GDM). Mice were either sacrificed at d17.5 or followed long term. After giving birth, dams followed long term, were returned to a normal chow diet until 7 weeks post-partum, and then challenged with a high fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks, at which time a glucose tolerance test was performed and mice were sacrificed. At sacrifice, the pancreas was collected for immunohistochemical analysis for the following markers: glucagon (alpha cells), insulin (beta cells) and CD31 (endothelial cells). RESULTS: At d17.5, \u03b2-cells were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in GDM compared to CD. There was evidence of alpha cell number reduction, though not significant (p=0.054). The number and ratio of CD31+ cells/\u03b2-cells was significantly reduced at D17.5 (p<0.02). In the long term, glucose tolerance was significantly reduced in females that had experienced GDM compared to those that did not. There was no difference in \u03b1 or \u03b2-cell numbers in long term dams. However, there was a significant decrease (p<0.0001) in the ratio of CD31+/\u03b2-cells and some indication of a reduction in the overall number of CD31+ cells (p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic vasculature was reduced in a mouse model of GDM and these vascular changes persisted later in life. Ongoing studies will evaluate remolding of pancreatic vasculature throughout a pregnancy complicated by GDM and its impact on long term maternal health. ",

INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet the causes and mechanisms of preterm labor are poorly understood, and identifying at risk patients remains a challenge. Procalcitonin is an acute phase protein secreted during infection and inflammation that is detectable in the serum of pregnant women, neonates, and umbilical cord blood, but has been infrequently studied in amniotic fluid. We sought to determine if procalcitonin (PCT) levels measured in amniotic fluid samples at the time of genetic amniocentesis are predictive of preterm delivery. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on all women presenting for genetic amniocentesis between 15-23 weeks of pregnancy at our institution from 2011 to 2013 with stored amniotic fluid samples.",

Amniotic fluid was excluded from immunoassay if it was visibly bloody. PCT protein levels were measured in the samples using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was validated for use with amniotic fluid by spike and recovery testing. The primary outcome compared PCT levels in women who delivered less than 37 weeks versus those who delivered at or after 37 weeks. The Mann-Whitney test was used; medians and ranges are shown. RESULTS: Eighty-eight samples were available for analysis and of these 7 (7.95%) were from patients who delivered preterm. Sixty-two (70%) of the amniotic fluid samples tested had PCT levels below the lower limit of quantification, which was 25 pg/mL. Median PCT levels did not differ between the preterm and term group (20.4 pg/mL (range 0 -82.8) and 20.2 pg/mL (range 0 -198.4), respectively, p= 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that procalcitonin can be reliably measured in second trimester amniotic fluid by ELISA down to the picogram level. However, in the asymptomatic women undergoing genetic amniocentesis in this cohort, procalcitonin levels were low to undetectable and did not correlate with risk of subsequent preterm birth. is identifying the driver genes and pathways that distinguish preterm labor from term labor. To date no RNAseq study has been done to examine the preterm myometrium, or compare non-laboring samples between preterm and term myometrium. Firstly, this study aimed to identify differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes in term laboring (TL), term non-laboring (TNL), preterm laboring (PTL) and preterm non-laboring (PTNL) myometrial samples.

The Tophat-Cufflinks-Cuffdiff protocol was used to analyze the data to identify differentially expressed and alternately spliced genes. Genes were considered significant if they achieved an FDR q-value less than 0.05. Crosstalker, a random-walk based method, was used to identify significant subnetworks of genes enriched with candidate differentially expressed genes. A Fisher's exact test was used to test the resulting networks for significant pathway enrichment in the NCI Pathway Interaction Database. RESULTS: 90 genes were differentially expressed between TNL and TIL in our cohort, 52 of which overlap with a previously reported RNAseq study. Five pathways were enriched including validated transcriptional targets of AP1 family members, FOXA1 transcription factor, and IL23 mediated signaling events. 57 genes were differentially expressed and an additional 24 genes were differentially spliced between PTNL and PTIL. Seven pathways including post-translational regulation of adherins junction stability and disassembly, VEGF/VEGFR signaling and IL-2 signaling were identified. 37 genes were differentially expressed between PTNL and TNL. Four pathways were enriched including post-translational regulation of adherins junction stability and disassembly, Syndecan-4 signaling, and VEGF/VEGEFR signaling. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first RNAseq study to identify differentially expressed genes in the PTNL myometrium compared to PTL and TNL myometrium. The pathways and genes implicated in these comparisons, and the 24 alternatively spliced genes in particular, may serve as biomarkers of preterm labor and suggest novel therapeutic targets to prevent PTB. The cervix has an integral role at both spectrums of a successful pregnancy -to remain closed and firm during pregnancy and to soften and dilate to allow passage of the fetus at term. Changes in the mechanical function of the cervix during pregnancy result from alterations in the composition and structure of the cervical extracellular matrix (ECM). Variations in the stromal cell populations could impact ECM function. We hypothesized that the distribution of cell types evolve throughout pregnancy allowing for synthesis of a customized ECM that can fulfill the changing needs during pregnancy. METHODS: Immunofluorescent localization of smooth muscle actin (SMA), vimentin, desmin and heavy chain myosin was used to identify fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and their distribution within the stroma. Transverse cervical sections from wild type mice, both nonpregnant (NP) and pregnant: days 6,12,15,18, and 1 day postpartum were evaluated.

In Cluster 2, differential gene expression of DEPDC5, DYM, and NDST2 were most reliably associated with preterm birth. Preterm infants in cluster 2 displayed altered expression of genes involving RNA splicing and regulation of cellular adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: The two distinct molecular subtypes exhibited differences in individual genes and functional groups in relation to prematurity. MT1E regulates placental transfer of micronutrients and cellular growth, and is implicated in implantation. MT1E expression was most reliably associated with preterm birth in cluster 1. Variable expression of genes involved in immune regulation observed preterm infants from cluster 1 may be reflective of perturbations in the placentas function as an immunological barrier.

Thus, it is likely that deficits in the capacity of the placenta to maintain bioenergetic and metabolic stability during the course of pregnancy could result in preterm birth (PTB). While not the only cause, intrauterine inflammation is regarded as one of the leading causes of PTB. Using our mouse model of PTB in the setting of intrauterine inflammation, we hypothesized that analysis of the metabolic profile of the placenta could reveal pathway alterations that result in the placental dysfunction seen in PTB METHODS: Timed-pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of lipopolysaccharide (50 \u00b5g/dam, LPS, n=8) or saline (n=8) on E15 of gestation. Placentas were collected six hours post-injection, frozen, and sent to Metabolon for analysis. The dataset comprised a total of 547 compounds of known identity. Data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVAs corrected for multiple testing. RESULTS: LPS-placentas (LPS-P) had significantly lower levels of metabolites involved in glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and glycogen synthesis/degradation pathways. Significant increases were observed in several long-chain acylcarnitines. Acylcarnitines are responsible for transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria; increased levels suggest increased \u00df-oxidation, an alternative source of energy in the setting of decreased carbohydrate metabolites. This is supported by the increased levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate. Carbon flow through the TCA cycle was diminished in LPS-P supporting mitochodrial dysfunction as a link to PTB. LPS-P also exhibited decreases in adenosine and guanidine nucleotides and pyrimidine catabolites, consistent with alterations in DNA/RNA turnover which may be associated with altered energy homeostasis as certain nucleotides play important roles in energy metabolism. Finally, levels of 11-dehydrocorticosterone and corticosterone were significantly increased in the LPS-P. CONCLUSIONS: LPS-P exhibited significant alterations in the availability and utilization of several energy sources. Thus, localized inflammation appears to have major impacts on the transfer and utilization of metabolites in the placenta resulting in placental dysfunction that may lead to PTB.

Tensile properties were measured after subjecting samples to a protocol consisting of a single ramp to failure at 1mm/minute.

This work lays a foundation for investigating cervical biomechanics and the role of the cervix in PTB. ( Many physiological and behavioral processes show daily rhythms that are generated endogenously and are synchronized to environmental stimuli. Chronotype defines the stable phase relationship between a biological rhythm (e.g., wake-sleep) and an environmental rhythm (e.g., dawn-dusk). Chronodisruption results when biological rhythms are not stably synchronized to daily environmental cues (e.g., jetlag or shift-work). Although studies have shown that genetic and environmental disruptions of circadian rhythms are associated with increased risk for infertility, miscarriage, and preterm birth, little is known about normal changes in chronotype during pregnancy.

A significant correlation (P=0.02,Fisher's exact) was found between L.iners dominance and/or dysbiosis and subsequent PPROM compared to controls delivering at term. Membrane rupture prior to treatment with Erythromycin (Ery)(n=17) was associated with L.iners dominance 47% and increased dysbiosis 35%. Ery treatment was associated with a significant shift toward dysbiosis (P=0.0095,78%,18/23) *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of L.crispatus and dominance of L.iners are prominent features of the vaginal microbiome prior to PPROM. This suggests a protective role for L.crispatus and the potential of microbiome modulation to reduce infection mediated PPROM. Association of Ery treatment with increased prevalence of dysbiosis and the emergence of bacteria implicated in neonatal and maternal sepsis indicates Ery is a suboptimal antibiotic for the treatment of PPROM. (SPTB) is a major factor associating with deaths and with lowered quality of life. According to family studies, SPTB has a significant genetic background. Genetic factors from both the mother and fetus likely play a role. However, little is known about the actual predisposing genes. The objective of the study was to discover genetic variants predisposing to SPTB using a genomewide association study (GWAS).",

Only individuals of Finnish origin were included. DNA samples were genotyped with the Illumina HumanCoreExome BeadChip consisting of approximately 550,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The analyses were performed with PLINK, v. 1.09. In addition to the study of SPTB as a dichotomous trait, GA was studied as a quantitative trait. After quality control, 230 case and 378 control mothers, and 247 case and 419 control infants remained for GWAS. RESULTS: We detected potential association signals for several SNPs in GWAS. Many of these SNPs were located in the vicinity of plausible candidate genes. In GWAS of SPTB, these included e.g. the IGSF21 and COL23A1 genes encoding immunoglobin superfamily, member 21, and collagen, type XXIII, alpha 1, respectively, in the mothers; and the DLC1 gene encoding DLC1 Rho GTPase activating protein in the infants. SNPs within the uncharacterized locus LOC105377819 and those near the GLI3 gene encoding GLI family zinc finger 3 showed the best signals for gestational age in term infants. Next, we will analyze the most promising SNPs in a large Finnish population-based cohort and in a replication population from Finland to assess which associations are replicated. CONCLUSIONS: We detected several suggestive associations in GWAS of spontaneous preterm birth. To verify these results, we will analyze the most promising SNPs in additional populations. Furthermore, the role of the arising candidate genes in the onset of preterm delivery will be assessed in functional studies.",

Hence timing of the cesarean delivery may be important in terms of the fetal health. In our study we aimed to evaluate whether neonatal cord blood concentrations of cortisol, free triiodothyronin (fT3), free tetraiodothyronin (fT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) relate to the onset of labor or labor pain in patients with history of previous cesarean section and also we evaluated maternal morbidity. METHODS: This prospective controlled study comprised 219 patients, divided into two groups according to the presence of labor and related labor pain before cesarean section. All patients in both groups were applied cesarean section >38 weeks gestational age due to previous cesarean section. The cord blood pH, fT3, fT4, TSH, cortisol and neonatal Apgar scores were compared. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in age, gestational week, gravida and number of previous cesarean deliveries between groups (p>0.05). A comparison of the groups for cord blood fT3, fT4, TSH levels revealed no significant differences (p>0.05). However, fetal cord blood pH, cortisol levels were found to be higher than that of the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The onset of labor and related labor pain in cesarean delivery provide high cord ph and cortisol values it means pain induces stress related cortisol and these condition can provide fetal lung clerance fastly and lower respiratory problems. There is an urgent need for sensitive and specific biomarkers to predict risk of PTB.

(hCG) has been implicated in the maintenance of uterine quiescence by down-regulating myometrial gap junctions during pregnancy, and it was suggested as a strategy to prevent preterm birth after the occurrence of preterm labor. We have previously demonstrated that hCG has anti-inflammatory effects at the maternal-fetal interface during late pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of hCG would prevent endotoxin-induced preterm birth (PTB) and improve perinatal outcomes. METHODS: In B6 mice, hCG was administered on 13, 15, and 17 days post coitum (dpc) while endotoxin was administered on 16.5 dpc (n=11). Controls included pregnant mice injected with PBS (n=10), hCG (n=6), or endotoxin (n=10) alone. Mice were then placed for video recording to determine the rate of PTB. Prior to term parturition (18.5 dpc), Doppler Ultrasound was used to measure fetal heart rate and umbilical artery pulsatility index in fetuses from dams injected with PBS or hCG alone (n=4 each). Comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney U tests and T tests. RESULTS: 1) Pretreatment with hCG reduced the rate of endotoxininduced PTB when compared to mice injected with endotoxin alone [hCG 36\u00b128.37% (4/11) vs endotoxin 80\u00b124.79% (8/10); p=0.04]; 2) administration of hCG alone caused high rates of dystocia when compared to PBS controls [hCG 100% (10/10) vs. PBS 0% (0/10)]; 3) on 22.5 dpc, fetuses from mice injected with hCG alone that underwent dystocia appeared hypoxic and non-viable; and 4) on 19.5 dpc, fetuses from mice injected with hCG alone had increased heart rates (p=0.001) and decreased umbilical artery pulsatilty indexes (p=0.001) when compared to those from PBS controls. CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment with hCG reduced the rate of endotoxininduced PTB, yet caused dystocia and fetal compromise. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety of hCG administration in the prevention of preterm labor.",

Our objective was to assess whether maternal cytokine levels during the second (Tri2) and third (Tri3) trimester are associated with neonate cord blood cytokine levels. METHODS: 100 healthy pregnant women were recruited as part of a study on stress and inflammation. Maternal blood samples were collected at Tri2 and Tri3, and vein cord blood samples taken at delivery. Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6 and anti-inflammatory IL10 and IL13 were assessed using electrochemiluminescence. Inflammation regulation was modeled by calculating the balance of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokine expression, specifically IL6:IL10 ratio. Correlation analyses were run between maternal peripheral Tri2 and Tri3 cytokine levels and neonate cord blood cytokine levels. RESULTS: Mothers were 31 +/-5.4 years old at entry, and 50% White and 27% Black. At Tri2 and Tri3, higher maternal anti-inflammatory cytokine levels were associated with anti-inflammatory phenotype in cord blood: Maternal IL13 was positively associated with cord IL13 (r's > .87), and negatively with IL6:IL10, (r's < -.37). Maternal IL10 was positively associated with cord IL13, (r's > .40), and IL6, (r's > .39). At both Tri2 and Tri3, tighter maternal regulatory control of IL6 by IL10 was associated with anti-inflammatory phenotype in cord blood: Maternal IL6:IL10 was negatively associated with cord IL13, r's < -.33. Only Tri3 maternal proinflammatory IL6 was associated with greater cord IL6, r = .35.

The University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. INTRODUCTION: MicroRNAs (miRNA) play key roles in the regulation of gene expression. Many miRNAs have been measured and identified in biological fluids as potential biomarkers or predictors of disease. The aim of this study was to determine the miRNA profile of 2 nd trimester amniotic fluid (AF) samples and compare signatures in samples from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (PTB), preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes (PPROM), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preeclampsia (PE) with normal control samples (CON). METHODS: AF samples were selected from 517 amniocentesis samples taken at 15-22 weeks' gestation (n=40 samples total). After extraction and reverse transcription, quantitative expression of 752 human miRNAs (plus controls) was performed using Exiqon miRCURY LNA TM Panel I and II 384-well PCR plates on a QuantStudio Real-Time PCR System. Amplification plots from each plate were individually inspected to exclude artefacts and false positives. Ct values were then derived, tabulated and filtered to exclude rarely-detected miRNAs. Due to overlapping clinical criteria, two composite groups (PTB-PPROM, n=8 and PE-IUGR, n=22) were compiled for statistical comparison with CON samples (n=10). RESULTS: Of the 752 miRNAs investigated, 389 were detectable in more than one sample, while 34 miRNAs were detected in \u226550% of samples. The most abundant of these were: miR-218-2-3p, miR-302e, miR-376a-5p and miR-587. Levels of miR-1471 (function/targets unknown) were significantly elevated in the PE-IUGR group (p=0.025, ANOVA). In the PTB-PPROM group, abundance of two miRNAs involved in regulating expression of inflammation-associated genes were significantly altered vs. CON: miR-206 (decreased, p=0.017) and miR-324-3p (increased, p=0.005).

The enzyme GSNO Reductase (GSNOR) regulates GSNO levels. We hypothesize that the overexpression of GSNOR in preterm laboring myometrium may contribute to the preterm contractile phenotype and that inhibiting GSNOR may promote relaxation in the myometrium by increasing the available NO. The drug N6022 is potent and selective inhibitor of GSNOR with an IC 50 of 8 nM and is in clinical trial as an airway smooth muscle relaxant. An exploration of NO availability in the myometrium might provide insight into the regulation of muscle contraction and the initiation of labor preterm. METHODS: GSNOR protein expression is compared in preterm/fullterm laboring human myometrium as well as in guinea pig myometrium (15-72d) at various stages of pregnancy and parturition using western blot analysis. GSNOR enzyme activity assay conducted using an oxygenpurged total protein lysate in the presence of NADH (GSNOR co-factor) and GSNO. N6022 effectiveness is tested using myometrial tissue strips connected to a force transducer in an organ bath. The force/frequency of contractions are monitored before and after application of N6022. RESULTS: GSNOR is overexpressed in preterm laboring myometrium as compared to full term myometrium. GSNOR activity is increased in preterm laboring myometrium as compared to full term. Preliminary data suggests that N6022 may serve as a novel tocolytic by decreasing the peak force of contraction in laboring myometrium. CONCLUSIONS: Nitric oxide is a potent smooth muscle relaxant. The overexpression of GSNOR in preterm laboring myometrium is hypothesized to decrease the availability of NO by eliminating GSNO from the cytosol and may explain the dysfunctional relaxation seen to exogenous NO. N6022 increases available GSNO by selectivity inhibiting GSNOR and this may promote relaxation in preterm laboring myometrial tissue that overexpresses GSNOR.",

LSU Health Sciences Center -Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Chymase, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease, is an ACE-independent angiotensin II (Ang II) generating enzyme. Chymase expression is increased in maternal vessel endothelium in women with preeclampsia (PE). Therefore, chymase activation could contribute to increased vasoconstriction and maternal hypertension in PE. However, how chymase became activated in PE is not known. Cathepsin C (CC) is a central coordinator for activation of many serine proteases including chymase. In the present study, we aimed to investigate if vascular CC expression is increased in PE and whether CC could induce chymase expression and stimulate Ang II generation in endothelial cells (EC). METHODS: Subcutaneous fat tissue (scfat) was obtained by cesarean section delivery from pregnant women (6 normal and 6 PE). Vessel CC and ACE expression was examined by immunostaining of scfat tissue sections. ECs were isolated from umbilical cord vein of normal term placentas. Confluent ECs were treated with different doses of CC (0, 1, 5, 20, and 100pg/ml) or CC 100pg/ml with or without ACE inhibitor captopril or chymase inhibitor chymostatin separately or in combination. Effects of CC on EC chymase activation were determined by chymase expression and Ang II production measured in cell culture medium. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE and analyzed by ANOVA. A p level < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Positive CC expression was detected in vessel endothelium in 4 out of 6 subjects in the PE group. Vessel endothelial CC expression was not detected in samples from normal pregnancies. ACE expression was undetectable in vessel endothelium in both normal and PE groups. Chymase expression was dose-dependently increased in EC treated with CC. EC Ang II production was significantly reduced when either captopril (captopril + CC+Ang I) or chymostatin (chymostatin+CC+Ang I) present in the culture compared to those without (CC+Ang I), p<0.001. EC Ang II production was further significantly reduced when cells were treated with both captopril and chymostatin (chymostatin+captopril+CC+Ang I) compared to those treated with either captopril or chymostatin alone, p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CC expression could promote chymase activation in maternal vessel endothelium in PE, which subsequently stimulate EC Ang II generation. CC activation may contribute to increased vasoconstriction through activation of chymase-Ang II regulatory pathway in PE (supported in part by NIH grant R21HD076289).",

Natalie J Hannan, Sally Beard, Natalie K Binder, Tu'uhevaha J Kaitu'u-Lino, Stephen Tong. University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, proteinuria and end-organ damage. Aspirin, an antiplatelet agent, is used to prevent preterm preeclampsia but its efficacy appears modest. Newer antiplatelet therapies such as Clopidogrel, Prasugrel and Ticagrelor are now available, used clinically to prevent heart attacks and stroke. Key pathophysiological steps in preeclampsia are 1) increased oxidative stress, 2) elevated placental secretion of sFlt1 and soluble endoglin (sEng) and 3) endothelial dysfunction. We set out to functionally examine whether aspirin or the new generation antiplatelet agents can counter the pathophysiology in preeclampsia. METHODS: Isolated primary trophoblast and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and placental explants were treated with Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel or Ticagrelor (0-100\u00b5M). Endothelial dysfunction was modelled in vitro where HUVECs and uterine microvascular cells (UtMVs) were treated with TNF\u03b1 (10\u00b5g/mL), then subsequently treated with Aspirin or Clopidogrel. Media and cell lysates were collected to assess 1) the Nrf2/antioxidant response element signaling pathway (nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and expression of HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC), 2) anti-angiogenic factors (sFlt1 and sEng) and 3) markers of endothelial dysfunction (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1)). RESULTS: Clopidogrel induced nuclear Nrf2 translocation and increased expression of antioxidant genes: HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC. In contrast, aspirin did not affect Nrf2 nuclear translocation and did not alter antioxidant gene expression. Clopidogrel, Prasugrel and Ticagrelor induced a potent reduction in sFlt1 secretion from placental and endothelial cells; and reduced sEng secretion from HUVECs. In contrast, aspirin did not affect sFlt1 or sEng secretion. Clopidogrel rescued endothelial dysfunction, mitigating TNF\u03b1 induced VCAM1 and ET-1 mRNA and protein production/secretion. In contrast, aspirin did not affect VCAM1 or ET-1 expression by endothelial cells.",

Given they are classified as category B/C drugs, they represent exciting candidate drugs to prevent or treat preeclampsia. Many studies have attempted to link circulating GF and Cyt with PE diagnosis with limited success. We have previously shown using ATPstimulated sustained Ca2+ signaling as an assay for proper endothelial cell function, that TNFa or VEGF mediated Src kinase signaling can induce endothelial dysfunction at doses which are commonly reported in preeclampsia, while VEGF stimulated greater function at doses in the normal range. We therefore hypothesize that any GF or Cyt which activates Src kinase will induce endothelial dysfunction at pathophysiological doses but will stimulate function in the normal range. In this study, we screen a panel of GF and Cyt at a variety of doses in vitro for their effect on endothelial cell function. This will assess whether GF and Cyt effect on endothelial cell function is a global phenomenon, which might explain why correlation of any single factor may be difficult. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown on 96 well plates to >90% confluence. HUVEC were loaded with Fura-2 AM dye (for Ca2+) and treated with bFGF, EGF, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100ng/ml for 30 or 60 min. For Ca2+ measures, cells were subsequently treated with 100uM ATP for 30 min and monitored for any inhibition vs ATP control. RESULTS: Statistical analysis by Student's T test revealed the following doses resulted in significant stimulations from ATP control (P<0.05), in ng/ml: EGF, 0.1, 0.3; IL-1b, 0.3, 1, 3; IL-6, 0.1; IL-8, 0.1. The following doses resulted in significant inhibition from ATP control (P<0.05), in ng/ ml: bFGF, 0.3, 100; EGF, 1, 30; IL-1b, 30; IL-8, 10. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some variation, in general GF and Cyt promote increased endothelial function at doses in the normal physiologic range and inhibit endothelial function as they move into the pathophysiologic range and beyond. This supports the idea that it is unlikely that any single Src coupled factor is responsible for the endothelial dysfunction associated with preeclampsia. It is more likely that appropriate amounts of these factors are essential for healthy pregnancy but any deviation from normal levels could have profound effects on endothelial function.

This inhibition is associated with decreased sustained phase Ca\u00b2 + bursting in endothelial cells leading to decreased production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with a known Src inhibitor, PP2, showed rescue of Ca\u00b2 + bursting in response to ATP in cells exposed to VEGF, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and bFGF. In this study, using the HUVEC model, we examine sustained calcium bursting response in cells pre-treated with conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isoforms 9, 11 (control) and 10,12 (known Src inhibitor) prior to GF and Cyt exposure. METHODS: HUVEC from normal pregnancies were grown to >90% confluence on 35 mm glass dishes and then loaded with Fura-2 for Ca\u00b2 + imaging. Control Ca\u00b2 + sustained-phase bursting with 100 uM ATP alone (30 min.) was followed by a wash prior to pretreatment with 50 uM 9, 11 or 10, 12 CLA. GF/cytokine (VEGF, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, bFGF, EGF, IL-6, IL-8, and INF\u0264) 10ng/ml treatment was then applied (30-60 min.) and cells were re-stimulated with ATP. Ca\u00b2 + burst numbers were then compared to internal control results. RESULTS: Pretreatment with 50 uM 10, 12 CLA showed significant recovery (p<0.05) in sustained-phase Ca\u00b2 + bursting in HUVEC cells exposed to VEGF, bFGF, and TNF\u03b1 (recover of 82 to 88% of control). Significant recovery was not noted with the 9, 11 CLA isoform, which is not known to be a Src inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Preclamptic effects on endothelial cell function can be mimicked by the addition of GF/cyt found to be elevated in preeclamptic patients. 10, 12 CLA, will partially improve these inhibitory effects with near global recovery for a wide range of GF and Cyt; and in the case of TNF even better than recovery with PP2.

Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, the cause is believed to be hyperglycemia. Nitric oxide (NO) is the principle regulator of vascular tone in the placenta. The synthesis of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) can be activated by phosphorylation. The eNOS serine 1176 residue shows reduced phosphorylation in non-pregnant diabetics. This study evaluated the effects of hyperglycemia on vascular reactivity to thromboxane resulting from altered eNOS activation, indicated by lower phosphorylation at serine 1176. METHODS: We collected cotyledons from placentas of normal term patients at caesarian section. Two cotyledons from each placenta were isolated and perfused in parallel. The intervillous circulation was perfused in the control with a glucose concentration of 100mg/dl (normal glycemic) and the treatment was perfused at a glucose concentration of 300mg/ dl (hyperglycemic), and then constricted with thromboxane. After 30 minutes, tissues were collected for analysis of eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1176. RESULTS: Staining's for phosphorylated eNOS showed a lower intensity with exposure to maternal hyperglycemia *Figure(s) will be available online.",

University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is associated with preeclampsia and IUGR. CMV increases sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) expression. Both SK1 and SK2 produce the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P, exported from cells by ABC-type transporters, signalsthrough S1P2/S1P3 receptors to induce vasoconstriction. We have shown that thromboxane-A2 (TXA2), a vasoconstrictor, signals through the S1P pathway. However, the effects of CMV infection on this signalling pathway are unknown. We hypothesize that TXA2-mediated constriction through the S1P pathway will be increased in arteries from CMV-infected mice. METHODS: Uterine arteries isolated from uninfected and CMV-infected female S1P3-/-or S1P2-/-mice and their wildtype (WT) controls were mounted on a pressure myograph. Constriction was assessed to increasing concentrations of the TXA2 mimetic U46619 (0.1-20nM) added to the bath followed by studies of 20nM U46619 with or without inhibitors to SK1 (1\u00b5M SK-II), SK2 (10\u00b5M ABC294640), ABC transporters (1\u00b5M FTC, 10\u00b5M MK571), S1P1/S1P3(1\u00b5M VPC23019), S1P2 (10\u00b5M JTE013), or Rho kinase (10\u00b5M Y27632). RESULTS: Constriction of arteries from CMV-infected compared to uninfected WT mice was significantly increased after cumulative addition of U46619. However, addition of 20 nM U46619 by itself to arteries from uninfected and infected mice induced similar levels of constriction (70.1\u00b12.2%; 69.7\u00b13.4%) that was significantly but differentially reduced in response to infection, except where indicated, by SK-II (20.2\u00b19.2%; 63.3\u00b11.2%-NS), ABC294640 (1.5\u00b11.3%; 28.4\u00b16.4%); FTC (47.9\u00b18.8%; 45.6\u00b15.6%), MK571 (6.1\u00b15.2%; 47.8\u00b16.1%), JTE013 (13.3\u00b15.9%; 24.7\u00b17.7%), VPC23019 (12.7\u00b15.0%; 49.0\u00b14.0%) or Y27632 (70.7\u00b17.3%-NS; 32.3\u00b19.5%), respectively. U46619-induced constriction was significantly reduced in arteries from uninfected S1P3-/-, but not S1P2-/-mice, suggesting the dependence on S1P3. In contrast, constriction in arteries from infected S1P3-/-mice was not affected. Thus infection reduces the dependence of the TXA2 response on S1P signalling. CONCLUSIONS: Signalling by TXA2 through the S1P pathway to induce constriction in uterine arteries is dampened during CMV infection with an increased dependence on the Rho kinase pathway. Understanding alternative downstream signalling by TXA2 in the presence and absence of infection is essential for choosing appropriate therapies for treatment where TXA2 is known to be elevated.",

CHU Sainte-Justine -Research Center, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is a syndrome specific to pregnancy. It is one of the leading cause of materno-fetal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Placenta is thought to play a role in its physiopathology as its only cure is delivery. Classically, PE occurs during pregnancy. By an unexplained mechanism, it can also develop in the postpartum period after placenta expulsion. Inflammation is known to be involved in PE but the actual changes in the maternal immune system during normal pregnancy as well as pregnancies complicated with PE are still incompletely understood. We sought to determine the immune profile of women with normal term pregnancies, pregnancies complicated with PE (PrePE) as well as the profile at birth of women that later developed PE (PostPE). METHODS: Women were recruited prospectively at the Sainte-Justine Hospital (N=50) with either uncomplicated pregnancies with term delivery (Ctrl, N=20), pregnancies complicated with PE (PrePE, N=15) or normal pregnancies with postpartum occurrence of PE (PostPE, N=15). Blood samples were collected prior and 24h after delivery in all patients as well as at the time of diagnosis (for PostPE). RESULTS: Delivery was associated with changes in the maternal circulating immune system with elevated total leukocytes and neutrophils numbers with a decreased proportion of lymphocytes and monocytes in Ctrl pregnancies. However, in pregnancies complicated with PE (PrePE), leukocytes and neutrophils count were elevated prior to birth as compared to Ctrl and did not change after delivery. However lymphocytes, which were similar to Ctrl levels prior to birth, were significantly elevated after delivery. In cases with PostPE, leukocytes and neutrophils count were the same as Ctrl prior to birth but contrary to Ctrl pregnancies, they did not raised following delivery and were significantly lower when the diagnosis of PostPE occurred. Furthermore, in the PostPE group, the proportion of lymphocytes was significantly elevated when the pathology was diagnosed.",

William H Nugent, Maria E Teves, Sonya L Washington, Jerome F Strauss III, Scott W Walsh. Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Neutrophils express PAR-1, but only during pregnancy. In preeclampsia, elevated levels of PAR-1 activating proteases could lead to a pregnancy-specific inflammatory response. A mechanism linking PAR-1 to inflammatory signaling could be through the recently discovered TET proteins that increase gene expression by enzymatic de-methylation of DNA. We tested the hypothesis that proteases activate neutrophil PAR-1, which activates RhoA kinase (ROCK) to trigger translocation of TET2 and NF-kB into the nucleus to increase expression of inflammatory genes. METHODS: Neutrophils were isolated from normal pregnant women and treated for 2 h with: 1) control media; 2) neutrophil elastase (0.033U/ml); 3) activated matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1, 5 ng/ml, a concentration present in preeclamptic women). Inhibitory treatments were added before protease activating treatments: 1) specific PAR-1 inhibitor (1 \u00b5M, SCH-79797); 2) specific ROCK inhibitor (10 \u00b5M Y-27632). Nuclear translocations of TET2 and NF-kB were evaluated using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (n=10). RESULTS: TET2 and NF-kB were localized to the cytosol in control cells. Protease treatments stimulated translocation of TET2 and NF-kB from the cytosol to the nucleus as well as significant increases in IL-8, an NF-kB regulated gene (P<0.001). When cells were pretreated with inhibitors, nuclear translocation and IL-8 increases were prevented. TET2 was localized to the nucleus in untreated neutrophils isolated from preeclamptic women. Treatment with PAR-1 inhibitor emptied the nucleus of TET2 restoring a normal state, even in the presence of protease stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Proteases that are elevated in preeclampsia activate PAR-1 on neutrophils obtained from normal pregnant women causing translocation of TET2 and NF-kB from the cytosol to the nucleus, which may epigenetically produce an inflammatory response. We speculate that inhibition of PAR-1 may be an effective treatment for reducing inflammation associated with preeclampsia. NIH HL069851 INTRODUCTION: Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy related endothelial disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. The postpartum persistent deterioration of endothelial function in women with a history of PE implies that changes in the maternal endothelium may be more than transient.

Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 is a nuclear regulator which known to regulate glucose and lipid metabolism especially in terms of glucose utilization and lipogenesis through heterodimer formation with the retinoid X receptor a (RXRa). Therefore, we hypothesize that glucose and lipid metabolism is compromised in FGR fetus due to PPAR\u03b3 dysfunction. METHODS: 24 term pregnancy placentas were collected from FGR (n=12) and normal (n=12) pregnancies in the department of Obstetrics, the first affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University, and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored in -80. The expression levels of mRNA and protein were determined by qPCR and immunoblotting respectively. The immunofluorescence staining of PPAR\u03b3 was performed on the frozen-sections of placental tissue. RESULTS: Both immunofluorescence staining and qPCR confirmed PPAR\u03b3 expression in placenta tissues but there were no difference in PPAR\u03b3 mRNA levels between FGR and normal placenta (p=0.91, n=6). Expression of total PPAR\u03b3 was also similar in FGR and normal placentas, as was expression of AMPK, ACC, PI3K and AKT. However, a significant reduction in phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 (p=0.002, n=6), AMPK (p<0.0001, n=6), ACC (p=0.004, n=6), PI3K (p=0.004, n=4) and AKT (p=0.0007, n=6) was found in FGR compared to normal placenta. In addition, the expression of membrane-bond GLUT4 protein was lower in FGR placentas (p=0.007, n=6), while the total GLUT4 protein expression level was increased in FGR placenta (p=0.04, n=6). CONCLUSIONS: Down-regulation of PPAR\u03b3 activity and its related metabolic signaling pathways is associated with FGR; this indicates that FGR placentas undergo disturbed glucose uptake and lipogenesis.

The difference between observed and expected based on duration of pregnancy crown-rump length was expressed as percentiles for gestational age. The late fetal growth was defined as difference between birth weight and early fetal growth percentiles. The relationship between early fetal growth and environmental exposures: maternal BMI in early pregnancy, diabetes, smoking, age and use of folic acid were evaluated using linear regression. RESULTS: BMI was inversely proportional to the percentile of early fetal growth. Each unit of BMI was associated with 0.7 percentile decrease in early fetal size (coefficient [95% CI] -0.007 [-0.011, -0.004], p<0.0001). Obese women (BMI>30 kg/m 2 ) had mean fetal size 7 percentiles lower than other women (coefficient [95% CI] -0.07 [-0.13, -0.02], p=0.006). Conversely, BMI was positively associated with late fetal growth. Obese women had a mean increase in fetal size between 1 st trimester and birth 14 percentiles higher than other women (coefficient [95% CI] 0.14 [0.07, 0.21], p<0.0001). There was no significant association between early fetal size and other environmental exposures affecting mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: Woman's weight and especially obesity in early pregnancy is associated with detrimental effect on early fetal growth. The later fetal growth until birth is increased in obese women resulting in larger birth weights. These findings show that negative effect of obesity on pregnancy outcome is already established at the onset of pregnancy and provide strong rationale for weight control before conception. The decidua is the major source of IGFBP-1 in the maternal circulation; however the role of decidual IGFBP-1 phosphorylation, in IUGR is unknown. IGFBP-1 phosphorylation markedly reduces IGF-bioavailability. Maternal IGF-I regulates placental function and alterations in IGF-I/IGFBP-1 phosphorylation may contribute to IUGR.

Beth Allison, 1 Chloe Bourguignon, 1 Stuart Hooper, 1,2 Valerie Zahra, 1 Graham Jenkin, 1,2 Atul Malhotra, 1,3 Martin Kluckow, 4 Andy Gill, 5 Foula Sozo, 6 Suzie Miller, 1,2 Graeme Polglase. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm birth are frequent co-morbidities and, combined, increase the risk of respiratory outcomes. Mechanisms increasing respiratory morbidity in IUGR infants compared to appropriately grown (AG) infants are not known, but likely include altered lung development, inflammation and increased respiratory requirements. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IUGR alters fetal lung development and have increased ventilator requirements after birth. METHODS: IUGR was surgically induced in fetal sheep at either 88d (early-onset) or 105d (late-onset) gestation by single umbilical artery ligation. At 127d gestation, fetuses were euthanized at delivery, or lambs ventilated (volume guarantee mode) for 24 hours. Ventilator requirements, lung inflammation, early markers of lung injury, lung morphological, vascular structure and surfactant composition were analyzed. RESULTS: Both early-and late onset fetuses were assymetrically growth restricted and hypoxic at birth. Both early-and late-onset fetuses showed no upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine, injury marker expression, surfactant, lung parenchymal or vascular structure compared to AG fetuses. Early-onset lambs required higher oxygen and peak inflation pressure after 24h ventilation, despite comparable surfactant properties, lung structure and inflammatory response when assessed at post mortem following completion of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of histological pulmonary structural changes, early-onset IUGR increased ventilator requirements. This study suggests that duration of exposure to in utero insult may affect the ability of an IUGR infant to transition to ex utero life. *Figure(s) will be available online.",

The University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA. INTRODUCTION: Evidence shows that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) increases the risk for insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes in adulthood. This association indicates that skeletal muscle responsiveness to insulin decreases in individuals with IUGR. The aim of this study was to show decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle strips from IUGR lambs. METHODS: Placental insufficiency-induced IUGR was created by exposing pregnant ewes to high ambient temperatures during mid gestation. IUGR lambs (n=4) were compared to controls (n=4). At 33\u00b15 days, the semitendinosus muscle was collected and strips of fibers were isolated for glucose uptake analysis. Briefly, semitendinosus strips (30-50 mg) were dissected, mounted in Plexiglas clamps, and pre-incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C in oxygenated KHB with 0.1% BSA, 5 mM of glucose, and 32 mM mannitol. Treatment conditions were 0, >10 \u00b5U/ml insulin (HumalinR), and >10 \u00b5U/ml insulin plus 20 mM cytochalasin B (n=6/ condition/lamb).Then, strips were incubated for an additional 30 minutes with 2-deoxy-D-[ 3 H] glucose in the same conditions. Fold change was determined relative to insulin plus cytochalasin B. RESULTS: IUGR lambs were lighter at birth than control lambs (2.0\u00b10.4 kg vs. 4.2\u00b10.4 kg; P<0.05) and remained smaller at ~33 days (7.2\u00b11.1 kg vs. 14.3\u00b11.1 kg; P<0.01). The rate of glucose uptake with no insulin was not different between control and IUGR muscle strips. Insulin stimulated (P<0.05) glucose uptake in muscle strips independent of treatment group. Strikingly, the rate of glucose uptake with high insulin was lower (P<0.05) in IUGR lambs compared to control lambs (1.30 vs. 1.60 \u00b1 0.05 fold change, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was reduced in IUGR semitendinosus muscle strips. These data demonstrate that skeletal muscle becomes insulin resistant by one month in IUGR lambs, which has been suggested to initiate the onset of Type 2 Diabetes. Further investigation into the intracellular signaling pathway of insulin is needed to define the mechanisms that lower glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle of IUGR lambs. However, this is difficult to prove in humans as ex-preterm adults have likely been exposed to synthetic glucocorticoids during the perinatal period. Here, we isolated the long-term effects of AGT used in humans on cardiovascular function at adulthood in sheep not born preterm. METHODS: At 0.8 of gestation, pregnant ewes carrying singletons were treated with steroids (2 x 12mg dexamethasone i.m. 24h apart, D; n=7) while the other received saline vehicle i.m. (C; n=10). After natural delivery, offspring were maintained until 9 months, and then chronically instrumented with vascular catheters and a femoral flow probe to assess in vivo cardiovascular physiology followed by ex vivo cardiac (Langendorff) and vascular (wire myography) function analysis. RESULTS: Both C and D ewes delivered at term (148\u00b13 vs. 148\u00b12 d).",

We have used a mouse model of flu infection to understand the enhanced morbidity/ mortality observed in young and aged human populations infected with flu. Preliminary data suggests enhanced susceptibility in neonates as compared to adults and possible sex-related differences. Due to the importance of the lung epithelium in the immune response to flu, we examined the gene expression profile of lung epithelial cells from neonatal, adult and aged male and female mice. METHODS: Lungs from C57BL/6 2-(8 pools, 4 male 4 female), 12-(4 male 4 female), and 76-(4 male 4 female) week old mice were used to generate lung epithelial cell suspensions. RNA was examined using the Affymetrix Mouse gene 2.0 st array. Multivariate Principal Component Analysis was done with Partek Genomics\u00ae Suite 6.6 to explore sample group variation. A binary filter (FDR of 0.05, two-fold change) and ANOVA was used to delineate significant differences in transcript presence. Pathway analysis was performed with NIH David. Relative expression of genes of interest was confirmed with qtPCR. RESULTS: Overall age accounted for more variability than sex, with Pups differing more from Adults or Aged mice than these groups differed from each other. Sex differences were stronger in Pups and Aged than in Adults. Sex-by-age interactions were more pronounced in Adult and Aged mice and focused on pathways involved with extracellular matrix interactions. Genes differing between males and females across age groups included development and inflammatory response-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression in lung epithelial cells differs relative to developmental milieu and aging and may reflect sex-inherent differences. Ongoing work relates inflammation and infection to these differences. Supported by NIH P20 RR021905-01 and the University of Vermont.",

Previously we showed that adult skeletal muscle force reduced by postweaning (POST) high fat (HF) diet is modified by prior prenatal (PRE) HF diet. Here we related muscle contraction to vitamin D status and insulin-mediated glucose uptake markers. METHODS: C57 mice were fed HF (45% kcal fat) or control (C, 7% kcal fat) diet in PRE (6 wk preconception to weaning) and/or POST periods (HF/HF, HF/C, C/HF, C/C, n=7-8/group Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) reduces prenatal muscle growth and is associated with postnatal limitations in skeletal muscle growth and function. In IUGR fetuses, myoblast proliferation rates and myofiber size were decreased in semitendinosus muscle, but these defects have not been defined postnatally. Thus, the objective was to determine if IUGR lambs grow slower and have deficiencies in satellite cell proliferation and myofiber size. Endometriosis is a common disease in women of reproductive age, causing pelvic pain and reduced fertility. With a suggested prevalence of 5-10% it is estimated that 176M women worldwide are affected by this chronic inflammatory condition. Nonsurgical means of diagnosis are required to reduce length of time until diagnosis and treatment. Variations in systemic inflammatory response mediators have been associated with adverse clinical outcome in infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis as well as malignancies such as lymphoma and various solid carcinomas. Moreover, the ratio of specific leucocyte subpopulations such as monocytes and lymphocytes has been implicated as prognostic factor of inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction (e.g. in myocardial infarction). The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of the monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) as a predictive marker of endometriosis, in the context of disease stage and menstrual phase.",

INTRODUCTION: Adhesion of endometrial cells to extracellular matrix is thought to be the initial step of endometriosis development in the endometrial-tissue implantation theory. Another feature of endometriosis is chronic inflammation. However, mutual effects of these two important features of endometriosis, adhesion and inflammation, have hardly explored. Integrins, transmembrane cell surface receptors of extracellular matrix, have been demonstrated to regulate cell survival, proliferation and invasion via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in many types of cells including endometriosis. In the current study, we investigated that FAK and adhesion-mediated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) that activates monocyte and macrophages secretion from endometrial and endometriotic stromal cells. We also investigated the FAK-mediated myofibroblastic changes of endometriotic stromal cells.",

Hypothalami were dissected and analysed for expression of genes related to appetite regulation (Npy, Agrp, Pomc and Cart) and phosphorylation of AMPK (AMP activated protein kinase) and ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) proteins (downstream proteins of ghrelin receptor activation). RESULTS: In response to ICV injection of ghrelin, 1) diet intake was significantly lower in LP rats than CT rats; 2) water intake was not affected in LP rats; 3) expression of Npy and Agrp, but not Pomc and Cart, were higher in the hypothalamus of LP rats than CT rats; 4) the abundance of phosphorylated AMPK and the ratio of phosphorylated to total AMPK, but not the abundance of total AMPK, were lower in LP rats; 5) the abundance of phosphorylated ACC, but not total ACC, was lower in LP rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that blunted ghrelin signaling in the hypothalamus of pregnant rats fed a LP diet leads to reduced diet intake and exacerbates gestational protein insufficiency. For this reason, preconception screening for thyroid dysfunction is controversial and is not currently standard practice. The goal of this study was to investigate whether levothyroxine (LT4) treatment has beneficial effects on IVF and pregnancy outcomes in infertile patients with subclinical hypothyroidism undergoing fresh IVF cycles. METHODS: An IRB approved retrospective chart review of patients undergoing IVF cycles between January, 2010 and December, 2013. A total of 151 patients were identified meeting inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups: those receiving LT4 at IVF start (treated, n=102), and those not receiving LT4 (untreated, n=49). Primary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage and live birth rates. Secondary outcomes were number of oocytes retrieved, endometrial thickness, average total gonadotropins used and chemical pregnancy rate. RESULTS: There were no differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. The live birth rate was significantly higher in the treated group (51% vs 49%, p=0.033). Though not statistically significant, there was a trend toward higher ongoing pregnancy rate, lower miscarriage rate and higher number of oocytes retrieved in the treated group (53.9 vs 44.9, p=0.299; 4.9 vs 10.2, p=0.219; 16.52 vs 13.78, p=0.1229). No difference was found in endometrial thickness or average total gonadotropins used. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a higher live birth rate in patients with treated subclinical hypothyroidism undergoing fresh IVF cycles compared to untreated patients. There was also a trend toward higher ongoing pregnancy rate, lower miscarriage rate and higher number of oocytes retrieved in the treatment group. These results suggest that untreated subclinical hypothyroidism adversely affects a patient's likelihood of ART success, and therefore provides support for the proposal of standardized preconceptual TSH screening and the need for further research into the optimization of treatment for thyroid dysfunction in this patient population.",

The qPCR data were analyzed & 2-fold change in gene expression compared to control is considered significant. To validate the results; DSM cells were cultured & treated in triplicate with 100 nmol/L of vitamin D 3 or 100 nmol/L of Paricalcitol for 48 hours. RNA extracted, cDNA prepared and analysed for IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL-13, CXCR3, F2R, F3, SERPINA1 and GAPDH by RT-PCR. Effect on invitro contractility assessed using cell contraction assay (Biolabs) after DSM cultured & treated with vitamin D or Paricalcitol. Statistical analysis done using ANOVA and P<0.05 defined statistical significance. RESULTS: In vitamin D treated cells versus control, superarray analysis revealed significant (P<0.05) downregulation of the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL1A, IL1B, IL6, IL-13, CXCR3, F2R, F3 and SERPINA1. RT-PCR confirmed downregulation of the above proinflammatory cytokines in both vitamin D-treated and Paricalcitoltreated cells versus control (P<0.05). Paricalcitol was superior compared to vitamin D (P<0.05). Both vitamin D & Paricalcitol signifacntly inhibited DSM cells contraction (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that both vitamin D and Paricalcitol exert robust anti-inflammatory effect and inhibit contractility in human female DSM cells. Paricalcitol is superior to vitamin D. Further in vivo evaluation of Paricalcitol in animal models of OBS is warranted and may present novel treatment for OBS.

For Ca2+ measures, cells were subsequently treated with 100uM ATP for 30 min and monitored for any inhibition vs ATP control (V0/T0). RESULTS: Statistical analysis by Student's T test revealed the following combinations resulted in significant stimulations from T0/V0 control (P<0.05), in ng/ml: T0.1/V1, T1/V0.1. The following doses resulted in significant inhibition from T0/V0 control (P<0.05), in ng/ml: T0/V10, T0.1V0, T0.1/V10, T1/V10, T10/V0, T10/V10. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of VEGF, in the normal physiologic range, can confer a level of protection against TNFa-related inhibition of sustained Ca2+ responses, and even can stimulate ATP-stimulated sustained phase Ca2+ responses. However, as doses climb into the pathophysiologic range of VEGF, strong inhibition of Ca2+ responses occurs. Thus, small levels of growth factors and cytokines are essential for endothelial function, but any increase above that leads to catastrophic failure of endothelial function.

INTRODUCTION: CD83, a highly conserved 40-45 kDa transmembrane molecule and activation marker on dendritic cells, has been postulated to be involved in the modulation of immune response during pregnancy. Its expression on the surface of immune cells is linked to immunosuppressive effects: B cells overexpressing CD83 show a high expression of the anti-inflammatory Interleukin 10 and simultaneously a lower secretion of antibodies. The membrane-bound form of CD83 generates a soluble protein (sCD83), which inhibits the anti-tumor-response of the immune system.",

Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shinjyuku-ku, Shinanomachi, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Glutamate-induced apoptosis (G-apoptosis) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of perinatal brain injury. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells derived from human amniotic fluid (hAF-MSC) were established and the effect of conditioned medium (CM) from hAF-MSC on G-apoptosis was determined.METHODS:The study was approved by the institutional review board of our university and informed consent was obtained from all patients. hAF samples were obtained by amniocentesis. CD117 + cells selected by microbeads were characterized by flow cytometry for surface markers of mesenchymal (CD29, CD73, and CD90) and hematopoietic (CD14, CD34, and HLA-DR) stem cells. CD117 + cells were analyzed to confirm their differentiation into osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with excess glutamate in the presence and absence of CM. After 24 hours of treatment, apoptotic cells were quantified using annexin-V immunostaining. RESULTS: CD117 + cells were positive for mesenchymal markers, but negative for hematopoietic markers. The differentiation of CD117 + cells into three lineages was confirmed by Alizarin Red S, Oil Red O and Alcian Blue staining *Figure(s) will be available online. The number of apoptotic cells increased after glutamate treatment; however, CM treatment alleviated this effect. CONCLUSIONS: We established hAF-MSC and CM from hAF-MSC alleviated G-apoptosis.",

CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that short-term SIM application can reduce contractility of human CPAs. Further studies will focus on determining the reliance of this effect on the NO pathway and if other statins can induce similar effects on vascular tone. References: (1) Rossoni et al 2011.

INTRODUCTION:Retrograde delivered menstrual debris and cyclic tissue death in endometriotic lesion are clinically relevant pathological mechanisms that occur within the peritoneal cavity and potentially disturb peritoneal homeostasis. The cell death in the tissue is thought to activate the immune system possibly leading to inflammation and pelvic pain observed in women with endometriosis. We have previously shown that intraperitoneal inoculation of uterine tissue causes acute inflammation and pain in mice. As both inflammation and pain are well described features of classic infectious peritonitis model in mice, we further evaluated the underlying inflammatory mechanisms and investigated if the presence of uterine tissue in the peritoneal cavity triggers all hallmarks of a sterile peritonitis.

We hypothesize that MTA3, as part of the NuRD complex, regulates trophoblast invasion directly through invasion genes, MMP2, MMP9 and Snail expression. METHODS: We immunostained for MTA3 protein in term placenta tissue sections (n=8) to verify its expression in trophoblast cells. Lentivirus carrying MTA3 cDNA and shRNA were used to overexpess or knock down MTA3 expression in HTR8SV/neo cells, a model of EVT, and a Matrigel invasion assay was performed. mRNA and protein levels of MMP2, MMP9 and Snail, required for trophoblast invasion, were evaluated via qRT-PCR and Western Blot. MTA3 assembly with NuRD complex was tested by immunoprecipitation from HTR8SV/neo extract with MTA3 antibody, then co-IP-Western-Blot and co-IP-Mass-SPEC were conducted to identify the protein makeup of the complex. RESULTS: MTA3 is expressed in the EVT cells in human term placenta.CONCLUSIONS:In summary, our data show that MTA3 regulates Snail and MMP expression via NuRD complex. The negative regulatory effect of MTA3 on EVT invasion which could be the tribute to the etiology/ pathology of preeclamptic placenta. The T-HESC cell line, representing decidua cells, and first trimester decidua tissues were treated with siRNAs against NODAL after which IGF1 mRNA expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and IGF1 secretion in media by Western blot. Recombinant IGF1 was added to SGHPL-5 extravillous trophoblast cells for 72h after which the effects on STOX1 mRNA expression were measured. Secondly, in these cells, STOX1 localization in different protein compartments was studied by Western blot. RESULTS: T-HESC cells treated with NODAL siRNAs showed significant upregulation of IGF1 mRNA, while a clear trend towards increased secretion of IGF1 in media obtained from the cells and decidua tissues was seen. Addition of IGF1 to the media of SGHPL-5 cells upregulated STOX1 mRNA expression, while Western blot on different protein compartments showed that the nuclear concentration of STOX1 protein decreased with the cytoplasmic STOX1 concentration increasing. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show that downregulated Nodal expression in the first trimester decidua increases IGF1 secretion. In extravillous trophoblasts, this IGF1 increase leads to a shuttling of the STOX1 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This most likely occurs via the PI3K-Akt pathway which can be activated by IGF1, while STOX1 is known to be regulated by Akt, with phosphorylation causing STOX1 shuttling to the cytoplasm where it is degraded. This also explains the upregulation of STOX1 mRNA; due to activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, less STOX1 protein is present in the nucleus which is replenished by increasing the STOX1 mRNA production of the cell.University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA; 3 University of Colorado Anschutz Medical campus, Aurora, CO, USA.

Analysis of variance was used to evaluate continuous variables. RESULTS: 68 participants had singleton gestations, complete sleep studies and ultrasound data. Of those, 34 had anterior and 31 had posterior placentation. Demographics were similar between groups.

It was our aim to demonstrate safety of early onset Controls were matched for week of gestational age at birth and BW within 10%, with no indomethacin exposure, selected randomly with no knowledge of neonatal outcome. To allow pure assessment of indomethacin complications, this matching equalizes impacts of prematurity. Neonates with complete variables for renal function (urine output (UO) at first 24h of life, UO at 48-96h, creatinin levels, need for peritoneal dialysis and need for Lasix) were selected. Continuous variables analyzed using rank test and Odds ratios were calculated. reference is poor prognosis (O/E LHR <25%).

Additionally, HC/AC was found to be predictive of the need for ECMO (p=0.009) but not survival (p=0.18). CONCLUSIONS: HC/AC not only shows a strong correlation with LHR and O/E LHR, it's also predictive of the need for ECMO in neonatal life.

Arie Shaw, 1 Michael Ulm, 1 Lei Wang, 2 Nhu Quynh Tran, 2 Danielle Tate, 1 Norman Meyer. 1 1 University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA; 2 University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA. INTRODUCTION: To evaluate whether performing antenatal testing on the basis of morbid obesity affects perinatal morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed on patients who delivered at the Regional Medical Center from 2007-2013.The historical control group consisted of patients with the diagnosis of morbid obesity that delivered at between 2007 and 2010. The prospective cohort group consisted of patients with the diagnosis of morbid obesity that delivered between 2011 and 2013 and received weekly antenatal testing starting at 32 weeks of gestation in the outpatient setting. Morbid obesity was defined as BMI \u2265 40. The historical control was matched to the prospective cohort based upon patient BMI. Patients who had maternal or fetal comorbidities outside of obesity necessitating antenatal testing were excluded. The cohorts were compared for mode of delivery, fetal outcome, and antepartum comorbidities. Chi-square test and likelihood ratio testing were used to analyze the results.RESULTS:The historical control group consisted of 139 patients with morbid obesity that did not undergo weekly antenatal testing. The prospective cohort group consisted of 139 patients that received weekly antenatal testing. There was no statistically significant difference between the two cohorts in rate of cesarean delivery or preterm delivery. There was no difference in hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes or other pregnancy-induced conditions between the two cohorts. There was a Weekly antenatal testing in the third trimester for the diagnosis of morbid obesity is associated with significantly lower NICU admission rates with no increase rates of cesarean delivery or preterm delivery.",

We hypothesize that the pathological thresholds for postglucose-load PG are lower in early than in late pregnancy OGTT due to lower insulin resistance in early pregnancy. We studied the effect of gestation on OGTT results by performing OGTTs in early and late pregnancy in a population-based Finnish cohort. Using the current diagnostic thresholds, 107/665 (12.1%) of subjects had GDM based on OGTT1 and were treated accordingly. At OGTT2, 69/496 (13.9%) of participants had GDM. Hence, the total number of participants with GDM was 176/665 (26.5%). The mean (SD) fasting PG value was higher and the post-glucose load PG values were lower in OGTT1 than in OGTT2 when the results of patients without early GDM were compared.CONCLUSIONS:Most patients with trauma during multi-fetal gestations have excellent maternal and neonatal prognosis with conservative management.

INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infection is common in pregnancy and associated with fever and pyelonephritis. Urine is routinely sampled from the mid-stream portion of a voided sample (MSU) and if epithelial cells are seen on microscopy, the sample is disregarded as a contaminated specimen. Outside pregnancy, a catheter specimen urine (CSU) is considered to contain fewer contaminants. No direct comparison between the two methods has been made in pregnancy. At term pregnancy, MSU has more bacterial growth and a higher proportion of urothelial cells with closely associated bacteria when compared to CSU. This suggests that the presence of urothelial cells in MSU may indicate underlying bacteriuria rather than simply contamination. This has implications for the correct interpretation of MSU findings in late pregnancy.",

Correlation between fractal dimension and clinical variables was assessed using Pearson's r correlation coefficient with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Fractal dimension score ranged from 1.63-1.81. There was a significant negative correlation between fractal dimension and gestational age at delivery (r=-0.42[-0.65, -0.11], P=0.0083). There was a significant positive correlation between fractal dimension and birthweight percentile (r=0.35 [0.0.15, 0.61], P=0.041). Non-significant negative correlations between fractal dimension and umbilical artery Doppler, placental weight and 5 minute APGAR were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In SGA pregnancies, increased villous complexity may allow for increased fetal growth and subsequent larger birthweight but decreases with advancing gestation. Future studies of fractal dimension score in SGA and normal pregnancies are needed to determine if fractal dimension can identify placental insufficiency leading to growth restriction.Infection of Placental Hofbauer Cells (HBCs) with Herpes Virus Suppresses Both Response to LPS and Bactericidal Properties:Consequences for Bacterial Infection of the Fetus. Seth Guller, Zhonghua Tang, Vikki M Abrahams, Gil Mor. Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. INTRODUCTION: The role of a polymicrobial viral-bacterial infection of the placenta in fetal infection remains largely unexplored. Herpes simplex virus is the most common sexually transmitted infection in adult females, and genital herpes infection during pregnancy is linked to fetal mortality. HBCs are placental macrophages located between the syncytium and fetal capillaries, a critical site for the protection against microbes migrating from the mother to the fetus. Our goal was to test whether infection of HBCs with herpes virus alters their ability to respond to bacterial LPS and to restrict bacterial proliferation, requisite functions for preventing transplacental fetal infection. METHODS: HBCs isolated from normal term placenta (n=5) were uninfected or infected for 1 h with murine herpes virus (MHV)-68 (10 5 cfu/ml), fresh media was added, and 24 h later cells were treated with and without 1 ng/ml LPS for 15 min to 24 h. Secretion of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and other cytokines was measured by ELISA and multiplex assay. Cytokine mRNA expression was assessed by qPCR. Western blotting was used to examine LPS signaling pathways. Bactericidal properties of HBCs were measured using Td-Tomato labeled E. coli (TL-E. coli, MOI=10), which were incubated with MHV-68-infected and uninfected HBCs for 24 h after which TL-E. coli were localized in HBCs by microscopy. RESULTS: MHV-68 infection of HBCs significantly suppressed the LPSmediated enhancement of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion and up-regulation of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 mRNA from 69% to 98%. LPS-enhanced secretion of IL-6, G-CSF, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES, but not GM-CSF, MCP-1, IL-8, and IP-10, was reduced in MHV-68-infected HBCs from 55% to 80%. MHV-68 infection also blocked LPS-dependent down-regulation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and the phosphorylation of IKK, indicating that MHV-68 infection suppresses LPS-driven NF-\u03baB signaling through an IKK-dependent mechanism. Using TL-E. coli, we observed that the bactericidal properties of HBCs were reduced ~50% in MHV-68-infected HBCs.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that herpes viral infection of HBCs blocks their ability to respond to LPS and inhibits their bactericidal properties. This suggests that a polymicrobial viral-bacterial infection of the placenta may suppress physiological responses of HBCs to bacteria resulting in bacterial proliferation and transplacental infection of the fetus. Attenuates Angiotensin II-Induced Placental Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Contraction: Potential Beneficial Effects of Vitamin D on Placental Vascular Function. Xiuyue Jia, 1 Jie Xu, 1 Yang Gu, 1 Mahmond H Al-Kofahi, 2 J Steven Alexander, 2 Lynn J Groome, 1 Yuping Wang. 1, 2 1 LSU Health Sciences Center -Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA; 2 LSU Health Sciences Center -Shreveport, Shreveport, LA, USA. INTRODUCTION:Emerging evidence has shown that sufficient maternal vitamin D (VD) levels have beneficial effects on human pregnancy. In contrast, insufficient VD levels or altered VD metabolism in the placenta was found to contribute to placental dysfunction in preeclampsia (PE). However, little is known about effects of VD on placental vascular function. This study was aimed to investigate the role of VD in placental vascular smooth muscle cells (PVSMC) and explore the underlying mechanism of VD-mediated PVSMC relaxation.

INTRODUCTION:Obesity in pregnancy aggravates inflammation and predisposes the fetus to excess adiposity, a risk factor for development of metabolic disorders later in life.The placenta contributes to the inflammatory environment through the activation of TLR4 signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to assess the relationships between placental TLR4 expression and neonatal adiposity. METHODS: Thirty nine healthy women with pre-gravid BMI <25(lean) or \u226530(obese) were recruited at term scheduled C-section(NIH:HD22965). Maternal venous and fetal cord blood were sampled to measure inflammatory and metabolic markers. Placenta tissue and cells were prepared for TLR4 expression by immunohistochemistry, WB and RT-PCR. Results were analyzed with ANOVA, Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and partial SRCC analysis. RESULTS: Neonates from obese women were heavier at birth (3.8\u00b10.4vs.3.0\u00b10.3kg, p<0.001) with a higher percentage of body fat (%BF)(15.9\u00b12.9vs.10.8\u00b12.8, p<0.001). Neonatal %BF was strongly associated with maternal pre-gravid BMI (r=0.52, p<0.001).TLR4, IL6 and IL8 expression was increased 3-fold (p<0.001) in placenta of obese vs. lean women. TLR4 protein was detected on both sides of the placental barrier i.e. in trophoblast cells facing maternal blood and macrovascular endothelial cells lining fetal vasculature. Placental TLR4 expression exhibited positive correlations with maternal pre-gravid BMI, plasma leptin, CRP and placentalweight (PW) (r=0.57, 0.73, 0.54, 0.36, p<0.05) but not with maternal age (MA), gestational age (GA) and gestational weight gain (GWG)(r<0.2, p>0.05). Placental TLR4 was also correlated with neonatal %BF, ponderal index, cord plasma leptin and insulin (r=0.52, 0.48, 0.42, 0.35, p<0.01). However, after adjusting for maternal variables: pre-gravid BMI, HOMA, MA, GA, GWG and PW, the correlation between placental TLR4 and neonatal %BF was no longer significant (r=0.33, p=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL8 was increased in placenta of obese vs. lean women. Placental TLR4 strongly correlated with maternal pre-gravid BMI but not with neonatal adiposity. These data suggest that the activation of placental innate immune pathways reflects the pre-pregnancy obesogenic environment but does not directly contribute to fetal fat accretion.Prenatal Maternal Stress Alters Placental Endocrine Functions inSex Dependent Manner.

METHODS: Wistar dams were exposed to normoxia (N, 21% O 2 ) or hypoxia (H, 13% O 2 ) from days 6-20 of pregnancy +/-MitoQ (500\u00b5M in drinking water). On day 20, animals were sacrificed and weighed and the placentae were processed for stereology. One placenta per litter per group was used. This model does not affect maternal food intake. RESULTS: Neither hypoxic pregnancy or MitoQ treatment affected fetal growth (N:3.83\u00b10.07 g; H:3.44\u00b10.03 g; HM: 3.59\u00b10.04 g; NM: 3.41\u00b10.03 g). Relative to normoxia, the placental absolute volume and the labyrinthine fetal capillary surface area were significantly increased in hypoxic pregnancy [Fig. 1 A and B, P<0.05]. Maternal MitoQ treatment in hypoxic pregnancy additionally increased the maternal blood space surface area[Fig. 1C, P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that the placenta adapts to chronic hypoxic pregnancy of a moderate level by increasing the fetal capillary surface within the labyrinthine transport zone to maintain fetal growth. Maternal mitochondrial targeted antioxidant therapy during hypoxic pregnancy improves perfusion on the maternal side of the placenta.Trained Memory in Decidual NK Cells During Human Pregnancy. Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune system able to kill tumor and infected cells. Recent studies suggest that NK cells possess some features of adaptive immunity, including a certain type of immune cell memory. During human pregnancy NK cells constitute the most abundant lymphocyte population (50-70%)",

INTRODUCTION: Melatonin and its receptors play a crucial in placental function. This indolamine plays a protective effect against oxidative stress and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis of the primary villous trophoblast (vTB) induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) through maintenance of the equilibrium between pro-and anti-oxidants. Under oxidative stress situations, such as H/R, ER activates a mechanism called unfolded protein response (UPR) by the activation of PERK, ATF6, Ire1\u03b1 and GRP78. However, whether H/R in the trophoblast cell activates ER-stress and if melatonin can prevent this damage has never been studied. The hypothesis is that melatonin prevents ER-stress induced by H/R in villous trophoblast. The specific objective is to determine the effect of increasing concentrations of melatonin on PERK, ATF6, Ire1\u03b1 and GRP78 in villous trophoblast under H/R. mM) treatment. ER-stress related proteins, PERK, Ire1\u03b1, GRP78, CHOP and ATF4 have been analyzed by western blot. RESULTS: Results show that melatonin induced Ire1\u03b1 and PERK activation in BeWo cells under H/R compared to normoxia, without induction of downstream protein CHOP which lead to apoptosis. However, GPR78 is induced by melatonin in vTB under H/R suggesting the activation of the autophagy pathways to prevent cell death. CONCLUSIONS: These finding suggested a role of melatonin in ERstress and autophagy that favor the maintenance of homeostasis of the placenta and the well-being of pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION:Endometriosis is a benign estrogen dependent inflammatory condition, severely affecting women's quality of life by chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and subfertility. Even though increasing evidence is indicating the impact of epigenetics in the development of endometriosis, the common use of tissue homogenates or cultured cells might have hampered the detection of distinct pathophysiological alterations so far.In this study we therefore aim to profile DNA methylation patterns in individual endometrial cell populations, separated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) in order to deepen our disease understanding. METHODS: For DNA methylation profiling, eutopic and ectopic endometrial specimens from patients with endometriosis as well as normal endometrium from healthy control donors were provided by the Vivantes Humboldt Hospital Berlin. The separation of epithelial and stromal endometrial cells was performed by LCM on 10 \u00b5m thick fresh frozen tissue sections. After DNA isolation and fragmentation with the restriction endonuclease MspI, bisulfite-converted libraries were produced using the NuGEN Ovation\u00ae Ultralow Methyl-Seq Library System.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis affects 10% of reproductive aged women. Loss of KLF11 signaling causes advanced endometriotic progression and fibrosis. We identified a novel role for KLF10, a KLF11 paralog, in human endometriosis. Whereas loss of KLF11 activates Collagen1 and scarring, loss of KLF10 results in dysregulation of distinct inflammatory pathways and cystic lesions. Despite 80% homology and similar epigenetic cofactor binding domains, loss KLF10 and 11 result in two common but highly divergent disease phenotypes and offer a robust model for molecular investigation of this heterogenous disease. METHODS: Endometriosis was surgically induced in 10wk old wt or Klf10-/-mice by suturing 0.5 mm everted uterine segments to parietal peritoneum. Klf10-/-uterine segments were allografted into wt mice and v.v. Disease progression was assessed by morphometry, PCR and IHC. PCR Arrays and confirmatory gene expression studies were performed in Ishikawa cells transfected with KLF10, KLF10siRNA or controls by ChIP, PCR and WB. CD40/CD154 expression was assessed by IHC in allografted murine and human disease lesions. RESULTS: In contrast to lesion regression in wild type, Klf10-/developed cystic lesions with minimal fibrosis. Like autologously implanted Klf10-/-lesions, when Klf10-/-lesions were allografted into wt animals, the lesions were cystic. In contrast, wt lesions regressed in Klf10-/-animals. Lesion specific loss of Klf10 determined inflammation and cystic progression, which significantly was also not accompanied by fibrosis in contrast with Klf11. Whereas KLF10siRNA increased CD40 and CD154 mRNA and protein levels, both were repressed by KLF10 in Ishikawa cells. Congruently, CD154 expression was increased in Klf10-/-but not wt lesions. In humans diminished KLF10 in lesions was also associated with increased CD154 compared to corresponding ectopic endometrium. CONCLUSIONS: Lesion specific dysregulated CD40/CD154 mediated inflammation from loss of KLF10 results in endometriotic cyst formation. Despite significant inflammatory infiltrate there was minimal scarring in contrast with loss of Klf11. Endometriotic cyst and fibrosis are thus likely discrete disease progression phenotypes contributing to heterogeneity. Human disease specific genes KLF10 and KLF11 recruit epigenetic mechanisms to regulate distinct target genes. Our models offer new insight into the role of inflammation and fibrosis in chronic disease with novel translational potential.Mast Cells and Chymase: Are They Partners in Crime inPelvic Pain and Endometriosis?

INTRODUCTION:Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease. Symptoms include chronic pelvic pain linked to an aberrant inflammatory state. Immune cells may communicate with neurons to alter pain sensitivity and trigger the transition from acute to chronic pain. Mast cells (MCs) are emerging as key players in physiological and pathological pain pathways. Degranulation of MCs results in release of inflammatory molecules including the MC-specific proteases, tryptase and chymase. MC mediators can sensitize neurons and the nerves in turn release neuropeptides such as histamine that can activate MCs, resulting in a vicious cycle.",

Juneau Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION:Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated and replicated several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with endometriosis. However, GWAS studies focus on SNPs with minor allele frequencies >3%, and for many diseases the phenotypic variance explained by GWAS are modest. SNPs rare in the general population often account for missing heritability. In this study, we sequenced the exomes of 206 affected women who were distantly related pairs (meiosis 6 to 7 apart) to detect rare variants in genes likely to predispose women to endometriosis. METHODS: Paired-end WGS was performed on 206 affected women using Ion Proton Platform (Thermo Fisher). Variant analysis was performed using Ion Torrent Variant caller and validated using the best practices workflow recommended by Genome-Analysis-Tool-Kit (Broad Institute). Prediction of protein function was evaluated using seven different algorithms (Polyphen 2, sift, Mutation Accessor, Mutation Taster, FATHMM,LRT, MetaLR). We examined damaging rare variants (ExAc MAF <0.03, and predicted to be damaging in at least 1 prediction algorithm). RESULTS: WGS was accomplished with a 100-fold mean coverage. We identified ~17,000 exome variants per individual and 2,811 rare exonic variants shared at least by a single relative pair. 227 rare variants were predicted to be damaging. 20 variants were shared by at least 5 distant relative affected pairs. We looked for association of these 20 variants in exome sequencing database of 860 unrelated endometriosis subjects. The genes showing association p<0.05 are shown inTable 1. Two other damaging missense variants in POLN (p.R485Q and p.R406G) showed association with endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS: Through distant relative pair analysis and exome sequencing, we have identified POLN as an endometriosis predisposition gene. POLN is the first DNA repair gene associated with endometriosis. POLN is expressed in endometrium and is implicated in prostate and ovarian cancer, but it does not have a known role in endometriosis.Impact of Psychological Stress on Pain Perception in an AnimalModel of Endometriosis.

INTRODUCTION: Symptoms of pain and infertility in endometriosis patients are considered significant sources of stress.We have recently demonstrated that stress can worsen the condition in a rat model of endometriosis, however the impact of stress on the sensitivity to pain in this condition has not been investigated. Our aim was to determine the effects of a psychological stress protocol on pain thresholds. METHODS: Endometriosis was induced in female rats by suturing uterine horn tissue next to the intestinal mesentery. Sham rats had sutures only. The stress protocol consisted of placing the rat on a platform (11cm x 10cm) in a plastic container (40.6cm x 40.6cm) with 25\u00b0C water up to 1 cm below the platform for 1 hour for 7 consecutive days. Fecal pellets (FPC) and corticosterone (CORT) levels were measured. Changes in pain perception were assessed using the hot plate test for hyperalgesia and Von Frey test for allodynia. Mu opioid receptor (MOR), neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), and substance P (Sub P) expression in the spinal cord was measured by immunohistochemistry. At time of sacrifice tissues were collected and vesicles measured.RESULTS:The endo stress (ES) group had higher anxiety levels (FPC and CORT) than endo no stress (ENS) (p<0.01) and sham no stress (SNS) (p<0.01). ES rats had higher inflammation when compared to the SNS (colonic damage: p<0.001) and ENS (colonic damage: p<0.05; mast cells in vesicles: p<0.01). Vesicles in ES animals were larger and more severe than in ENS. Both endo groups developed hyperalgesia reaching significance in the ES (p<0.05), but stress reversed the allodynic effect caused by endo (p<0.001). MOR expression was significantly reduced in ENS versus SNS (p<0.05), and stress did not significantly alter this. No effects were found between groups for NK-1R and Sub P expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings parallel our previous studies showing that animals subjected to stress develop more severe symptoms. Interestingly stress seems to have beneficial effects on allodynia which could be a consequence of the stress induced analgesia phenomenon. Further studies are needed to understand physiologically how pain perception is altered in this disease and which pathways are involved.Supported in part by R25GM096955 & R25GM082406 Endometrial Gene Expression Analysis of Genes Found to Be Associated with Endometriosis by GWAS.

            "text": "Production in Endometriosis: The Roles of NR5A1 and GATA6. Lia Bernardi, Christia Sison, Serdar Bulun, Matthew Dyson. Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION: NR5A1 and GATA6 regulate steroid biosynthesis in steroidogenic tissues.We have previously demonstrated that both of these transcription factors are expressed in endometriotic tissue and drive steroidogenic gene expression in certain cell types. As the pathoprogression of endometriosis ultimately depends on estradiol (E2), we hypothesize that NR5A1 and GATA6 also drive E2 production seen in endometriosis. To test this, NR5A1 and GATA6 were silenced in endometriotic stromal fibroblasts (OSIS) and transduced into normal endometrial stromal cells (NoEM), human foreskin fibroblast cells (BJ), or mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3). METHODS: OSIS were obtained from endometriotic cysts and NoEM were acquired from the endometrium of women without endometriosis. BJ and NIH/3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC. NR5A1 and GATA6 were depleted in OSIS by transfecting gene-specific siRNAs. Overexpression in NoEM, BJ, and NIH/3T3 was accomplished by transducing adenoviruses bearing species-specific, CMV-driven NR5A1 and GATA6. Enzyme immunoassays were performed to assess E2 production. Steroidogenic gene expression was evaluated in NIH/3T3 using qPCR and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Concordant with reduced steroidogenic gene expression, E2 production in OSIS decreased from 59.7 pg/mL in controls to 41.7 pg/ mL with NR5A1 silencing (p=0.04). E2 synthesis was further suppressed to 23.2 pg/mL when both NR5A1 and GATA6 were silenced (p=0.005). NR5A1 expression in NoEM generated a nonsignificant increase in E2 production (42.9 pg/mL versus baseline of 17.5 pg/mL). Combined expression of NR5A1 and GATA6 significantly increased E2 synthesis to 260.6 ng/mL (p=0.003). Although steroidogenic genes were induced in BJ cells in response to NR5A1 and GATA6, there was no detectable E2 synthesis. In NIH/3T3, NR5A1 and GATA6 elicited little change in steroidogenic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: NR5A1 and GATA6 contribute toward E2 synthesis in endometriosis. E2 production was dependent upon both transcription factors, as depletion compromised steroidogenesis in OSIS. This observation was complemented in NoEM, where NR5A1 and GATA6 worked synergistically to produce the highest levels of E2. In contrast, NR5A1 and GATA6 did not drive E2 synthesis in BJ cells, despite detectable levels of the steroidogenic enzymes. NIH/3T3 cells appeared refractory to developing any steroidogenic potential. Studies addressing the differentiation cues inducing NR5A1 and GATA6 will provide insight into novel treatments for the disease.Physical & Mental Health Components of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and Health State Utilities (HSU) for Uterine Fibroids (UF) Patients in the United States (US). Ahmed M Soliman, 1 Karin Coyne, 2 Mary Kay Margolis, 2 Jane Castelli-Haley, 1 Michael Snabes, 3 Craig Winkel. 4 1 AbbVie Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; 2 Evidera Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA; 3 AbbVie Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; 4 Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA. INTRODUCTION: UF is associated with significant impact on HRQL.This analysis assessed the HRQL (physical and mental health) and health state utilities (HSU) among UF patients in the US. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among US women aged 18-54. Women who reported UF diagnosis or UF-related symptoms in prevalence screening completed a main survey which assessed multiple aspects of HRQL; SF-12 \u00ae was used to compute physical and mental component scores (PCS & MCS; national average score is 50) and EQ-5D-5L \u00ae was used to derive HSU (range:0-1). Analysis excluded women who had hysterectomy. ANOVA was used to examine the impact of UF self-reported severity and UF-related symptoms (heavy menstrual bleeding, excessive or irregular bleeding, passage of clots, pelvic pressure & bloating) co-occurrence on HRQL and HSU. RESULTS: A total of 59,411 women completed the prevalence screener; 5,879 completed the main survey. SF-12 analysis sample included 1,397 UF women. Mean age was 42.8 years. Mean PCS and MCS scores were 49.7 and 43.6 respectively . Women reporting their overall UF symptoms as severe had significantly lower PCS and MCS scores compared to women reporting moderate or mild symptoms (PCS: 41.1, 48.7 and 51.7; MCS: 36.7, 40.9 and 46.2; respectively all p<0.01). PCS and MCS scores decreased as the number of co-occurring UF-related symptoms increased . HSU analysis included 1,244 women with UF. Mean HSU were 0.81. Women with overall self-reported severe UF symptoms had significantly lower estimated HSU compared to women reporting moderate or mild UF symptoms (0.65, 0.79 and 0.85, p<0.01). HSU among women with UF deteriorated as the number of UF-related symptoms increased. CONCLUSIONS: UF are associated with significant impairment in HRQL and HSU that increase with increasing disease severity and symptoms co-occurrence. Symptom improvement could result in improving overall HRQL of women with UF.Therapeutic Use of Ulipristal to Inhibit Leiomyoma Growth Inhibits Smooth Muscle Contractile Protein Expression in Surgical Samples.William H Catherino, 1,2 Jeris Cox, 1,2 Minnie Malik, 1 Joy Britten, 1 Lynnette Nieman. 2 1 Uniformed Services University, Bethesda, MD, USA; 2 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Uterine leiomyomas are highly prevalent and symptomatic, resulting in substantial maternal and fetal morbidity. Ulipristal acetate treatment, in clinical trials, results in decreased leiomyoma size and symptoms. However, the mechanism of this compound remains unclear. We have obtained hysterectomy specimens from a clinical trial after treatment with ulipristal or placebo for 12 weeks, and have demonstrated alterations in extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that ulipristal alters excessive and aberrant intracellular, contractile smooth muscle proteins. METHODS: Genome-wide quantitative screening via RNAseq, followed by confirmatory qRT-PCR. Additional confirmatory tests were performed using human immortalized leiomyoma cells in vitro.",

Farah S Chuong, 1 Chantel I Washington, 1 Paul H Driggers, 1 Minnie Malik, 2 James H Segars. 1 1 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2 Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Sex steroid hormones, estrogen (E) and progesterone (P), play a critical role in regulating growth and development of uterine fibroids. Fibroids have an altered extracellular matrix, which can cause increased mechanical stress leading to activation of Rho-dependent signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement. We have previously shown that AKAP13, a scaffolding protein that activates Rho-dependent signaling, is differentially expressed in fibroid cells versus myometrial cell controls. AKAP13 binds specifically to estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) and progesterone receptor B (PR-B) in vitro and augments both PR and ERdependent reporter activity in transfected cells. Given this interaction, we evaluated whether AKAP13 gene expression in fibroid tissue is subject to regulation by ovarian steroid hormones. METHODS: Immortalized leiomyoma cells were treated with E or P for 24 hours. RNA was then isolated and used as a template for generation of complementary DNA (cDNA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were performed. All values of the target genes were normalized to the expression of the reference genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 18S ribosomal RNAs. The immortalized leiomyoma cells were transfected with AKAP13 expression vector and analyzed for a change in PR-B message. RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in AKAP13 gene expression with the 24-hours of E exposure (p<0.05) that was not observed after P exposure. Through AKAP13 transfection we were unable to detect a difference in PR-B message. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that E induces AKAP13 in a feedforward mechanism affecting E action. The increased P responsive gene activity previously noted does not appear to be caused by increased PR-B message in the presence AKAP13. AKAP13's involvement in both Rho signaling and steroid hormone response makes it a plausible integrator of mechanical stress and hormonal signaling. We postulate that the increased expression of AKAP13 noted in fibroid cells results from both an altered state of mechanical homeostasis as well as hormonal regulation.Vitamin D Deficiency Induces an Overactive Bladder SyndromePhenotype in a Novel Murine Model. Mohamed Abdelaziz, 1 Noura Eziba, 1 Paul O'Connor, 1 Nahed Ismail, 2 Michael Diamond, 1 Ayman Al-Hendy. 1 1 Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA; 2 University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder syndrome (OBS) is a common health problem. This syndrome shares epidemiological and pathophysiological features with preterm birth. Our recently published work suggested that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for preterm birth(Thota et. al., 2013). Recent studies have documented the expression of vitamin D receptors in human bladder. We hypothesize that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for OBS, leading to a heightened inflammatory microenvironment in the bladder wall leading to hyper-excitability of detrusor muscle cells. METHODS: Weight matched 4-6 wk-old C57BL/6 female mice were either raised on normal diet (n = 10) or vitamin D-deficient diet (n = 10) for 8 weeks. Then mice undergone cystometry & the following parameters recorded: Filling pressure, threshold pressure, presence of non-voiding bladder contractions (NVBC) & bladder capacity. Then animals were euthanized. Blood was collected at time of euthanasia. Bladder samples undergone H&E and Immunohistochemistry for proliferation markers (Ki67, PCNA & TGF beta), inflammatory cell markers (CD69, CD3, FOXP3 & CD11b), and contractility related markers (Connexin 43, COX 2 & NF-Kb). Statistical analysis done using Student's T test. RESULTS: We confirmed hypovitaminosis D status by measuring serum 25-OH vitamin D (23\u00b11.78 ng/mL in vitamin D deficient group vs 62\u00b12.63 ng/mL in control group, P=0.01). In deficient group versus control, we observed significant increase in filling pressure (5.8\u00b10.7 vs 1.6\u00b10.8 cm H 2 O, P= 0.03) as well as significant decrease in bladder capacity (153\u00b128 vs 266\u00b122 microL, P=0.01). We also identified presence of premature NVBC in deficient group which was totally absent in control group. H&E shows significant increase in thickness of detrusor muscle in deficient group by 32\u00b13.73% (P=0.02). IHC showed significant increase in expression of proliferation markers 'PCNA, Ki-67 & TGF beta', inflammatory markers (CD69, CD3, FOXP3 & CD11b) and contractility related markers (Connexin 43, COX 2 & NF-Kb) in deficient group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency was associated with decreased bladder compliance, development of detrusor overactivity and increased detrusor proliferation. Vitamin D deficiency might be a novel OBS risk factor. Vitamin D and its analogues could present a new family for possible treatment of OBS.Low Impact of Vaginal or Buccal Misoprostol on Mucosal and Systemic Immune Activation and the CervicovaginalMicrobiome. Spyros A Kalams, 1 Lisa M Rogers, 1 Rita M Smith, 1 Louise Barnett, 1 Katie Crumbo, 1 Shonda Sumner, 1 Naomi Prashad, 1 Kyle Rybczyk, 1 Ginger L Milne, 1 Scot E Dowd, 2 Erica Chong, 3 Beverly Winikoff, 3 David M Aronoff. 1 1 Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA; 2 MR DNA (Molecular Research), Shallowater, TX, USA; 3 Gynuity Health Projects, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION:Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin (PG) E 1 analogue. It is used to prevent post-partum hemorrhage, induce labor in term pregnancies, and terminate pregnancies. Misoprostol has immunomodulatory effects. It is typically administered orally, buccally, or vaginally. Vaginal misoprostol has garnered controversy because of concerns that the drug increases the susceptibility of women to infections of the reproductive tract following its use. We sought to test the null hypothesis that single-dose misoprostol alters neither mucosal nor systemic immune responses, regardless of the route of administration METHODS: Prospective, cross-over, pilot study of 15 healthy, reproductive age women. Women received 800 ug of misoprostol either via buccal or vaginal administration and were crossed over one month later to receive the drug via the other route. Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples, cervical cytobrush samples, cervicovaginal swabs, urine, and blood were obtained immediately prior to drug administration and 24 hours later. Parameters assessed included urine and cervicovaginal misoprostol levels, whole blood cytokine responses (by ELISA) to immune stimulation, peripheral blood and cervical lymphocyte phenotyping by flow cytometry, cervicovaginal antimicrobial peptide measurement by ELISA, and cervicovaginal microbial ecology assessment by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Misoprostol was well tolerated and cleared from subjects within 1 day of administration. Neither buccal nor vaginal misoprostol significantly altered the local or systemic innate or adaptive immune responses measured in this study. Misoprostol did not appear to alter the vaginal microbiome. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not identify major immunomodulatory roles for buccal or vaginal single-dose misoprostol in healthy, reproductive age women. This study was supported by a grant to Gynuity Health Projects from an anonymous donor.Lactobacillus Crispatus Protects Vaginal Epithelial Cells fromLeptotrichia Amnionii-Induced Damage. Caroline Mitchell, Nidhi Gaur, Anuj Kalsy. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Leptotrichia amnionii (LA) is a gram negative, anaerobic species associated with increased preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal meningitis. Lactobacillus species have been associated with decreased rates of these complications. METHODS: Immortalized human vaginal epithelial cells (VK2) were cultured anaerobically with live or heat-killed (HK) Lactobacillus crispatus (LC) or LA alone or in combination for 24 hours. VK2 and bacterial numbers and viability were evaluated at 24 hours. Bacterial adherence was measured by plating VK2 cell suspension on appropriate agar after PBS wash. ELISA for IL6 and IL8 was performed on culture supernatant. Results were compared between treatment conditions using ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparison test. RESULTS: After culture with live LA VK2 cell numbers were significantly reduced compared to culture with no bacteria or with LC, though 95% of remaining cells were viable. *Figure(s) will be available online. When live LC was combined with LA this cell loss was attenuated. With HK bacteria, these effects were not seen. No differences in number of LA were seen whether cultured alone or with LC (4.8 x 10 6 vs. 4.2 x 10 6 cfu; p = 0.95) Levels of IL8 were significantly elevated after co-culture with live or HK LA *Figure(s) will be available online. but this was attenuated by co-culture with live or HK LC. A similar trend was seen for IL6 (data not shown). Co-culture with LC reduced the number of adherent LA by 41 \u00b1 3% (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Live LC inhibits vaginal epithelial cells loss due to LA and attenuates the epithelial immune response. This may be via competitive binding to the cell surface, but is not due to direct killing of LA.The S100A8 Concentration in Sera Prior to Initiation of an In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Cycle Predicts Subsequent Outcome.

INTRODUCTION: The autoimmune disorder Multiple Sclerosis (MS) ameliorates during pregnancy. The mechanisms for this are unclear, but some have hypothesized that maternal-fetal interaction may play a role.During normal pregnancy, bidirectional transplacental exchange of cells and subcellular material occurs between mother and fetus, establishing microchimerism (Mc). We sought to evaluate circulating fetal Mc (FMc) in pregnancies complicated by MS, evaluating overall whole blood (WB) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). METHODS: Maternal blood samples (n=40) were collected longitudinally from patients (n=8) with MS and confirmed full-term delivery (prepregnancy, 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd trimester, delivery, and postpartum). Cord blood was collected at delivery, or if not available, offspring buccal swabs were obtained. Maternal DNA was extracted from WB and Ficollpurified PBMC. Maternal and fetal genotyping was conducted, and FMc was quantified with quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting fetal-specific nonshared polymorphisms. Prevalence of FMc was compared in WB and PBMC. RESULTS: Overall detection of FMc was higher in WB than in PBMC (43% vs 9%, p=0.003) and this relationship persisted as gestation progressed. Although a limited sample size, our analysis suggests a possible reversal of this relationship in the postpartum period where FMc was more readily detectable in PBMC than WB (20% vs 0%).CONCLUSIONS:Our data demonstrate that in pregnancies complicated by MS, FMc was commonly detectable and found more often in WB compared to PBMC. This difference may reflect cell-free FMc or FMc in cells other than PBMC, such as granulocytes. Further studies are warranted to determine the phenotype of FMc, to evaluate whether detection correlates with MS amelioration in pregnancy, and to delineate any potential mechanistic relationship.Reconstruction of the Human EndometriumUsing Decellularized Uterine Tissues.

University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. INTRODUCTION: 1. Characterize the expression of methylation regulatory enzymes, DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) and teneleven translocation (TETs) enzymes, in murine oocytes during growth, acquisition of meiotic competence, and in response to exogenous gonadotropins. 2. Determine if insulin's terminal enzyme, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), regulates DNMTs/TETSs expression. METHODS: Growing meiotic incompetent and fully grown meiotic competent murine germinal vesicle intact oocytes were collected with and without ovarian stimulation with pregnant mare serum gonadotropins (PMSG) and expression levels of 5 DNMTs and 3 TET's were determined by Q-PCR. Two murine embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines were treated with either control solutions containing i) phosphate buffer saline (PBS), ii) Leukemia Inhibiting Factor (LIF), iii) DMSO (vehicle control) or the GSK3 inhibitors iv) Lithium chloride (LiCl), or v) Alsterpaullone (Alster). LiCl and Alster simulate hyperinsulinemia which results in GSK3 inhibition. Cells were collected after 15 days and Q-PCR was performed to measure the quantity of mRNA. ANOVA and pairwise comparisons by unpaired Student t-test were used in the analysis. RESULTS: All DNMT transcripts (1o, 1s, 3a, 3b, 3l) and all TET mRNAs (1, 2, 3) analyzed were expressed in murine oocytes. During oocyte growth and acquisition of meiotic competence DNMT1o & 1s expression increased while DNMT3a & 3l remained constant and DNMT3b was significantly reduced. As oocyte gained meiotic competence TET1 expression significantly decreased, while TET2 & 3 expression remained constant. In fully grown meiotic competent oocytes, pretreatment with gonadotropin, caused a significant increase in DNMT1s, no change in DNMT1o & 3a, and a significant reduction in DNMT3b & 3l. In the same oocyte group, pretreatment with PMSG had no effect on TET1 & 2 expression, whereas it induced a significant decrease in TET3 expression. Treatment of mESCs for 15 days with inhibitors of GSK3 (LiCl & Alster) had no influence on expression of DNMT3a, 3b, 3l, or 1s. In the same study, GSK3 inhibitors had no effect on TET1, 2, or 3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation enzymes are present in murine oocytes, change in expression during oocyte growth/acquisition of meiotic competence, and can be influenced by exogenous gonadotropins. Future experiments will address the role of prolonged elevated insulin, oocyte GSK3, and regulation of enzymes that regulate DNA methylation, epigenetics and imprinting.Obese Women Experience Impaired Endometrial ReceptivityIn Vitro Compared to Lean Women. Maureen MB Schulte, Jui-He Tsai, Kelle H Moley. Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. INTRODUCTION:Defective endometrial receptivity can lead to infertility and miscarriage. Obese women (BMI \u2265 30) are three times more likely to suffer infertility than women with a normal BMI. The objective of this study was to investigate the difference in endometrial receptivity between normo-ovulatory lean and obese women. METHODS: Normo-ovulatory women with regular menses and proven fertility were consented. They underwent an endometrial biopsy, patients with BMI \u2265 30 were considered obese and BMI \u2264 25 were considered lean. Endometrial decidualization was induced by exposing endometrial stromal cells to 1mM medroxyprogesterone acetate and 0.5 mM cAMP for nine days. The mRNA expression levels of known markers of endometrial decidualization; prolactin and IGFBP1, were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The fold change in gene expression between non-decidualized and decidualized samples was calculated. Students T-test was used for statistical analysis to stratify endometrial decidualization by BMI. RESULTS: The fold change in gene expression of markers of endometrial decidualization prolactin and IGFBP1 exhibit a statistically significant decrease in obese patients as compared to lean. Recent studies suggest that endometrial disturbances in PCOS patients are distinct from those in obese women. Here, we are presenting data that confirms that obesity alone perturbs endometrial receptivity.CONCLUSIONS:By controlling the in vitro hormonal environment and measuring markers of endometrial decidualization we found that obese women have endometrial stromal cells that have reduced ability to undergo normal decidualization.Cigarette Smoking AffectsUterine Receptivity.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking is known to have negative reproductive consequences. Smokers undergoing IVF cycles have a lower implantation rate than non-smokers after adjusting for embryos quality. This suggests that altered uterine receptiveness may be a factor in infertile smoker women.",

Emily C Holden, Banafsheh N Kashani, Andrea Wojtczuk, Sara Morelli, Laura T Goldsmith. Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, USA. INTRODUCTION: Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) is an important angiogenic, proliferative and chemotactic factor produced by human endometrial stromal cells. Prior studies have shown inconsistent expression patterns in endometrial tissue during the menstrual cycle. Thus, understanding of the regulation of endometrial CXCL12 expression requires reproducible in vitro studies. Several laboratories have reported that levels of CXCL12 in medium from cultured endometrial stromal cells are undetectable. However, these studies have generally used relatively short incubation time periods. Our prior data suggest that CXCL12 levels from cultured endometrial cells are fairly abundant after extended culture time periods. We tested the hypothesis that endometrial stromal CXCL12 expression increases with time of incubation, independent of cell differentiation. METHODS: A well characterized line of immortalized human endometrial stromal cells was used. In each experiment, replicate wells of cells, plated at 1 x 10 5 cells per well in 24 well tissue culture plates, were incubated in phenol red-free medium supplemented with stripped serum, for various time periods up to 16 days. At the end of each incubation time period, cell morphology was assessed under phase contrast microscopy, cell numbers in each well were determined and CXCL12 levels in conditioned medium from each well were measured using a human CXCL12 specific ELISA. Medium levels of CXCL12 at each time point are expressed normalized to cell number. Increased production of endometrial stromal CXCL12 during extended duration of culture is independent of cell differentiation and associated with increased cell proliferation. These findings suggest autocrine regulation of endometrial stromal CXCL12 expression.Does Insulin Resistance Correlate with Changes in the EndometrialTranscriptome by the Endometrial Receptivity Array?

INTRODUCTION:Turner syndrome (TS) is due to partial or complete loss of the second sex chromosome and affects 1 in 2500 live-born females. Half of TS females have a 45,X karyotype, while the remainder demonstrate mosaicism or structural abnormalities of the second sex chromosome. In TS, normal ovarian development occurs in the fetus, but accelerated follicular atresia leads to gonadal dysgenesis and infertility. Our objective is to analyze single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays for three apparently non-mosaic fertile TS females to determine if low level mosaicism or copy number variations (CNV) may contribute to preserved fertility. METHODS: Five women were identified as non-mosaic TS with 200 cell peripheral blood karyotype with spontaneous pregnancy through the National Institutes of Health. Three underwent OmniExpressExome_ v1.2-A SNP Array and analysis with CNVPartition v3.2 (Illumina) and Nexus Copy Number v.7.5 (Biodiscovery) to evaluate for low-level mosaicism or microdeletions/duplications that may explain preserved fertility. RESULTS: No occult mosaicism was detected on Log R ratio or B allele plot. In total, 32 deletions and 14 duplications were found. There were no CNVs involving genes known to cause premature ovarian insufficiency (catalogued in the Clinical Genomic Database, http://research.nhgri.nih. gov/CGD/). One 56-kilobase deletion was detected on the X chromosome, involving the intronic portion of DMD. No other sex chromosome CNVs were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Mosaicism in peripheral blood was not detected in this small case series of women with monosomy X and preserved fertility. Additionally, microduplication of the X chromosome was not present. CNVs detected were not disease causing and unlikely to contribute to fertility protection. The presence of mosaicism in other tissues, such as the ovaries, cannot be excluded.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate if hepatitis C is associated with abnormally elevated maternal serum bile acids and abnormal fetal cardiac function measured by the left ventricular Tei index. We hypothesize that hepatic liver disease manifested by elevated bile acids will have abnormally elevated fetal left ventricular Tei indices. Hepatic liver disease manifested by elevated hepatitis C viral load or elevated bile acids did not effect the left ventricular Tei index. Further studies are needed in order to be able to predict fetal deterioration in those with liver disease during pregnancy.

RESULTS: After exclusion criteria, we identified 229 women who received ARV during the study period. There was no significant difference in the rate of obstetric complications or mode of delivery. There was a comparable distribution according to BMI intervals. Women with BMI >40 had a greater initial VL compared to the other groups, but there was no difference in the final VL before delivery among groups.CONCLUSIONS: BMI does not impair the rate of HIV VL clearance during pregnancy in women receiving ARV.

CONCLUSIONS: Increased UBF and UI are observed in early pregnancy in women with history of EPL. We observed no differences in peripheral vasculature as reflected by MAP and PWV. This suggests a history of pregnancy, even of short duration, may prime the uterine vasculature for an amplified response to future pregnancy. Increased response also contributes to systemic effects, observable in LP, evidenced by increased PV, MAP, and CO in women with a history of EPL. Increased PV has previously been associated with improved pregnancy outcomes. Taken together, these findings indicate that EPL, while common and poorly understood, may result in enhanced hemodynamic response to future pregnancy.Omental Artery Relaxations to CGRP Family Peptides are Greater in Women with Twins Compared to Singleton Pregnancy.

Molly B Moravek, 1 Angela K Lawson, 2 Rafael Confino, 2 Kristin N Smith, 2 Ralph R Kazer, 2 Susan C Klock, 2 Mary Ellen Pavone. 2 1 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; 2 Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION: Initiating in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles in fertility preservation (FP) patients regardless of menstrual cycle phase, a \"randomstart\" (RS) protocol, has been proposed in order to decrease the time to cancer treatment, but has not been thoroughly studied. We hypothesized that RS protocols would have the same cycle outcome as conventional, cycle-specific (CS) protocols, and would decrease the time from fertility preservation consultation to initiation of cancer treatment. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients undergoing IVF for FP at Northwestern University from 2006-2012. Outcomes from RS protocols compared to CS protocols, including days of stimulation, peak estradiol levels, total oocytes retrieved, mature oocytes, and days between fertility preservation referral and beginning cancer treatment (surgery or chemotherapy), were analyzed using student's t-test. RESULTS: A total of 95 FP patients were included, with 14 in the RS group and 81 in CS group. Mean age was 31 years in both groups. RS protocols resulted in significantly higher peak estradiol levels than in CS protocols (1744 vs 1434 pcg/mL, p<0.01), but there was no significant difference in number of oocytes retrieved (13 vs 12), mature oocytes (11 vs 9), or days of stimulation (11 days in both groups). There was also no difference in the number of days from initial patient consultation to commencement of cancer treatment (44 vs 45 days). CONCLUSIONS: RS cycles result in similar oocyte yield as CS cycles in FP patients, and it is unnecessary to await menses to initiate stimulation. Interestingly, RS protocols may not significantly shorten the time from fertility preservation referral to initiation of cancer treatment, as previously proposed, suggesting there may be other factors resulting in delay.A Highly Specific Molecular Bioimaging Approach for Diagnosis of Human Uterine Leiomyosarcoma. Mostafa K Khater, 1 Shahinaz M Shalaby, 1,2 Ayman A Al-Hendy. 1 1 Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA; 2 Tanta Medical School, Tanta, Egypt. INTRODUCTION: Uterine Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a highly aggressive malignant tumor developing in the uterine smooth muscle. LMS is associated with poor prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates (2-9%).FDA recently estimated that 1:352 women undergoing a surgery for benign leiomyomas may have unsuspected sarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma can't be pre-operatively diagnosed with sufficient certainty & accuracy. No LMS specific imaging characteristics are available, nor reliable biomarkers. The FDA discouraged the use of power morcellation for hysterectomy & myomectomy in women with a uterine mass,for the potential risk of disseminatiing occult uterine cancers;highlighting the need for better diagnostics for LMS.",

Nicole M Fletcher, 1 Jimmy Belotte, 1 Mohammed G Saed, 1 Mohammed S Abusamaan, 1 Michael P Diamond, 2 Ghassan M Saed. 1 1 Wayne State Univeristy, Detroit, MI, USA; 2 Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Despite significant advances in surgery, radiation therapy, and anticancer treatment, chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle to improving ovarian cancer patient outcome. The genetic component of ovarian cancer risk may be attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that result in point mutations in the gene, and altered protein function. We hypothesized that treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells with clinically approved chemotherapeutic drugs could induce a genotype switch in key antioxidant enzymes altering their activity. METHODS: DNA from human EOC cell lines (MDAH-2774 and SKOV-3) and their cisplatin or taxotere chemoresistant counterparts was evaluated by TaqMan\u00ae SNP Genotype analysis for SNPs rs1001179 (catalase (CAT)), rs1002149 (glutathione reductase (GSR)), rs3448 (glutathione peroxidase (GPX1)), and rs4880 (superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)) utilizing the QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System. Corresponding enzymatic activity and mRNA levels were determined utilizing both ELISAs and real-time RT-PCR. Data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows with independent sample t-tests for sensitive EOC cells as compared to their chemoresistant counterparts. Statistical significance of p<0.05 is considered significant for all analyses. RESULTS: There was no SNP for CAT, GSR, or MnSOD in either chemosensitive EOC cell line. Interestingly, the GPX1 SNP was present in both chemosensitive EOC cell lines. Upon the acquisition of chemoresistance to taxotere or cisplatin, there was a SNP in MnSOD in both cell lines. Additionally, the GPX1 SNP present in sensitive EOC cells was switched to the normal GPX1 genotype in chemoresistant EOC cells. There was no SNP present in either GSR or CAT in both chemoresistant EOC cell lines. The mRNA levels of GPX1 and CAT were significantly increased while GSR and SOD3 were significantly decreased in chemoresistant as compared to chemosensitive EOC cells (p<0.05). The activity of GPX, GSR and SOD were significantly decreased while the activity of CAT was significantly increased in chemoresistant as compared to chemosensitive EOC cells (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure of EOC cells to chemotherapy leads to a genotype switch in key antioxidant enzymes, which may serve as a mechanism of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.MicroRNA let-7c Contributes to Acquired Resistance to Paclitaxel inEndometrial Serous Carcinoma. Izumi Sato, 1 Yoh Watanabe, 1 Fumihiko Suzuki, 1 Satoru Nagase, 2 Nobuo Yaegashi. 1 1 Tohoku University Hospital, Sendai, Japan; 2 Yamagata University Hospital, Yamagata, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Endometrial serous carcinoma (ESC) is a rare phenotype of endometrial carcinoma known for the poorest prognosis in gynecological cancers. One of the reasons of miserable clinical course of ESC is acquired chemo-resistance, because there are few choices of chemo-agent. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance from the aspect of microRNA (miRNA). METHODS: ESC cell line USPC1 and paclitaxel (PTX) resistant cell line (USPC1/PTX-R) derived in our laboratory were used. Expression of let-7c was examined by qRT-PCR in drug resistant cells and compared with their parental cell. Alteration of drug-resistance was analyzed after let-7c precursor transfection. Moreover we searched for the possible target of let-7c including HMGA2, Bcl-xl and other candidate.RESULTS:The expression of let-7c was decreased in USPC1/PTX-R. After let-7c precursor transfection to USPC1/PTX-R, the decreased resistance for PTX was observed compared with negative control. CONCLUSIONS: Let-7c contributes acquired resistance to PTX in ESC.Transferrin in Follicular FluidCan Facilitate DNA Double-Strand Breaks to Fallopian Tube Epithelium: Possible Involvement of Transferrin in the Carcinogenesis of High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer. Shogo Shigeta, 1 Masafumi Toyoshima, 1 Kazuyuki Kitatani, 2 Masumi Ishibashi, 1 Toshinori Usui, 2 Junko Minato, 1 Nobuo Yaegashi. 1 Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan; 2 Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) is a candidate for the origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer(HGSOC). DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-DSBs) is considered to be involved in the carcinogenic change at FTE. Iron ion is known to catalyzes a Fenton reaction resulting in inducing oxidative stress. Focusing on the transferrin as an iron ion transporter, we have reported that transferrin-transferrin receptor 1 axis facilitated DNA-DSBs to the cells in vitro at the previous meeting. Further,",

New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: Human amniotic fluid contains a heterogeneous population of cells that carry surface markers and transcription factors resembling embryonic cells and can induce to all germ layers. We investigated effects of valproic acid (VPA), a known teratogen, on amniotic fluid cells (AFC) in culture. METHODS: Amniotic fluid was collected between 16-23 wks by amniocentesis from 3 individuals. Two groups were studied: 1)control grown in DeCoppi medium and 2)treatment group supplemented with VPA. AFC were characterized by morphology, multiplication and FACS for expression of embryonic markers CD-90, TRA-1-60, and SSEA4. AFC were grown as 3D spheroids with/without VPA for differentiation capacity to osteogenic, chondrogenic and neural lineage and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. RNA was extracted (RNeasy MiniRNA Kit Quiagen,CA), PCR was performed and compared with differential gene expression using Affymetrix probes, DAVID and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: VPA addition in vitro did not affect cell morphology but slowed proliferation. VPA treated samples displayed significant increase in apoptosis with increased TRA-1-60 and SSEA-4 and decreased CD-90 compared to untreated controls. Differentiation varied among VPA exposed samples, with overall inhibition of neural lineage measured by expression of Nestin, Tubulin, and GFAP. IPA was consistent with downregulation of neural development pathways in VPA treated samples with significant variation in gene expression from controls. VPA treatment caused upregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis pathways and downregulation of cell membrane pathways related to neural differentiation. There was variable upregulation of bone and cartilage differentiation with VPA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Valproic acid exhibits selective effects on AFC in vitro. Inhibition of neural lineage and preservation of osteogenic and chondrocyte lines resembles in vivo effects of VPA exposure such as neonatal frontal bossing and neural tube defects. This AFC model may serve as a surrogate for study of mechanisms for deleterious effects that medications may have on the developing human fetus. *Figure(s) will be available online.Egg from Ovarian-Derived Stem Cells Develops into Embryo AfterIntracytoplasmic Sperm Injection. Solji Park, Jaclyn Yu, Kaitlin Marquis, Alan H DeCherney, Erin F Wolff. NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Historically, germ cell development was believed to occur only during fetal development. Once the maximum number of oocytes is reached in the fetal stage, this number decreases until depletion at menopause. This is in contrast to men who possess germ line stem cells that create sperm throughout their lives.However, recently several labs have shown the existence of cells in the ovarian cortex capable of mitosis and meiosis in mouse, rat, and human models. Our lab has shown that these ovarian-derived stem cells (OSCs) are also present in a non-human primates (NHP).METHODS:The objective of this study is to test fertilization potential of oocytes derived from OSCs transplantation in non-human primates. To obtain OSC, the ovarian cortex was digested with collagenase and DNase followed by FACS with the DDX4 antibody. The cells were expanded in culture, transfected with a GFP lentivirus, and transplanted into the remaining ovary of the monkey. Following transplantation, gonadotropins are used for ovarian hyperstimulation to isolate oocytes. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) was performed with collected MII oocytes and fertilization and embryo development potential assessed. Resultant embryos were analyzed by PCR and nested-PCR to identify lentiviral labeling indicating OSC derivation. RESULTS: OSCs were autologous or allo-transplanted into four monkeys. Each monkey received 1.28-2.1 million cells that were GFP+ via a 27 gauge tuberculin syringe. One out of 11 oocytes obtained by follicular aspiration were confirmed OSCs origin, whereas 32 out of 71 from microdissection. Following ICSI, a mature oocyte originating from OSCs developed into 64-cells stage embryo. OSC derivation was confirmed with nested PCR for the GFP. CONCLUSIONS: Orthotopic OSC transplantation in healthy non-human primates results in mature oocyte formation which can be fertilized and develop to the early blastocyst stage. This is the first fertilized embryo derived from stem cells to achieve fertilization in primates. However, most OSC derived oocytes appear to arrest in the ovarian tissue after transplantation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the determinants and timeline of follicular development of OSC derived oocytes after orthotopic transplantation.Co-Culture of Endometrium-Derived Stem Cells with Murine NeonatalCardiomyocytes to Support Differentiation into Cardiomyocyte-Like Cells In Vitro. Demetra H Hufnagel, Levent Mutlu, Hugh S Taylor. Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. CVDs result in permanent damage to cardiomyocytes, which ultimately may lead to loss of heart function. Human clinical trials for CVD treatment have shown that injection of mesenchymal stem cells can improve cardiac function. Endometriumderived stem cells (EDSCs) may provide a new and less invasive source of cardiomyocyte-like cells. METHODS: Hearts from neonatal dsRed mice were digested to single cell suspensions before being plated on gelatin-coated 6-well plates.",

During the 2nd step, these cells show lower fusion index and higher hCG secretion in T21-hPSC-derived trophoblast. Furthermore, Activin A treatment rescued the fusion defect in T21-hPSC-derived CTB, without changing hCG secretion. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that, similar to primary T21 trophoblast, T21-hPSC-derived trophoblast have cell fusion defects which can rescue by exogenous Activin A. Our results confirm that BMP4-treated hPSC can be used to model trophoblast differentiation defect. Our goal is to generate iPSCs from placental cells from both normal and complicated pregnancies to establish in vitro models of placental disorders.Umbilical Cord Blood Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy Restores Ovarian Functions in a Preclinical Model of Chemotherapy InducedPremature Ovarian Failure.

INTRODUCTION: This work is to determine efficacy of Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) in restorative functioning of chemotherapy-damaged ovaries in mice which will serve as a prelude to assess utility of preserving fertility with adult stem cells among cancer survivors for treatment of patients with idiopathic premature ovarian failure. METHODS: Acclimatized 4-6 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice (N=6/group) were randomly assigned to vehicle treated control group (group1), sham chemotherapy group (group2), or cell therapy group (group3). Group 2 & 3 received single intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/ kg Cyclophosamide and 12 mg/kg Busulfan to induce ovarian failure. Seven days post injection, mice in groups 1 and 2 were subjected to bilateral intra-ovarian injection of 10 ul phosphate buffered saline through abdominal laparotomy. Group 3 received 10 ul of UCMSCs suspension (5X10 5 cells) in each ovary . RESULTS: Post UCMSC implantation, group3 showed detectable estroidogeneic changes in vaginal smears as early as 1 week . Significant increases in total body weight as well as ovaries and other estrogendependent organs (uterus & liver) were observed in group 3 (P<0.05) as early as 2 weeks post cell implantation . Hemotoxylin and Eosin evaluation of the ovaries demonstrated significant increases in total number of follicles in group3 as compared to group 2 (P<0.05) after 2 weeks post cell implantation (1 st time point). Group 3 demonstrated a serum hormonal profile of restored ovarian function compared to group 2: group 3 FSH serum levels showed significant decrease of 40 % \u00b1 5 (P <0.05) compared to group 2, AMH serum levels increased by 50 %\u00b1 2 (P<0.05) in group 3 versus group 2. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated higher expression of AMH, FSHR, Inhibin\u03b1 and Inhibin\u03b2 in growing follicles in group 3 versus group 2. Breeding experiments to evaluate effect of this treatment on fertility is ongoing in our laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that intra-ovarian injected UCMSCs were able to restore ovarian hormone production, reactivate folliculogenesis in chemotherapy-damaged ovaries in this preclinical model. This approach carries high promise to women with chemotherapyinduced, and potentially other types of, premature ovarian failure.Fertile Lifespan Characteristics and All-Cause and Cause-SpecificMortality: A Study of Postmenopausal Women from the Rotterdam Study. Loes Jaspers, 1 Nicole Erler, 1,2 Albert Hofman, 1 Joop SE Laven, 3 Maryam Kavousi, 1 Oscar H Franco. 1 1 Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 2 Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands; 3 Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands.INTRODUCTION: Considering demographic changes in reproductive choices and their relevance for longevity, we characterized the relation between established and novel characteristics of the fertile life with allcause and cause-specific mortality (ACM and CSM). METHODS: Analyses included 4076 women (mean age 69.1 years) from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Using cox models, the effect of women's fertile lifespan (age at menopause -menarche), number of children, maternal age at first and last child, maternal lifespan (maternal age at first -last child), and post-maternal fertile lifespan (age of menopause -age at last child) on ACM and CSM were assessed. The potential (non)-linearity of the effect was evaluated with p-splines, and the interaction of these variables with age and number of children was tested.RESULTS: 2754 women died during 14.8 years of follow-up. Each 1 year increase in age at first and last birth was linearly associated with a significantly lower hazard of dying of any cause in age and time since menopause adjusted models [hazard ratio HR, (95% confidence interval CI): 0.99 (0.98-1.00), for both variables], whereas a 1 year longer maternal, fertile, and post-maternal fertile lifespan was significantly associated with higher hazards or dying of any cause [HR (95%CI): 1.01 (1.00-1.02), 1.02 (1.00-1.04), 1.01 (1.00-1.02), respectively]. None except fertile lifespan remained significant in fully adjusted models. Furthermore, we found that women bearing 1 child and bearing it >35 years had a lower hazard of dying [HR (95% CI): 0.61 (0.46-0.82)] compared to women bearing at \u226434 years, whereas no effects were found in women bearing > 1 child. This association might be explained by the higher socio-economic status of these women. Findings differed with regard to direction, size and significance when stratifying for CVD and cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found associations between fertile lifespan characteristics and mortality. To broaden our understanding of the effect of changing fertility patterns on mortality, more research is needed in contemporary cohorts with larger sample sizes and more extreme ages of birth.Maternal Morbidity Associated with Postpartum Hemorrhage After Vaginal Delivery at Low, Moderate, and High Volume Hospitals.Alexander M Friedman, Cande V Ananth, Audrey A Merriam, Zainab Siddiq, Mary E D'Alton, Jason D Wright. Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine risk for postpartum hemorrhage and associated major morbidity for women undergoing vaginal delivery in hospitals with different obstetrical volumes. METHODS: Women who experienced postpartum hemorrhage following vaginal delivery from 2006 to 2012 were identified in a large administrative database (Premier). Hospitals were characterized based on annualized volume: low (<1,000 deliveries per year), moderate (1,000-<2,000), and high volume (\u22652000). The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage was calculated for each hospital volume category. Risk for severe maternal morbidity and/or death associated with postpartum hemorrhage was determined. RESULTS: Of 4,067,694 women who had a vaginal delivery, 103,474 women (2.54%) experienced hemorrhage. At low volume hospitals, the rate of hemorrhage was 2.47% compared to 2.58% and 2.55% at moderate and high volume hospitals. Rates of severe morbidity are presented in the table in terms of incidence per 1,000 cases of hemorrhage. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was the most common form of severe morbidity, occurring in 6.2%, 7.3%, and 8.4% of cases of hemorrhage at low, moderate, and high volume hospitals respectively. Other commonly encountered morbidity included acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and shock. CONCLUSIONS: Hemorrhage after vaginal delivery is relatively common obstetric complication that occurs with similar frequency across obstetrical centers. Given the morbidity associated with postpartum hemorrhage, and that it occurs with similar frequency even at low volume hospitals, all centers providing care should be prepared to manage this complication. *Figure(s) will be available online.Sustainable Cervical Cancer Prevention Clinics Using the World Health Organization \"See and Treat\" Method: A Five CountryExperience. Stephen A Morris, 1 Jacquelyn T Dang, 1 Jennifer Lang, 1 Patricia Gordon, 1 Caroline C Nitschmann. 1,2 1 Cure Cervical Cancer, Los Angeles, CA, USA; 2 Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide.CureCervicalCancer (CCC), a 501(c) (3) nonprofit organization, is dedicated to cervical cancer prevention in resource poor nations. Clinics are sustained by utilizing local recourses and training native healthcare providers in the 'See and Treat' method as described by the World Health Organization (WHO). We sought to describe our experience of five international clinics. METHODS: Patients screened and treated for precancerous lesions at sustainable CCC clinics were retrospectively identified from March 2013 to August 2015. Clinic locations included Vietnam, Haiti, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Guatemala for a total of 46 clinics in all five countries. Per the WHO method, patients were screened by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). If patients screened positive they were offered treatment with cryotherapy by carbon dioxide (CO2) or nitrous oxide (N2O). Local healthcare provider training was offered to doctors, midwives, and nurses. Intensive education was presented in the native language in both visual and written forms in addition to hands on training. Continued education and support was provided for each clinic in exchange for ongoing screening and creation of reliable patient registries. RESULTS: A total of 34,759 patients were screened in the five countries identified. There were 4,010 (11.5%) patients found to be VIA positive, of which 2,994 (8.6%) received cryotherapy treatment. Of the patients who screened VIA positive, there were 1,016 patients (2.9%) that did not receive cryotherapy treatment because of refusal or equipment failure. As a result of local training, a total of 256 healthcare providers were considered proficient in \"See and Treat\". CCC maintains constant communication with the clinics. Data from ongoing screening is reported electronically on a monthly basis and includes the number of women screened with VIA, how many test positive or negative, and the number of women that received cryotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate 'See and Treat' is a feasible approach to the early detection and treatment of precancerous cervical lesions in different developing countries. The unique CCC organizational model demonstrates it is possible to maintain sustainable clinics in through ongoing education and support.Twin Pregnancy in theSetting of Advanced Maternal Age: Risk of Prematurity, Neonatal Morbidity, and Stillbirth. Amelia A McLennan, Cande V Ananth, Jason D Wright, Zainab Siddiq, Mary E D'Alton, Alexander M Friedman. Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION:The objective of this study was to evaluate risk of preterm delivery, neonatal morbidity, and stillbirth in twin pregnancies in the setting of advanced maternal age. METHODS: This population-based study of U.S. natality records from 2005-2013 evaluated neonatal outcomes for twin pregnancies based on maternal age. Women delivering at age 18-34, 35 to 39, and >39 were compared. Only twin pregnancies that resulted in a live birth at > 24 weeks gestation or a stillbirth at \u226520 weeks were included. For each maternal age category, risk was determined for the following conditions: assisted ventilation for >6 hours, NICU admission, antibiotic administration for suspected neonatal sepsis, surfactant use, neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction, Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes, and stillbirth. RESULTS: Of 785,888 live twin births, 601,710 were to women age 18-34, 137,602 were to women age 35-39, and 46,576 were to women 40 or older. 8855 stillbirths were included in the analysis. Risk for stillbirth was significantly lower for both groups of older mothers compared to mothers age 18-34, as was risk for preterm birth at age <32 weeks gestation",

Amelia A McLennan, Cande V Ananth, Jason D Wright, Zainab Siddiq, Mary E D'Alton, Alexander M Friedman. Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate mode of delivery and risk for obstetric conditions such as gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension/preeclampsia for twin pregnancies based on maternal age. METHODS: This population-based study of U.S. natality records from 2005-2013 evaluated maternal outcomes for twin pregnancies in women by maternal age. Women aged 18-34, 35 to 39, and >39 were compared where delivery occurred after 24 weeks gestation. Only twin pregnancies that delivered at \u2265 24 weeks gestation were included. For each maternal age category, risk was determined for gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension/preeclampsia. Mode of delivery was also determined. RESULTS: 785,888 twin births were included in the analysis: 601,710 to women age 18-34, 137,602 in women age 35-39, and 46,576 to women over 40. Risk of gestational hypertension was significantly higher only in mothers over 40 (RR 1.45, 95%CI 1.42-1.49) compared to women age 18-34. Risk of gestational diabetes was increased among both 34-39year-olds (RR 1.58, 95%CI 1.55-1.62) and age greater than 39 (RR 1.83, 95%CI 1.78-1.88). Women with twin pregnancies over age 39 were most likely to undergo cesarean delivery (84.5%) compared with those age 18-34 (74%) and 34-39 (79%) (p<.0001). There were fewer vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries in both groups over 35, and no difference between the groups in rates of forceps-assisted vaginal delivery CONCLUSIONS: Twin pregnancies in women over age 35 are associated with higher rates of gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and cesarean section compared to women age 18-34, and are the highest in women over age 40. *Figure(s) will be available online.Association Between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Preterm Birth: A Case-Control Study inChongqing, China. Barbara SE Verstraeten, 1,2 Ping Xu, 3 Kelly Ma, 4 Xing Cheng Qi, 3 Hongbo Qi, 3 David M Olson. 1,5 1 U of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; 2 Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; 3 Chongqing Medical University, Chonqing, China; 4 U of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; 5 U of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Preterm birth(PTB)is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. One of the possible contributors to PTB is chronic maternal stress. We previously conducted a case-control study in Edmonton, AB, Canada, using the Wellbeing and Pregnancy Questionnaire. We showed that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in a mother's life are associated with increasing PTB risk. We report on a similar study performed in Chongqing, China in order to evaluate the questionnaire's effectiveness in a different population. METHODS: Subjects were recruited at hospitals in the Chongqing area. Cases were mothers with a spontaneous singleton PTB (<37w) without preterm premature rupture of membranes. Controls included mothers with an uncomplicated singleton birth >38 weeks and without a history of PTB. Sociodemographic and medical data were collected. The Wellbeing and Pregnancy Questionnaire, evaluating chronic life-long stressors was administered postpartum. A combined childhood and adult abuse score was calculated from the ACE score and the Abuse Assessment Screen (ASS). 20 cases and 75 controls were included. Uni-and multivariate logistic regression were performed, p<0.05. Odds ratios for spontaneous PTB and 95% CIs are reported. RESULTS: Maternal age and educational status differed significantly between cases and controls. Cases were younger (OR 0.874; 95% CI 0.78-0.99), had a lower level of education (p<0.001) and annual income (p<0.001). The ACE score and ASS were significantly associated with sPTB in univariate analyses (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.08-3.71; OR 13.06, 95% CI 1.28-133.38) as was the combined childhood and adult abuse score (OR 5.89, 95% CI 1.92-18.01), but not in multivariate. History of \u22651 ACE was also linked with sPTB (OR 6.00, 95%CI 1.95-18.44). CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study in Chongqing showed similar results to our larger study in Edmonton with small differences in sociodemographic variables between the study populations. Even in this small Chinese cohort, the ACE score, ASS and childhood and adult abuse score were associated with sPTB, suggesting that the association between ACEs and sPTB might be common between ethnic groups, and that this questionnaire may be part of a predictive algorithm for sPTB.Factors Associated with Gastroschisis in the UnitedStates, 2005-2013. Alexander M Friedman, Cande V Ananth, Zainab Siddiq, Mary E D'Alton, Jason D Wright. Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study evaluating live births in the United States from 2005 to 2013 was to provide up-to-date epidemiology on risk factors associated with gastroschisis. METHODS: This population-based study of US natality records from 2005-2013 evaluated pregnancies complicated by gastroschisis.The primary outcome was the presence or absence of gastroschisis. Obstetrical, medical, and demographic characteristics were evaluated. Multivariable log-linear regression models were developed to determine factors associated with the anomaly. RESULTS: 7,683 pregnancies with gastroschisis and 24,829,094 pregnancies without the anomaly were included. The overall incidence was 3.1 cases per 10,000 pregnancies and ranged from 2.9 to 3.2 during the study period. 74.0% of cases were diagnosed in women younger than 25. The risk ratio (RR) in the adjusted model for age <20 was 3.46 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.19-3.75). Other factors included smoking (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.51-1.72), being unmarried (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.57-1.77), and high school graduation as highest educational attainment (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23-1.59). Factors associated with lower risk for gastroschisis included African American race (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.41-0.48), chronic hypertension (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.84), and body mass index (BMI): Compared to normal weight women, the RR for overweight women was 0.70 (95%CI 0.65-0.77); for obesity with BMI 30.0-34.9 the RR was 0.49 (95% CI 0.43-0.56); for obesity with BMI \u226540 the RR was 0.26 (95% CI 0.19-0.36). CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of reduced risk with obesity suggests a potential metabolic etiology for gastroschisis. Given the morbidity associated with gastroschisis and that the etiology is unknown, further research into the protective role of obesity is warranted. While several reports have suggested increasing prevalence of gastroschisis, our results did not demonstrate this temporal trend.Stillbirth and Neonatal Adverse Outcomes in PregnanciesComplicated by Chronic Hypertension. Alexander M Friedman, Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, Jason D Wright, Zainab Siddiq, Mary E D'Alton, Cande V Ananth. Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk for stillbirth and adverse neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension at or nearing term. METHODS: This population-based study of U.S. natality records from 2005-2013 evaluated neonatal outcomes and cumulative risk for stillbirth for pregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension delivering at \u226536 weeks gestational age. Only singleton, non-anomalous pregnancies without diabetes and/or preeclampsia/gestational hypertension were included. For delivery at each week of gestation, risk was determined for a composite adverse neonatal outcome that included the following conditions: assisted ventilation for >6 hours, NICU admission, antibiotic administration for suspected neonatal sepsis, surfactant use, neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction, and/or Apgar score <7 at 5 minutes. Multivariable log-linear regression models were developed to create an adjusted model for the composite neonatal outcome. Cumulative risk of stillbirth was calculated from 36 weeks until the gestational age at delivery. RESULTS: 201,740 live births and 878 stillbirths were included in the analysis. The risk for the adverse neonatal outcome was highest with delivery at 36 to <37 weeks(18.9%), lowest with delivery at 39 to <40 weeks age (6.1%), and increased after 40 weeks gestational age (p<0.001)",

INTRODUCTION:Birth by Caesarean section(CS) may affect psychological development through changes in gut microbiota or stress response. Our objective was to assess the impact of mode of delivery, specifically birth by CS on the development of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder(ADHD), using data from the Swedish national registers. METHODS: Mode of delivery included: unassisted vaginal delivery(VD), assisted VD, elective CS or emergency CS. ADHD was determined using International Classification of Diseases version 10(F90 or F98.8), or prescription for ADHD medication. The study cohort included all singleton live births in Sweden from 1990-2008. We used Cox regression for data analysis in the total cohort, adjusting for perinatal and socio-demographic factors. We then stratified our Cox regression analysis by maternal ID to assess the association among sibling matches. RESULTS: There 1,722,548 children in our cohort, and 47,778 cases of ADHD(2.8%). 1,241,366 families were included in the sibling-matched analysis including 6,976 families discordant on both mode of delivery and ADHD. When compared to unassisted VD, there was little evidence of an association between assisted VD and ADHD in the total cohort(HR=1.02; [95%CI:0.98-1.06]) or sibling-matched(HR=1.05; [95%CI:0.93-1.18]) analyses. For elective CS, the HR was 1.15(95% CI:1.11-1.20) in the total cohort, and 1.05(95%CI:0.93-1.18) with sibling-matched analysis. For emergency CS, the HR was 1.16(95%CI:1.12-1.20) in the total cohort and 1.13(95%CI:1.01-1.26) with the sibling-matched analyses.",

INTRODUCTION: Our study objective was to provide national birth weight (BW) references for gestational age and gender for twin and triplet pregnancies. METHODS: Twin and triplet live births between 22-41 weeks were abstracted from the 2004-2013 Natality Public Use files from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for the United States (n=1,346,477 for twins and n= 54,235 for triplets). The gestational age at delivery (GAD) is generated through NCHS algorithms. GAD, computed based on LMP, obstetric estimated gestation age, infant BW and plurality, was used for calculating percentiles of BW at each gestational week for male and female infants separately. The mean, standard deviation, and percentiles (3rd, 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, 95th, and 97th) of BW were calculated for gestational age and gender. Histograms of all twin and triplet BW were used to describe the overall BW distribution. Analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Twin male BW percentiles were higher than female BW percentiles except for 24 and 25 weeks. Twin growth plateaus and decreases at 38 weeks. The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of twin BW born at 38 weeks were 2319g, 2834g, and 3320g in males compared to 2231g, 2720g, and 3185g in females. Nine percent of twins remain undelivered after 38 weeks. Triplet male BW percentiles were higher than female BW percentiles except for 22 and 23 weeks. Triplet growth continues to increase until 35-36 weeks. The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of BW born at the 36th gestational week were 1758g, 2296g, and 2760g for male triplets, compared to 1616g, 2183g, and 2608g in female triplets. BW appears to decrease in triplets that remain undelivered after 36 weeks. Thirty-six percent of triplets remained undelivered after 36 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying delivery until after 38 weeks in twins and after 36 weeks for triplets does not improve birth weight. These updated BW references may be an alternative to using singleton BW charts in twins and triplets in clinical practice and research.Intergenerational Risk of Breech Presentation.

INTRODUCTION:Previously we showed that presence of intraamniotic \"sludge\" (IAS), an ultrasound (US) finding of hyperechoic matter in amniotic fluid (AF) close to internal os, did not change pregnancy outcome in asymptomatic patients (pts) undergoing high cerclage for sonographycally short cervix (Cx). We aim to find if addition of 22 patients (pts) to previously reported 46 changes the result.METHODS:A case records of 68 consecutive pts, who underwent high MacDonald cerclage betweent 16-24 6/7 weeks (wks) gestation for a short Cx (<25 mm), from 2007-2015 were evaluated. Pre-cerclage transvaginal US images were reviewed for Cx length, funneling and presence or absence of IAS. All procedures were performed or supervised by single operator (FB). Baseline morphalogical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between those with and without IAS. RESULTS: 36/68 pts had IAS present, 32 did not.

Xueya Qian, Pin Li, Robert E Garfield, Shao-Qing Shi, Huishu Liu. GuangzhouWomen and Children's Medical Center,  Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.  INTRODUCTION:  The aim was to record and characterize EMG signals from the uterus and abdominal muscles during the 1 st and 2 nd stages of labor and define relationships to contractions. METHODS: Nulliparous patients without any treatments were used (n = 63, 30 during 1 st stage, 33 during 2 nd stage). EMG of uterine and abdominal muscles was simultaneously recorded from electrodes placed on patients' abdominal surface using PowerLab hardware and LabChart software (ADInstruments, New South Wales, Australia) with filters to separate uterine (low frequency) and abdominal (high frequency) EMG. Contractions of uterine muscles were also recorded using tocodynamometry connected to the PowerLab. RESULTS: During the 1 st stage of labor, when abdominal EMG is absent, uterine EMG bursts temporally correspond to contractions. In the 2 nd stage uterine EMG bursts usually occur at same frequency as groups of abdominal bursts and precede abdominal bursts, while abdominal EMG bursts (not uterine EMG) correspond to contractions and are accompanied by feelings of \"urge to push\" by the patients.Table showsparameters of uterine and abdominal EMG bursts at different stages (mean values \u00b1 SEM). There are significant differences (P<0.01) between uterine EMG during 1st stage vs. 2nd stage of labor and uterine vs. abdominal EMG. CONCLUSIONS: 1). Uterine and abdominal EMG accurately reflect electrical activity of the muscles during labor and are valuable to assess progress and effort. 2). During 1 st stage of labor uterine EMG is responsible for contractions and during 2 nd stage uterine and abdominal muscle both participate in labor. 3). Electrical signals from the uterus and abdominal muscle change during the progression of labor. 4). Uterine EMG influences abdominal muscle EMG initially through a CNS reflex that contributes to the impulse to \"push\" and voluntarily-induced contractions.The Effect of Infertility Treatment on Term Maternal/Neonatal Outcomes and Optimal Timing for Delivery in Conception-AssistedSingleton \"Premium Pregnancies\".

Laura Meints, 1 David Akers. 2 1 University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA; 2 University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA. INTRODUCTION:Little is known about the effect of type of conception on pregnancy outcomes. We aim to quantify perinatal risks associated with type of conception in twin gestations. METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate 17-OH progesterone (17-OHP) in twin gestations to prevent preterm birth (PTB). Exposure was type of conception: spontaneous, ovulation stimulation (OS), in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI), and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Primary outcome was gestational age at delivery (EGA). Secondary outcomes were indication for delivery, mode of delivery, birthweight, gestational diabetes (GDM), preeclampsia, markers of neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality. We performed univariate and multivariable linear regression with generalized estimating equations to determine the potential association between primary outcome and BMI. Results were considered statistically significant if p<.05. RESULTS: There were 1316 women included in the analysis: 855 with spontaneous conceptions, 118 with OS, 311 with IVF/ICSI, and 32 with IUI. Women by type of conception were significantly different in age, race, BMI, tobacco use, chorionicity, parity, previous PTB, marital status, and receipt of 17-OHP. In the univariate analyses, there was a statistical difference in EGA (p=.0003) by type of conception. In univariate analyses, statistically significant differences were also seen by type of conception in mean birthweight (p=.0003), indication for delivery (p<.0001), GDM (p=.017), and preeclampsia (p<.0001). In adjusted models, none of these relationships remained statistically significant. No significant differences were seen in measures of neonatal morbidity or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This data shows no increased risk for maternal or neonatal morbidity in twin gestations by type of conception.Factors Associated with Longer Duration of Pregnancy After OpenFetal Myelomeningocele Repair.

CONCLUSIONS: Operative time, gestational age at repair, myelomeningocele repair time, and location of hysterotomy did not influence the duration of pregnancy following open prenatal myelomeningocele repair. Only a change in cervical length postoperatively correlated with earlier delivery. Pre-and post-operative measurement of cervical length may identify a subset of patients requiring more intensive surveillance following open myelomeningocele repair.Impact of Increased Parity in the Success of Vaginal Birth After Cesarean Section (VBAC). Katherine Apostolakis-Kyrus, 1 Ginikachukwu B Ikwuezunma, 1 Chibbi Iwelu, 1 Christine J Secrest, 2 Luis M Gomez. 1 1 The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA; 2 Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA. INTRODUCTION: To determine if an increased number of vaginal deliveries increases VBAC success.METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study that reviewed 233 singleton cases of attempted trial of labor after cesarean section (TOLAC) from 2007 to 2010. The primary outcome was successful vaginal birth after cesarean section. We stratified patients by parity, body mass index, race, and age. Statistical analysis was done using commercially available software. Continuous variables were analyzed using the Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. A p-value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between women who had a previous spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) versus no prior vaginal delivery in their success of having a VBAC, p value < 0.001. Of the 233 TOLAC attempted, 175 (75%) cases were successful. Of 59 women who had one previous vaginal delivery, 45 (76%) had successful trials of labor compared to 96 women out of 109 (88%) women who had a history of multiple vaginal deliveries. In our cohort, the success of VBAC increased significantly when a patient had 3 or more vaginal deliveries (P=0.02, after adjusting for confounders). BMI >35 decreased the success of VBAC only for women older than 35 y-o who had 2 or less prior vaginal deliveries (P=0.04). White race was an independent successful prognostic factor for a successful VBAC (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, women with 3 or more previous vaginal deliveries have an increased rate of successful VBAC. Success of VBAC is greater in women of white race. BMI >35 may decrease the rate of success especially in women older than 35 y-o who had less than 3 prior vaginal deliveries.Revision of a Failed Cerclage Is Associated with Higher Risk of Premature Birth Compared to Primary Cerclage.

INTRODUCTION: Cerclage for cervical (Cx) insufficiency is a common procedure. However, there is operator variation in technique that may impact its effectiveness in improving pregnancy outcome. Previously we showed high success rate of cerclage performed on mid-trimester sonographycally short Cx. We aim to find if addition of 23 patients (pts) to our previously reported 54 pts would change the result. METHODS: We studied 77 consecutive pts with ultrasound (US) Cx length of <25 mm, at 16-24 6/7 weeks (wks) who underwent a high MacDonald cerclage from 2007-2015. High cerclage was defined as cerclage (mersilene tape) suture placement 5 cm above the external os, intracervical-Foley (balloon filled above the internal os). Amnioreduction (transabdominal amniocentesis) was used in pts with very short Cx (bulging membrane or 0-2 cm Cx length). All pts received pre-op antibiotics, pre, post-op indomethacin and regional anesthesia. All procedures performed or supervised by a the single operator (FB). Post-op Cx US were performed immediately and 2 wks post-op to evaluate Cx length and cerclage quality. RESULTS: 64 of 77 pts (83%) had amnioreduction. The distribution of pre and post-op Cx lengths were as follows: Preop Cx lengths: 23 pts (30%) >15 mm, 54 pts (70%) <15 mm, 29 pts (38%) <10 mm, and 18 pts (23%) <5 mm, (mean 11 mm, median 11 mm, range 0-25 mm). Post-op Cx lengths: in 39 pts (51%) were between 40-50 mm and in remaining 38 pts (44%) between 30-40 mm, (mean of 41 mm, median of 41, range 30-55 mm). 1 pt was lost to follow-up. Outcome in 76 pts: 4 pts (5.3%) delivered at <24 wks, 4 pts (5.3%) at 24-25 wks (%), 2 pts (2.6%) at 26-28 wks, 8 pts (10.5%) at 28-32 wks, 7 pts (9.2%) at 33-34 wks, 10 pts (13%) at 35-36 wks and 41 pts (54%) at >=37 weeks. In total 67% and 76% of deliveries occurred at >34 and >32 wks, respectively CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest reported group of high cerclages. Under appropriate condition and using the optimal technique, high cervical cerclage by an experienced operator in pts with sonographycally short Cx appears safe and is associated with excellent pregnancy outcomes.Antenatal Magnesiumsulphate for Neuroprotection ReducesPunctate White Matter Laesions at 30 Weeks MRI in the Human Neonate.

            "text": "). Punctate white matter lesions (PWML) were reduced at 30 weeks MRI (19,4% vs 45,2%, p value 0.002), but not at 40 weeks MRI. There was no increase in neonatal complications, including early intubation for respiratory insufficieny or hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Magnesiumsulphate does not increase neonatal side effects and is associated with less PWML at 30 weeks MRI. The clinical consequences need to be elucidated in long term followup.The data have to be interpreted with caution due to the retrospective character of the study.Suboptimal Antenatal Corticosteroid (ACS) Administration AmongWomen with Spontaneous Preterm Birth (PTB).

INTRODUCTION: ACS improve neonatal outcomes, but it can be difficult to know when to give ACS. We sought to examine ACS use by gestational age (GA), and to determine factors associated with use. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter study of spontaneous PTB. We included women w/non-anomalous singleton pregnancies delivering 23.0-33.9 wks. Women receiving ACS \u22652 days before delivery had a 'complete' ACS course. We examined the relationship between sociodemographic factors, pregnancy history, maternal medical co-morbidities, and foreboding PTB risk factors (short cervix, vaginal bleeding, +/-oligo w/out PPROM) and ACS use. RESULTS: 967 women met inclusion criteria. 114 (12%) received no ACS, 362 (37%) got a partial ACS course, and 491 (51%) got a complete course. Groups are compared by ACS course(Table). Neonatal ACS exposure varied by GA (p=0.002),Figure.In regression models, delivery GA (aOR for 23 weeks=0.39; aOR for 24-30 wks ranged 1.5-2.2, compared to delivery at 32-33 wks), PPROM (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.18), and foreboding PTB risk factors (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02-1.84) were associated with receiving a complete course of ACS. Other factors remaining in the model included maternal medical co-morbidities, white race, and clinical site. CONCLUSIONS: 51% of women with SPTB at 23-34 wks received a complete course of ACS prior to delivery. Decisions regarding ACS timing are complex, and may be influenced by GA, socioeconomic factors, & current pregnancy complications.Further Evidence That the Presence of \"Sludge\" Does Not Justify the Need for Amniocentesis to Rule Out Infection in Patients withSonographycally Short Cervix. Fereshteh Boozarjomehri, 1 Margaret Dziadosz, 2 Morgan M Peltier, 1 Fatima S Boozarjomehri, 3 Anthony M Vintzileos, 1 Ilan Timor-Tritch, 2 Frederick Naftolin. 2 1 Winthrop UnivHosp, Mineola, NY, USA; 2 New York Univ Sch Med, New York, NY, USA;  3  Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Previously we found that biomarkers for infection, rates of infection at time of cervical (Cx) cerclage and pregnancy outcomes were similar between patients (pts) with Intra-amniotic \"sludge\" (IAS), an ultrasound (US) finding of hyperechoic matter in the amniotic fluid (AF) close to internal os, and without IAS. We aim to find if addition of 23 pts to previously presented 41 pts changes the result. METHODS: Records from 64 consecutive pts who underwent MacDonald cerclage between 16-24 6/7 weeks (wks) for sonographycally short Cx (<25mm) from 2007-2015 were reviewed. Pre-cerclage transvaginal US images were evaluated to determine Cx length and presence or absence of IAS. AF was collected at time of cerclage (transabdominal amniocentesis) and evaluated for presence of infection by culture, Gram stain (GS), glucose (Glu), red (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) count. RESULTS: Cohort of 64 pts with AF studies prior to cervical cerclage were reviewed and results are in table 1. 43%) did not. All culture and GS results were negative. No differences between groups were detected with regard to Glu, RBC or WBC. Pregnancy outcomes were similar for gestational age at delivery, and rates of delivery at <24 <25, <28, <32, <34, and <37 wks. Base line Cx lengths were similar between groups. Cerclage occurred at slightly earlier GA and women were slightly older for IAS Group. CONCLUSIONS: IAS does not indicate presence of infection. In this series of pts with sonographycally short Cx, IAS was not associated with a difference in rate of premature delivery. The presence of IAS in asymptomatic pts with a short Cx at mid-trimester does not constitute an indication for an amniocentesis to rule out IA infection or increased risk for premature birth.",

MFMU, Bethesda, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Low cord blood fetal cortisol levels are associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). An inverse relationship is theorized between betamethasone (BMZ) and cortisone (CTZ) cord blood concentrations. However, the association of BMZ levels with respiratory morbidity (RM) is unknown. Our objective was to assess the relationship of fetal BMZ and CTZ with neonatal RM after late preterm (LP) exposure to BMZ or placebo. METHODS: We measured BMZ phosphate and CTZ levels in cord blood in an ancillary to the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids trial, a multicenter, double-blind randomized trial of BMZ versus placebo to decrease RM in infants of women at risk for LP delivery (34-36 weeks). Samples were aliquoted, frozen at -80\u00b0C, and analyzed in batches. We tested the association between CTZ levels and the adverse composite respiratory primary outcome of the parent trial: continuous positive airway pressure or high flow nasal cannula for \u22652 hrs, oxygen requirement with FiO2\u226530% for \u22654 hrs, mechanical ventilation or perinatal death, within 72 hrs of life. We also assessed RDS and transient tachypnea of the newborn in relation to CTZ levels and whether the relationship varied by BMZ level. A Z-test for interaction was used to assess variation by BMZ status. RESULTS: Of 385 women, 184 received placebo and 201 received BMZ. There was an inverse relationship between BMZ and CTZ levels which disappeared after adjusting for time from last dose. There was no association between BMZ level and RM in those exposed to BMZ. For every log unit increase in CTZ*, there was a significant decrease in RM in the placebo group, but not the BMZ group. Delivery mode did not modify this effect.*Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased fetal CTZ levels are related to adverse respiratory morbidity. Administration of BMZ mitigates these findings.Antenatal Glucocorticoid Administration Alters Cardiac Function in BaboonOffspring.

INTRODUCTION:Women threatening premature labor receive glucocorticoids (GC) to accelerate fetal lung maturation. While benefits are well documented, experimental animal studies show that long term effects on offspring remain a concern. In a nonhuman primate model shown to have altered phenotype following fetal GC exposure(Rodriguez  JS et al. Am J Obstetrics. 2011 204 545). We determined long term changes in cardiac function in offspring exposed to GC during fetal life. METHODS: We studied control (CTL, 5 Males, 10 y) and antenatal GC exposed (GC, 5 Males, 10 y) baboons. Maternal baboons received 2 days IM betamethasone (175 \u00b5g/kg/day) at 0.6, 0.65, and 0.7 gestation (GC) vs saline (CTL). Offspring cardiac MRI evaluation was performed to evaluate cardiac motion, including tissue tagging sequence for rotational analysis. Data analysed (Harmonic Phase Flow, Interactive and Augmented Modelling Group, UAB, Barcelona, Spain). Student's t test, *p < 0.05. RESULTS: Left ventricular rotation was less in GC vs. CTL in the latter half of systole, most pronounced at the midventricular level(Fig 1; end",

Intermountain Healthcare, Murray, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: The goal of FHR monitoring is to prevent hypoxic injury to the fetus. We sought to determine if the use of risk stratification at admission and FHR interpretation algorithms would result in earlier intervention (EI) in cases of fetal acidemia (pH<7.1). METHODS: Complete FHR tracings were reviewed. Cases and controls were randomly selected from term, singleton deliveries that occurred between 2010-2014 with arterial cord blood gas and \u22652 hours of FHR monitoring. Cases had pH <7.10 without an unpreventable cause of acidemia. Rules for intervention for two FHR interpretation systems (5 Tier (5T) and Clark) were developed. The Holmgren Risk Score (HRS) was applied 1 hr after admit to stratify patients as low risk (LR), moderate risk (MR), or high risk (HR) for pH <7.1. Modified rules for the 5T (M5T) and Clark (MC) algorithms were applied to MR and HR tracings (figure 1). No algorithm was applied to LR patients. Percent of cases identified for EI \u2265 30 min prior to their actual delivery time, false positive rate (FPR), number of additional cesarean deliveries (CD), and number of additional CD per case identified for EI were determined. *Figure(s) will be available online.

INTRODUCTION:We hypothesized that maternal genotype affects variable response to indo for SPTB tocolysis. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter study of SPTB. 46 women w/singleton pregnancies were classified as indo responders (RES) if delivery was \u22652 days after indo or non-responders (NRES) if delivery was w/in 2 days of indo rx. All women were exome sequenced. Sequence variation between RES and NRES was analyzed with the Variant Annotation, Analysis & Search Tool (VAAST) using a recessive inheritance model & locus heterogeneity. Genes scored by VAAST with p<0.05 were then analyzed using (a) Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) to assess for over-/ under-representation of gene sets and (b) Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to evaluate gene groupings & disease associations. Phenotype Driven Variant Ontological Re-Ranking Tool and GROUPER reclassified genes and evaluated for disease burden; both of these new VAAST algorithms used an established PTB candidate gene list (dbPTB). RESULTS: 29 indo RES were compared w/17 NRES. RES and N-RES had similar genetic ancestry. 755 genes identified by VAAST had p<0.05. PANTHER revealed a higher than expected # of genes in GO groups listed inTable 1after Bonferroni correction.DAVID and GROUPER results are in Tables 2&3. *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic analysis of maternal exome variation using multiple gene set algorithms identifies enrichment in several pathways & implicates new candidate genes, a first step in applying pharmacogenomics to threatened SPTB.First-Trimester Serum Concentrations of Secreted Frizzled-RelatedProtein 4 Are Increased in Women Who Develop Gestational Diabetes. Joost HN Schuitemaker, 1,2 Edwin van Bloois, 2 Jacqueline E Siljee, 3 Arie Franx, 4 Thomas IFH Cremers, 2,5 Wendy PH Koster. 4 1 University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands; 2 IQ Products BV, Groningen, Netherlands; 3 National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, Netherlands; 4 University Medical Center Utrecht, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; 5 University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. INTRODUCTION:Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a major health problem affecting 1-10% of all pregnancies. Risks related to adverse pregnancy outcomes or even possible health issues later in life might be reduced by early screening. We investigated whether secreted frizzledrelated protein 4 (sFRP4), recently identified to play a role in the regulation of glucose resistance, has prognostic value in the first trimester of pregnancy to determine the risk to develop GDM. METHODS: Samples used in this study were derived from women participating in the routine Dutch first-trimester Down syndrome screening between 2011 and 2012. For the current nested case-control study we selected 50 serum samples drawn between 10-12 weeks GA from women who developed GDM and 100 matched women with a healthy pregnancy. The concentration of sFRP4 was determined by ELISA (Pregnostic \u00ae -GDM, IQ Products bv, Groningen, The Netherlands).RESULTS:The median sFRP4 concentration in the GDM group was 91.2 ng/mL versus 93.0 ng/mL in the control group (p=0.0297). Analysis learned that a cut-off value of 130 ng/mL showed the highest OR (3.75; 95%CI 1.72 -8.18) and was indicated as the most optimal cut-off value.program, Centering was not associated with a significant difference in the risk of excess gestational weight gain compared to IPC. Future efforts should determine how to tailor and use group prenatal care to decrease rates of excess gestational weight gain.Gestational Weight Gain, BMI and Pregnancy Outcomes in Obese Pregnant Women in the UPBEAT Behavioural Intervention RCT.Annette Briley, Paul T Seed, Claire Singh, Nashita Patel, Lucilla Poston, UPBEAT Consortium. King's College London, London, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: The UPBEAT RCT (ISRCTN 89971375) evaluated a behavioural intervention in 1555 obese pregnant women (mean BMI 36.3 kg/m 2 ). The intervention led to reduced gestational weight gain (GWG) with no difference in primary maternal (gestational diabetes, GDM by IASPSG criteria), or infant (large for gestational age, LGA) outcomes 1 . The aim of this study is to determine (1) the effect of the intervention on GWG allowing for prepregnancy BMI and (2) association of GWG and key pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: Estimated GWG from pre-pregnancy to 34-36 weeks in the cohort by randomized group was assessed. RESULTS: The intervention did not affect the number of women in the recommended IOM range for GWG but led to an increase in women who lost weight(Table 1). The reduction in GWG was greatest for obesity category III (Interaction test: P=0.005) (Table 2). Table1: GWG in UPBEAT cohort",

Veronica T Boyle, 1,2 Eric B Thorstensen, 1 David Mourath, 3 M Beatrix Jones, 4 Lesley ME McCowan, 5 Louise C Kenny,6,7  Philip N Baker. 1,2 1 University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 2 University of Auckland,Auckland, New Zealand; 3 Linkoping University, Linkoping,  Sweden; 4 Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand; 5  University ofAuckland, Auckland, New Zealand; 6 University College Cork, Cork,  Ireland; 7 University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.  INTRODUCTION:  The main role of vitamin D is to ensure adequate calcium absorption but the nuclear receptor is found in many tissues including the placenta. Rates of Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency vary with location but affect 50-90% of pregnant women, thus it is important to understand possible effects on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our aim was to investigate whether serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in early pregnancy was associated with pregnancy complications. METHODS: Serum samples were collected at 15 weeks' gestation from women in Auckland, NZ who participated in the SCOPE study; a prospective pregnancy cohort of nulliparous women. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Pregnancy complications investigated were gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, spontaneous pre-term birth (SPTB) and small for gestational age (SGA). RESULTS: Samples from 1715 women were analysed. Mean total 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was 72.9nmol/L (SD 27.0). There was a wide range of concentrations (4.7-176.3 nmol/L). 53.7% of women were vitamin D insufficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D <75 nmol/L) and 18% were vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D <50 nmol/L). In logistic regression analysis a lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with GDM (p=0.03) but this relationship was not significant after correcting for body mass index, ethnicity and season of sampling (p = 0.6). 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not associated with development of preeclampsia (p= 0.2), SPTB (p=0.3) or SGA (p=0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at 15 weeks' was not associated with later development of GDM, preeclampsia, SPTB or SGA. 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were higher in this New Zealand nulliparous cohort than in many previous cohorts and the incidence of vitamin D deficiency was lower; this may in part explain weak or absent associations. controlled trials of women who were being induced and had modified Bishop scores of 4 or less (Miso-Obs-303 and 004). Subjects were divided into HTNsive disorders of pregnancy and no HTNsive disorder. RESULTS: A total of 1116 women were randomized to receive the DVI; 268 (24%) had HTNsive disorders of pregnancy. The median time to vaginal delivery was 1693 minutes (Q1, Q3: 1112.0, 2333.5) for women with HTNsive disorders of pregnancy and 1335 minutes (Q1, Q3: 861.5, 1847.5) for those with no HTNsive disorder (p<0.0001). The cesarean rate was 31% vs. 25.5% in women with HTNsive disorders of pregnancy and the no HTNsive disorder group, respectively. Data presented as (n)%, except as noted, Wilcoxon Rank Sum used for p value, *p<0.0001 CONCLUSIONS: Preeclampsia and other HTNsive disorders of pregnancy are important factors to consider when counseling patients regarding expectations for a successful labor induction. Our findings suggest that those with HTNsive disorders of pregnancy may have slower labor progress than those with no HTNsive disorder, thus consideration should be given to allow more time to achieve vaginal delivery. However, the benefits of a vaginal delivery should be balanced with the potential risks of prolonged labor in mothers with HTNsive disorders.Is Duration of Balloon Tamponade Associated with PostpartumHemorrhage Outcomes? Brett D Einerson, 1 Moeun Son, 2 Patrick Schneider, 2 Ian Fields, 2 Emily S Miller. 2 1 University of Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; 2 Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA. INTRODUCTION:The optimal duration of intrauterine balloon tamponade (IUBT) for the management of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is unknown. We sought to determine whether the duration of IUBT is associated with PPH outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of women with PPH from 2007-2014 who received IUBT. Women were excluded if the duration of IUBT was \u22642 hours or if hysterectomy was required prior to planned IUBT removal as these represented failures of IUBT. We compared the group of IUBT for 2-12 hours to the group of IUBT for >12 hours. Outcomes included endometritis, estimated blood loss (EBL) after balloon placement, blood transfusion, peripartum hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospital stay. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used. RESULTS: 274 women with PPH met inclusion criteria. Women with IUBT >12 hours were more likely to have undergone cesarean (57% vs. 38%, P=0.008), but other risk factors for PPH (maternal age, grand multiparity, placenta previa, induction/augmentation of labor, and chorioamnionitis) and EBL prior to IUBT placement did not differ between the groups. IUBT >12 hours was associated with a higher rate of endometritis (27% v. 15%, P=0.047), a higher rate of transfusion (74.4% v. 59.3%, P<0.028), and a longer mean hospital stay (3.7 days vs. 3.1 days, P=0.002). Other morbidities including EBL after balloon placement, UAE, hysterectomy, and ICU admission, were not different between the groups. After adjusting for potential confounding, the associations between IUBT >12 hours and endometritis, transfusion, and hospital stay were no longer present.CONCLUSIONS:There are no differences in clinical outcomes associated with IUBT duration beyond 12 hours compared to removal at or prior to 12 hours.Second Stage Length and Third and Fourth Degree LacerationsAmong Nulliparous Women.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Diagnosis of Morbidly Adherent Placenta: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Bradley D Holbrook, Nathan R Blue, Pranita A Nirgudkar, Ellen L Mozurkewich. University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA. INTRODUCTION: Placenta accreta, increta, and percreta, collectively known as morbidly adherent placenta (MAP), lead to significant maternal morbidity and mortality due to abnormal invasion of the chorionic villi into the myometrium. Its prevalence is increasing as the incidence of cesarean delivery rises. Both ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been employed to identify this condition prenatally. Our objective is to compare the test characteristics of US versus MRI in the diagnosis of morbidly adherent placenta. METHODS: We performed a search of the Medline, EMbase, and Cochrane databases using a variety of search terms and combinations. Search results were crosschecked against the reference list of a prior systematic review and other review articles germane to the topic to ensure completeness. We evaluated English language, full-text studies; these were included only if they included blinded interpretations of both US and MRI in each study patient, and if the diagnosis of MAP was confirmed by intraoperative or pathologic findings. We computed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of US and MRI. RESULTS: 520 studies were identified with our initial search; review of reference lists from other reviews added an additional 95 studies, for a total of 615. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and relevant titles were read in detail. Seven studies met criteria for inclusion, with a total of 276 patients. Sensitivities for US and MRI were 82.8% and 67.6%, specificities were 75.3% and 71.5%, PPVs were 76.1% and 70.9%, and NPVs were 88.9% and 76.4%, respectively(table 1).CONCLUSIONS:Both US and MRI are moderately sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of morbid adherent placenta. These two testsSaturday Postersappear essentially equivalent. Compared to US, MRI does not offer significant improvement in test characteristics to predict morbidly adherent placenta.Pregnancy Following Letrozole Treatment in Infertile Women with PCOS or Unexplained Infertility Has Low Risk of CongenitalAnomalies and Serious Adverse Events. Esther Eisenberg, 1 Michael P Diamond, 2 Richard S Legro, 3 Hao Huang, 4 Heping Zhang, 4 Reproductive Medicine Network. 1 1 Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD, Bethesda, MD, USA; 2 Augusta University, Augusta, GA, USA; 3 Penn State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA; 4 Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.INTRODUCTION: Prospectively collected data on pregnancy outcomes and risk of congenital anomalies in conceptions following exposure to medications for ovarian stimulation is sparce. Patients and clinicians need reliable information to aid in selecting appropriate treatment. Letrozole is approved for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and is used off label to stimulate ovulation in infertile women. Key issues for the use of letrozole are pregnancy outcomes and risk of teratogenicity. METHODS: We sought to identify adverse effects of ovarian stimulation with letrozole compared to clomiphene citrate (CC) or gonadotropins (Gn) on pregnancy outcomes in an observational cohort of infertile women who conceived in the PPCOSII and AMIGOS clinical trials conducted by the Reproductive Medicine Network. Data on pregnancy loss, pregnancy related complications and congenital anomalies were collected prospectively. Statistical analysis was with chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical data; for continuous data, Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test differences between two groups and Kruksal-Wallis test to test differences among groups of three or more. RESULTS: A total of 572 pregnancies were conceived with medical treatment: 232 with letrozole, 201 with CC, 139 with Gn, and 18 were conceived spontaneously. Baseline characteristics were comparable in all treatment groups. Outcomes of pregnancy loss, serious adverse events, antenatal and post-partum complication and congenital anomaly rates were comparable among the groups, though hyperemesis and mixed pregnancy (loss+live birth) were significantly increased in the Gn group, and gestational diabetes was significantly increased in pregnancies conceived with letrozole and CC. Congenital anomalies occurred in 3% of all deliveries with no difference among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian stimulation with letrozole is associated with comparable pregnancy outcomes as CC and similar low risk of congenital anomalies as other medications used for ovarian stimulation.Severe Maternal Morbidity and Associated Risk Factors During Delivery Hospitalization in Large Teaching Hospitals in the UnitedStates, Australia and England, 2007-2013. Heather S Lipkind, 1 Ellie B Turner, 2 Jess Collins, 2 Radek Bukowski, 1 Katherine Campbell. 1 1 Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; 2 Dr. Foster, London, United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: The Dr. Foster Global Comparators (GC) Project is an international hospital network created in 2011 as a global benchmarking collaborative.This study utilized the GC database to identify pregnancy complications and related risk factors that led to severe maternal morbidity (SMM) during delivery hospitalizations in large university based hospitals in the United States, Australia and England. METHODS: Data from delivery hospitalizations between the years 2007-2013 were identified using the GC database. We utilized hospitalizations with maternal diagnoses and procedures that indicated a possible life-threatening diagnosis or a life-saving procedure using published algorithms from the Center for Disease Control. The frequency of SMM was calculated for each country. Multivariable analysis was used to examine the association between SMM and patient characteristics within each country.RESULTS: From 2007-2013 there were a total of 606,813 deliveries including 54.5% from England, 30.8% from the US, and 14.7% from Australia. These deliveries came from eighteen hospitals. The overall SMM rate was 8.2 per 1000 deliveries; 15.6 in the US, 8.2 in Australia and 5.0 in England. Most women that were classified as having a severe morbidity had codes for DIC, renal failure, hysterectomy, maternal cardiac disease and eclampsia. For all countries advanced maternal age, hypertension, diabetes and substance abuse were significantly predictive of SMM with hypertension having the strongest association (aOR [95% CI]; US 4.56 [3.86-5.39], Australia 7.90 [3.18-19.67] and England 11.70 [5.76-23.78]). CONCLUSIONS: Severe maternal morbidity was identified in large hospitals in all three countries but the rates differed by country. The predictors of adverse outcomes were consistent regardless of location. Exploring the differences in facility and country based care could help modify practice and improve obstetrical outcomes.Effects of Body Mass Index on the In Vitro Fertilization Outcomes inPatients with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis.

INTRODUCTION:Bile acids are commonly used to diagnose and risk stratify ICP. We sought to compare neonatal outcomes by bile acid level. METHODS: Retrospective cohort of women suspected to have ICP with bile acid data. Women were stratified by maximum bile acid: <11 \u00b5mol/L (normal, no ICP), 11-40 \u00b5mol/L (mild ICP), 40-80 \u00b5mol/L (moderate ICP), and \u226580 \u00b5mol/L (severe ICP). Delivery gestational age, birth depression, and neonatal morbidity (any: HIE, NEC, BPD, IVH grade 3/4, death) were compared. For multiple gestations, the worst outcome was studied. RESULTS: 789 women were included. 327 had normal bile acids, 321 had mild, 91 had moderate, and 50 had severe elevation. Demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Additional clinical variables are shown in theTable.Rates of morbidity, birth depression, and delivery gestational age are shown in theFigure.There were 2 stillbirths, 1 in the mild and 1 in the moderate group. 189 women (24%) delivered preterm. In limited regression models controlling for gestational age, severe bile acid elevation remained associated with severe neonatal morbidity (aOR 5.7, 95% CI 1.2-26.5, p=0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Delivery gestational age was inversely related to bile acid elevation. Neonates delivered to women with severe bile acid elevation had higher rates of severe neonatal morbidity.Marijuana Use in Pregnant Teens Before and After Legalization.Christina E Rodriguez, 1 Jeanelle Sheeder, 1 Torri D Metz.1,2 1 University of Colorado, Aurora, CO, USA; 2 Denver Health Medical Center, Denver, CO, USA.

It's All About the Head (Circumference): Head Circumference vs. Birth Weight as a Risk Factor for Vacuum Extraction Failure. Doron Kabiri, Michal Lipschuetz, Sarah M Cohen, Oren Yagel, Lorinne Levitt, Shmuel Herzberg, Yossef Ezra, Simcha Yagel, Hagai Amsalem. Hadassah Hebrew Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel. INTRODUCTION:Vacuum extraction (VE) fails in 6-9% of trials; nulliparity, fetal macrosomia, and occipitoposterior presentation are among the reported risk factors for failed VE. We have previously shown that large fetal head circumference (HC) is an independent risk factor for vacuum delivery. The aim of this study was to determine whether large HC increased the risk of VE failure as compared to high fetal birth weight (BW). METHODS: This EMR-based study included all attempted VE performed in a tertiary center between January 2010 and December 2012. All term singleton live births were eligible. We assessed the risk of failed vacuum extraction in cases with HC\u226595 th centile (Large HC) vs. those with HC<95 th centile (Normal HC) and BW\u226595 th centile (Large BW) vs. those with BW<95 th centile (Normal BW). Other neonatal and maternal parameters were also evaluated as potential risk factors. Cases were divided into 4 groups according to HC and BW(Table 1). Multinomial multivariable regression provided adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for vacuum extraction failure while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: During the study period 24,800 deliveries met inclusion criteria, of which 1,834 had vacuum extraction attempt. We identified 117 cases of vacuum extraction failure, for failure rate of 6.4%. The aOR for vacuum extraction failure in cases of large HC was 2.61 (95% CI 1.58-4.30 P<0.001), while high BW was not significant. Primiparity and occipito-posterior presentation were also found to be significant risk factors for failed VE.CONCLUSIONS:Large HC is significantly associated with risk of failed VE, while high BW is not. In addition to known risk factors we propose that fetal HC measured in the last week before delivery may contribute to the decision whether or not to attempt vacuum extraction.Penetrating Trauma in Pregnancy. Meike Schuster, 1 A Dhanya Mackeen, 1 Michael J Paglia, 1 Natasha Becker. 2 1 Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, PA, USA; 2 Geisinger Wyoming-Valley, Wilkes-Barre, PA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Trauma accounts for 20% of maternal death, making it the leading non-obstetrical cause of death during pregnancy. In nonpregnant patients, admission systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90mmHg defines patients in shock; and this predicts worse outcomes. The same has not been validated in pregnancy. This study describes penetrating injuries in pregnant patients and examines patients with admission SBP < 90mmHg to determine if this predicts poor maternal and pregnancy outcomes.

Identifying mediators that may alter fetal response to anti-Ro may identify fetuses at risk of CHB and risk of demise. This study aimed to understand if the levels of immune mediators in women with CHB varied by ethnic group. METHODS: Soluble immune mediators (N= 32) (cytokines, chemokines, soluble receptors) were examined using validated multiplex bead-based (xMAP) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in serum from a cohort of 36 anti-Ro+ women with CHB complicated pregnancies. Autoantibodies were measured by Bio-Rad Bioplex ANA2200 and recombinant/native Ro60/52 proteins by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate regression compared levels between women with infants with CHB identifying as non-Hispanic white versus ethnic minorities. RESULTS: Levels of soluble mediators were examined in women identifying as non-hispanic white (n=28) versus other (n=8). Levels of 32 immune mediators between mothers (NH white versus all minorities) whose infants were affected by CHB were not significantly different.CONCLUSIONS:We found no evidence that that ethnicity affects results of soluble immune mediators. Further research to understand if demographic factors affect immune mediators, or predict the severity of CHB is warranted.",

INTRODUCTION:Distinction between fetuses who are growth restricted (FGR) from those who are not is vital. In this study we assessed whether cord blood levels of placental growth factor (PLGF) can serve as a tool to retrospectively identify fetal growth restriction.METHODS:This study was embedded in the Generation R study, a large prospective population based cohort study. Live singletons with data available concerning fetal growth and cord blood PLGF levels were included (n=3462). To adjust for gestational age PLGF multiple of the median (MoM) values were calculated. Using repeated measurements analyses growth curves of neonates with a PLGF MoM level <p10 were compared with neonates with a PLGF MoM level >p10. RESULTS: Median PLGF MoM level was 1.0 (3.2). Neonates with a PLGF MoM level <p10 (i.e. 0.67) showed a significantly different fetal growth pattern (p < 0.01) showing a deviation from the growth curve from approximately 30 weeks of gestation onwards. This resulted in a significantly lower birthweight of 0.58 SD (90% range 0.46-0.70, p<0.001) and an increased risk for a deviating growth curve of \u226530 percentiles ( OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.21-2.11, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood PLGF might be a promising biomarker in retrospectively determine fetal growth restriction.Impaired Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in Fetal GrowthRestriction Placenta.

INTRODUCTION: There are several rodent and sheep models of programming by developmental MO exposure. NHP data are needed for translation to early human growth. One NHP MO model, Japanese macaque is well documented [1-4]. To enable more study of this paradigm in NHP, we developed a baboon model of MO at Southwest National Regional Primate Center. NIH requires that resources developed on R24s be advertised as available for collaborations. We summarize the phenotype of our MO offspring. METHODS: Control (CTR) mothers ate standard baboon chow containing 12% energy fat, 0.29% glucose and 0.32% fructose, and energy content 3.07 kcal/g. HED diet contained 45% energy fat, 4.6% glucose, 5.6% fructose, and energy content 4.03 kcal/g. HF-HED baboons had free access to sugar containing Kool Aid.",

In 30 wk female soleus muscle (m) we measured area under the curve of peak force isometric contraction to electrical stimulation (PF AUC), and GLUT-4, insulin receptor (IR) and IRsubstrate-1 (IRS-1) mRNA by PCR. Analysis: ANOVA / linear regression. RESULTS: E16 dam [25(OH)D3] pl was higher in PRE HF compared to control (30.0\u00b14.6 vs. 63.0\u00b110.4 nmol/L, p<0.05). [25(OH)D3] pl was higher in 30 wk POST HF mice, regardless of PRE diet (p<0.01). Soleus m.GLUT-4 and IR mRNA levels were reduced in POST HF mice regardless of PRE diet (p<0.05). Lower soleus PF AUC was associated with lower [25(OH)D3] pl in C/C (B=3074, p<0.01, R 2 =0.80) and C/HF (trend) mice. But greater peak contractile force was associated with lower [25(OH)D3] pl in HF/C mice (B=-1287, p<0.05, R 2 =0.53), and no association in HF/HF mice. In HF/C mice, greater PF AUC was associated with greater IRS-1 mRNA levels (B=3.57Xe -5 , p<0.05, R 2 =0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced GLUT-4 and InsR mRNA in POST HF mice may mediate in part the glucose intolerance previously observed in this model. The altered relationship between [25(OH)D3] pl and muscle contractility in HF/C mice, and its abrogation in HF/HF mice suggests that early life high fat-high vitamin D diet has long term implications for vitamin D regulation of muscle contraction.Gerald Kerkut Charitable Trust S-154 Decreased Satellite Cell Proliferation Rates Contribute to Small Fibers in the Semitendinosus Muscle of Intrauterine Growth Restricted Lambs.

INTRODUCTION: Divergent mechanisms contribute to preterm birth and the associated adverse neurologic sequelae in offspring. In prior studies, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was shown to increase CD8 T cell infiltration in placenta. We sought to determine the mechanisms by which CD8 T cells contribute to perinatal brain injury by studying the effect of CD8 depletion on adverse neurologic outcomes. METHODS: To deplete CD8 T cells, 200 mg anti-CD8 antibody was administered to CD-1 dams intraperitoneally (IP) at E14 and E16. Dams were randomly assigned to five groups: saline (NS), LPS (25 mg intrauterine (IU), LPS + CD8 depletion (LPS+DEP), NS + CD8 deletion (NS+DEP), and no surgery (Control) (N = 4-6 dams per group). Flow cytometry of placenta and maternal serum, and histology (Nissl staining) of fetal/perinatal brain regions were performed. Preterm birth and neurodevelopment in offspring were assessed. Immune profiling of placentas was performed. RESULTS: While DEP did not prevent LPS-induced preterm birth (p>0.05), LPS+DEP significantly improved negative geotaxis neurobehavioral test performance over LPS exposure ( Figure; p<0.001). LPS+DEP significantly improved cortical neuronal density compared to LPS exposure (Table; p<0.05). CD8 depletion was confirmed by flow cytometry on maternal serum and placentas. We are monitoring cervical changes during pregnancy with shear wave elasticity methods. We previously reported that cervical ripening with misoprostol had considerably smaller effect on shear wave speed (SWS) in the rhesus macaque cervix vs the human. Our objective here was to determine if we could detect changes in viscoelasticity of the cervix by using a more robust SWS estimation method and accounting for microstructural differences between the macaque and human cervix. METHODS: Ultrasound SWS estimation was performed on ex vivo cervices of 13 misoprostol-ripened and 14 control (unripened) macaques undergoing necropsy for reasons unrelated to our study. SWS estimates were made along the cervix from the internal os to the transition zone between the distal end of the macaque cervix (bulbous with serpentine canal) and the proximal end (cylindrical with straight canal, like human). Cervical stiffness and viscosity were assessed with SWS and the slope of a linear model to the frequency dependence of the shear wave phase velocity vs. frequency, respectively. RESULTS: A gradual increase in SWS was observed along the cervix from the internal os to the transition zone. Average SWS in the ripened group (6.3m/s) was slower (indicating softer tissue) than in the unripened (7.4m/s). This difference of 1.1 m/s is similar to that observed in the S-093 In women with premature cervical shortening, cervical stretching starts at the internal os, which may be seen on ultrasound as a cervical funnel. We sought to construct patient-specific 3D finite element (FE) computer simulation models of the pregnant uterus and cervix to understand how anatomical and tissue mechanical factors influence cervical tissue stretch and shortening. METHODS: We generated FE models (FeBio 2.3.1) using a custom computer script (Trelis Pro 15.1.3) based on input parameters from transabdominal and transperineal ultrasound measurements (GE Voluson E8). For the baseline model, uterine diameter, uterine thickness, cervical length, cervical diameter, and cervical angle with anterior lower uterine segment (LUS) were measured for a 35 y/o normal P0 patient at 21 weeks (Fig.1A&B ). Cervical angle was ranged from 90 to 110 degrees from the anterior LUS ( Fig.1B-D) . The uterus and cervix were modeled as collagenous composite materials, and the fetal membrane as a nonlinear hyperelastic material. Intrauterine pressure was applied over the physiological range for 21 weeks (0 to 1 kPa), and the cervical stretch at the internal os was evaluated. RESULTS: The cervical angle of 90\u00b0 with respect to the anterior LUS has the lowest simulated stretch concentration at the cervix internal os. Maximum tissue stretch and percent surface area of cervix above a 10% stretch threshold both increase directly with cervical angle (Fig.1B-D) . *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical angle is a critical factor contributing to internal os tissue stretch. As cervical angle deviates from 90\u00b0 with respect to the anterior LUS, simulated cervical stretch increases. These results may explain how mechanical therapies such as a pessary change cervical angle and may contribute to the prevention of preterm birth. We therefore aimed to examine how labour-like cord occlusions with worsening acidemia alter BRS in dependence on preexistent hypoxia. METHODS: Near-term ovine fetuses were chronically instrumented with catheters, electrodes and inflatable cord occluders. Normoxic (N/UCO, N=9) and hypoxic (H/UCO, N=5) fetuses had average arterial O2Sat prior to UCOs of > or < than 55%, respectively. All animals were subjected to UCOs of 1 min duration every 2.5 min with increasing occlusion strength as repetitive mild (1 h), moderate (1 h), and severe (up to 2 h) UCO series or until fetal arterial pH was < 7.00. Blood pressure (BP) was continuously recorded and spontaneous BRS indices were calculated at baseline (60 min) and for each of the UCO series (20 min segments) (cf. doi: 10.1139/ y09-070). Results are presented as means \u00b1 SEM for p<0.05.",

Cesarean delivery for twins in which one fetus presented as breech peaked at 92.18% in 2010, falling slightly but significantly in the ensuing 3 years. Our data demonstrated that the decrease in the cesarean delivery rate to be exclusively due to fewer cesareans in non-Hispanic white patients (p<0.001).The rate of vaginal birth after cesarean in twin pregnancies remains under 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The recent decrease in the cesarean delivery rate in twin gestation was happened for the first time after three decades and appears to be largely attributable to a decline in cesareans among multiparous women and pregnancies complicated by breech presentation in non-Hispanic white women, and may reflect a health care disparity that deserves further research.",

Lauren Theilen, 1,2 Benjamin Horne, 3 M Sean Esplin. 1,2 1 University of Utah Health Science Center, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; 2 Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA; 3 Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Elevation in the red cell distribution width (RDW), a quantitative measure of anisocytosis, predicts increased mortality risk for a variety of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other chronic diseases in non-obstetric populations. We aim to determine whether an elevated RDW during pregnancy is associated with adverse obstetric outcomes. METHODS: We identified all women in a single healthcare system with a singleton delivery between 2005-2015 and >1 complete blood count drawn during pregnancy. We included the RDW drawn at 2 time points (T1 at < 20 weeks and T2 from 21 weeks through 1 week prior to delivery). Outcomes considered included hypertensive disease of pregnancy (HDP), preterm birth (PTB), mean gestational age at delivery (GAD), mode of delivery, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, maternal length of stay after delivery (mLOS), and neonatal length of stay after delivery (nLOS). The frequency of each outcome was reported as percent per RDW quartile. Odds ratios were calculated for the 4 th quartile compared to the 1 st quartile, and p-values were calculated for the trend across quartiles. RESULTS: We identified 139,425 women with an RDW at T1 and 54,297 women with an RDW at T2. The association of an increased RDW with obstetric outcomes is described in Table 1 . At both time points, increasing RDW was associated with an increased risk for HDP, cesarean, NICU admission, greater mLOS, and greater nLOS. Women with an elevated RDW at T2, but not at T1, had an increased incidence of preeclampsia and spontaneous PTB. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated RDW was associated with adverse obstetric outcomes, perhaps due to stress, inflammation, or hypoxemia during pregnancy. Further investigation of the predictive value of these findings is warranted. *Figure(s) will be available online.",

INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study evaluating pregnancies complicated by gastroschisis was to determine the proportion of women undergoing planned cesarean versus attempted vaginal delivery. METHODS: This population-based study of U.S. natality records from 2005-2013 evaluated pregnancies complicated by gastroschisis. Women were classified based on whether they attempted vaginal delivery or underwent planned cesarean. Obstetric, medical, and demographic characteristics were evaluated. Multivariable log-linear regression models were developed to determine factors associated with mode of delivery. RESULTS: Of 5,985 pregnancies with gastroschisis, 63.5% (n=3,800) attempted vaginal delivery and 36.5% (n=2,185) underwent planned cesarean delivery. The rate of attempted vaginal delivery increased from 59.7% in 2005 to 68.8% in 2013 (FIGURE) . Earlier gestational age and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with lower rates of attempted vaginal delivery. These factors retained significance in the adjusted log-linear model. CONCLUSIONS: Attempted vaginal delivery is becoming increasingly prevalent for women with a pregnancy complicated by gastroschisis. Recommendations from research literature findings may be diffusing into clinical practice. A significant proportion of women with this anomaly still deliver by planned cesarean suggesting further reduction of surgical delivery for this anomaly is possible. *Figure(s) will be available online. For most uncomplicated pregnancies in the United States, a healthcare visit 4 to 6 weeks postpartum is recommended to assess maternal health, and is an opportunity to promote wellness and establish preventive care. Although postpartum data are limited, there are concerns that compliance with postpartum visits may be suboptimal. We studied whether pregnancy and delivery factors such as prenatal care, severity of maternal and newborn conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics were related to the likelihood of not having a postpartum visit. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 64,952 women who completed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Phase 6 survey in 2009-2011 from 17 states and NYC that included a Yes/No question about receiving a maternal postpartum checkup. We calculated chi-square tests, t-tests, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using SAS software to study the association between maternal factors and lack of a postpartum visit. RESULTS: Compared to women who attended a postpartum visit, women who missed the visit were younger, more likely to be unmarried, less-educated, with lower income, without insurance, and smokers (all p<0.001). Newborn complications resulted in noncompliance with the postpartum visit, as mothers of preterm newborns (p<0.001) and newborns in the NICU at birth (p<0.001) were more likely to fail to attend a postpartum visit. Lack of other medical care was also related to noncompliance. Compared to women with adequate prenatal care, those with intermediate (RR: 1.79 (95% CI: 1.70-1.88)) or inadequate (RR: 2.71 (95% CI: 2.53-2.91) care were more likely to be noncompliant. Women who delivered at home and whose newborns were never hospitalized were more than twice as likely to not attend a postpartum visit (both CONCLUSIONS: We show here that a serum sFRP4 concentration higher than 130 ng/mL in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an almost four-fold higher risk to develop GDM later in pregnancy.",

INTRODUCTION: Betatrophin and WISP1 have recently been introduced as novel adipokines. They play a role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to compare serum levels of betatrophin and WISP1 in healthy non-pregnant women and pregnant women with gestational diabetes and normal glucose tolerance. METHODS: Circulating WISP1 and betatrophin were measured in 52 pregnant women with GDM (GDM group) and 60 body mass index matched pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (Non-GDM group) as well as 51 healty age matched non-pregnant women (Control group) by ELISA.RESULTS: WISP1 levels were significantly increased in patients with GDM compared to Non-GDM and Control groups (p<0.001). Similarly, betatrophin levels were increased in GDM group when compared to Non-GDM and Control groups (p<0.001). As well as, betatrophin levels were significantly higher in Non-GDM group than Control group (p<0.001)",

The UK Better Eating an Activity Trial (UPBEAT: ISCRTN 89971375) 1 randomized women to a dietary and physical activity intervention or standard antenatal care. In this cohort there was no association between gestational weight gain (GWG) and key adverse outcomes (gestational diabetes, cesarean section, pre-eclampsia) apart from birthweight (BW). We devised a novel method to estimate appropriate GWG based on BW centiles. METHODS: GWG from pre-pregnancy weight was estimated in control women. BW were converted to World Health Organisation (WHO) centiles, and to Z-scores. Linear regression was used to predict BW Z-scores from BMI class and GWG. As the centiles are based on a healthy normal population, a mean Z-score of 0 can be regarded as healthy. This also maximises the number of appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) neonates with BW within the 10 th and 90 th centiles. Appropriate GWG was calculated for for all women and for BMI obesity classes I (30-34.9 kg/m 2 ) II (35-39.9), and III (\u226540) by setting the expected average to 0; with Confidence Intervals by the delta method. RESULTS: Complete data was available for 566 women in the control arm. The mean BW Z-score was .0459\u00d7gestational weight gain -.208 (class I), -.201 (class II), -.129 (class III).

Women self-selected participation in Centering or IPC. Inclusion criteria were: age 18-45, singleton pregnancy with no fetal anomalies, lack of significant chronic medical problems, such as pre-gestational diabetes, enrollment in prenatal care by 20 weeks, and attendance at \u2265 5 prenatal visits of their chosen prenatal care type. Demographics, self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and body mass index (BMI), and maternal weight at the time of delivery were collected from the medical record. Excess gestational weight gain was defined by the 2009 Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines based on a woman's prepregnancy BMI. The student's t-test, chi-squared test, and multivariate linear and logistic regression were then performed, where appropriate. RESULTS: 2,998 women were included: 125 in Centering and 2,873 in IPC. The groups were similar with regard to maternal age (mean 33.0 years), race (50.8% Caucasian and 24.7% Asian), and pre-pregnancy BMI (23.8 mg/kg2) (p >0.05). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women who gained excess gestational weight between Centering and IPC (46.4 vs 43.3%, p=0.49). When controlling for confounding factors, such as maternal age, race, starting BMI, and gestational diabetes, there was no significant difference in the risk of gaining excess gestational weight (OR 0.92, CI 0.62-1.34) or in the mean amount of excess weight gained (9.8 vs 10.3 lbs, p =0.39) between Centering and IPC. CONCLUSIONS: Although self-empowerment and group discussion of nutrition, diet, and exercise are components of Centering's prenatal Increased lipogenesis results from transcriptional activation of many genes in the liver including ACC\u03b1,which catalyzes carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. In humans, the ACACA gene encodes ACC\u03b1. We hypothesized that upregulation of ACACA expression and fatty acid synthesis in the livers of fetuses of MO ewes would contribute to the previously reported increases in organ and tissue adiposity observed in these offspring. Objective: To determine if increased fetal liver ACC\u03b1 expression contributed to the increased adiposity of MO offspring, and investigate ACACA gene methylation changes as a potential contributor to expression changes.",

Of the T2DM risk variants previously reported, 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 36 candidates (Japanese minor allele frequency > 30%) were genotyped using DNAs from maternal peripheral blood samples. Logistic regression analyses were used to test between genetic variants and results of the 75g-OGTT, as well as genetic variants and the homeostasis model assessment as an index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or Insulinogenic Index (I.I.).",

During pregnancy in primates, CRH is produced by the placenta and released into the maternal and fetal compartments, where it is believed to play key roles in development and parturition. The objective of this study was to determine the association of pCRH with length of gestation and fetal growth. METHODS: 603 participants were recruited across 4 US sites. Maternal blood samples were obtained at two visits between 12-20 weeks and 32-35 weeks gestation. pCRH was measured by RIA in duplicate, averaged and log transformed. Change in pCRH between the first and second visits was calculated and adjusted for the time interval between visits. Birth outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. The associations of the natural log of pCRH with gestational length and fetal growth were assessed via multiple linear and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Median pCRH in the third trimester was 433.5 pg/ml with a range of 53.4 -7488.8 pg/ml and IQR of 458.0 pg/ml. Higher log pCRH during the third trimester was associated with shorter gestational length (\u03b2=-0.1804, p=0.0002) as well as small for gestational age at birth (OR 2.1 (1.3,3.2), p<.001) and preterm birth (OR 1.8 (1.1,3.1), p=0.031). For every 2 SD increase in log pCRH in the third trimester, gestational age decreases by 3.0 days. Similarly, the change in log pCRH from the second to third trimester also predicted shorter gestational length (\u03b2=-0.1747, p<.001) small for gestational age (OR 2.0 (1.3,3.0), p=0.002) and preterm birth (OR 1.8 (1.3,3.0), p=0.038). For every 2 SD increase in log pCRH from second to third trimester, gestational age decreases by 4.8 days.These relationships remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, race, education, income, and obstetric complications. pCRH in the second trimester alone was not associated with birth outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher pCRH during the third trimester of gestation and change in pCRH from second to third trimester is predictive of shorter gestation and small for gestational age birth. Future studies should examine how upstream factors, stress and inflammation, influence pCRH and risk for adverse birth outcomes",

Sections of the abdominal aorta were removed in varying stages of pregnancy. Aortic diameters were determined from paraffin-embedded cross-sections using Metamorph TM software. DNA and RNA were prepared by standard methods. Gene expression studies were performed by qPCR. Levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) were determined using a commercial ELISA kit (Zymo). Immunohistochemistry was performed using commercially obtained antibodies. RESULTS: Analysis of sections of abdominal aortas from 3 separate animals at each of several gestational timepoints, showed that the cross sectional area enlarges up to 4 fold by e15.5, indicating extensive expansive remodeling. RNA expression analysis and immunohistochemistry of Myh11 and Myocd, established markers of VSM differentiation, showed that both are downregulated 20-to 30-fold, consistent with dedifferentiation of the VSM from a contractile to a secretory phenotype. The expression of all three members of the Tet gene family were downregulated 10-to 30-fold as well. In keeping with the observed downregulation of Tet genes, genome-wide assessment of 5hmC and 5mC indicated that the level of both DNA modifications were altered by approximately 5%. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that pregnancy-related remodeling of the maternal aorta is likely to have an epigenetic basis. Future work will focus on how the elastic properties of the aorta are altered in pregnancy, and on how long the physiologic and epigenetic modifications endure in the postpartum period.

The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of pregnancy disorders among women with a history of stroke, and to compare stroke characteristics between women with and without a history of adverse pregnancy outcome. METHODS: Female participants of the multicenter Dutch Acute Stroke Study, conducted among patients admitted for acute ischemic cerebrovascular events between 2009-2013 were sent a structured followup questionnaire to collect data on reproductive health and pregnancy history. RESULTS: A questionnaire was sent to 464 living female patients, of whom 152 consented to participate (32.8%). Mean age was 63.2 years at admission for stroke and 67.7 years at follow-up. In total, 130 of the participants (85.5%) reported at least 1 pregnancy with a mean age at first pregnancy of 25.0 years.

On G22, caesarean section was performed and placentas collected and either frozen for protein analysis by ELISAs or fixed for histological analysis. RESULTS: Elevated uric acid levels at the end of gestation in rats dosedependently led to fetal growth restriction (FGR), with 45% of the pups presenting fetal weight below the 5 th centile of pups from vehicle-injected dams. Significantly elevated levels of IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa were found in placentas from uric acid exposed dams. Histological analysis revealed clusters of immune cells within the placental labyrinth of uric acid exposed rats, on the fetal side, even though gross placental morphology remained intact. These cell clusters were highly positive for the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b. Although immune cells were observed in LPS-exposed placentas, they were restricted primarily to the vessels and never formed the clusters observed following prenatal uric acid exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that elevated uric acid level during gestation is a strong inducer of placental inflammation in rats leading to FGR. This new model of non-infectious inflammation during pregnancy will be used to address the placental mechanisms involved in the negative impact of inflammation on the fetus and will allow to test new therapeutic strategies.",

Pre-term birth patterns are challenging to understand, e.g., it is unexpectedly prevalent among Black and Hispanic women of higher social classes. Pathways contributing to these patterns are not well understood, though inflammation could play a role. METHODS: Data are from a multisite prospective study of 593 pregnant women, from whom peripheral blood was drawn during the 2nd and 3 rd trimesters. RNA was extracted from leukocytes for qPCR of 19 proinflammatory transcripts, shown to be increased in response to stress. Demographics were gathered by patient report, and pregnancy risks via chart review. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed the RNA targets loaded on a single principal component. Thus, a composite inflammatory endpoint was examined by repeated-measures ANOVA, with trimester, race, and education as predictors. There was no across-the-board racial differences in inflammatory gene expression, but a significant 3-way interaction emerged (F = 2.17, p = .04.). Specifically, gene expression differed based on the mix of racial background and educational attainment. Among Whites (n=364), there were negligible educational differences in inflammatory gene expression, but among Blacks (n=95) and Latinas (n=113) there was a reverse gradient, such that as education increased, so did inflammatory gene expression. This gradient was most prominent in the 3rd trimester, when university-educated Blacks had composite values that were .25 standard deviation units higher than similarly educated Whites (and .40 units higher than high-school educated Blacks.) These patterns remained significant (F = 2.22, p = .04) even after adjusting for maternal age, parity, obstetric risk, gestational age at blood draw, and the relative proportion of monocytes vs. lymphocytes in the qpCR specimen. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that inflammatory activity is paradoxically increased in minority women with higher educational attainment. This reverse social gradient may reflect the physiological toll of social mobility, or the greater exposure to discrimination in mixed-race workplace settings.",

The control group (n=9) was injected intraperitoneally (ip) with TNFa dissolved in 0.5 mL PBS at T=0 and 50 \u00b5L polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 at T=1 and 7 h. The treatment group (n=8) was also injected ip with the same dose of TNFa and then injected with 50 mg/kg SphK inhibitor (SKI II) dissolved in PEG 400 at T=1 and 7 h. After injections at T=7 h, mice were continuously observed for time of delivery and number of pups dropped. Mice that did not deliver were observed until T=24 h. All mice were euthanized and necropsied to confirm pregnancy and the number of pups retained in utero was recorded. The retained placentas and uteri were harvested and stored at -80 \u00b0C or in 10% neutral buffered formalin at room temperature. RESULTS: Inhibition of SphK with SKI II significantly decreased the percent of TNFa-challenged timed pregnant mice delivering prematurely from 88.9% to 25.0%, (p < 0.05). SKI II also rescued pups from spontaneous abortion, reducing the percent pups prematurely dropped in the TNFa challenged mice from 18.9% to 8.3%. None of the 101 pups tracked in the study showed evidence of teratogenic effects and no toxic effects were observed in the dams. We now plan to examine the profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines in tissue lysates and sera from both groups to test whether SKI II acts by suppressing inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of sphingosine kinase may have broad applications in the management of inflammation induced preterm birth.",

            "text": "Maternal The effect of cortisol exposure on its cellular targets depends on both the amount produced and on the sensitivity of glucocorticoid receptors. Pregnancy produces a progressive increase in HPA axis activity, resulting in a period of relative hypercortisolism. However, there are no systematic studies to date that have examined variation in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity and its changes in gestation. The aims of the study were to quantify change in GR sensitivity from early to late gestation, and to characterize the maternal determinants of GR sensitivity across gestation. METHODS: GR sensitivity was assessed in 158 pregnant women at two time periods, 12-20'6 and 32-35'6 (second and third trimester), using an ex vivo stimulation assay. The inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL1b, TNF-\u03b1) by leukocytes after co-incubation with increasing levels of dexamethasone provided a marker of GR sensitivity. RESULTS: GR sensitivity diminished significantly with progression of pregnancy (F=5.216. p=0.009, see Figure 1 ). Both race and maternal BMI were independently associated with cytokine concentrations in the GR sensitivity assay. Overall production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly higher in Black women compared to women of other race/ethnicity (F=6.002. p=0.003). Maternal BMI was significantly associated with greater reduction of GR sensitivity in later pregnancy (F=7.082, p=0.003). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: The association of higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI with reduced GR sensitivity during pregnancy may represent a mechanism underlying differential susceptibility to the potentially detrimental effects of excess cortisol exposure on fetal development, birth outcomes, and subsequent child health. . Current clinical management proposes the use of a collagen plug (or amniopatch) to avoid the loss of amniotic fluid. To improve this poorly efficient mechanical strategy, vitamin A (as a well-known healing substance) could be proposed as an adjuvant of this plug to promote amniotic re-epithelization. The aim of this work was to test the pro-healing properties of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA, an active derivative of vitamin A) on primary amnion derived epithelial cells. METHODS: Twelve fetal membranes were collected at term after healthy pregnancies. Primary amniocytes, amnion and chorion explants were treated with atRA or its vehicle (DMSO) and used for transcriptomic analysis. The induction/repression of genes expression by atRA was firstly confirmed by RT-qPCR at 24h and also studied after 6, 12 and 48h. Protein accumulations were confirmed by immunocytochemistry. The effect of atRA on wound healing was tested by scratch-assay on primary amniocytes and then by proliferation and migration assay. These scratch assays were also realized using specific atRA induced gene inhibitors or siRNA.",

Functional RARE binding site DR5 type were localized by promotology study and the retinoic-induction of genes was confirmed at transcript and protein level. AtRA improves wound-healing of primary amniocytes by promoting cell migration but not proliferation, property strongly affected by the use of specific siRNA. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a pro-migratory effect of atRA on primary amniocytes, leading to a healing improvement of up to 80% in vitro. We demonstrate that these effects are mediated by the regulation of numerous genes acting in the dynamic and generation of the extracellular matrix. By providing new elements to understand how atRA exerts their pro-healing properties, this work proposes atRA as a promising candidate, in the pathophysiological context of pPROM. The relationship between short inter-pregnancy interval (SIPI) and preterm birth is well established, but the relationship between SIPI and short cervix has not been studied. Our objective was to determine if the relationship between inter-pregnancy interval (IPI) and preterm delivery (PTD) was related to cervical shortening. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study designed to assess the relationship between cervical length (CL) and PTD. Patients were included if they had one previous delivery, transvaginal cervical lengths obtained at 22-24 weeks and complete pregnancy outcome data available. We excluded nulliparous women, and patients with an indicated PTD, abruption, and intrauterine fetal demise. IPI was classified in years. The women were divided into two groups: Group 1 with an IPI of <1 year and Group 2 with an IPI of >1 year. The primary outcome was short cervix (CL< 2.5cm) at 24 weeks. The secondary outcome was the incidence of PTD <37 weeks. Bivariate analyses were performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and Student's t-test where appropriate. Logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders (age, pre pregnancy weight, smoking, and previous PTD), and the interaction between short cervix and IPI was examined in a regression model. RESULTS: There were 155 women in Group 1 and 328 women in Group 2. There was no difference in the incidence of short cervix by the length of inter-pregnancy interval (10.0 % in Group 1 and 12.9% in Group 2, p=0.35). Women with SIPI had a significantly shorter CL at 24 weeks when compared to women in Group 2 (33.6 mm vs. 35.5mm,p=0.03), but this association disappeared when adjusted for confounders (p=0.14).",

In term or preterm birth (PTB), cervical changes precede the onset of labor. Defining the molecular changes that drive cervical remodeling is necessary for risk detection and prematurity prevention. We have determined that LPS-mediated premature cervical ripening occurs by a distinct mechanism as compared to term ripening. While the mechanical integrity of the cervix is reduced in both term and LPS-mediated ripening, the structural reorganization of fibrillar collagen occurring in term does not occur in infection-mediated PTB. Despite low abundance relative to collagen fibers, elastic fibers also contribute to tissue mechanical function. The elastic fiber is comprised of elastin, microfibrillar and other associated proteins. In the current study we test the hypothesis that infection disrupts elastic fiber integrity to facilitate cervical compliance and induce PTB.",

Elastic fiber structure and morphology was visualized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and immunofluorescence staining for elastin (IF). Biomechanical testing of tissue recoverability to measure elastic fiber integrity was performed. Elastin abundance was assessed by Fastin Elastin assay. RESULTS: Elastic fiber ultrastructure (TEM) appears disrupted in cervices from d15LPS mice compared to d15 controls and d18. The biomechanical test for recoverability of d15LPS samples was significantly reduced compared to d15, indicating disrupted elastic fiber integrity. This measurement at term was not significantly different from d15. Assessment of the core component of the elastic fiber, elastin, indicates no significant change in extractable elastin abundance (Fastin assay) or morphology (IF) in d15LPS or d18 compared to d15 controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies structural (TEM) and functional (biomechanical) defects in elastic fibers in LPS-mediated premature ripening that are distinct from term ripening. These results motivate further studies to determine mechanisms that disrupt elastic fiber organization specifically in LPS-mediated premature cervical ripening. These findings provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms by which the cervical ECM can be reorganized to increase compliance and facilitate cervical opening. is a key transcription factor that modulates cell defense mechanisms against endogenous and exogenous stress.

We suggest, therefore, that pharmacologic activation of Nrf2 may prevent preterm premature rupture of the membranes associated with dysfunctional thrombin generation (during pregnancy (e.g., subchorionic hemorrhage or bleeding). PGE2 is the primary prostaglandin that mediates cervical ripening. Since inflammation and progesterone receptor (PR) function represent important pathways involved in both term and preterm labor, we investigated effects of PGE2, IL-1\u03b2, or both on human cervical stromal cells (hCSCs) and compared these responses to that of myometrial cells. METHODS: RT-qPCR and immunoblotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of highly differentiated primary hCSCs from nonpregnant and pregnant women. H3 and \u03b1-tubulin were used to normalize protein input. RESULTS: hCSCs were strikingly more responsive to the effects of IL-1\u03b2 (0.008 -1 ng/ml) on IL-8 than myometrial cells (15,000-compared with 500-fold, p < 0.01). Further, IL-1\u03b2-induced increases in COX-2 mRNA (>1000-fold, p <0.01) and protein (162-fold) were dramatically increased relative to IL-1\u03b2-induced changes in myometrial cells (55-fold and 40fold respectively, p < 0.01). PGE2 attenuated IL-1\u03b2-induced increases in COX-2 mRNA and protein (from 162-to 5-fold) despite the fact that IL-1\u03b2-induced nuclear translocation of p65 was not altered. Importantly, both IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 profoundly suppressed 15-PGDH (from 1.0 \u00b1 0.12 to 0.34 \u00b1 0.03 for Il-1\u03b2; to 0.11 \u00b1 0.01 RU/h36b4 for PGE2, p < 0.01) and the progestational transcription factor MiTF-CX (from 1.0 \u00b1 0.31 to 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 for IL-1\u03b2; to 0.07 \u00b1 0.03 RU/h36b4 for PGE2, p<0.01). Whereas IL-1\u03b2 decreased PR-A (2-fold) and -B (4-fold) in hCSCs, surprisingly, PGE2 increased nuclear PR-A 33-fold and PR-B 3.4-fold. IL-1\u03b2 suppressed PGE2-mediated induction of PR mRNA (from 6.7 \u00b1 0.9 to 3.0 \u00b1 0.31 R.U./h36B4, p <0.05) and protein (PR-A, 18-fold; PR-B, 1.6-fold) possibly through suppression of the cervical PGE2 receptor EP2 (63 \u00b1 3%, p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: hCSCs are extraordinarily sensitive to the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 increasing IL-8 and COX-2 and decreasing the progestational nuclear transcription factor MiTF-CX and 15-PGDH. IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 do not synergistically activate proinflammatory pathways in the cervix. Interestingly, whereas IL-1\u03b2 downregulates PRs, PGE2 increases PR in hCSCs with disproportionate increases in PR-A. Taken together, IL-1\u03b2 and PGE2 result in complex, but different, inflammatory and progestational transcription factor profiles in human cervical stromal cells.",

Atosiban had no effect upon spontaneous concentrations. Atosiban antagonized the effects of oxytocin upon the rate of contractions and peak tension with a dose dependent effect, although at lowest concentrations the effects were partly agonist. OBE001 was studied at equimolar concentrations (6, 60 and 600nM). OBE001 inhibited spontaneous contractions in a dose dependent way, affecting rate, contraction peak tension, and contraction duration and therefore having an overall effect upon total work.

CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the effect of Atosiban and OBE001 at equimolar concentrations, there was little difference at 6nM, but OBE001 was superior to Atosiban at 60nM and 600nM, and unlike Atosiban, totally inhibited contractility.

The objective of this study was to identify miRNA transcripts differentially expressed during myometrial contractions in term and preterm labor. METHODS: Myometrial specimens were collected from women undergoing cesarean delivery in the setting of: 1) spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) with clinical and/or histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA, n=5); 2) PTB without labor (PTNL, n=5); 3) term birth in absence of labor (TNL, n=5); and 4) spontaneous term labor (TL, n=5). MiRNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. After adaptor trimming, quality control, and mapping to the miRBase 21 database, statistical and pathway analyses were performed using a combination of bioinformatic tools. RESULTS: Relative to the non-laboring state, term labor was associated with differential expression of 40 mature miRNAs (FDR < 0.1), 16 of which increased in abundance. For these, 675 validated mRNA targets were identified. Up-regulated miRNA targets were enriched for transcripts mapping to interleukin-1 receptor, nuclear factor kappa-B, and MAP kinase signaling pathways, while targets of down-regulated miRNA were enriched for pathways relating to autophagy/senescence, DNA damage response, and NOTCH signaling. Only 7 miRNAs differed between the HCA and PTNL specimens, and the HCA specimens exhibited heterogeneous clustering among the TL and non-laboring miRNAomes ( Figure) . In both scenarios, labor was associated with increased expression of the immunomodulatory miRNAs miR-146b and miR-223. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mature miRNA expression signature associated with term labor in the human myometrium. A subset of these miRNAs was also differentially regulated during preterm labor, albeit with less consistency.

Saiprasad Ramnarayanan, 1 Pancharatnam Jeyasuria, 1,2 Jennifer C Condon. 1,2 1 Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA; 2 NICHD, Detroit, MI, USA. INTRODUCTION: The uterine endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERSR) regulates gestational length through increased non-apoptotic caspase 3 (CASP3) activation (1). There is growing evidence that pregnancy associated oxidative stress, which also acts as a regulator of ER stress plays an important role in the timing of labor (2). In other systems protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), an important activator of the ERSR, has been shown to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels through activation of an antioxidant signaling cascade, resulting in increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) and its downstream antioxidant target NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1). We examined the crosstalk between the ERSR and oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in the myometrial tissues from pregnant mice and women. METHODS: Telomerase immortalized human myometrial cells (hTERT-HM) were transfected with PERK siRNA and treated in the absence or presence of the ERSR inducer tunicamycin (TM) (5\u00b5g/ml). ROS levels were measured using dichlorofluorescein diacetate fluorescence assay. Western blotting and qPCR analysis were performed on human (GA 32-42) and mouse (E6-19) myometrial tissues to measure NRF2, NQO1 protein and mRNA levels. RESULTS: PERK knockdown in hTERT-HM cells revealed decreased activation of the antioxidant response in response to TM treatment. These events resulted in elevated ROS production and consequently increased apoptotic CASP3 activation. These data demonstrate that disabling the uterine myocyte ERSR impairs the local pro-survival anti-oxidant response. Uterine levels of pPERK, NRF2 and NQO1 in the human and mouse tissues increased in late gestation. CONCLUSIONS: The pregnant uterus experiences increasing amounts of oxidative stress towards term. Our in vitro analysis reveals that the uterine myocyte has the capacity to host an anti-oxidant signaling cascade in an ERSR dependent manner preventing oxidative stress induced cell damage and cell death. In vivo, it is critical to regulate the levels of oxidative stress to avoid cell damage signals that activate inflammatory responses that can lead to the onset of preterm birth. The myometrium goes through phases of differentiation during pregnancy to become a powerful contractile tissue at term. Small heat shock proteins (HSP) are a family of ten (HSPB1-B10) stress molecules that are versatile mediators of health and disease. Phosphorylated HSPB5 is reportedly involved in aiding actin filament dynamics and immune cell activation. Thus, it was hypothesized that HSPB5 would be highly expressed in the myometrium during the contractile and labour phases of myometrial differentiation when such processes are prominent. METHODS: Rat uterine tissue samples (n=4 per timepoint) were collected from non-pregnant rats, from day (d) 6, d12, d15, d17, d19, d21, d22, d23 (labour) of pregnancy, as well as 1-day post-partum (PP). Samples of gravid and non-gravid horns were also collected from unilaterally pregnant rats on d19 and d23 (n=4 each timepoint). The spatio-temporal",

For co-localization experiments, hTERT-human myometrial cells were cultured under standard conditions in supplemented DMEM/ F12 media. Cells were then immunostained for pSer59-HSPB5, CD63 and/or Kindlin-2 and analyzed by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: pSer59-HSPB5 protein detection was significantly increased from d19 through to PP (ANOVA, Neuman-Keuls, p<0.05). pSer59-HSPB5 was also readily detected in the cytoplasm and juxtamembrane regions of myometrial cells during late pregnancy and labour. In unilaterally pregnant rats, pSer59-HSPB5 protein expression was significantly elevated in gravid uterine horns at both d19 of gestation and d23 (labour) compared to non-gravid horns (t-tests, p<0.05). Confocal microscopy analysis of hTERT-HM cells also demonstrated that pSer59-HSPB5 co-localized with the exosomal marker CD63 as well as with the focal adhesion protein Kindlin-2 at the ends of actin filaments. CONCLUSIONS: pSer59-HSPB5 is highly expressed in myometrium during late pregnancy and labour and expression appears to be regulated by uterine distension. HSPB5 may be involved in regulating actin filament dynamics and could be secreted by exosomes as a prelude to involvement in immune activation in the myometrium. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific hypertensive disease. It is characterized by impaired placental angiogenesis and compromised uterine spiral artery remodeling, and has been considered to be an ischemic placental disease. AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury in a variety of organs. Thus, we hypothesized that compromised AMPK activity is involved in the development of preeclampsia. METHODS: Placental tissue was collected from 20 normotensive and 20 PE complicated nulliparous subjects, whom were admitted in the department of Obstetrics, the first affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University and chose non-labored caesarean delivery in the absence of other complications. mRNA was measured by q-PCR, protein expression was measured by WB, and the transwell assay was performed by the use of ACEA real-time cell analyzer. RESULTS: mRNA levels of AMPK\u03b11 and AMPK\u03b12, as determined by q-PCR did not identify any significant differences in placentas from term normal and preeclampsia pregnancies (n=4, AMPK\u03b11 transcript 1 p=0.08, AMPK\u03b11 transcript 2 p=0.28 and AMPK\u03b12 p=0.72), and there were no differences in protein expression as determined by Western blotting (n=18, p=0.39). However, AMPK phosphorylation increased 1.97 fold in preeclampsia placentas (vs. normal, n=18, p=0.01). Moreover, the phosphor-Akt level was decreased 41% in preeclampsia compared with normal placentas (n=7, p=0.01). HTR8 trophoblast cells were treated with specific AMPK agonist AICAR (2.47-200\u00b5M) or specific AMPK inhibitor Compound C (1.25-20\u00b5M) for 24 hours; real time cell analysis demonstrated that the migration of HTR8 cells was downregulated by AICAR but upregulated by Compound C in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: AMPK phosphorylation is increased in term preeclampsia placentas, indicating that preeclampsia is associated with enhanced AMPK activity. However, pharmacological inhibition of AMPK significantly enhanced HTR8 cell migration whilst a AMPK agonist inhibited cell migration. Paradoxically, some researchers have reported lower risk of pregnancy-related hypertension (PRH) among immigrants when compared to their non-immigrant counterparts. The lack of consistency and the absence of a synthesis of studies investigating the associations between immigration status and PRH represent a gap in our understanding of socio-ecological roots of PRH METHODS: A literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, CINHAL, Ovid, and Web of Knowledge bibliographic databases was conducted, covering studies that investigated the role of migrant status on PRH, published after January, 2000. Of the 310 papers identified, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. For each study, we computed relative risks that compared PRH risk in immigrants versus non-immigrants. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was used to generate a pooled relative risk estimate. One-way sensitivity analyses and an assessment of publication bias were conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen of the sixteen studies reported lower rates of PRH among immigrant populations (those born outside of the country of study), compared to non-immigrants *Figure(s) will be available online. The pooled estimate of the relative risk of PRH represented a statistically significantly lower risk among immigrants versus non-immigrants (RR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence indicates that immigrant populations, in general, have lower risk for PRH. Due to the methodological limitations of included studies, namely limited adjustment for confounders such as duration of immigration and other socio-behavioral factors, we recommend larger longitudinal studies with well-defined and operationalized measures of immigrant status, PRH, and reliable confounders. Preterm birth (PTB) accounts for 11.5% of total births. Inflammation accompanies most of the preterm labors which, in turn, leads to PTB We have provided evidence that activation of PPAR-\u03b3 via rosiglitazone prevents inflammation-induced PTB. Since macrophages participate in the pathophysiology of inflammation-related preterm labor, we aimed to determine whether rosiglitazone alter various pathways known to be involved in PPAR-\u03b3 signaling and PTB. METHODS: Pregnant mice (E16.5) were divided into 4 groups, and treated as outlined in Table1.0. The LPS+Rosi group received Rosiglitazone 6hrs after an LPS (lipopolysaccharide) injection. Two hours after injection, uterine and decidual tissues were collected. Next, macrophage isolation using (MACS) Magnetic cell sorting and F4/80+ antibody was performed. Expression levels of anti-oxidative factors and Toll like receptor 4 were semi-quantified by qRT-PCR in the isolated macrophages. ",

Macrophages from the LPS + Rosi group showed significant downregulation of the TLR4 expression (\u2265 1.5 folds, p\u22640.05, n=5) and upregulation of HO1 and NRF2 expression (\u2265 1.5 folds, p\u22640.05, n=5). Expression of Cox2 was downregulated, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of PPAR-\u03b3 via Rosiglitazone reduced the rate of LPS-induced preterm birth by downregulating the inflammatory response. This may be achieved by down-regulating the expression of the LPS receptor, TLR4, and increasing in the anti-oxidative response.",

We identified women with recurrent (n=5,437), isolated (n=22,110), or no preeclampsia (n=567,261). We abstracted all future hospitalizations for cardiovascular outcomes or procedures, including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, any heart procedure, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary angioplasty, or aorta repair. Using time-to-event analysis, we estimated hazards for each outcome (hazard ratio, HR; 95% confidence interval, CI), comparing recurrent and isolated preeclampsia with no preeclampsia. We adjusted for age, year, parity, and deprivation, and censored women who died or had no event by March 31, 2014, the last day of follow-up. RESULTS: Incidence of any cardiovascular disease was higher for recurrent (105 per 1000) and isolated (60 per 1000) than no preeclampsia (30 per 1000). Recurrent preeclampsia was more strongly associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes than isolated preeclampsia. Compared with no preeclampsia, women with recurrent preeclampsia had greater risk of any cardiovascular disease (HR 3.7; 95% CI 3.4-4.0), heart failure (HR 3.5; 95% CI 2.4-5.3), ischemic heart disease (HR 3.1; CI 95% 2.3-3.9), stroke (HR 2.2; 95% CI 1.6-3.1), any heart procedure (HR 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1), coronary artery bypass graft (HR 3.0; 95% CI 1.1-8.2), coronary angioplasty (HR 3.4; 95% CI 2.2-5.3), and aorta repair (HR 5.7; 95% CI 2.7-12.3).

INTRODUCTION: Antenatal Beta is used clinically to accelerate fetal lung maturity, but prenatal exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids reduces nephron number in animals Reductions in nephron number in early life increase the risk for impaired renal function following a second insult to the kidney and may be associated with imbalance between Ang-II /AT1 receptor and Ang-(1-7)/Mas-receptor pathways within the kidney. The objective of this study was to determine if antenatal glucocorticoid exposure combined with a second insult (acute loss of nephrons -unilateral nephrectomy) would alter the effects of Ang-(1-7) on Na + uptake in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTC) and Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor gene expression in adult sheep kidney.",

In contrast, in females there was no effect of acute loss of nephrons on responses to Ang-(1-7).The ability of Ang-(1-7) to decrease Na + uptake was greater in RPTC from Beta females than in cells from Beta males. Prenatal Beta exposure decreased Angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor expression in male sheep compared with vehicle treatment (F=8.28; P<0.01). There was no significant difference in Angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas receptor expression in female sheep exposed to Beta and following nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that acute nephron loss in males enhances ability of Ang-(1-7) to inhibit Na + uptake by RPTC. In addition, the greater effectiveness of Ang-(1-7) in RPTC from Beta females vs Beta males may be due to greater expression of Mas receptor in the females. Previously we have reported that 30 min of transient hypoxic hypoxia (HH) upregulates the expression of inflammation and apoptosis markers in fetal cerebral cortex (CTX), and the administration of ketamine attenuates these responses. The present experiments test the hypothesis that UCO produces a robust inflammatory and apoptotic response in the fetal CTX, and the treatment with ketamine reduces these responses. METHODS: An extravascular occluder was placed around the umbilical cord in chronically catheterized fetal sheep (125d). A 30-minute UCO decreased fetal P a O 2 50%. Half of the fetuses received ketamine (3mg/ kg) intravenously 10 min prior to UCO (n=4/group). 24 hours after the experiment, fetal brains were collected and mRNA were extracted and hybridized to ovine Agilent 15.5k microarray. Differentially regulated genes were determined using empirical Bayes moderated t-test and twoway ANOVA for microarray data and qPCR calculations, respectively, and DAVID Bioinformatics to identify significant up-and downregulation of biological processes. We also performed real-time qPCR of key inflammation and apoptosis mediators (NFKB, CD14, MYD88, BAD, and CASP3). The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05. RESULTS: UCO upregulated cellular catabolic processes (p\u22640.05), with a trend for upregulated apoptotic and cell death pathways (p=0.08 and 0.06, respectively), but no effect on inflammation or apoptosis pathways. There were no significant downregulated pathways induced by UCO. Also, the administration of ketamine did not show any effect on either group of animals (\u00b1UCO). Real-time qPCR validation of specific target genes confirmed our array results. CONCLUSIONS: UCO did not induce an inflammatory or apoptotic response on the fetal CTX. This is in contrast to the inflammation/apoptotic response to HH (with the same magnitude and duration of hypoxia). We conclude that the inflammation/apoptosis in fetal CTX after HH is secondary to a maternal response to HH and is not a direct response to cellular oxygen deprivation. The incidence of GDM is rapidly increasing worldwide, and GDM is known to result in both early perinatal complications and long-term effects such as cardiovascular disease in offspring. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is cardioprotective, especially in the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, we hypothesized that AMPK is involved in the cardiac disease of offspring exposed to in utero hyperglycemia, in particular, the response to I/R of male offspring. METHODS: 8 weeks-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were mated with age matched male. GDM animal model was established by administering streptozotocin (35 mg/kg) on E8.5 via i.p. injection. The blood glucose level, GTT, ITT of the male offspring were measured at 22-24 weeks of age, and then the offsprings were subjected to 20 min of global ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion by the use of Langendorff system. Cell signaling was determined by western blot.",

This is facilitated by an endogenous increase in maternal cortisol across gestation. Cortisol bioavailability and local tissue delivery is regulated by corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG). CBG also binds progesterone, but with over a 3 fold lower affinity. To investigate the regulation of cortisol bioavailability in-utero, we assessed cord blood levels of free and total cortisol, high and low affinity CBG (haCBG and laCBG) and progesterone across gestation. METHODS: Cord blood samples were collected at birth from preterm (n=141) and term (n=176) neonates. High and low affinity CBG levels were assessed by an in-house ELISA. Total cortisol and progesterone was measured by electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay and ELISA, respectively. The fraction of free cortisol was determined using a temperature-controlled ultrafiltration/ligand-binding method. All clinical data were collected from medical records. RESULTS: Total cortisol, free cortisol, the proportion of haCBG and progesterone increased across pregnancy (p<0.05 for all). Compared to reference ranges for women in the luteal phase, progesterone levels in cord blood were over 100-fold higher (mean 7476 nM/L, IQR 4184-9697nM/L). Free cortisol fractions were elevated three-fold in gestation compared to previous reports in adults. While the progesterone to CBG ratio did not change over gestation, it was correlated with free cortisol concentrations at each gestational time point (r=0.155, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We propose that high progesterone concentrations result in a displacement of cortisol from CBG, allowing predominant free cortisol in the neonatal circulation. This high free cortisol fraction may allow a fetal-specific cortisol tissue distribution required for fetal development. This does not appear to be driven by alterations in haCBG or laCBG levels. This 'progesterone switch' in CBG function in utero potentially has important physiological implications for neonatal transition.",

            "text": "Characterization INTRODUCTION: Through CAP's efferent vagus nerve, \u03b17 nAChR expressed on peripheral macrophages reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. While adult CAP has been studied, its function in fetus is hardly known. We hypothesized that agonistic stimulation of \u03b17nAChR in fetal brain microglia will reduce IL-1\u03b2 secretion, thus mimicking CAP. METHODS: 8 ovine near-term fetuses were instrumented with catheters, recovered 3 days and were injected LPS (400 ng IV) or NaCl to induce inflammation. At 54h, at necropsy primary microglia and astrocyte cultures were derived. Microglia (n=8) were studied 2 weeks and astrocytes (n=10) -4 weeks after in vivo LPS/NaCl exposure (DOI: 10.3389/fncel.2015.00294). The cells were pre-incubated with AR-17779 (\u03b17nAChR agonist, 10 ng, \"A10\") for 2h followed by LPS (100 ng) for 6h or NaCl exposure. Thus, in vitro LPS exposure meant single hit to in vivo animals receiving NaCl and second-hit (SH) (microglia: n=2; astrocytes: n=1) to those having received LPS in vivo. IL-1\u03b2 secretion was measured in supernatant (ELISA). RESULTS: 5 microglia and 8 astrocyte cultures showed an unexpected increase, rather than decrease, in IL-1\u03b2 after A10 treatment (Fig. 1, 2) , regardless gender. In SH microglia, LPS induced 74-or 2-fold IL-1\u03b2 increase. In SH astrocytes, LPS induced 0.4-fold IL-1\u03b2 increase. *Figure(s) will be available online.CONCLUSIONS: CAP's traditional anti-inflammatory role may not hold in the developing brain. Stimulating \u03b17nAChR on fetal glia has pro-inflammatory effect in most cases. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this observation and its therapeutic implications. . At 54 h post first LPS, animals were euthanized and brain and terminal ileum tissues were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for Iba1+ microglia/macrophages signal intensity. Results are reported for p<0.05. RESULTS: LPS 400 and 800 resulted in a similar IL-6 rise at 3 h post LPS, no change in brain inflammation, and an increase of Iba1 intensity in ileum macrophages. Vx+LPS400 resulted in a surprising anti-inflammatory effect: IL-6 was diminished to control levels on D2; similar behaviour was seen in brain and gut. Vx+LPS800 led to the expected increase in brain, but not gut, inflammation, compared to Vx+LPS400 and bringing it to Control or LPS group levels ( Fig. 1 ). *Figure(s) will be available online. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to adult CAP function in mitigating sepsis, low-grade inflammation in fetus is diminished by CAP withdrawal. This counter-intuitive effect of CAP is abolished and the expected proinflammatory role of CAP withdrawal is revealed upon exposure to a higher endotoxin dose. This bimodal CAP behaviour requires further study to gauge therapeutic consequences of targeting CAP. Maternal obesity has been demonstrated to increase fetal overgrowth as well as adult disease risk in the offspring for a range of diseases including metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The placenta is the interface of nutrient transport to the fetus and Glut1 is the main glucose transporter. By isolating the role of glucose transport levels to the fetus, we have created a mouse model to examine the role of different levels of glucose on fetal health outcomes. METHODS: Active transgenesis utilizing a hyperactive piggyBac transposase-based plasmid was used to generate a transgenic mouse line using pronuclear injection (te-PNI). This approach combines high transgenesis rates and low transgene insertion numbers with the ease of using te-PNI. The plasmid used contains an shRNAmir against Glut1 under the control of the CYP19I.1 promoter for placental trophoblast specific expression and a Tet-on system to allow for time point specific induction. The vector also contains the gene for EGFP, which allows for visual confirmation of transgenic mice. Knockdown of Glut1 expression was induced in transgenic mice between E 14.5 and E18.5.",

Experiments were conducted in 8 month old age male offspring. Isolated hearts were in a Langendorff preparation. RESULTS: Perinatal nicotine treatment significantly increased ischemia and reperfusion-induced left ventricular injury, decreased post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular function and coronary flow rate. In addition, nicotine enhanced cardiac ROS production and significantly attenuated Protein kinase C \u0190 (PKC \u0190 ) protein abundance in the heart. Although nicotine had no effect on total cardiac Glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) protein expression, it significantly increased the phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at serine 9 residue in the heart. NAC inhibited nicotine-mediated increase in ROS production, recovered PKC \u0190 gene expression and abrogated increased phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2. Of importance, NAC blocked perinatal nicotine-induced increase in ischemia and reperfusion injury in the heart. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide novel evidence of a causative role of increased oxidative stress in perinatal nicotine-induced developmental programming of ischemic sensitive phenotype in the heart, and suggest potential therapeutic targets of anti-oxidative stress in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. Increasing parity has been shown to be associated with offspring adiposity, inflammation, and impaired glucose metabolism in an animal model. However, similar studies examining the impact of parity and higher birth order in humans are lacking. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of parity on the fetal programming of gene expression in neonates. METHODS: Foreskin samples were collected from 55 non-anomalous neonates. Parity was abstracted from review of medical records. Samples were flash frozen, and RNA was isolated from the epidermal/dermal layer. Nine epidermal/dermal samples were excluded (n=4 from twins; 2 from preterm infants; 3 due to RNA degradation). RNA expression levels were analyzed using the NanoString Technologies nCounter system. Expression of genes involved in glucose/lipid metabolism and inflammatory response was quantified and normalized to housekeeping genes. The average gene expression levels among neonates born to mothers with a lower parity (1 or 2) (n = 35) vs. higher parity (3 or more) (n = 11) were compared, using Student's t test.",

            "text": "Offspring Fed a High Fat Diet. Baifeng Yu, Erin Zinkhan. University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA. INTRODUCTION: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) and consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) predispose to insulin resistance in both humans and animal models. Despite the prevalence of a HFD, little is known about the mechanism through which FGR increases insulin resistance in the context of a maternal HFD. Tissues important in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance include visceral adipose (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose (SAT). In healthy individuals, insulin initiates the insulin signaling cascade resulting in increased glucose transporter (Glut4) protein at the cell surface to increase glucose uptake from the blood. An endogenous inhibitor of the insulin signaling cascade (Socs3) prevents insulin signaling. We hypothesized that FGR rats from dams fed a HFD (FGR+HFD) would demonstrate insulin resistance in young rats by increasing VAT and SAT protein levels of Socs3. METHODS: Adult female rats were fed a HFD prior to mating through gestation and lactation. FGR was induced by uterine artery ligation at E19 of a 21 day gestation. At postnatal day 21 (D21) rats were weaned to the same maternal HFD. We measured serum glucoses during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (GTT), calculated the area under the curve of the GTT, and measured protein levels of the insulin signaling cascade of VAT and SAT with western blot. RESULTS: FGR+HFD male and female rats had increased fasting serum glucoses on GTT at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes (all timepoints p<0.05) and increased area under the curve on GTT (male: control+HFD 356+/-13, FGR+HFD 432+/-13* mg/dL/hr; female: control+HFD 323+/-7, FGR+HFD 456+/-15* mg/dL/hr). FGR+HFD male and female rats had decreased VAT and SAT Glut4 protein (male VAT: control+HFD 8. *p<0.05. CONCLUSIONS: FGR+HFD increases serum glucoses during GTT and decreases VAT and SAT Glut4 protein in young male and female rats. Increased adipose tissue Socs3 protein may inhibit insulin signaling and induce insulin resistance in young FGR+HFD rats. We speculate that inhibition of Socs3 protein will improve insulin resistance in FGR+HFD rats. Since nicotine is highly addictive, women may use nicotine replacement therapies and electronic cigarettes to aid in their cessation attempts. However, studies from our group have demonstrated that in rats MNE during gestation and lactation leads to postnatal hypertriglyceridemia, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Intrahepatic triglyceride accumulation can occur, in part, due to impaired lipid loading capacity in white adipose tissue (WAT). Since (i) MNE has been shown to induce ER stress in other tissues, and (ii) ER stress can adversely affect adipocyte function, we predicted that nicotine-exposed offspring would have increased ER stress in WAT. Therefore, we hypothesize that MNE alone will adversely impact adipose function leading to hypertriglyceridemia and CVD long-term. METHODS: Female rats received daily subcutaneous injections of vehicle or nicotine bitartrate (1mg/kg) from 2 weeks prior to mating until weaning. Visceral gonadal WAT was harvested from male and female 26 week old offspring. Formalin fixed WAT was stained with H&E to quantify adipocyte cell areas. Steady-state mRNA expression in markers of adipogenesis and adipose tissue function along with ER stress were quantified via real-time PCR. Significant differences were determined using Student t-tests (n=11-15/group). RESULTS: MNE significantly decreased adipocyte cell area (p<0.001) and increased expression of genes associated with adipocyte differentiation (SREBP1c, PPAR\u03b1/\u2206; p<0.05) and lipolysis (ATGL p<0.05) in male and female offspring. Also, MNE increased expression of GRP78 (p<0.01), ATF4, spliced XBP-1, and CHOP (p<0.05) suggesting an aggravated ER stress response in WAT. Markers of proliferation and lipogenesis were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: MNE decreased adipocyte size, resulting in impaired lipid storage and long-term hypertriglyceridemia. This exposure was also associated with augmented ER stress. Future studies assessing the role of nicotine-induced ER stress in altering adipocyte size and lipid storage will uncover molecular mechanisms promoting adipose dysfunction and hypertriglyceridemia long-term.",

We have shown disruption in autophagy in placentas of obese women. To study the role of autophagy in placenta, a conditional knockout (KO) mouse with placenta-specific deletion of autophagy-related gene 7 was created. We reported that placentas of KO mice show mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Five-monthold offspring of KO mice develop obesity and hyperglycemia following 8 weeks exposure to a high fat diet (HFD, 45% fat) vs. regular diet (RD, 17% fat). We hypothesized that placental dysfunction would give further programming effects in these mice. METHODS: Plasma, adipose and heart tissues of male or female wild type (WT) and KO mice fed RD or HFD (n=5-10/group) were collected. Plasma adiponectin, insulin, heart and adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size were measured and heart tissue were stained with Masson's trichrome. RESULTS: No significant changes in plasma adiponectin were seen, though there was a slight decrease (p=0.2) in male KO/HFD mice. Insulin levels in male but not female WT/HFD and KO/HFD mice were increased compared to RD-fed (p<0.05), and in KO it was higher than WT within each diet group. There were no differences in heart weights across groups. Visceral fat mass was greater in both male and female WT/ HFD and KO/HFD vs. RD-fed mice (p<0.05). Male and female KO/HFD mice, however, had significantly higher fat accumulation than WT/HFD, WT/RD and KO/RD (p<0.05). Only male WT/HFD and KO/HFD mice showed increased adipocyte size vs. RD-fed (2-and 3-fold respectively, p<0.05). Adipocyte size has been previously shown to be increased in metabolically unhealthy individuals. While we observed cardiac fibrosis in all HFD-fed mice, the area of fibrosis was significantly greater in KO vs. WT mice, and in males vs. females in each HFD-fed group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in a mouse model of placental dysfunction caused by defective autophagy, we were able to recapitulate metabolic abnormalities seen in the offspring of obese women in a sex-dependent manner: this included hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, accumulation of visceral fat, increase in adipocyte size and myocardial fibrosis. Alterations in imprinted genes have been implicated as a potential link between maternal exposures, in utero growth, and longterm health and disease. Grb10, an imprinted gene expressed from the maternal allele in the placenta and fetal liver, is critical to fetal growth in the mouse. Changes in the peri-conception environment, such as a high fat diet or in vitro fertilization, alter Grb10 expression and DNA methylation. GRB10 has been linked to adult metabolic health as well and GWAS studies identified GRB10 as a diabetes susceptibility gene. In the present study, using wild type (WT) mice, mice lacking the maternal Grb10 allele (Grb10 (-/+) , mice lacking the paternal Grb10 allele (Grb10 (+/-) and null mice (Grb10 (-/-) ), we investigated the role of Grb10 in body composition and metabolic function in adulthood.",

We examined insulin sensitivity by quantifying downstream targets of the insulin signaling pathway including p-Akt, p-GSK-3\u00df and p-S6K1 at baseline and following insulin challenge; glycogen content in liver was also quantified. RESULTS: Body weight, lean body mass, and pancreatic weight were significantly increased in Grb10 (-/+) and Grb10 (-/-) mice in adulthood (p<0.05 vs. WT). We also observed lower fasting glucose, lower fasting insulin levels and improved glucose tolerance in mice lacking the maternal Grb10 allele (n>15/group, p<0.05). Insulin sensitivity was markedly improved in muscle tissue in Grb10 (-/+) and Grb10 (-/-) vs. WT mice, and p-AKT, p-GSK-3\u00df and p-S6K1 were significantly increased (p<0.05 vs. WT) following insulin administration. Mice lacking the maternal allele also had a blunted response to glucagon administration, which may be due to the observed decrease in glycogen stores in the liver of the maternal heterozygote and null mice (p<0.05 vs. WT). CONCLUSIONS: Loss of the maternal Grb10 allele alters insulin signaling resulting in improved insulin sensitivity and decreased hepatic glycogen stores. These findings, combined with the known affects of Grb10 on fetal weight, suggest that Grb10 is a critical link between early embryo exposures, growth kinetics and long-term metabolism.

Expressions of Egr1, mTOR, and p70S6K in mice hippocampus were detected before and after intra-cerebroventricularly rapamycin-treatment using qPCR and Western blot. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of mTOR and p70S6K in neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells transfected with Egr1 interference fragment or Egr1overexpressing plasmid. Changes of Egr1 level with rapamycin were also studied. RESULTS: Compared with controls, we found escape latency increased, time in target platform quadrant reduced, and synaptic plasticity damaged in OVX-mice. And expressions of Egr1, mTOR and p70S6K in the hippocampal of OVX-mice were obviously increased relative to that in Sham group. After intra-cerebroventricularly rapamycin-treated, cognition decline was significantly improved, and expression of mTOR/ p70S6K and Egr1 were statistically down-regulated in OVX mice compared with vehicle controls. Additionally, in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, either the Egr1 interference fragment or the Egr1-overexpressing plasmid transfection did not alter the expression of mTOR and p70S6K, while rapamycin-treated decreased Egr1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that increased Egr1 expression, relating to cognitive decline in OVX, is regulated by mTOR/p70S6K pathway. Interestingly, mTOR inhibitor-rapamycin, reducing the Egr1 level, might be a potential therapeutic target in postmenopausal cognitive decline. Females have an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) compared to males. The increase may be due to estrogen, since decreased estrogen levels affect the onset and severity of OCD.

RESULTS: AKAP13 was expressed in brain regions involved in complex behaviors, appetite/satiety, and estrogen receptor expression.The grooming assay demonstrated OCD behavior in AKAP13 +/-mice compared to controls (p\u22640.05). Haploinsufficient female mice exhibited increased total grooming (p<0.05), and increased incomplete bouts (p<0.05), where incomplete bouts demonstrated a departure from the cephalocaudal grooming pattern. Similarly, AKAP13 +/-mice shredded a greater percentage of their nestlets than controls. In the marble-bury assay, the AKAP13 +/-male and female mice buried more marbles (p<0.05), consistent with OCD behavior. Furthermore, AKAP13 +/-mice of combined sexes were found to be heavier than controls between 3-6 months old (p< 0.05) and greater than 6 months old (p<0.05). Female +/-mice were heavier than controls at 3-6 months (p<0.05), but the males did not show significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the conclusion that mice haploinsufficient for AKAP13 exhibit traits consistent with OCD. Additionally, these data support a potential connection between obesity and OCD, and add to the body of knowledge suggesting sex differences in anxiety disorders.

CONCLUSIONS: Findings in this study provide a first direct evidence about differential chemokine expression between healthy and arresting CAS, potentially contributing towards a shift in immune cell functions at the maternal-fetal interface.

To standardize evaluation, we developed an Examination Rubric, containing evidence-based criteria for grading severity of lesions.

INTRODUCTION: Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is produced endogenously from L-cysteine (L-Cys) by cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE). L-Cys can be degraded by cysteine deoxygenase (CDO) and cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminases (GOT1 and GOT2). In murine uterus, we have shown decreased CDO and increased CSE expression at labor on gestational day 19 (E19), suggesting increased L-Cys availability and H 2 S production. Inducing preterm (E15) labor or delaying term delivery (E19) with RU486 or progesterone (P 4 ) does not alter cysteine metabolic enzymes. We hypothesize that there may be compartment specific regulation of cysteine metabolism in uterus and placenta. We examined the expression of CBS, CSE, CDO, CSAD, GOT1 and GOT2 in placenta during mouse gestation and labor, and compared with non-pregnant (NP) maternal liver expression of these enzymes. METHODS: Placentae were collected from timed pregnant C57/Bl6 mice on gestational day 15-19 and at labor. Placentae were combined for each litter, and analyzed by western blot using specific antibodies for CBS, CSE, CDO, CSAD, GOT1 and GOT2. Enzyme expression was quantified using infrared fluorescence imaging, and internally normalized to NP liver control. Normalized expression is presented relative to \u03b2-actin at each gestational age. Data are mean \u00b1 SEM, and analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: A 1.7 fold increase in CBS expression was seen over late gestation (E18-19; n=3-5; p<0.05). CSE increased across gestation to 1.4 fold in labor (n=2-6). No change was observed in CDO expression throughout gestation. CSAD remained unchanged from E15-19 but increased 3 fold in labor (n=3-5). GOT1 increased 2.2 fold at late gestation (E18-19; n=2-6) whereas GOT2 decreased at late gestation and labor (n=1-3). CONCLUSIONS: CSE and CBS expression is increased in term and labor placenta, similar to our findings in the myometrium. Unlike myometrium, there is no decrease in CDO across gestation. This suggests a compartment-specific regulation of L-Cys availability and possibly H 2 S production. Increased CSAD and GOT1 in labor suggest that taurine and sulfites may increase at term. The regulation of maternal and fetal transsulfuration enzymes may indicate novel roles for H 2 S production and amino acid metabolism in the fetus.",

Herein, we investigated a possible role of SDF2 in ER stress pathway in trophoblast cells. METHODS: HTR8-Svneo trophoblastic cell lineage was maintained in culture and induced to ER stress with tunicamycin for 3h, 6h and 24h. ER stress markers were evaluated by q-RT-PCR (sXBP1, CHOP and SDF2) and Western Blot (GRP78/BiP and SDF2). Cells were also silenced for SDF2 with siRNA and superexpressed with plasmid; the same factors were evaluated in both conditions. Apoptosis and cell survival were evaluated by caspase-3 and ATP production luminescence assays. RESULTS: In HTR8/SVneo cells, SDF2 is downregulated after 6h of treatment and it is restored after 24h. The survival marker GRP78/BiP is upregulated after 24h of tunicamycin treatment and, in silenced cells it is upregulated after 6h only. sXBP1 is upregulated in SDF2 silenced cells after 24h of tunicamycin treatment, while CHOP expression is downregulated in silenced cells. Caspase 3/ATP production was lower in the group SDF2-/-treated for 3 and 6h with tunicamycin, but increased after 24h. In SDF2 superexpression, caspase 3/ATP production increased in tunicamycin treated cells. CONCLUSIONS: GRP78/BiP, CHOP and sXBP1 are classical ER stress markers involved in cells survival/apoptosis decision. Cells treated with tunicamycin and silenced for SDF2 showed a pro-survival fate (upregulation of GRP78/BiP and sXBP1, downregulation of CHOP and reduction in caspase 3/ATP production), while superexpression of SDF2 showed a pro-apoptosis fate (increase of caspase 3/ATP production).

METHODS: Time-mated pregnant guinea pigs were exposed to either normoxic (NMX) or hypoxic (HPX;10.5%O 2 ) conditions at 20d gestation (implantation at 23d) until mid-term (40d) or near-term (65d). From euthanized animals placentas were excised, weighed, and frozen in liquid N 2 for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR, or perfusion-fixed with formalin for IHC for TB (KRT7), blood vessels (SMA-smooth muscle actin, vWF-endothelium), and proliferation (PCNA) in the placenta and associated uterine tissue. RESULTS: At term, hypoxia increased mean maternal arterial blood pressure (HPX 57.9\u00b12.3 vs NMX 40.4\u00b12.3, p<0.001), decreased fetal weight by 16.1% (p<0.05), and increased absolute and relative placenta to fetal weight by 10.1% and 31.8%, respectively (p<0.05). At mid-term, there was a significant increase in TB in HPX placentas as confirmed by elevated ESX1 gene expression (p<0.05), and staining for PCNA and KRT7. Image analysis of the decidua revealed that HPX placentas had a 39.2% decrease in the KRT7:vWF signal ratio, and evaluation of individual maternal vessels showed reduced occupation and remodeling by KRT7 positive TB in HPX placentas.",

            "text": "The HPX placenta compensates maladaptively by stimulating TB proliferation but inhibiting invasion into the SA. We conclude that oxygenation of the placenta regulates normal SA remodeling and that HPX conditions contribute to inadequate blood flow and placental insufficiency leading to maternal hypertension and fetal growth restriction. This is the first evidence of hypoxia-induced repression of SA remodeling in guinea pig placenta. (n=12) was chronically instrumented under anaesthesia at 119\u00b12 d with a wireless data acquisition system to record maternal arterial pressure, uterine blood flow and vascular resistance. Five days later, half of these pregnancies were exposed to hypoxia (10% O 2 ) for 10 days in the isobaric chambers. RESULTS: Hypoxic pregnancy led to FGR (3.5\u00b10.2 vs. 2.7\u00b10.2 Kg; P<0.05) and increased the placental expression of protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), glucose related protein 78 (GRP78) and phosphorylated-p38 (P-p38) while reducing calreticulin; molecular changes associated with ER and oxidative stress ( Fig. 1 A-D) . Hypoxic pregnancy also prevented the fall in maternal arterial blood pressure and in uterine vascular resistance with advancing gestation (Fig. 1 E, F) . CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hypoxic pregnancy in sheep impairs uterine perfusion with advancing gestation, promoting relative maternal hypertension and placental ER stress which may lead to protein synthesis inhibition and FGR. These effects may link the low birth weight and increased prevalence of preeclampsia associated with hypoxic pregnancy. Support: British Heart Foundation *Figure(s) will be available online. RNA-Seq on all samples was used to identify genes possibly implicated in causing the DNA damage and pharmacologic and siRNA treatments were used to establish causation.",

PolyA RNA-seq, qPCR and immunoblotting from the cultured cells revealed that L1 gene and protein expression was markedly elevated compared with controls.. To determine whether L1 caused the DNA damage or was just associated with the damage, L1 activity was blocked by treating the cultured cells with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothimidine (AZT). AZT-treatment resulted in a >50% increase of \u03b3H2AX positivity in cells cultured from patient M1, but not in cells from other spontaneous and elective abortion samples. siRNA-targeted L1 knockdown in cells cultured from patient M1 resulted in a 50% decrease of \u03b3H2AX levels in cells collected from patient M1 but had no effect in controls or when scrambled siRNAs were used. Immunoblot analysis using an antibody against the apoptosis marker Caspase-3 revealed high level of Caspase-3 in the cultured cells from our patient, whereas no apoptosis in control cells was detected. Remarkably, AZT-treated and L1 knockdown cells from patient M1 demonstrated an increase and reduction in Caspase-3 , respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The L1 family of endogenous retrovirus, thought to be an ancient relic in our genome, caused DNA damage-induced apoptosis in a patient with unexplained RPL. In vitro, this damage is reversible under specific experimental conditions. Placentation is an intricate process that involves signaling not just from one individual but entails a finely orchestrated cellular and molecular interplay of 2 separate individuals, both mother and fetus, requiring a significant amount of crosstalk at the maternal fetal interface. However, in ongoing human pregnancies this crosstalk is poorly understood, as there is no means of assessing the underlying signaling between mother and fetus. To better understand the interactions at the maternal fetal interface, we conducted a 2 step approach to better define the crosstalk that takes place. First, we performed an in silico assessment of receptors/ligands in the uterus and placenta and then proceeded with RNA sequencing from matched maternal decidua and fetal chorionic villi from the same pregnancies to determine which receptor ligand pairs may be critical during this period of placentation. METHODS: In silico assessment was performed first by identifying all receptors in the uterus through Unigene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ unigene/). Identification of potential ligands for all receptors identified from the uterus was performed using the Human Plasma Membrane Receptome (http://reprobio.stanford.edu/hsueh/). Further, identification of placental receptors and identification of potential ligands was performed in a similar fashion. RNA sequencing was performed from 8 matched maternal decidua/ fetal chorionic villus pairs of ongoing healthy pregnancies.",

            "text": "The Interplay Between Endothelin-1 (ET-1) Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a severe pregnancy complication associated with impaired trophoblast invasion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is up-regulated in PE and is also a regulator of cell migration and invasion. Since matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-15 plays a crucial role in these processes, we hypothesize that increased levels of ET-1 modify MMP-15 expression in human first trimester trophoblasts and that this effect is further modulated by PE characteristic stimuli such as TNF-\u03b1 and hypoxia. METHODS: Primary human trophoblasts isolated from first trimester placenta (week 7 to 12 of gestation) were incubated in the absence or the presence of 100nM ET-1. MMP-15 mRNA and protein were quantified by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. ET-1 functional effects were analysed by MMP-2 zymography. ET-1 biological effects were tested as trophoblast outgrowth in first trimester chorionic villous explants. The role of TNF-\u03b1 (25ng/ml) and hypoxia (1% O 2 ) on ET-1-mediated MMP-15 regulation was assessed by Western Blotting. RESULTS: ET-1 down-regulated MMP-15 mRNA and protein (by 27% and 26%, respectively, p\u22640.05). This was paralleled by a down-regulation of MMP-2 protein (-17%, p\u22640.05) and by an inhibition of trophoblast outgrowth in placental explants (-26%, p\u22640.05). TNF-\u03b1 did not directly affect MMP-15 expression, but enhanced ET-1 mediated MMP-15 downregulation by 12% (p\u22640.05). Preliminary results showed that hypoxia down-regulated MMP-15 protein levels (by 44%) and even increased the effect of ET-1 on MMP-15 down-regulation by 8%. CONCLUSIONS: ET-1 down-regulates MMP-15 expression in human first trimester trophoblasts, leading to a decrease in MMP-2 activation and a reduction of trophoblast invasion. This effect is enhanced in the presence of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, or hypoxic environment, which are characteristic for PE. Thus, ET-1 might stimulate the impairment of trophoblast invasion observed in PE. Aged or damaged regions of the syncytiotrophoblast are shed into the maternal blood as syncytial nuclear aggregates (SNAs). These SNAs are cleared from the maternal body, at least in part, by pulmonary endothelial cells that phagocytose them. The effects of phagocytosing SNAs on endothelial cells is not fully established but we have shown that SNAs from normal pregnancies regulate the transcriptome of endothelial cells 1 and surprisingly up regulate the expression of \"placenta-specific genes\" such as human placental lactogen (hPL); chorionic gonadotropin alpha (CGA) and pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoprotein 3 (PSG3). Here we investigate the mechanism of this up regulation. METHODS: First trimester placentas (n=12) were obtained with informed consent following termination of pregnancies. SNAs were harvested from cultured placental explants as described before 2 . The endothelial cell line HMEC-1 was cultured with SNAs for 2, 24 or 48 hours in the presence or absence of 2 \u00b5M of 5-Ethynyl Uridine (5EU) to distinguish the newly transcribed RNA from the total RNA. At the end of each time point, total RNA or newly generated RNA was isolated from the SNAs-treated endothelial cells or the SNAs alone controls and reverse transcribed into cDNA for qRT-PCR. RESULTS: 1) qRT-PCR using total RNA demonstrated that control SNAs cultured in the absence of HMEC-1 for up to 24 hours contained extremely low levels of transcripts for hPL and by 48 hours these transcripts were undetectable. Whereas, HMEC-1 had expressed de novo transcripts for hPL at 2 hours after phagocytosing SNAs and continued to generate these transcripts for at least 48 hours, p<0.001. 2) qRT-PCR using newly transcribed RNA isolated from SNAs-treated HEMC-1 or SNAs alone confirmed that SNAs cultured in the absence of endothelial cells did not generate new transcripts for hPL but that endothelial cells did synthesise transcripts for hPL after phagocytosing SNAs, p<0.00001. CONCLUSIONS: After extrusion from the syncytium, most SNAs have little capacity to synthesise new mRNA. However, SNAs carry as yet unidentified regulators that can induce the de novo expression of placenta-specific genes in endothelial cells. Thus in effect SNAs expand production of pro-pregnancy factors to extra-placental sites. (ADM2), secreted by human blastocysts and expressed in placenta, promotes trophoblast invasion in the 1 st trimester of human pregnancy. Lower levels of ADM2 are associated with spontaneous abortion and inhibition of the endogenous ADM2 function in early rat pregnancy results in reduced implantation rate, restricted feto-placental growth and impaired placental vasculature. However, it is not known if ADM2 has a role in modulating the phenotypical changes in trophoblast stem cells. Current study was designed to assess the effect of ADM2 on the differentiation of trophoblast stem cells (Rcho-1) into giant trophoblasts. METHODS: RCHO-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in either stem cell medium (RPMI-1640 with 20% Fetal bovine serum, 50 \u00b5M 2-\u03b2-ME) for a 24hrs treatment with ADM2 (10 -8 M-10 -7 M) at 37 0 C, or in stem cell medium for 24hrs followed by differentiation medium (NCTC-135 medium with 1% horse serum, 50 \u00b5M 2-\u03b2-ME ) and culturing further at for 3 days in presence or absence of ADM2 (10 -8 M-10 -7 M). Rcho-1 cell spheroids were prepared by hanging drop method using 700 cells per drop. Spheroids were transferred onto a monolayer of smooth muscle cells and cultured for 72hrs in differentiation medium in presence or absence of ADM2 (10 -7 M). Morphological changes were assessed with Olympus U-TV1 microscope. Expression of mRNA were assessed by real time PCR. RESULTS: 1) ADM2 increases the formation of giant trophoblast cells in the stem cell population of Rcho-1 cells, 2) ADM2 increases the expression of both, stem cell markers Essrb1 and Id1, and differentiation markers prl3b1 and plf (P<0.05) in Rcho-1 cells, and these effects are inhibited by ADM2 antagonist, 3) ADM2 increases the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, STAR, sf1, 3bHSD1, 3bHSD2 and 17bHSD1 in differentiated Rcho-1 cells (P<0.05), and 4) compared to the control, ADM2 increases the differentiation of cells at the periphery of the Rcho-1 spheroids CONCLUSIONS: ADM2 induced increases in the expression of stem cell markers, differentiation markers and steroidogenic enzymes in Rcho-1 cells suggest an important role for ADM2 in regulating trophoblast stem cells phenotype to support placental formation. There are major sexually dimorphic differences in perinatal morbidity and mortality but the mechanisms that confer these differences are unclear. Our research and the work of others, suggest that glucocorticoids may play a role in regulating sex specific differences in placental function and fetal growth during pregnancy. We have recently identified there are twelve isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor in the human placental trophoblast that vary with fetal sex, gestational age at delivery, maternal asthma and maternal betamethasone exposure. The current study was designed to determine if there are differences in placental glucocorticoid regulated pathways in association with the expression of different GR isoforms in term pregnancies complicated by asthma. METHODS: Placentae from pregnancies complicated maternal asthma (term deliveries, n=8) were analysed by Western blot to determine their GR protein profile. Placental RNA was extracted and GR regulated pathways were examined using a GR PCR array. Data was analysed based on fetal sex and presence and absence of maternal asthma.",

CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that glucocorticoid regulation of placental genes is dependent on the GR isoform pattern of expression.

Syncytiotrophoblasts from lean women appeared more sensitive than those of obese women with the greatest increase (p<0.05) in basal and maximal respiration, and spare capacity compared to control by 400nM. Addition of NaSe had no effect on basal respiration and required 800nM NaSe for a significant effect (p<0.05) on maximal respiration and spare capacity in cells from obese women. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that NaSe is able to increase mitochondrial respiration in primary syncytiotrophoblasts. Addition of NaSe to BeWo cells reportedly increases GPx activity, also in a biphasic manner with stimulation followed by inhibition at higher concentrations. Our data are consistent with NaSe induction of GPx activity reducing oxidative stress and increasing mitochondrial activity. The reduced sensitivity of trophoblast from obese women may be explained by their existing greater oxidative stress.

These changes are believed to directly contribute to the restricted fetal growth because mTOR signaling is a positive regulator of placental amino acid transport. We hypothesized that mTOR activation in primary trophoblast cells isolated from placentas of baboons subjected to MNR will improve placental insulin responsiveness, restore normal placental insulin-mTORC1/2 signaling and nutrient uptake capacity. METHODS: Pregnant baboons were fed either a control (n=8) or MNR diet (70% of control, n=8) from 30 days gestation (G) At 140 days G, placentas were collected. Primary Baboon Trophoblast (PBT) cells were isolated, cultured for 18 h and transfected with siRNA targeting DEPTOR (activation of mTORC1/2) or scrambled siRNA (control). PBT cells were allowed to syncytialize in culture and incubated in 5.8 ng ml -1 insulin and 300 ng ml -1 insulin-like growth factor 1 from 66 to 90 h in culture. System A and L amino acid transport activity was measured at 90 hours. RESULTS: Basal System A (-66%, p<0.01) and L (-70%, p<0.01) uptake was decreased and growth factors failed to stimulate System A/L uptake in MNR PBT cells as compared to control cells. Transfection with DEPTOR siRNA increased basal System A (+114%, p<0.001) and L uptake (+85%, p<0.01) and restored growth factor stimulation of amino acid uptake in MNR PBT cell.

Trophoblast cell lines were treated with different microbial associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) for 24 hr and changes in cellular PGLYRP expression were measured. RESULTS: Expression of PGLYRP1, 3, and 4, but not PGLYRP2, was observed in placental tissue by western blot and by RT-qPCR using two different primer sets for each gene. Immunohistochemical staining of term placenta revealed highest expression of PGLYRP1, 3, and 4 in the syncytiotrophoblast layer. Cellular levels of PGLYRP1 and PGLYRP3 were decreased by 50% in Swan.71 cells following exposure to MAMPs. Similarly, PGLYRP3 levels were decreased in 3aSubE cells, while PGLYRP1 levels were not altered. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the human placenta expresses PGLYRPs in the syncytiotrophoblast. Exposure of trophoblast cells to bacterial cell wall components resulted in reduced intracellular levels of PGLYRP, which is consistent with stimulated protein secretion as an anti-bacterial defense mechanism. Thus, PGLYRPs may also contribute to the placental innate immunity to bacterial infection. RESULTS: : There were 71 and 257 subjects in the RPOCs and myomectomy groups respectively. There were no intraoperative complications. There were 28 pregnancies in the RPOC group and 39 pregnancies in the myomectomy group. There were no significant differences in birth weight or preterm delivery. Although a higher rate of abnormal placentation was observed in the RPOC group, this difference was not statistically significant (25% vs. 7.6%, p=0.107). Of the subjects in the RPOC group, 47 had an intrauterine catheter placed for 3-14 days post operatively. There were no differences in abnormal placentation (17.6% vs. 8.5%, p=0.370), birth weight (3.17Kg vs. 3.41Kg, p=0.220) or the presence of intrauterine adhesions on postoperative imaging (30% vs. 29%, p= 1.00) between the two groups. Placement of an intrauterine catheter was associated with a lower rate of preterm delivery (40% vs. 5%, p=0.031) (gestational age <37 weeks).

RESULTS: Immunostained human endometria displayed increased total (Mean\u00b1SEM; 227.13\u00b110.4 vs. 133.63\u00b115.5; p<0.001) and N-half OPN (87.13\u00b129.3 vs. 176.375\u00b120.3; p<0.05) levels in post vs. pre-DepoMPA use, respectively. Stronger perivascular nOPN immunoreactivity was evident vs. other endometrial compartments from post vs pre-DepoMPA use. Moreover, a 3-fold increase in neutrophil numbers were found in post-DepoMPA exposed endometria (p<0.001), with intense nOPN immunoreactivity co-localized to perivascular areas displaying excess neutrophil infiltration. In culture, compared to controls (0.03\u00b10.007) thrombin + r-OPN treatment (0.182\u00b10.005) increased neutrophil migration by 6-fold (p<0.01); neither thrombin nor r-OPN alone exerted a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: These in situ and in vitro findings reveal that thrombincleaved nOPN promotes pLARC-induced AUB by recruiting/activating neutrophils, a potent source of perivascular ECM degrading proteases.",

However, the specific MPO activity (%) was significantly lower in women with endometriosis than in controls (p = 0.0182). When assessing the different cycle phases, specific MPO activity (%) was significantly decreased in the luteal phase exclusively (p = 0.0330). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic MPO levels may not be suited as a single biomarker for endometriosis. We have reported an altered specific activity of MPO in endometriosis, indicating an altered inflammatory and immune response in these patients. Adenomyosis is an uterine disorder characterized by intense menstrual and non-menstrual-related painful symptoms, as well as abnormal uterine bleeding and infertility. The pathogenesis of adenomyosis indicates that endometrial cells invade and proliferate within myometrium, with mechanisms similar to those of endometriosis, in which inflammatory mediators and neurogenic factors participate to the intense painful symptoms. Given the similarity between adenomyosis and endometriosis, the present study aimed to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression of inflammatory and neurogenic factors in both adenomyotic nodules and eutopic endometrium of patients with adenomyosis. METHODS: Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)-family members (CRH, urocortin (Ucn), Ucn2), CRH-receptors (CRH-R1, CRH-R2) and nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA expression and protein localization were analyzed by RT-PCR, IHC and IF. RESULTS: CRH, Ucn, Ucn2 and CRH receptors (CRH-R1 and CRH-R2) mRNAs expression was detected in both eutopic and ectopic endometrium from patients with adenomyosis. Moreover, adenomyotic nodules and eutopic endometrium of patients with adenomyosis expressed NGF mRNA. Protein expression of CRH and NGF was confirmed by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis in all the specimens analyzed. In particular, the presence of these peptides was observed in both glandular and stromal cells of eutopic endometrium and adenomyotic nodules. CONCLUSIONS: The present study, showing that adenomyotic nodules are novel site of expression of inflammatory mediators of the CRH-family and NGF, contribute to explain the mechanisms underlining inflammation and pain in adenomyosis. Endometriosis is a gynecological disorder which is a major cause of chronic pelvic pain and infertility. Though the prevalence of the disease has been known for more than a century the molecular mechanisms associated with the pathophysiology of the endometriosis related infertility are poorly understood. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved pathway which regulates cellular events such as proliferation and apoptosis which are also know to be altered in women with endometriosis. In the present study we have tried to understand the role of Hippo signaling in the eutopic endometrium(EuE) of baboons and women with endometriosis. METHODS: Total RNA from the mid-secretory EuE extracted from the same group of baboons(n=4) before and 15 months after the induction of endometriosis were analyzed for molecules involved in Hippo signaling pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed for YAP protein to validate the mRNA changes. Mid-secretory endometrial biopsies were obtained from control(n=6) and women with endometriosis(n=8) and proteins were isolated to perform western blot analysis for TAZ protein.",

Anne-Marie Coelho, 1 Melanie Hermann, 1 Kerstin Kopp, 1 Michael Vos, 1 Mark Gemkow, 1 Markus Koch, 2 Jens Nagel, 2 Susan Boyce. 1 1 Evotec AG, Hamburg, Germany; 2 Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany. INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic inflammation (NI) is likely to be of relevance in endometriosis since, in human endometriotic tissues, neuropeptides like substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were found expressed in sensory nerve fibers of peritoneal and deep infiltrating lesions. These neuropeptides contribute to NI by causing vasodilatation, plasma extravasation and cellular infiltration. In the context of the Bayer HealthCare-Evotec strategic alliance on endometriosis therapy initiated in 2012, the present study aimed to confirm the presence of CGRP, SP and its neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) in a recently established animal model of endometriosis-induced dyspareunia. METHODS: Endometriosis was induced in cycling rats by an autotransplantation of uterine biopsies onto abdominal arteries of the mesentery and the colon. Six (6) weeks after the surgery, biopsies were collected and analyzed by an immuno-histochemical (IHC) approach to identify the localization and expression pattern of CGRP, SP and NK1R, as well as PGP9.5, a marker of nerve fibers. All in vivo experiments were conducted in accordance with Evotec AG policies, AAALAC guidelines and the Directive 2010/63/EU as well as the German Animal Welfare Act. RESULTS: Compared to controls, animals implanted with uterine biopsies presented ectopic growths/lesions around blood vessels of the intestinal mesentery and on the colonic wall. These lesions developed rapidly in volume and weight during the first 6 weeks after autoimplantation. Using IHC techniques, SP and NK1R immunoreactivities (-ir) were detected in the lesions from both the mesentery and the colon. Staining analysis showed a co-localization of these markers with CGRPand PGP9.5-ir confirming presence on peptidergic positive sensory fibers in the lesions. In some of the lesions, SP-and NK1R-ir were also found to be present on purinergic nerve fibers or on infiltrating immune cells, which could possibly be mast cells. CONCLUSIONS: In the rat model of dyspareunia, IHC analysis of the implanted uterine biopsies revealed the presence of SP-and NK1Rimmunoreactivity on sensory nerve fibers innervating the lesions. These findings are consistent with observations in human endometriotic lesions and support a role of NI in the development of mechanical hyperalgesia observed in our animal model of endometriosis-induced dyspareunia. Endometriosis is a chronic, mainly estrogendependent disease characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus in the peritoneal cavity. Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3/ 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5) is an enzyme, combining 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and prostaglandin (PG) F synthase activity. AKR1C3 has been described to play a crucial role in intra-tissue steroid and prostaglandin metabolism. Expression of the enzyme in lesions is expected to lead to increased local concentrations of steroid hormones (especially estradiol) and of PGF2\u03b1. This proestrogenic environment with increased PGF2\u03b1 concentration is thought to stimulate proliferation and growth of estrogen-sensitive endometriotic lesions.

METHODS: AKR1C3 expression in human endometriotic and endometrial samples was studied by Affymetrix analysis. Localization of AKR1C3 in endometriotic lesions was performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). BAY-688, a potent and selective AKR1C3 inhibitor was generated and tested in a marmoset endometriosis model for the effect on lesion size reduction. In this model endometriosis was induced as described by Einspanier et al. (2006) . RESULTS: AKR1C3 mRNA is strongly up-regulated in human endometriotic lesions compared to control endometrium, indicating a potentially important role in endometriosis. IHC confirmed strong expression of AKR1C3 in human lesions. A novel potent and selective AKR1C3 inhibitor (BAY-688) was generated. BAY-688 showed strong efficacy in a primate endometriosis model, in which total endometriotic lesion size was reduced by ~70% of baseline after 6 weeks treatment with BAY-688. CONCLUSIONS: In marmoset monkeys with established endometriosis, BAY-688 showed a significant effect on endometriotic lesion shrinkage. These results suggest that AKR1C3 plays a crucial role in endometriosis. Since AKR1C3 is not expressed in the ovary, effects on the ovarian cycle are not expected.

This disease is a principle cause of pelvic pain and infertility. Severe endometriosis is strongly associated with junctional zone (endometrium and subendometrial myometrium interface) thickening. A growing body of evidence suggests that junctional zone hyperplasia may alter the peristaltic activity, reducing uterine transport capacity of the inner myometrium and leading to elevated retrograde flow. Using a high fidelity murine model of endometriosis, we examined whether pelvic endometriosis alters genetic and protein characteristics of the myometrium. METHODS: Donor mRFP1 transgenic female mice were induced to develop menstrual endometrium for intraperitoneal injection into menstrually synchronized wild-type C57BL/6J recipient females. Two weeks following the initial injection, recipient mice received a second inoculation of mRFP1 endometrial material. Uterine horns from age matched controls and recipients were removed two weeks after receiving the second injection and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Recipient mice with induced endometriosis exhibited myometrial thickening with a significant increase of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin immunereactivity and expression [ Figure 1 ]. In addition, significant up-regulation of additional muscle genes where observed: myosin heavy chain 11 (Myh11), smooth muscle protein 22-alpha (SM22a), and calponin 1 (Cnn1). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that endocrine signaling from ectopic endometrium can alter the molecular signature and induce thickening of the myometrium. The myometrial layer of the uterus is composed of an intricate network of smooth muscle fibers, and plays an important role in uterine tonicity. The evidence presented here supports endometriosis impacts the myometrium and may contribute to the pathophysiology of endometriosis. *Figure(s) will be available online. Resistance to conventional therapy critically raises the need for novel therapeutic options. Dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) has been associated with endometriosis in genetic studies.

Epigenetic cofactor binding mutants KLF11EAPP or KLF11del486 were generated by in vitro mutagenesis. To enable comparison of human and animal model data rat, mouse, and human DRD2 promoter activity was determined using luciferase assays. Promoter binding was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Gene expression was determined by qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. In vivo disease relevance was evaluated in a surgically induced murine endometriosis model using KLF11-/-and wild-type mice; lesional Drd2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: DRD2 was expressed in human and mouse endometrial epithelial cells and in intact endometrium. KLF11 directly bound the DRD2 promoter in endometrial cells. DRD2 Promoter binding by KLF11 resulted in repression via the region encompassing the cognate binding element. Promoter repression resulted in diminished DRD2 transcript and protein expression levels. wt-KLF11 repression was reversed when cells were treated with KLF11EAPP and KLF11D486 mutants that do not bind and recruit the epigenetic histone deacetylase or heterochromatin protein 1/histone methyl transferase mechanisms. Consistent with loss of Klf11 repression, lesions in Klf11-/-animals had activated Drd2 expression which was diminished by targeted epigenetic inhibitor therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to activation in neurons, KLF11 is a DRD2 repressor in the endometrium, primarily via selective recruitment of epigenetic corepressors rather than activators. KLF11 is thus an epigenetic modulator via tissue-specific cofactor utilization. Characterization of such differential regulatory mechanisms have translational relevance in health and disease.",

As expression of CD74 and CXCR7 is either incompletely understood or unknown, our objective was to define their expression in human eutopic endometrium and endometriotic lesions as well as in matched tissues from baboons with experimentally-induced disease. METHODS: Archival matched eutopic endometrial and endometriotic lesion tissues (N=10 proliferative stage; N=12 secretory stage) as well as control eutopic endometrial tissues from women without endometriosis (N=8 proliferative stage; N=11 secretory stage) were obtained. To determine the cause and effect relationship between eutopic and ectopic expression of these receptors, matched tissues were obtained (N=6) from baboons with experimentally-induced disease. For all studies, CD74 and CXCR7 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. H-SCORE values were separately analyzed by one-way ANOVA or planned comparisons. RESULTS: Endometriotic eutopic endometrium, but not control, expressed significantly (P<0.05) greater CD74 staining in the glandular epithelium of the basalis layer and expression decreased in a graded fashion in glands of the functionalis layer. CD74 expression in lesion epithelial cells was significantly (P<0.01) greater compared to matched eutopic samples and this expression was independent of menstrual cycle stage. A similar pattern of expression was detected in both eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissue from baboons with experimentally induced disease. CXCR7 expression in control eutopic endometrium was minimal while epithelial cells of endometriotic eutopic endometrium expressed significantly (P<0.05) higher levels compared to stroma. Endometriotic epithelial CXCR7 expression was significantly (P<0.01) greater compared to both eutopic epithelial and endometriotic stroma expression. This pattern of expression in lesion, but not eutopic endometrium was recapitulated in baboons with experimentally-induced disease. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that the ectopic lesion may influence eutopic CD74, but not CXCR7 expression and that endometriotic lesion CD74 and/or CXCR7 may contribute to MIF mediation of lesion survival. Endometriosis is a complex disease with an estimated heritable component of ~52%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have so far identified nine genome-wide significant (P< 5 x 10 -8 ) common risk variants for endometriosis, which explain <4% of heritability; whereas half of heritability is estimated to comprise of such variants.

RESULTS: Higher numbers of macrophages were found inside and in the vicinity of leiomyoma as compared to the more distant surrounding myometrium. Cellular leiomyomas showed more macrophages and mast cells than the usual type.

INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus, characterized by their growth dependence on sex steroids. Non-invasive treatments are limited to a progesterone modulator (Ulipristal -not approved in the US) and GnRH agonists. However the use of the latter is limited to 6 months as they reduce sex steroids to post-menopausal levels and thus lead to hypoestrogenic side effects including bone loss. Aim of the project was to identify an orally available, potent and selective GnRH antagonist with low PK&PD variability allowing to titrate estradiol in a way that efficacy is maintained while avoiding hypoestrogenic side effects and thus being suitable for long term treatment. METHODS: 180 hits from a screening approach have been characterized on binding and in vitro activity towards the rat, monkey and human receptor. Selected compounds have then been tested on their LH reducing ability in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Finally a cpd (BAY-784) with the most favorable profile has been administered to post-menopausal women in single escalating doses and characterized with regard to its PK &PD properties. RESULTS: BAY-784 is a potent (human IC 50. 21 nM) and selective GnRH antagonist without agonistic activity in vitro. It displays comparable functional activity at the GnRH receptor of rats and cynomolgus monkeys (rIC 50 24 nM, cynIC 50 35 nM). In ovariectomized rats a dose-dependent reduction of the plasma LH levels could be demonstrated (ED 50 4.5 mg/ kg). In the orchidectomized monkey LH suppression of up to ca. 60% from baseline was achieved with 20 mg/kg. Administration of BAY-784 to postmenopausal women was safe and well tolerated. PK variability in terms of AUC and Cmax was generally low across doses (gCV:14.9 to 36.4%). The maximum LH reduction was about 45% and showed a low variability of 27.6% (CV). CONCLUSIONS: BAY-784 revealed a favourable PK & safety profile and lead to LH with low variability of up to 45%. Whether this reduction will lead to a reduction in estradiol levels sufficient to reach the desired treatment effects in patients with uterine fibroids remains to be shown. In this work, we wanted to investigate if human fibroid stem cells do indeed produce exosomes, and evaluate factors that regulate this process (such as hypoxia) as well as possible effect on surrounding differentiated fibroid cells. METHODS: For exosome isolation, hFSCs were cultured in media with exosome-free FBS at normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Exoquick TC reagent was added to isolate exosomes. Electron microscopy and ZetaView were used to characterized hFSC derived hypoxic and normoxic exosomes. For proliferation and apoptosis studies, primary human (differentiated) fibroid cells were cultured for 48 hrs. MTT assay and Western blot were carried out to measure the level of proliferation and apoptosis. We also used MiScript PCR array human fibrosis kit to run RT-PCR for miRNA expression profiling in (hFSC) derived hypoxic vs normoxic exosomes. RESULTS: Hypoxia induced dramatic increase in exosomes production by hFSC (up to 16 fold increase) compared to normoxic-grown hFSC (P = 0.005). The hypoxic and normoxic exosomes were similar in size about 200 nm. The hypoxic exosomes induced significantly higher rate of proliferation and lower rates of apoptosis in primary fibroid cell proliferation compared to normoxic exosomes after 48 hours of treatment. PCR array revealed 3 folds or more up-regulation of 11 miRNA and 3 of these miRNAs are intricately involved in regulation the estrogen receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic human fibroid stem cells produce dramatically more exosomes that possess robust pro-oncogenic properties. This pro-proliferative paracrine stimulation of primary fibroid cells by hFSCs derived exosomes is likely mediated through miRNA. Further understanding of the cross-talk between human fibroid tumor-forming stem cells and surrounding differentiated tumor cells can provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.",

Bin Li, 1 Takashi Takeda, 2 Kenji Tsuiji, 1 Nobuo Yaegashi. 1 1 Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan; 2 Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. INTRODUCTION: Uterine leiomyomas are the most common gynecological benign tumors and greatly affect reproductive health and wellbeing. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are estrogen receptor (ER) ligands that act as estrogens in some tissues while blocking estrogen activity in others. SS5020, a new benzopyran antiestrogen, has anti-breast cancer potential in rats and mice model. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of SS5020 on uterine leiomyomas in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: In vitro study, ELT-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of Tamoxifen (TAM), SS1020 and SS5020. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay. In vivo study, human leiomyoma tumor tissues were collected from female Japanese patients at the time of hysterectomy and implanted into immunodeficient mouse. Mice were administered orally with SS5020. Then tumors were evaluated by tissue morphology, steroid receptors, apoptosis and collagen components. RESULTS: SS5020 inhibited ELT-3 cells proliferation. Xenograft model study showed that SS5020 administration inhibited the enlargement of the tumor, caused the inhibitory effect of cellular proliferation and ER, PR expression levels. Furthermore, SS5020 increased TUNEL positive cells. However, the expression levels of smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen components exhibited no significant changed. CONCLUSIONS: These experimental findings showed that SS5020 inhibited uterine leiomyoma cells proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. However, the inhibitory effect was not as strong as to affect the expression levels of SMA and collagen components.

Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA; 7 The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. INTRODUCTION: Up to 77% of women have a uterine fibroid (UF) by menopause. UF are the leading indication for hysterectomy and account for up to $39B in annual healthcare costs. Risk of UFs is heritable with disparities in UF risk, symptoms, and severity among ancestral groups. African ancestry (AA) populations have 2-3 fold higher prevalence, more severe symptoms, and earlier onset than Europeans (EA). Because up to 51% of UF cases are unaware of fibroid status and are misclassified as controls in surveys, association studies of UF risk without UF status confirmed by imaging suffer from information bias. METHODS: We conducted an association study of rare and common genetic determinants of UF risk confirmed by pelvic imaging from electronic medical records (EMR) from 6 eMERGE Network sites (N=10,227). All subjects were classified using a validated EMR algorithm (PPV 98%, NPV 96%). All samples were genotyped by GWAS arrays and a subset was also genotyped by exome arrays. RESULTS: The most statistically significant associations from transethnic meta-analysis were the intergenic SNPs rs2983218 at chr6q27 (OR=1.23, p=8x10 -10 ) and rs13103279 at chr4q34.3 (OR=0.81, p=2x10 -9 ) near genes involved in angiogenic pathways. Statistically significant associations were observed in the subset of AA cohorts for the rare (MAF<0.01) variants rs190615976 at chr17 near IGF2BP1 (OR=3.82, p=2x10 -10 ), chr2 at rs77950674 near RUFY4 (OR=4.15, p=7x10 -10 ) and rs116003406 in the 3'UTR of SLC9A4 (OR=3.57, p=3x10 -9 ), and chr4 at rs115077882 in ARFIP1 (OR=1.98, p=5x10 -9 ). In EAs the rare variant rs148308239 near NEBL on chr10 was significantly associated with UF risk (OR=0.44, p=5x10 -8 ). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest UF risk is influenced by common and rare variants, and ancestral genetic heterogeneity in UF risk is likely.",

Oksana Shynlova, 1 Yvonne Leong, 2 Harold Drutz, 2 May Alarab. 2 1 MSH, Toronto, ON, Canada; 2 MSH, Toronto, ON, Canada. INTRODUCTION: Currently pelvic organ prolapse (POP) affects almost half of postmenopausal women. Menopause has also been associated with lower urinary tract symptoms and urogenital atrophy. Local low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy (creams or tablets) can treat urinary symptoms related to atrophy, but its effect on POP is less clear. Ovarian hormones are known to influence the immune system that plays a major role in uterine tissue repair/regeneration. We investigated whether local estrogen therapy affects immune responses (cytokine expression and the presence of leukocytes) in vaginal tissue of postmenopausal patients with severe POP. METHODS: Postmenopausal women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy and anterior vaginal wall repair for POP (POPQ=3-4) were recruited. Vaginal biopsies were collected from POP patients not treated with hormone (Controls, N=14) and patients using local vaginal estrogen cream (conjugated equine estrogen) or tablets (estradiol) (N=13). One half of each sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical study, the second half was fixed in formalin. Total protein and RNA was extracted. The expression of multiple cytokines was analyzed using 17-plex Cytokine assay and RT-PCR (N=6-13/group). Leukocyte infiltration was examined by immunohistochemistry (N=10/group). RESULTS: Protein expression of cytokines (IL1b, IL6) and chemokines (IL8, MCP1, MIP1\u03b2) as well as their transcript levels were significantly (p<0.05) up-regulated by local estrogen therapy in vaginal tissue of postmenopausal POP patients as compared to untreated Controls. IFN\u0264 protein was not detected in Controls, however was upregulated in all samples from Estrogen group. Hormone-induced chemokines play important roles in leukocyte infiltration, thus we examined vaginal tissues using pan-leukocyte marker CD45 and CD68 (expressed by tissue macrophages). We detected a significant increase in the number of CD68+ cells in the sub-epithelium/lamina propria (140\u00b157 vs 32\u00b15 cells/mm2) and muscularis (66\u00b110 vs 30\u00b17 cells/mm2) layers of estrogen-treated vaginal tissues compared to Controls. CONCLUSIONS: An activated local immune response was detected in the vaginal tissue of postmenopausal POP patients after estrogen treatment. The immune alterations included significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which coincided with infiltration of immune cells . We speculate that the infiltrated leukocytes may play a role in the vaginal tissue repair and remodeling .",

INTRODUCTION: A father's knowledge of menstrual symptoms is usually considered limited, yet there have been no studies on paternal understanding of menstruation. As not every family has a mother, a well-informed father can be essential for ongoing health of adolescent daughters. This study aimed to establish the degree of understanding and concern of fathers of adolescent girls with menstrual symptoms. METHODS: Adolescent patients attending the Royal Children's Hospital outpatient gynaecology clinic for dysmenorrhoea and/or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and their parents were surveyed about the father's understanding of menstrual symptoms and potential medications, as well as involvement/concerns with his daughter's health care.",

The fathers' knowledge of menstrual symptoms was poorer than mothers, although most knew of HMB (93%) and mood swings (87%). A large percentage of both fathers and mothers answered 'don't know' or didn't answer questions about potential long-term health impacts and side-effects of medications, although parents were clearly concerned about side-effects. Of fathers, 80% felt sympathetic/concerned, 53% helpless and 13% frustrated when daughters were in pain. Parental perception of their daughter's pain was comparable within families, with mothers more likely to overestimate and fathers underestimate. When asked about impacts on the family, 93% of fathers (79% of mothers) worried about their daughter's welfare and 60% (21%) about schooling; 54% (69%) noted impacts on family activities and 33% (53%) took leave from work to care for daughters. CONCLUSIONS: We present the first insight into father's knowledge of their daughter's menstrual health. Overall, fathers have an incomplete picture of menstrual symptoms or side effects of common medications. Even in this cohort, which could be expected to be well informed due to their daughter's attendance at a tertiary hospital, it is clear that both mothers and fathers lack sufficient knowledge to make fully informed decisions for daughters. This highlights the need for carefully tailored education material that addresses knowledge gaps and parental concerns. HIV-treatment has evolved rapidly with most HIV positive people in Western world being on continuous suppressive combination Antiretroviral Treatment (cART) with restored immunity and life expectancy approaching that of general population. METHODS: A retrospective study of all 369 women attending HIV care at our hospital at least twice during 2002-2013. Their mean (SD) age was 35y (\u00b19) at the beginning of the follow-up. All women were invited to annual PAP-smear follow-up. Altogether 2056 PAP-smears were collected and analyzed using the Bethesda system. Risk factors for SIL (combined LSIL, ASC-H and HSIL) were analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: The distribution of PAP-smears findings at the beginning of follow-up was 60% normal, 25% ASC-US, 10% LSIL, 0,3% ASC-H, 2,7% HSIL and 1.6 AGC-NOS, whereas the last PAP-smear findings were 90% normal, 7 % ASC-US, 3% LSIL, 0,3% ASC-H and 0,3% HSIL. Altogether 53% of the women were on HAART and 86% on cART at the beginning and end of the follow-up, respectively. The corresponding mean CD4 lymphocyte counts (/\u00b5L) were 465 (range 6-1577) and 615 (range 51-2138). Significant risk factors for SIL are shown in Table. Mode of transmission, country of origin, smoking, hepatitis C serostatus or age were not risk factors for SIL. Maternal obesity is associated with poor reproductive outcomes and their offspring have greater risk of adverse metabolic sequelae and fetal anomalies. The precise mechanisms behind these associations are undetermined. We hypothesized that obese women have an altered follicular fluid (FF) metabolite profile compared to nonobese women.",

University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. INTRODUCTION: Uterine fibroids are a common finding in infertility patients. Impaired implantation has been proposed to contribute to compromised fertility. While the most recent findings suggest no difference in the endometrial receptivity signature in women with intramural fibroids, there are no data on the decidualization potential of endometrial stromal fibroblasts from women with fibroids. METHODS: Endometrial stromal fibroblasts (eSF) were isolated from 5 women with intramural fibroids (F) and 5 women with no uterine pathology (NUP) and treated with 1mM progesterone (P 4 ) (with 10nM estradiol (E 2 )) for 14 days, and 0.5mM of 8-bromo-cAMP for 96 hours. IGFBP1 and prolactin secretion was measured by ELISA. Expression of P 4 -and cAMP-regulated genes and decidualization markers (IGFBP1, prolactin, HOXA10, EBAF, SST, FOXO1A, GPX3), steroidogenic enzymes HSD17B1, HSD17B2, aromatase, and estrogen (ESR1, ESR2) and progesterone receptor (PRA, PRB) mRNAs were determined by realtime qRT-PCR. Cell morphology was analyzed under light microscopy. In addition, mid-secretory endometrium (MSE) was obtained from 8 women with F and 4 with NUP, and subjected to microarray analysis on the HU133 Affymetrix platform with subsequent bioinformatics analysis; validation was performed with Fluidigm array. Menstrual cycle phase was assigned by histology, hormone levels and bioinformatics methods. RESULTS: Large number of transcripts was significantly dysregulated throughout the menstrual cycle in F vs NUP. Upon validation, there was an increased expression of IGFBP1 mRNA, but not prolactin, in F vs NUP tissue, but no significant difference was found in cultured cells on mRNA or protein level. No difference was seen in SST, GPX3, EBAF, FOXO1A or HSD17B1, HSD17B2 and aromatase mRNA between F and NUP on tissue levels or in eSF decidualized with either E 2 +P 4 or cAMP.

Glucocorticoids (GC) are crucial in the inflammatory response that accompanies tissue remodeling and influence several aspects of early pregnancy. Local tissue concentrations of GC are modulated by the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD), which interconverts cortisol and cortisone. Although the type 1 isoform (11\u03b2-HSD1) is present in term decidua, its expression and regulatory mechanisms have not been characterized in first trimester maternal tissues. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of inflammatory mediators as regulators of GC balance, by assessing the effect of IL1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 and IFNg on 11\u03b2-HSD1 expression in cultured first trimester decidual cells (FT-DCs).

As control (n=7), we obtained endometrium and plasma samples from healthy, cycle stage-matched women (University of North Carolina, USA). An ELISA (R&D systems) was performed on plasma samples from normal and endometriosis patients. RESULTS: Based on samples analyzed so far, endometriosis patients showed no significant changes in pooled analyses of IL-33 levels across time. When stratified by disease stage, IL-33 levels were higher at 3 months vs. 2 weeks post-surgery in early stage (stages I-II), but not in advanced stage patients (stages III-IV). When compared to normal patients, levels of IL-33 were lower only in 2 week post-surgery vs. normal samples. After stratification, early stage patients had lower levels of IL-33 at both pre-and 2 week post-surgery, but the differences disappeared at 3 months. No differences were found in normal vs. advanced stage patients. Tissue analysis and mechanistic studies are in progress. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary analysis indicates that serum IL-33 levels are influenced by lesion removal and seem to achieve closer to normal levels at 3 months. Further studies are in progress. ",

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors and immune cells extracted and incorporated into the vaginal equivalents. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence using antibodies against cytokeratin, Lamin and collagen identified the three key structures of the equivalent (epithelium, basement membrane and stromal component). Primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) infected with HIV-1 or free HIV-1 viral load were co-cultured on the apical surface of our equivalents to measure virus transcytosis 24, 48, 72h post-infection in the multilayer vaginal model. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental model indicates that the 3D vaginal equivalent engineered in our laboratory is similar to native vaginal tissue, and can be used to study intravaginal delivery of microbicides, contraceptives and/or anti-HIV agents. Melatonin is an indoleamine involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms, sleep and food-intake. Apart from the pineal gland, many peripheral tissues express both melatonin and its receptors. This ubiquitous distribution suggests that, in addition to endocrine actions of pineal derived indoleamine, locally produced melatonin might exert autocrine/paracrine effects in different tissues. This should be the case in ovary, where the expression of both melatonin and its receptors has been demonstrated in human granulosa-luteal cells.",

National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. INTRODUCTION: Cholesterol trafficking in steroidogenic cells has been studied primarily using biochemical methods and thus can only provide insight into the average behavior of cells ignoring any spatial specialization of organelles in cells. TopFluor\u2122 Cholesterol (TFCh) is a cholesterol with a fluorescent molecule on the side-chain. TFCh may allow live-cell imaging of cholesterol up through the side-chain cleavage step since the fluorescent molecule will be cleaved with the side-chain. Given the selective nature of the P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc), the structure of TFCh may not be recognized by the mitochondrial transporters or P450scc. Since the fluorescent molecule is on the side-chain, successful import and cleavage of the side-chain should result in 2 fluorescent byproducts (an aldehyde and subsequent conversion to alcohol by aldolases). The objective of this study was to determine if TFCh can be used to study mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking in steroidogenic cells. METHODS: Mouse Leydig tumor cells (mLTC-1), which retain their response to hCG stimulation, were cultured and exposed to TFCh in methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin overnight to exchange unlabeled cholesterol in the plasma membrane for TFCh. Experimental conditions were control, hCG 100mIU/mL, aminoglutetimide (AG) 172\u00b5M, and hCG+AG (same as other concentrations). After 6 hours, cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in methanol:chloroform:water to extract polar and nonpolar molecules. Thin layer chromatography was performed on silica gel with a solvent system of cyclohexane:ethyl acetate. The plates were fluorescently imaged and the peaks quantified. RESULTS: All conditions showed 4 dominant peaks in addition to the source spot from most to least polar as follows: by-product peak #1, free TFCh, by-product peak #2, and esterified TFCh. The free TFCh peak was approximately 400x larger than the two by-product peaks and approximately 75x larger than the esterified TFCh peak. The hCG condition showed the by-product peaks 50% greater than the other 3 conditions as expected since AG inhibits P450scc and thus cleavage of the fluorescent side-chain even in the presence of hCG. CONCLUSIONS: TFCh is a novel probe for studying mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking in steroidogenic cells. A potential difficulty with imaging TFCh in mitochondria is the large difference in intensity of the free cholesterol versus the by-product peaks, which will ultimately require a sensitive high dynamic range camera. syndrome, also known as Mullerian aplasia, is a congenital anomaly characterized by the absence of the uterus and vagina. MRKH affects 1/5000 females and is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea in adolescent girls. Although WNT4, LHX1, and HNF1B gene mutations and copy number variants have been identified in some patients, the genetic basis for most cases of MRKH is unknown. MRKH often occurs without a family history, which has led us to hypothesize that affected patients have heterozygous de novo mutations. The purpose of this study was to identify candidate genes in MRKH patients.",

CONCLUSIONS: In addition to important population frequency information provided by ExAC, the incorporation of PhenoDB allows more detailed phenotypic analysis. This should improve the detection of meaningful genetic variants.

We hypothesized that ghrelin signaling in the hypothalamus is blunted under a low protein diet condition and therefore, it does not stimulate diet intake during late pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, diet and water intake, expression of genes related to appetite regulation and hypothalamic ghrelin signaling in response to intraventricular (ICV) injection of ghrelin in pregnant rats fed LP diet were investigated. METHODS: Female SD rats were fed a normal (CT) or LP diet from Day 1 of pregnancy. On Day 21, 0.5 \u00b5g ghrelin was given into the third ventricle.

INTRODUCTION: Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a major cause of failure to achieve pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer treatment cycles. However, no formal criteria defining the number of failed cycles or the total number of embryos transferred in these IVF attempts exist. Considering the current success rate of IVF treatments, outcomes of IVF procedures performed between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015 were analyzed to determine the cumulative number of embryos needed to achieve 80% probability of pregnancy with demonstrated fetal cardiac activity. METHODS: From January 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015, 644 patients underwent IVF or embryo transfer procedures involving 2093 embryos. 427 women had positive HCG tests 7 days after transfer of 1364 embryos, resulting in 381 FHT demonstrated by 6 weeks gestation. Of the 381 positive FHT, 55 had preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) and 326 had no PGS. The percentage of pregnancies with demonstrable FHT was determined for each number of embryos transferred, and cumulative pregnancy rates were computed. RESULTS: Cumulative rates to achieve fetal cardiac activity compared with total number of embryos transfer are shown in the following graph (Fig 1) . The rate of FHT after 1 embryo transferred double from 13% to 29% with PGS. Whereas, after a cumulative of 4 embryos transferred the rate of FHT was 75% amongst PGS and 82% with no PGS. CONCLUSIONS: The total number of embryos transferred to achieve 80% of pregnancies with FHT is 4. After a cumulative of 4 embryos transferred, PGS does not increase probability of successful pregnancy. PGS should be used to make the diagnosis rather than evaluation of implantation failure. Individuals who have not achieved successful pregnancy after transferring 4 embryos should be evaluated for implantation failure. *Figure(s) will be available online. Elevated progesterone (P) in a fresh ART transfer cycle results in decreased implantation and live birth. Recent evidence has shown elevated P likely advances the endometrium creating asynchrony with the embryo and thus implantation failure. If the window of implantation is closing as the embryo attempts to implant, there may be difficulty with trophoblastic invasion, leading to failure of early pregnancies. Our objective was to evaluate if P on the day of trigger was associated with spontaneous abortion (SAB) rates in fresh transfers. The secondary objective was to determine if P interacted with SAB risk differently in fresh versus FET cycles.",

Autologous ART cycles with fresh transfers or FET from 2011-2013 were included if P was measured on the day of trigger in the initial fresh cycle. The primary outcome was spontaneous abortion. GEE modeling was performed to control for age, embryo quality, embryo stage, and repeated cycles. Interaction testing was performed to determine if the effect of P on SAB was similar in fresh and FET cycles. P was treated as a continuous variable except in additional analyses comparing P threshold of 2ng/mL. RESULTS: 4,123 fresh and FET transfer cycles were included, resulting in 1,547 fresh and 491 FET pregnancies. The overall SAB rate was 19.9% among fresh cycles and 18.9% in FET cycles. P as a continuous variable was not associated with SAB in fresh cycles (OR 0.93, 95%CI 0.68-1.29). P >2 ng/ml was not associated with SAB in fresh cycles (OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.24-3.05). Interaction testing of P and cycle type indicated P had similar associations with SAB in FET and fresh cycle (P=0.95). Similar results were found in both groups after adjusting for age, embryo quality, and embryo stage. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated P on the day of trigger during the initial fresh cycle was not associated with increased SAB in fresh transfer cycles or in FET cycles. Despite elevated P likely advancing the window of implantation, once implantation occurs, pregnancies are no longer negatively impacted by progesterone. INTRODUCTION: PCOS has been associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) However, the underlying mechanism(s) have not been clearly elucidated. Previously we demonstrated alterations in skeletal muscle fiber type and decreased estrogen (ER), insulin (IR), and androgen (AR) receptor gene expression with PCOS. Since skeletal muscle represents the major site for insulin mediated glucose disposal, we sought to determine alterations in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism that could explain this relationship.",

Protein levels of the ER alpha, AR-A, and AR-B were evaluated using routine western blot techniques. Phosphorylation levels of second messengers involved in glucose homeostasis were also examined. . Levels of phospho-MAPK, phospho-IRS-1, and phospho-JNK were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle in patients with PCOS demonstrates changes associated with decreased glucose metabolism and a relative hyperinsulinemia. Our findings support a PCOS phenotype with a decreased oxidative capacity secondary to changes in fiber type, along with alterations at numerous points in insulin signaling pathways that affect the ability of skeletal muscle to increase uptake of glucose. Oral supplementation with myo-inositol, a new insulin sensitizer agent was demonstrated to enhance insulin sensitivity and improve the clinical and hormonal characteristics of patients in PCOS. Moreover Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a biological antioxidant, has been reported to improve glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes, presumably by improving insulin sensitivity and reduction of oxidative stress. This study investigates the potential role of these two molecules in improving PCOS characteristics METHODS: Forty overweight PCOS women (BMI>25; age range 18-35 years) were enrolled. Anthropometric characteristics, hirsutism score, ovarian ultrasound, an oral glucose tolerance test and hormonal parameters, including AMH were evaluated before and after combined treatment of alpha-lipoic acid (800 mg), myoinositol (2000 mg) and folic acid (400 mcg) daily for six months. RESULTS: All patients completed the study therapy. A significant improvement in mean F-G score and BMI was obtained after six months of treatment, while WHR values did not significantly changed. All studied patients experienced a significant increase of number of cycles in six months. A significant ireduction of androgen levels (in terms of free androgen index, androstenedione, DHEAS) was observed. At baseline, AMH serum levels were above the normal range and after six months of treatment we observed a significant decrease. At baseline, participants presented a mean insulinemic response to OGTT and a normal peripheral insulin sensitivity expressed as HOMA-IR. After therapy, we did not observe a significant modification in peripheral insulin sensitivity and in insulin secretion during the OGTT CONCLUSIONS: This combined therapy was shown to restore the menstrual pattern and to improve the hormonal milieu in PCOS women, with a mechanism that, albeit not fully clarified, seems to be insulin independent and instead targeted to the ovary itself. Further investigations on a larger population are needed to confirm these results and to elucidate the specific mechanism of action of this therapy.",
