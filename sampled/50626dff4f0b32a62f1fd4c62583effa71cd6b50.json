At onset of development, the kidney rudiment is composed of a mesenchyme and an epithelium, the ureter bud. The mesenchyme stimulates the ureter epithelium to grow and branch into the mesenchyme, and the ureter bud cells Stimulate a part of the mesenchyme to form a new epithelium. This new epithelium will gradually develop into the distal and proximal tubules and into the different epithelial cells of the glomerulus (i) . The newly formed epithelial cells will stimulate both the differentiation of the stroma and the ingrowth of blood vessels. The different types of cells gradually begin to produce extracellular matrix components typical for each tissue compartment (2) (3) (4) (5) .",

One of the earliest events is an increased cell proliferation (6) (7) . The expression of the c-myc protooncogene correlates with cell proliferation. The cells also express the N-myc protoonco~ene at early stages, but N-myc expression is more transient than c-myc expression. Taken together, these studies suggest that c-myc could be involved in proliferation, while N-myc together with other transcription factors could be controlling the conversion of the mesenchyme into epithelium. One possibility is that N-myc stimulates genes important for epithelial cell morphogenesis (7) . At later stages, when the cells convert into a polarized epithelium, the expression of cell adhesion proteins typical for epithelial cells (laminin, E-cadherin) increases. The laminin isoform produced by developing kidney epithelial cells has the chain composition A-BI-B2. The cells also produce the a6bl integrin. Antibody perturbation experiments suggest that this integrin is required for the development of kidney tubules and it could act by binding to the carboxyterminal ends of laminin A-BI-B2 (2) (3) (4) (5) . It would thus be important to identify transcription factors that stimulate synthesis of laminin chains and their receptors.",

Thus far only EGF has been studied systematically. In this context Renal EGF expression is decreased after acute tubular necrosis but the EGF receptor is up-regulated in viable cells. Immuno-detectable EGF is increased in cells which normally do not express the growth factor (eg proximal tubule) suggesting that enhanced EGF binding plays a role in the mitogenesis. The source of this EGF is not clear but is probably from the circulation. TGF ~x may also activate EGF receptors and this may arise from infiltrating cells. Exogenous EGF has been shown to accelerate recovery from acute tubular necrosis in the rat. However, in recent studies (Killion, Canfield, Norman, Fine and Rosenthal, Abstr. Am Soc Urol 1992) autotransplanted, ischemic pig kidneys failed to recover at an accelerated rate if exposed to EGF during the 72 hour period of cold-ischemia despite evidence of a mitogenic response to the EGF.

Current research has focused upon demonstrating whether or not the expression of given growth factor or cytokine is increased in a certain disease and upon where this expression localizes in the kidney. Almost all reported results are positive. In the glomerulus there is increased expression of PDGF, TGFfl and possibly IGF-1 in various models of renal disease. Likewise early evidence suggests increased PDGF expression in the interstitium in many diseases in which this compartment is involved. Because prognosis in many forms of human disease shows a closer relationship with the degree of interstitial scarring and tubular atrophy than with glomerular scarring, the mechanisms underlying the former process need to be investigated. Existing possibilities include damage to peritubularcapillaries or absorption of filtered protein both of which could induce tubular damage and atrophy. Since tubular cells express growth factors (EGF, IGF-1, PDGF, IL6, GM-CSF) it is not difficult to conceive of how such injury may set up paracrine stimuli to cause fibroblast proliferation extracellular matrix deposition and attraction of monocytes macrophages and polymorphs into the interstitial compartment.",

Similarly, in human and murine models of ARPKD, abnormal quantitative (increased amount) and qualitative (apical membrane location) of EGF-receptor expression has been reported. In ADPKD cystic epithelial in vitro, abnormalities in NaKATPase expression appear to mediate tubular fluid secretion. A complete reversal of Na + pump polarity has been demonstrated, with active apical NaKATPase activity driving vectorial transport of Na + in a net basal to apical direction. In murine models of ARPKD additional abnormalities of NaKATPase expression have been demonstrated. Increased Na + pump activity and apical NaKATPase expression have been noted in cystic collecting duct epithelium in a marked exaggeration of normal tubular developmental profiles.

Since any elevation Of urinary oxalate (Ox) concentration contributes considerably more to calcium oxalate (CaOx) saturation and hence to the risk of CaOx deposition than does calcium, attention is focussed on urinary Ox. Reliable methods (enzymatic and HPLC) are now available. Urines are best collected into bottles containing 6 N HC1 in order to attain pH <2.Neglecting acidification or using older eolorimetric methods may yield spurious results. Ox excreEion in 24 h urines obtained in over 400 normal children aged 2-15 yea~s (1) showed similar mean values for the different age grmups (range 0.30-0.39, mean 0.33 mmol per 1.73 m 2 surface area (SA)). These values are close to those (0.30 +/-0.08 SD) reported in adults (2) . For infants, data are scarce. Eleven preterm infants aged 4-8 days (mean birth weight 2.1 kg) excreted between 0.06 and 0.40 mmol per 1.73 m ~ SA (mean 0.19) . Ox excretion thus parallels SA, the upper limit of normal being 0.5 mmol (45 mg)/24 h per 1.73 m ~. Since accurately timed urine collections are difficult to obtain, data for Ox are usually related to urinary creatinine (Cr). These ratios, being log normally distributed, are far higher in infants than in older children (3, 4) . This decrease through-ouE childhood is to be expected since Cr excretion is proportional to weight and not to SA (3), e.g. a 5 kg infant would excrebe 1/7 of adult oxalate yet 1/20 of adult crestinine. During the first ten days of life Ox/Cr ratios are rising and then remain constant up to two months. Higher ratios are seen in preterm infants than in term infants. This is accentuated after ten days by formula feeding as compared to breastmilk feeding, as is sho~n below:",

Even when known causes are excluded, Ca intestinal hyperabsorption or impaired renal tubular reabsorption or increased bone resorption seem to play a different role in each patient. The distinction among these three different causes is crucial since treatment varies according to the primary mechanism. Certrain diagnostic tests may be of help but cannot eliminate uncertainty. The reasons for this uncertainty lie in the complex feedback mechanisms regulating calcium metabolism and renal excretion, which make it difficult to distinguish between primary and secondary events. If genetic factors are involved in causing this disorder, an abnormality in calcium transport across the cell membrane is a likely mechanism. However, we should measure calcium transport across the membrane of a cell which is not affected by the mechanisms (hormonal, humoral etc....) involved in calcium homeostasis. Erythrocytes are an appropriate candidates, providing the genetic mechanism involved in calcium transport across the plasma membrane is similar to that regulating calcium transport across the plasma membrane of the ceils (tubular, intestinal ..) directly involved in favouring an increased urinary calcium excretion.",

Even though the dietary content of oxalate is important in determining the excretion, genetic factors must be involved in causing the variability of urinary oxalate in the individual patients maintained on a diet with a fixed amount of oxalate. Oxalate transport in erythrocytes may be evaluated as self exchange through plasma membrane. Borsatti and coll. found a more rapid oxalate trasport was found in the 70% of the patients with idiopathic Ca-oxalate urolithiasis. In spite of its high frequence in urolithiasis the defect was not correlated with urine oxalate excretion, but was associated to a faster excretion of oxalate after an oral load. In the patients with primary hyperparathyroidism or genetic defect of oxalate metabolism enzymes, oxalate transport was not altered. In the families with urolithiasis the alteration of oxalate self exchange appeared to be genetically determined and segregated as an autosomal, monogenic, dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity. The inhibition of the transport by stilbenes showed that it occurred through membrane anion channel (band 3). Moreover, glycosaminoglyeans corrected the erythrocyte defect and reduced urine oxalate excretion. These findings suggest that in patients with urolithiasis there may be a defect in the cellular synthesis of glycosaminoglycans. This may cause a defect in the inhibition of protein kinase phosphorilation function and an increased phosphorilated state of band 3 and of its transport activity. There is evidence of an anion exchanger encoded by the same gene as that of erythrocyte band 3 in basolateral membrane of alpha intercalated cells of the collecting tubule. As this cell seoerned H +, the defect of th 9 anion exchanger may partly justify the alterations in urine acidification found in idiopathic urolithiasis. A difficult regulation of cellular pH was also shown in the lymphocytes of the patients with urolithizsis and hypercalcuria, who had low cytoplasmatic pH, but the cause of the alteration was not clear.",

R. Cohen-Luria, G. Rimon and A. Moran*, Departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion university of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel. Prostaglandins of the E series induce diuresis and natrittresis. This effect is mainly attributes to inhibition of the antidiuretic hormone (AVP)-induced cAMP production in the cortical collecting ducts. In the present study a direct effect of PGE2 on ouabain binding and Na,K-ATPase activity in a clone of MDCK cells (established renal cell line that expresses properties of the renal collecting duct) is presented. Incubation of the cells with low concentrations (pM) of PGE2 produced a concomitant inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity in the cell homogenate and reduction in ouabain binding to the intact cells. The half maximal concentrations of PGE2 for reduction of ouabain binding and inhibition of Na, K-ATPase activity were similar (IC50 of about 0.1 pM). Ten nanomolar of PGE2 caused maximal inhibition. At this concentration the activity of the Na,K-ATPase and ouabain binding was reduced by about 40-50%. The inhibition was apparent within 10 minutes of incubation of the cells with PGE2. Scatchard analysis of ouabain binding demonstrated that PGE2 treatment reduced the number of ouabain binding sites without a change in the dissociation constant (Kd = 366+-38 and 372247 nM; Bmax = 1.103-+0.114 and 0.557-+0.094 pmol/mg (P<0.01), for control and PGE2 pretreated cells, respectively). Ten nanomolar of PGE1 or PGF2a, (a concentration 10.000 fold the IC50 for PGE2) did not affect ouabain binding or Na,K-ATPase activity, suggesting that the inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase is rather specific to a PGE2 receptor. Treatment of the cells with NaF caused a dose dependent decrease in ouabain binding (40 and 80% for 13 and 50 mM NaF, respectively). Hence, it is conceivable that the mechanism of action of Na,K-ATPase inhibition involves activation of G proteins. Three lines of evidences indicate that an increase in intracellular cAMP is involved in the inhibition of ouabain binding: a. forskolin, a stimulator of the adenylate cyclase; b. di-butyryl-or 8-bromo-cAMP, permeable cAMP analogues; c. theophilline, IBMX and RO-20174, phosphodiesterase inhibitors. These agents inhibited ouabain binding similarly to the effect achieved by PGE2, in a dose dependent manner. The simultaneous addition of these agents with PGE2 did not have an additive inhibitory effect on ouabain binding, suggesting that cAMP is a possible mediator in this regulatory process of PGE2 on the Na, K-ATPase in these cells. The data are consistent with the notion that the mechanism of the diuretic/natriuretic effect of PGE2 in the collecting tubule, in addition to the inhibition of AVP activity, may result from a direct reduction in the number of the Na,K-ATPase active units via a prostaglandin receptor. We have previously demonstrated the existence of an inverse relationship between changes in [Pi] i, related to age or brought about by alterations in Pi supply, and changes in Na \u00a7 cotransport. However, age related differences in [Pi]i alone could not explain the high rates of renal Pi transport observed during growth (Barac-Nieto et al. Am. J. Physiol. 261:F153, 1991) . We have therefore explored the possibility that GH contributes to the high rates of renal Pi transport by a mechanism independent of changes in [Pi]~. Net renal tubular transport of Pi (TPi) was measured in vivo, and the NMR-visible [Pi]i was measured in perfused kidneys of 8-week-old genetically GH-deficient dwarf rats (Harlan Olac, Bicester, England) , and in dwarf rats treated with GH (i00 ~g /day twice a day s.c., for 3 days). In addition, we evaluated the effect of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGFI, i0 \"8 M) on 32p uptake (TPi) Thus, in the whole animal, changes in TPi due to GH occur in the absence of significant changes in [Pi] }. In OK cells, the effect of IGFI on TPi is independent of changes in [Pi] ~ and is additive to that of low [Pi] ~.",

Hemodialysis prescription in children needs on the one hand to choice the type of dialysis modality and on the other hand to determine the dialysis dosis prescription. Today, the dialysis modality is based on the recent technology advancements : conventionnal or highly permeable membranes (hydraulic and molecular permeabilities, area, biocompatibility), acetate or bicarbonate or buffer free (biofiltration, BF) dialysate, ultrafiltration control, diffusive (HD) or convective (hemofiltration, HF) or diffusive and convective (hemodiafiltration, HDF) epuration, ultrafiltration (UF) rate and/or sodium (NaD) dialysate modelling, compartimental epuration against water (NaD modelling) or phosphate (bicarbonate modelling) cellular sequestration. The first goal is dialysis tolerance specially weight loss over session : low extracorporeal blood volume (capillary membranes), UF control (volumetric) dialysate composition (NaD level and bicarbonate as buffer) and only for a few patients UF rate and NaD modelling can be used. The second choice is guided by the quality of epuration. A highly permeable membrane allows the combination of diffusive (low molecular weight compounds like urea) and convective (higher molecular weight compounds, middle molecular uremic toxins or B2 microglobulin) blood epuration during the same session time (HDF). Most of these membranes have high biocompatibility, only some of these ones are sterilisated without ethylen exyde. But despite a larger range of molecular weight compounds epuration (ie B2 microglobulin) and increement of cardiovascular stability (HF effect) conventionnal HDF with highly permeable membranes is only occasionnaly performed in children (expensiveness of these management). Perhaps on line HDF (restitution solution directly elaborated from the dialysate) will give a new chance to this very efficient (quality of epuration and tolerance) dialysis modality. Use of highly permeable membranes requires enhancement of dialysate purity (to limit retrofiltration adverse effects i e endotoxia) adjustment of dialysate composition (to limit buffer or calcium intoxication) and monitoring of the risk of fast epuration (osmotic syndrom). Today, dialysis dosis prescription is based on the normalized whole body urea clearance determinated by the ratio : urea cleared volume (KT) over urea volume of distribution (V). The goal is the adjustment of KT/V for the protein catabolic rate (PCRn nutrition and catabolism) to obtain a low urea time average concentration (TAC urea lower than 20mmol/l). Adaptation of the quality of epuration (KT/V, TAC urea) to the quality of nutrition (caloric versus protein intake, PCRn) offers to each dialysed child the highest chance to low dialysis morbidity or even mortality. Single pool urea kinetic modelling is the simplest way for calculation of : KT/V (delivered dialysis deals), PCRn (quality of nutrition, caloric versus protein intake) and TAC urea (dialysis adequacy). Because of the real but only relative inaccuracy of the single pool model, partial dialysate collection, direct calculation, percent reduction of urea over time, two hours post-session urea level (to avoid error of postdialysis urea rebound) and two pool urea kinetic modelling are proposed. Each of these calculations (except total dialysate collection) are approximations and so the results are more informative in the follow up of each patient as in the comparison of different patients. HD prescription in children has to choice the best technology modality adapted to each patient with respect of his cost. Assessment of the adequacy of HD in children has not only to take into account biological calculations (KT/V) but also to refer to clinical results (acute tolerance, long term morbidity). Infants with chronic renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have attracted a great deal of attention from the pediatric nephrology community because of the high risk nature of these patients. Technological advances and increasing clinical expertise in the fields of dialysis and transplantation has maintained the controversy as to which of these techniques might be considered the optimum form of therapy in this population.",

While long-term peritoneal dialysis is available to infants of any age, transplantation in children 6-12 months of age is also possible. In most cases~ however~ transplantation should probably he reserved for those patients who are do~Dg p@orly on diaSys~% or who are not achieving growth a~o/or ueve\u2022 mltestones. It is yet to determined whether and when infants should be grafted. Arguments pro and contra the delay of kidney transplantation will be pointed out. Criteria for optimal treatment should include patient and graft survival but have to stress somatic and psychosocial development. The graft survivals compare unfavourably to the results obtained in older children, especially in infants, which could be explained by the hightened non-specific immune reactivity in small children. Data on dialysis treatment in very small children are rare. In our own experience 2 children < 2 out of 4 years died on CAPD. Multicenter studies including all children with CAPD/CCPD reported a 1 year survival rate of 90%, which is comparable to the results of kidney transplantation. Other parameters like growth and mental development as well as the psychosocial strain on the child and his family have to be considered. In infants growth rates can be normalized by aggressive nutrition, i.e. nasogastric tube feeding. Daily subcutaneous application of growth hormone can achieve normal growth rates in older children on dialysis. Erythropoietin treatment eliminates the necessity of blood transfusions. New aspects with high dosages of calcitriol will improve the renal osteodystrophy. Conclusion: Renal transplantation in small children remains a challenge for pediatric nephrologists and the optimal timing of renal transplantation in small children depends on multiple preconditions. Recent progress with dialysis treatment may shift the balance towards continuous peritoneal dialysis, at least for children less than one year of age.",

Sublethal ischemia induce~ a variety of structural changes including the loss of apical brush border, cytoskeletal disintegration, and a redistribution of membrane proteins into a non-polar configuration. To determine if heat shock proteins might be involved in restoration of cellular integrity following an isc/lemic insult, we examined the induction, elaboration and distribution of HSP-72 in rat kidneys at 15 minutes, 2, 6 and 24 hours after 45 minutes of renal ischemia. The ischemic injury resulted in a marked induction of HSP-72 mRNA which peaked at 2 hours and declined to near basal levels by 24 hours of reflow. A small amount of constitutive HSP-72 was present in soluble, but not microsomal fraction of proteins obtained from uninjured kidneys. After 15 minutes of reflow, there was a shift from the soluble to mic~l fraction and frc~ 2 to 24 hours of reflow HSP-72 increased in quantity both in the microsfm~l and soluble fractions. Localization of HSP-72 by confocal microscopy demonstrated that the protein is restricted to the apical domain at 15 minutes, is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in a vesicular pattern at 2 and 6 hours reflow and has migrated away from the apical domain toward the basolateral domain by 24 hours. These studies indicate that heat shock response is induced by an ischemic renal injury and the elaboration and localization of these proteins are consistent with the recovery of cellular structure and polarity after an ischemic insult. The specific pattern of localization suggests that HSP-72 may interact with misplaced or daz~aged membrane proteins or with cyteskeletal elements to assist in the stabilization, repair and repolarization of epithelial cells.",

Renal medullary hypoxia derives from the countercurrent mechanism that permits not only solutes to be concentrated along a corticopapillary gradient but also oxygen to difi'u~e from the descending to the ascending branches of the vasa recta. In this region, the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (mTAL) avidly consumes oxygen for sodium chloride transport, necessary for the generation of concentration gradients. The net result is that renal medullary pO 2 falls to very low levels. In this hypoxic environment, the mTALs are particularly susceptible to excessive workload and may be a prime target of injury. By contrast, in the cortex, glomerular filtration and bulk reabsorption of solutes along the proximal tubule are supported by an exceptionally generous blood flow, which equals nearly a quarter of the total cardiac output. Because of high tissue perfusion, over the metabolic needs of tubules, cortical pO2 is generally high. Nonetheless, in this region, medullary rays (which are expansions of the renal medulla into the cortex) receive a substantial portion of their oxygen supply from desaturated blood ascending from the renal medulla and may also be particularly vulnerable to hypoxic injury, during renal hypoperfusion",

            "text": "We hope this symposium will excite and interest you and demonstrate the significant advances that have taken place in the area of genetic renal disease in recent years. Alport syndrome (AS) is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive hematuric nephritis with typical ultrastructural changes of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) -such as combined thinning and thickening with splitting of the lamina densa -and sensorineural deafness. Ocular changes, lenticonus anterior and macular changes may be found. The association of AS with diffuse esophageal leiomyomatosis (DL) has been reported in a few cases. AS is a phenotypically heterogeneous disease, with two predominant clinica~ypes :juvenile-onset end stage ren~_l disease (ESRD), and adult-onset ESRD with or without deafness. An altered composition of the Alport GBM has been suspected based on the observation that Goodpasture autoantibodies fail to bind to Alport GBM, and that a minority of AS transplanted patients developped anti-GBM glomerulonephritis, with failure of these antibodies to bind to Alport GBM. The absence of ~3 and ~4 (IV) collagen chains from some AS GBM by immunohistochemical studies adds substantial evidence that AS is a type IV collagen disease. AS appears to be inherited as a dominant X-linked trait in most cases, as shown by pedigree analysis and linkage studies, the data of which enabled mapping the AS locus tO Xq 22. Recently, a gene (COL4AS) coding for a previously unknown basement membrane type IV collagen chain, has been cloned and mapped to Xq22, whereas genes coding for ~3 and c~4 chains were mapped to chromosome 2. COL4A5 structural defects found in 3 of 18 Utah kindreds identified COL4A5 as the relevant gene for X-linked AS. To date, 10 different deletions or major rearrangements of the COL4A5 gene have been reported by different groups and 18 others have been found in our laboratory by conventional Southern blotting using COL4A5 probes covering the whole cDNA. The deletion detection rate varies from 5%, to 16% in our series. in 2 instances, the COL4A5 gene is completely deleted. In others cases, the breakpoints of the deletions are either intra-or extragenic.Abnormal junction fragment allowing the detection of female carriers are present in ihalf cases. In addition, 10 single base mutations in various COL4A5 regions have been reported, identified by various techniques, either by Southern blotting when the mutation removes a restriction site, or by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) or direct sequencing. All deletions have been found in patients with juvenile onset AS, whereas point mutations could be associated with the different phenotypes -juvenile onset ESRD, adult onset ESRD with or without deafness -could be found in patients with point mutations. COL4A5 mutations have been described in 6 among 12 patients with post-transplant anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. They consisted in 2 complete deletions, 3 intragenic deletions involving the 3' part of COL4A5 and a point mutation in a splicing site. These mutations lead, at least, to the absence of the NC1 domain of the o~5(IV) chain bearing target epitopes of alloantibodies. These findings strongly suggest that such mutations could represent risk factors for the occurence of post-transplant anti-GBM giomerulonephritis. However, other factors than the genetic defect itself seem to intervene in determining this complication. We looked for COL4A5 mutations in 6 patients with the association of AS and DL. All of them have a deletion in the 5' part of the COL4A5 gene, extending beyond its 5' end for at least 700 bp. These findings demonstrate that the same gene (COL4A5) is involved in classical AS and in AS associated with DL and suggest that DL might be due to the alteration of a second gene involved in the smooth muscle cell proliferation and located upstream of the COL4A5 gene. The Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, WT1, residing at chromosome 1 lp13, has recently been cloned and characterized. The predicted WT1 polypetide shows several features characteristic of transcription factors (nuclear localization, four contiguous Cys2-His2 zinc finger domains, and an amino terminus rich in proline and glutamine residues). This gene is highly expressed in the developing glomerular epithelium, fetal gonads, as well as the Sertoli celis of the testis and granulosa cells of the ovaries. Recent results have implicated WT1 in some cases of hereditary Wilms' tumor as well as in development of the genital system.",

            "text": "Denys-Drash syndrome is a rare human condition in which severe urogenital abberations result in renal failure, intersex disorders, and Wilms' tumor. To investigate the possible role of WT1 in the etiology of Denys-Drash syndrome, we have analyzed the coding exons of WT1 for possible germline mutations. In fourteen independent cases of Denys-Drash syndrome, point mutations within the DNA binding domain of one WT1 gene copy were identified by single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP). These mutations directly affect DNA sequence recognition. In three families analyzed, the mutations were shown to arise de novo. Four Wilms' tumors and one granulosa cell tumor from individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome demonstrated reduction to homozygosity for the mutated WT1 Mlele. In one case of Denys-Drash, a mutation within an intron was detected which affected splicing of the WT1 mRNA. These results indicate that mutations within the WT1 gene are responsible for the constellation of phenotypes associated with Denys-Drash syndrome. In addition, they implicate a key role for the WT1 gene product in development of the urogenital system. C 45 S-5.3 PRIMARY HYPEROXALURIA Jon L Scheinman. Avi Ka~z. Duke U. Durham NC, and Jerusalem Primary hyperoxaluria is caused by metabolic errors in amino acid matabolism: Type I (PH1, AGT deficiency) in liver trans-amination of glyoxylate, causing buildup of glycollic acid and oxalate. The defect may be absolute, partial, or due to misplaced enzyme. Type II results from absent conversion of hydroxypyruvate to D-glycerate, increasing L-glycerate through LDH and NADH, shifting the NAD:NADH balance, finally increasing oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate. Most important for nephrolithiasis is the total oxalate excretion and intratubular urine supersaturation. In view of the multiple possible pathways for glycollate and glyoxylate metabolism, and the uncertain effect of pyridoxine (B6) on these pathways, a simple enzymatic diagnosis may inadequate to dictate therapy. Even continued massive hyperoxaluria can be tolerated when GFR is high, urine dilute, and urine calcium low. This strategy has allowed prevention of renal failure and successful LRD transplantation, with agressive dialysis to avert early crystallization. Even in infants and children presenting with nephrocalcinosis and ESRD, a 50% long-term success has continued, with mortality usually due to denial of early re-transplant. Older patients, treated soon after the onset of-ESRD, have even better results.",

Nehrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by insensitivity of the distal nephron to the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin. AS a consequence, the kidney loses its ability to concentrate urine. The clinical features of the disease are polyuria, polydipsia, life-threatening dehydration, fever, anorexia and failure to thrive. Without treatment severe dehydration of the brain may lead to mental retardation. In most cases, NDI is inherited in an X-linked fashion. Linkage analyses have shown that the NDI locus is located in the subtelomeric region of the X chromosome long arm, at band Xq28. Although the molecular pathogenesis Of X-linked NDI is unknown at present, the renal vasopressin V2 receptor has been considered as the possible site of the underlying defect. This V2 receptor is bound to the adenylate cyclase complex resulting in an increase of cyclic AMP and can thus be distinguished from the vasopressin type 1 receptor, which is coupled to a phosphoinositide specific phospolipase and intracellular Ca 2+ mobilization. There is convincing evidence that the vasopressin type 1 receptor is intact in NDI. Firstly, NDI patients show normal vasoconstrictive responses after administration of vasopressin. Secondly, binding of vasopressin to type 1 receptors on thrombocytes isolated from NDI patients appeared to be normal; that is, binding characteristics (binding affinity and maximum binding capacity) in NDI patients were identical to those in normal control individuals. To test the hypothesis that the defect in NDI might be at the level of the vasopressin type 2 receptor, V2 receptor activity has been examined in somatic cell hybrid cell lines,, using a functional assay based on the increase of cAMP after addition of Arg-vasopressin to the medium. A hamster/human hybrid cell line, which contained as the sole human component the Xqter region, displayed Vz receptor activity while the hamster control cell line did not, indicating that a functional gene for the Vz receptor is located in the Xqter region. This observation has led us to a strategy to clone the NDI gene by analyzing cloned DNA fragments from Xqter for V2 receptor activity in a complementation assay system. This chromosomal region of interest, however, is still about 12 million base pairs long. By extending the linkage analysis in NDI families we were able to further refine the genetic localization of the NDI gene, thus reducing the region to be analyzed for V2 receptor activity with 75%. Also more somatic cell hybrids with different breakpoints in Xq28 were tested for V2 receptor activity. This has resulted in a further 50% reduction of the X-chromosomal region to be analyzed. Now about 1,5 million base pairs have to be screened for the V2 receptor geneo It is now straightforward to use yeast artificial chromosomes (I~ACs) located in the region of interest varying in length between 100.000 and 1.000.000 base pairs, for transfectien in a Vz receptor deficient cell line. The genetic localization of the NDI gene is up to now entirely compatible with the physical mapping of the V~ receptor gene. This strengthens the assumption that both genes are identical and lends further support to the NDI gene isolation strategy outlined here.",

Conclusion SIM is very effective in inducing remission and maintaining these despite withdrawal of steroids in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, but is less effective in steroid-resistant forms. In the latter, efficacy is improved when combining SIM with low dose steroids. SIM ~an be recommended in children not responding to conventional therapy or in whom such treatment, although effective, has induced relevant side effects. Steroid resistant INS carries a poor prognosis since, after a follow-up of 10 years, about half of the patients progress to endstage renal failure. Immunosuppressive agents may be efficient but there is no study showing a clear-cut beneficial effect of alkylating agents as the remission rate after such treatment is close to the rate of spontaneous remission. Recently, CsA has been administrated to steroid resistant patients with conflicting results. Retrospective cumu]ative analysis shows that the combination of CsA with prednisone, even at low doses, appears to improve the chance of remission from 15 to 25% of cases.",

In the urine and plasma samples used for the measurement of dextrans we also measured albumin, IgG and IgG 4 concentrations. To analyze the size selective properties of the glomerular barrier we used a heteroporous model of the glomerular capillary wall as described by Deen. In this model the major portion of the capillary wall is perforated by restrictive cylindrical pores of identical radius (re). In addition this model assumes a parallel \"shunt pathway\" that does not discriminate on the basis of dextran size and through which a small fraction of the filtrate volume (~) passes. The membrane barrier to dextrans is fully characterized by r o, to,, and Kf, where K~ is the product of effective hydraulic permeability and glomerular capillary surface area.",

Before cyclosporine, in the baseline untreated state the proteinuria was highly selective. The fractional clearance of large dextrans with radii > 40 A was comparable to that in normals. In contrast, the sieving of small dextrans was hindered. We could explain the abnormal sieving of small dextrans in this condition by a reduction in Kf. The marked reduction in protein excretion observed in MCD after cyclosporine was due to restoration of charge selective, of the giomerular basement membrane as measured by IgG/IgG 4 clearances. The hampered sieving of small dextrans was improved by cyclospodne although values did not reach the level observed in normal controls. Calculation of membrane parameters indicated that the raised fractional clearance of small dextrans can be accounted for by a rise of Kf. Such effects are difficult to reconcile with a vasoconstrictory effect of cyclosporine.",

However its mode of action on the diseased glomerular bai'rier was different from that in minimal change disease. Before cyclosporine, in the untreated state, proteinuria was non-selective and the clearance of iothalamate, the fractional clearance of uncharged dextrans with a radius between 28-38 A and filtration fraction were depressed significantly below values in our healthy volunteers. In contrast, the passage of dextrans with radius > 54 A was increased. This can be explained by a loss of intrinsic ultrafiltration capacity (depressed Kf) and decreased barrier size selectivity. We calculated Kf to be depressed threefold and the fraction of filtrate permeating the shunt pathway (~o) to be increased fivefold. In contrast to the effects of cyclosporine on charqe selectivity in patients with minimal change disease, the antiproteinuric action of cyclosporine in membranous glomerulopathy was the result of an increase in size selectivity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Blood pressure and GFR did not change significantly, although ERPF fell markedly. The fractional clearance of dextrans measuring 28-32 A rose and that of large dextrans (50-58 A) fell. Our computations revealed that the changes in glomerular sieving induced by CsA can be accounted for by a rise in K~ and a pronounced diminution of filtrate passing through the \"shunt\" pathway ~o.",

In all patients in which CsA was discontinued proteinuria returned promptly.

It remains to be demonstrated that these lower doses are free of long-term nephrotoxic side effects as evident morphological changes were observed at doses as low as 5 mg/kg/day.

Radiologists and pediatricians appreciate this procedure because it is easy to perform and a non irradiating technique. The fields of applications of ultrasound in pediatric nephro-urology are wide (table i). Antenatal ultrasound has become the most frequent way of discovering renal abnormalities. This has brought many changes in the work-up and management of nephro-uropathies. At birth, the anomaly has first to be confirmed and postnatal ultrasound is the first procedure to be performed. Its result decides whether further investigations are necessary. Ultrasound has also become the main (and usually the only) screening method of nephro-uropathies in patients ar risk; these nephro-uropathies include malformations possibly associated to other anomalies (i.e. vertebral malformations), tumors in patients at risk of developping benign (i.e. angiomyolipoma in Tuberous Sclerosis) or malignant tumors (i.e. gongenital aniridia and Wilm's tumor), or patients with familial history of polycystic kidney disease. Sonography is usually the first procedure performed in the work-up of urinary tract infection. It is the best method to show underlying malformations, parenchymal thickness and thickening of pelvic and ureteral wall in cases of pyelitis or ureteritis. Yet, ultrasound underestimates the presence of vesico-ureteral reflux and the number of renal scars and therefor complementaries imaging procedures are mandatory (cystogram, isotopes, .... ). Once the work-up has been completed and treatment established, ultrasound is helpful in assessing renal growth. As mentionned above, US is used in the work-up of abdominal and especially renal tumors. It helps to characterize the type of tumor, to detect the presence of adenopathies and to evaluate vascular involvment thanks to color doppler imaging. In case of large or/and invading tumors, other modalities (CT, IRM) will be necessary to evaluate tumoral extent. Sonography helps to determine the origin of hematuria and is a good method to demonstrate urolithiasis and lithiasis-related disease. In case of acute renal failure US differentiates between parenchymal and collecting system diseases. Associated to color doppler imaging, it verifies the patency of renal vessels. US can be used to follow chronic renal disease, be it related to reflux nephropathy or to congenital disease. After renal graft, for years now, US has been used to evaluate the graft and related diseases. Finally, US is the method of choice to follow post-operative or endoscopic procedures in order and to detect complications.",

In the early 1980s, a role for dietary protein restriction in delayir~g the deterioration of renal function was suggested by Brenner and his colleagues. In animal models of progressive renal disease, the important glomerular change that leads to loss of renal function is glomerular sclerosis. The underlying mechanisms that result in glomerular sclerosis include hemodynamic changes in the glomerulus, increased glomeru~ar metabolism, local hypercoagulability, mesangial macromolecular deposition, and hyperlipidemia, in a model proposed by Fogo and Ichikawa, all the factors above, either individually or in concert with others, stimulate the production/release of glomerular growth promoters, which in turn induce glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial matrix production and accumulation causing glomerular sclerosis. Preliminary evidence is now accumulating that dietary protein restriction may indeed alter the production and/or release of locally derived growth factors. Systemic hypertension and increased intraglomerular capillary pressure have been shown to result in progressive glomerular damage and glomerulosclerosis. Studies have shown that dietary protein restriction results in a fall in glomerular filtration rate and a reduction in intraglomerular capillary pressure. This, too, could have a salutary effect on progression of renal disease. The mechanism by which dietary protein could influence glomerular capillary pressure is unproven, Tubulointerstitial injury has been proposed as a mechanism leading to progressive renal injury. This m~y be mediated through increased oxygen consumption by remnant nephrons, thereby increasing the susceptibility of remnant tissue to oxidant injury. Increased ammonia production of remnant nephrons has been associated with complement activation and interstitial inflammation leading to progressive injury. Here too the mechanism(s) by which protein restriction could alter tubulointerstitial injury is(are) unknown.",

The percentage of patients needing renal replacement therapy during the first two years after randomization was 23% in children with 'progressive' diseases and 1.4% in children with 'non-progressive\" diseases. Stratification according to the progression of disease during the runin period eliminated the effect of stratification for renal diseases. Therefore, patients were analysed in groups according to progression rate and randomization only ('progressive' diet n=37 vs. control n=37 and 'non-progressive' diet n=32 vs. control n=39).",

            "text": "The Effect of Acidosis, Salt and Water on Growth and Nutrition in Children with Chronic Renal Failure Steven J~ Wassner, Department of Pediatrics, The Penn State University Children's Hospital, Hershey, PA, U~S~A~ In addition to decreased glomerular function, abnormalities in tubular function are often important in the clinical care of infants and children with chronic renal disease~ Prominent~ among the tubular abnormalities is the development of acidosis due to both defective bicarbonate reabsorption and diminished hydrogen ion secretion. .Irrespective of GFR, acidosis has a specific effect upon protein metabolism and growth. Children with renal tubular acidosis and normal GFR's are growth retarded~ Growth.rates improve when they are treated with adequate amounts of sodium bicarbonate~ Zn both humans and laboratory animals, metabolic acidosis is associated with poor linear growth and weight gain, diminished nitrogen balance and increased rates of myofibrillar (muscle) protein degradation~ The change in nitrogen balance is due to an increase in protein degradation without any effect on protein synthesis. In rats and humans with chronic renal failure, repair of acidosis improves muscle protein degradation and nitrogen balance. These changes are due to altered levels of the enzyme branched-chain ketoacid decarboxylase (BCKD). The ketoacid of leucine, a-ketoisocaproate, inhibits protein degradation within muscle~ Acidosis stimulates the activity of BCKD, increasing the degradation of ketoleucine, thus lowering ketoleucine levels and stimulating muscle protein degrada-tion~ Both sodium and chloride depletion are associated with diminished growth and weight gain~ Salt loss may be unassociated with acidosis and these individuals often demonstrate volume contraction with the development of compensatory metabolic a!kalosis~ When sodium was removed from the parenteral alimentation mixtures administered to debilitated adults, nitrogen balance rapidly diminished~ Isolated chloride deficiency (the chloride depletion syndrome) was responsible for decreased growth in infants with normal renal funetion~ In our laboratory we have been able to demonstrate that either isolated sodium or chloride depletion lead to the same alterations in growth and protein turnover: decreased length and weight gain~ diminished nitrogen balance and within muscle, decreased protein synthesis rates and abnormal muscle RNA contenL Unlike the abnormalities seen in acidosis, the effect of either sodium or chloride deficiency are restricted to synthesis and muscle protein degradation rates are unaffeeted~ Protein turnover studies were performed in rats made either sodium or chloride deficient by feeding them synthetic, low-sodium or chloride formulas and distilled water. Control rats were supplemented with sodium chloride~ Sodium or chloride deficient animals demonstrated marked urinary conservation of the test compound while excretion of the counter ion was equal to that of the control group~ Protein turnover rates were determined using the epitrochlearis muscle preparation with and without the addition of insulin to the bathing media. Both sodium and chloride deficiency decreased protein synthesis by approximately 20%. Total muscle RNA content was decreased to an equivalent degree suggesting that sodium or chloride deficiency act by decreasing the capacity for protein synthesis. Other organs were also affected by salt depletion with liver weights being proportionally smaller while kidney weights were either normal or increased as a percentage of body weight~ When sodium depleted rats were salt repleted they rapidly regained weight and restored protein synthesis and RNA levels, but body length did not entirely catch up to that of the control animals. As yet, the cause of these alterations is unknown but the similarity between both sodium and chloride suggest that the defect may be better related to alteration in volume than in the specific electrolyte defic-iency~ Clinical correlation for both acidosis and salt depletion suggest that at least some of the growth abnormalities seen in renal failure can be related to abnormal acid-base and electrolyte metabolism~ This can be particularly important for infants with renal disease since they are fed defined diets with limited salt content. These infants are also most likely to demonstrate those structural anomalies associated with the development of acidosis and salt loss~ In these infants, when growth is subnormal the provision of additional dietary sodium chloride may lead to increased weight and length gain. Hyperparathyroidism remains one of the major causes of morbidity in children with renal failure. Pathologically increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the result of parathyroid gland hypertrophy and decreased sensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular calcium. The mechanism by which extracellular calcium suppresses PTH secretion is not clear. We and others have described a paradoxical relationship in parathyroid cells between calcium, the second messenger diacylglycerol, protein kinase C activity and PTH secretion. In bovine parathyroid cells the pharmacological activator of protein kinase C, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) increases PTH secretion at high extracellular calcium where endogenous diacylglycerol (DG) formation is enhanced and PTH secretion is suppressed. Similarly, enhancement of endogenous parathyroid DG by inhibition of its metabolism with R59 022 resulted in inhibition of PTH secretion. To explore this relationship, we investigated the role of the endogenous sphingoid bases, sphingosine and sphinganine as potential inhibitory second messengers. These compounds are pharmacological inhibiters of protein kinase C and are formed in cells in the pathways of formation and degradation of sphingomyelin referred to as the sphingomyelin cycle. Our initial studies demonstrated that these sphingoid bases inhibited PTH secretion when added to bovine parathyroid cells. Moreover, sphinganine in bovine parathyroid cells was enhanced when parathyroid cells were incubated in high extracellular calcium. Ceramide, an intermediate compound in the formation of sphingosine from sphingomyelin similarly suppressed PTH secretion. Studies of the control of the enzyme sphingomyelinase in parathyroid cells demonstrated that DG but not PMA enhanced sphingomyelinase activity as demonstrated by ceramide formation. This differential effect of DG vs. PMA on ceramide formation was consistent with the lack of activation of protein kinase C and PTH secretion seen with increases in endogenous DG in bovine parathyroid cells. Ceramide formation was also enhanced at high extracellular calcium as compared to low extracellular calcium. In further studies, incubation of bovine parathyroid cells with HgC12 and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, inhibitors of neutral sphingomyelinase blocked the ability of high extracellular calcium to inhibit PTH secretion and decreased parathyroid ceramide in cells incubated at high extracellular calcium. These effects were found to be reversible with incubation in fresh media without the inhibitors. We next studied the effect of inhibition of the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway with D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase. Inhibition of this enzyme would be expected to increase ceramide and its products by blocking its metabolism to the glycosphingolipids. Our studies demonstrated that PDMP increases ceramide formation in bovine parathyroid cells and inhibits PTH secretion in a time and dose dependent manner. These results were also reversible after incubation overnight in fresh media. In summary, these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that parathyroid cells responffto high extracellular calcium with activation of a novel second messenger pathway, the sphingomyelin cycle. Inhibitory second messengers generated by this pathway contribute to the physiologic ability of high extracellular calcium to suppress PTH secretion and possibly explains the paradoxical relationship between DG formation and protein kinase C activity in this tissue. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in patients with renal failure remains a therapeutic challenge. Inappropriate renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D 3 is thought to play a major role in the genesis of renal sHPT. The primary aim of calcitriol treatment in uremic patients with sHPT is suppression of parathyroid overactivity. Parathyroid cells have receptors for 1,25(OH)2D 3 and 1,25(OH)2D 3 suppresses parathyroid cell activity through several mechanisms: (i) shifting the increased calcium set-point towards normal, (ii) reducing gene transcription for pre-pro-PTH and (iii) inhibition of parathyroid cell proliferation. Recently pulsatile administration of calcitriol by i.v. injection (Delmez, JCI 83, 1989) and-per os (Klaus et al., Lancet 337, 1991 , Tsukamoto et al., Nephron 57, 1992 has been shown to be effective for treatment of renal sHPT. The temporal relationship between oral administration of calcitriol and the nadir of 1,84iPTH concentration was examined in 9 adult patients and 6 children with renal failure of various degrees. A single oral pulse of calcitriol (2 ug) caused a delayed, but long lasting decrease of 1,84iFrH, which persists even after 1,25(OH)2D 3 plasma levels had returned to baseline (peak 1,25(OH)2D 3 plasma levels at 6-12h); 1,84iPTH levels were decreased significantly after 24h, the time to reach nadir (42-64% of baseline) ranging from 12-96h in adults as well as in children. Only a modest, but not statistically significant increase of serum calcium was noted; therefore it seems to be unlikely that the decrease in 1,84iPTH levels is explained by a rise in serum-calcium. These results are in agreement with experimental studies in uremic rats, in which a prolonged decrease in mRNA for pre-pro-PTH was noted after a bolus injection of calcitriol. When the same dose was administered either as a bolus or as a constant infusion by osmotic minipump, the former mode of administration was more efficacious (Reichel et ai., EDTA 1992). The increased effect of 1,84PTH suppression by 1,25(OH)2D 3 bolus might be related (i) to higher peak plasma concentration of 1,25(OH)2D 3 (associated with increased 1,25(OH)2D 3 receptor occupancy) and (ii) to upregulation of 1,25(OH)2D 3 receptor expression, as shown in growth plate chondrocytes in vitro (Klaus et al., IPNA 1992) . These experimental results confirm findings of our pilot study in 21 dialysis patients, who had elevated 1,84iPTH levels (12-200pmol/I, normal 1-6 pmol/1) despite daily oral calcitriol. Pulsatile oral calcitriol thrice weekly (0,5-3 g) decreased 1-84iFFH serum levels by 68.4% within 12 weeks. Hypercalcemic episodes, the most severe side effect of calcitriol therapy, can be decreased or even be avoided, when caletriol pulse therapy is discontinued, after FrH has fallen below a threshold level. In this context, it is of note, that after administration of 2ug calcitriol to healthy volunteers increased urinary elacium excretion rates return to pretreatment values within 2-3 days. After discontinuation of calcitriol, suppression of 1,84iPTH plasma levels persists for variable periods of time. We conclude, that pulsatile oral calcitriol is effective and safe for treatment of renal sHFr. The selection of optimal schedules with respect to time and dose of administration of calcitriol in the treatment of sHFr is currently under investigation.",

Hypercalcemia occurs frequently in solid-organ malignancies, and is termed humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). 80% of the cases of HHM are from elaboration of a factor that resembles the actions of parathormone (PTH): hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia with phosphaturia, and increased nephrogenous cAMP excretion. However, circulating levels of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin~ are reduced. In 1987-88, three laboratories announced the isolation of the putative HHM factor, and recently, the gene structure has been determined. HHM factor is now called parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH-rp) since it has a striking structural homology with PTH in the first 13 amino acids of the N-terminus. Interestingly, after this portion of the molecule, the two protein sequences diverge completely.

It is known that urinary tract infection (UTI) may cause renal scarring; for this to occur, it has been thought that vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) must be present and therefore, the scarring has been referred to as reflux nephropat.hy (RN). The present symposium deals with the pathogenetic mechanisms concerning adhesion of bacteria, their capacity to elicit an inflammatory response, the reliability of diagnosing VUR by voiding cystourethrography (VCU), and the functional and morphological consequences of recurrent symtomatic U;I'I, i.e. pyelonephritis (PN). The adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to urinary tract epithelium is mediated by a specific interaction between adhesins on the bacterial surface and receptors on the epithelial cell surface. E. coli strains which cause symptomatic infection are characterised by their capacity to adhere to mucosal surfaces in this way. Competitive blocking of bacterial adhesion by receptor analogues has proved successful in an experimental model and it is possible that certain foodstuffs may contain naturally occurring inhibitors of bacterial adhesion. Further, information is now available regarding the mechanisms by which attaching bacteria elicit a mucosal inflammatory response. Bacteria stimulate epithelial cells to secrete various cytokines (eg. IL-6 and IL-8). 1L-6 activates hepatic production of C-reactive protein and acts as a pyrogen, thereby contributing to the systemic response in acute PN, while IL-8 recruits neutrophils to the urinary tract. In adults with RN, proteinuria associated with segmental glomerular sclerosis (SGS) is known to have a poor prognosis.",

Finally, microproteinuria, in children as in adults, is associated with the development of SGS and its presence indicates a poor prognosis. Adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to mucosal surfaces is essential for the survival of the organisms because it confers on the pathogen the ability to withstand cleansing mechanisms and to overcome nutrient deprivation, resulting in growth advantages and enhanced toxicity. It is mediated by a specific intern&ion between (macro) molecules, termed adhesins, on the bacterial surfaces, that combine with complementary structures, termed receptors, on the animal cell surfaces. Three types of adhesin-receptor interactions have been described. One type involves protein (or lectin)carbohydrate interactions whereby bacterial lectins, expressed in fimbrial or nonfimbrial forms, bind the organisms to corresponding carbohydrates presented on the animal cell surfaces as glycoproteins and glycolipids. The other type includes protein-protein interactions mediated by specific regions of bacterial surface proteins that bind the bacteria to components of the extracellular matrix (e.g. fibronectin) or to the superfamily integrins on animal cell surfaces. The third type involves hydrophobic interactions in which a hydrophobin consisting of proteins or glycolipids (e.g. lipotheicoic acid) binds Lhe bacteria to hydrophobic regions of animal cell surface constituents. The knowledge gained from the molecular mechanisms of bacterial adhesion have served to design antiadhesive therapy as a new approach for the prevention of bacterial infections at the earliest step of the infectious process. One approach deals with the application of soluble inhibitors resembling the adhesion site of the receptor molecule in an attempt to block competitively the attachment of the bacteria to the mucosal surfaces. This so called \"receptor therapy\" by receptor analogues was documented in experimental infections using Escherichia coli that express either mannose or di-galactose specific fimbrial adhesins. It has been demonstrated that urinary tract infections caused by these organisms can be prevented by challenging the animals with bacteria suspended in solutions supplemented with the sugars specific for the bacterial adhesins. Another approach is based on the observations showing that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics suppress the expression of bacterial adhesins. It is an attractive approach because sublethal concentrations of antibiotics may reach mucosal surfaces intermittently during a typical course of therapy and interfere with the ability of the bacteria to colonize these surfaces. Last but not least, is the idea that inhibitors of bacterial adhesion may be found in certain diets. Especially are the recent findings showing that cranberry juice, a widely recommended juice for the treatment of (or prevention of recurrent) urinary tract infections, contains inhibitors of adhesins expressed by E. coli, ;':c most c,mmo, bactmia causing t~rinary tract infecnons. Uropathogenic E.coli adheres to mucosal surfaces via two fimbrial adhesins (designated MS and MR) protruding from the bacterial surface. Cranberry and blueberry juices from vaccinium berries contain two compounds that inhibit the E.coli adhesins. One is fructose, a constituent of all juices; it inhibits the MS fimbrial adhesin. The other inhibitor is a high molecular weight polymeric compound of unknown nature, found only in cranberry and blueberry juices and inhibits the MR adhesins of E.coli. This material was a more potent inhibitor of the activity of MR adhesins produced by urinary isolates including pyelonephritogenic isolates of E.coli than of those expressed by fecal isolates including diarrheal isolates. It is possible that the claimed beneficiary effect of cranberry juice is due to its antiadhesive agents which act in the gut (the source of uropathogens), in the bladder, or both by preventing colonization of these sites. In summary, a single clone of bacterial pathogen contains genetic information coding for multiple type of adhesins each of which exhibits distinct receptor specificity. The organisms also contain genetic information that enable them to switch on and off the expression of each type of adhesin at relatively high frequency so that one at a time one single adhesin is expressed. It appears now that in order to effectively prevent infection, the antiadhesion therapy should include agents which inhibit all the types of adhesins expressed by the bacterial pathogen. Infections of the urinary tract give rise to an inflammatory response. Granulocytes are recruited to the site of infection and are detected as pyuria. Localized inflammation of the bladder gives rise to dysuria and frequency. Systemic involvement can be detected as fever, elevated acute\" phase reactants and elevated blood leukocyte counts. Indeed, the site and severity of the host infiammatory response is a major determinant of the symptoms of acute urinary tract infection. Pye!onephritis is commonly diagnosed as bacteriuria, fever, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in combination with signs of renal involvement such as reduced renal concentrating capacity. Bacteria differ in the capacity to elicit the host response. This has been most extensively analyzed for Escherichia coli, which give rise to the majority of febrile infections in childhood. Febrile infections are caused by a subset of E.coli strains, which attach to the urinary tract mucosa, contain certain types of lipopolysaccharides and capsular polysaccharides, make iron binding proteins and are resistant to the bactericidal effect of serum. This association between certain bacteria and severe infections suggested that the virulent E.coli strains are more inflammatogenic than other bacteria. We have recently analyzed the mechanisms whereby attaching E.coli may induce a mucosal and systemic inflammatory response in the host.",

We have demonstrated that these cytokines are synthesized in the urinary tract in response to E.coli infection. IL-6 is secreted into the urine within minutes to hours of colonization of the human urinary tract, and continues to be produced for as long as bacteriuria persists. Elevated serum IL-6 levels are mainly found in patients with acute pyelonepbritis. We therefore propose that IL-6 acts as a mediator from the local site of infection to systemic sites, and that spread of IL-6 from the urinary tract mucosa to the blood stream contributes to the induction of fever, CRP and ESR in acute pyelonephritis. IL-6 is, however, not known to be involved in granulocyte recruitment. On the contrary, experimental evidence has suggested that the IL-6 activation is independent of the neutrophil response. IL-8 is a wellknown chemoattractant for neutrophils. We recently demonstrated that IL-8 is secreted into the urine in response to E.coli infection. In animals, the neutrophil response coincided with the clearance of infection. It remains to be shown whether the individuals with potent IL-8 and neutrophil responses clear infection better than others.",

            "text": "Finally, glomerular enlargement, a feature common in AIDS patients is suggested to be predecessor of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Normal acidification comprizes the almost complete reclamation of filtered HCO3-, the titration of buffers such as HPO42and the excretion of NH 4 +. The first process amounts to some 4.5 mol/day, the second to 20-30 mmol/day, and the NH4+ excretion is variable depending largely on the acid base status (20-500 mmol/day). Since the early work of Pitts and Alexander [1] it has been clear that the task of renal tubular acidification is accomplished by Na+-dependent H+-secretion. It took 31 more years untiLMurer et al. [2] eventually proved this concept by demonstrating Na+/H+ exchange. This exchanger is responsible for more than 90% of the tubular reabsorption of HCO3-. It is present in the luminal membrane proximal tubule (PT), mostly in the Sl-segment, and in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). Many of the regulatory properties of this exchanger have been unravelled [3] . It is upregulated by a fall in cytoso{ic pH, by hormones such as PTH and ang}otensin {{, and it is inhibited by amiloride-like compounds such as EIPA. This exchanger seems to occur in several forms. One present in fibroblasts has recently been cloned [4] , and it appears likely that this \"housekeeping\", i.e. pH-regulatory system, is present in many if not every cell. The luminal membrane Na +/H+-exchanger is a close relative and is currently cloned by Pouyssegur and collaborators. In essence proximal tubule acidification can be described as the secondary active reabsorption of NaHCO 3. For this to occur, a HCO3--export system in the basolateral membrane must also be present. This seems to be a Na +(HCO3-) 3 carrier [5] . This transporter is inhibited by stilbenes, which are known to interact with the band 3 protein (HCO3\"/CI--exchange) of red blood cells. Due to its 2 extra negative charges this system is vcltage depgndent. This explains why high plasma K + concentration impedes HCO 3-reabsorption and hence causes systemic acidosis. Apart from its predominant role in HCO3\"-reabsorption the PT is also the main site of NH4+ production. This process becomes highly relevant in chronic metabolic acidosis, inasmuch as an increased delivery of glutamine is metabolized essentially to NH 4+, CO 2 and H20. Glutamine is delivered from the liver for the sake of a reduced urea production. This saves HCO 3\" in the liver and hence corrects metabolic acidosis, but shifts the burden of N-metabolism and excretion from the liver to the kidney. NH 4 + produced by the PT is secreted in the collecting tubule (CD).",

The mutual relevance of the first two processes are under investigation. Abundant data favors the existence of the vacuolar type proton pump in the luminal membrane of A-type cells, but more recent data also shows compelling evidence for a H+/K+-pump as it is present in the oxyntic cells of stomach. Both pumps can reduce tubule lumen pH to well below 4.5. HCO3--secretion, in the state of metabolic alkalosis, has been looked at as a mirror-type remodelling of the A-cell. This view probably will not hold inasmuch as the luminal HCO3--exporter is immunologically not identical to the basoiateral band-3-type exchanger present in the A-cell. Also the H +-pump, claimed to be present in B-type cells is as yet poorly characterized. The fourth task is the shortcircuiting of NH4 + in the kidney medulla.

This allows the cortical collecting tubule to secrete either acid or base, in response to changes in dietary acid. In addition, this allows H+ secretion from the cortical collecting tubule to be regulated by changes in transepithelial voltage secondary to changes in Na+ transport.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are represented by relatively well defined clinical entities whereas others remain theoretical. P a t i e n t survival and graft survival after the 1st t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n were similar to p a t i e n t s w i t h o t h e r p r i m a r y renal diseases. c c e s s f u l p r e g n a n c y after start of RRT; almost all p r e g n a n c i e s occurred after t r a n s p l a n t a t i o n , The p e r c e n t a g e s of neonatal deaths and m a l f o r m a t i o n s w e r e not d i f f e r e n t from p r e g n a n c i e s of h e a l t h y mothers. M e a n g e s t a t i o n a l age and m e a n b i r t h w e i g h t w e r e reduced, however, Measurement of GFR is essential in the assessment of renal function and the progression of renal disease as well as in the evaluation of renal response to therapeutic maneuvers. \"Ideal markers\" for GFR should be completely filtered by the glomerulus without tubular secretion or reabsorption and should have no extrarenal metabolism. In addition they should be easily, accurately and inexpensively quantifiable in small amounts of blood and urine. No single marker fits all these criteria, and few meet enough criteria to be used for research studies, especially in clinical trials where multiple centers are participating. In pediatrics, an ideal GFR method should also preclude the need to collect urine, since accurate urine collection is technically difficult, especially in children who have bladder anomalies or who have undergone urinary diversion. The urinary clearance of exogenous inulin has been the \"gold standard\" for GFR in research studies. Inulin clearance by the infusate method without urine collection has been equally accurate and reliable in children, but inulin is not easy to prepare, its constant infusion is laborious, and from time to time it is difficult to obtain commercially in the USA. Other methods are desirable for multicenter studies. Neither timed urinary creatinine clearance (usually 24 hours) nor estimation of ereatinine clearance from serum creatinine and patient height or weight is accurate or reproducible enough to be an acceptable research alternative. Newer methodologies, such as the plasma and renal clearance of single injections of radionuclides (e.g. Tc~-DTPA and CrS*-EDTA) and the clearance of radiographic contrast agents, like iothalamate, have been used successfully as research tools, mostly in single center studies. In 1990, the SPNSG began a controlled multicenter trial of growth hormone therapy for children with chronic renal insufficiency (GFR 10-40 ml/min/1.73m2). This study required accurate assessment of GFR at 0, 3, 12 and 24 months of study in each patient at 20-25 different centers. The clearance of nonradioactive iothalamate by the infusate method (GFR,o) was chosen as the best available method. Conditions of the test were standardized to be performed the same way by a research nurse in each center. After a priming dose, iothalamate was infused continuously at a rate equal to the estimated urinary excretion rate to maintain a steady state serum concentration near 1 mg/dt. The infusion continued for 5 hours in all children except those < 3 y.o. with estimated GFR < 35 ml/min/1.73m 2, in whom the infusion was continued for 8-12 hours to be sure steady state was achieved. Hydration with non-sodium containing fluids delivered at 3-10 ml/kg/hr was maintained during the study. Serum samples were obtained hourly during the last 3 hours of study, when patients were expected to be at steady state. Samples of infusate and serum were mailed on dry ice to a central lab, where the concentration of iothalamate was measured by HPLC. Results were rejected if the 3 serum values did not reflect a steady state, the serum iothalamate concentration was > 1.5 mg/dl, or the infusate concentration was <70% of predicted value. During the last 2 years, 112 GFR,o studies have been performed in 57 children, ages 2-15 years (mean 6.5 years), at 21 centers. Absolute GFR~o ranged from 2.5-35 ml/min. 14 studies (13%) were rejected for technical reasons, usually because an error was made in calculating or measuring the iothalamate dose (7/14) or the wrong infusion rate (3/14) was used. Errors occurred at 11 different centers (52%), usually during the first few studies performed by that center. Only 2 patients (3%) required more than one repeat study to obtain a technically acceptable result. One family refused a repeat study, but continued with regularly scheduled studies. In general, these studies was acceptable to both nurses and patients, despite being labor intensive and invasive. The GFR~o is an accurate, reproducible method, even at the lower ranges of absolute GFR, and can be standardized for pediatric multicenter trials. Although the GFRIo is the current method of choice for studies of the SPNSG, a less expensive, noncontinuous infusion method is still desirable for future studies. 4) Heredo-familial diseases (73 cases (9.9%), mainly policystic kidney disease, nephronoptisis and Alport Syndrome. 5) Others: 56 (7.6%).",

Persistent nephrotic syndrome induced by multiple injections of PAN sustains the increase in these mRNA levels and results in progressive TI matrix accumulation. Treatment of acute PAN rats with a low protein diet or lipid-lowering drugs normalizes TGFfll and matrix mRNA levels. In both the acute and chronic models, matrix degradation may also be decreased by the production of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP).

This approach did not prove fruitful. The now traditional view was articulated by Bradley and Tyson in 1948 (2): proteinuria ~resulted from changes in the glomerular filter, hypoproteinaemia developed as a consequence, transudation of salt and water into the interstitium followed, oedema and a fall in plasma volume were the result.

In some instances the infusion of albumin into nephrotic patients has produced gratifying natriuresis and diuresis. These observations support the view that in some circumstances plasma volume may indeed be reduced in nephrosis, but is a tendency towards contraction of plasma volume a general mechanism driving renal sodium retention in the nephrotic state?

Interpretation of many studies is hampered by methodological imperfections and lack of attention to the need to make observations at a time of continuing sodium retention. However, the most meticulous work suggests that in adult nephrotics plasma volume is more commonly elevated than depressed (3) . In groups of sodium-retaining nephrotic patients activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system is not a consistent tinding, and sequential studies of individual patients do not reveal a convincing relationship between the propensity to retain sodium and plasma levels of renin or aldosterone. Infusion of the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin or administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril do not induce natriuresis. These findings have led to dissatisfaction with the traditional hypothesis and to the suggestion that there might be an intrinsic renal abnormality of sodium excretion. Strong,direct evidence implicating an intrarenal abnormality has come from the study of an animal model. Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) acts directly on the kidney to induce heavy proteinuria, hypoproteinaemia and oedema when administered systemically to rats. [chikawa et al (4) used this property of PAN to create a unilateral model of the nephrotic syndrome. They perfused one kidney with the chemical, leaving the contralateral kidney as an unexposed control, Despite the fact that both organs shared the same systemic milieu, heavy proteinuria and reduced sodium excretion subsequently developed only in the kidney that had been exposed to PAN. Micropuncture suggested that the depression of sodium excretion resulted either from altered behaviour of tubule segments beyond the distal convolution, or from altered behaviour of deep nephrons inaccessible to surface micropuncture, Firth and Ledingham (5) examined the behaviour during isolated perfusion of the kidney taken from a rat rendered nephrotic by previous exposure to PAN. In this preparation the immediate influences of renal nerves and circulatory substances were clearly eliminated. Despite this the kidney of the nephrotic animal excreted considerably less sodium than a normal control at any given arterial pressure. The reason for this was not clear. The tendency to sodium retention was not overcome by high concentrations of ouabain, acetazolamide, frusemide, hydroflumethiazide, benzamil or atrial natriuretic peptide. An underlying metabolic abnormality was suggested by (a) the finding of increased oxygen consumption in organs taken from nephrotic animals, and (b) the observation that cooling to 8 -10~ rendered sodium handling by the isolated nephrotic organ virtually identical to that by similarly cooted control. degradation products, has been demonstrated (2,6).

            "text": "Although the GH serum concentration is high, the action of GH at the target organs is, at least partially, diminished. This seems to be the consequence of a reduced availability of IGF-I, which acts as mediator substance of GH: In uremia, the high-affinity GH binding protein (GHBP) activity in the circulation is reduced. GHBP most likely reflects the receptor status for GH at target organs, and one might conclude that it is low in uremia. In accordance with this view, we have found a reduced mRNA concentration of the GH receptor in liver tissue of uremic rats. As a consequence, the renal production rate of IGF-I is found to be reduced in uremic rats and men. In addition, the serum concentration of the main carrier protein of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 is increased as a consequence of the reduced renal clearance of the low molecular fragments of IGFBP-3. Low production rate and high binding capacity of IGF-I result in a reduced availability of free active IGF-I indicated by a low bioactivity of IGF-I in uremic serum. The resistance of GH can be overcome by the treatment with recombinant human (rh) GH in doses of about 1 IU/kg/week. In prepubertal children with CRF, without or with dialysis treatment, rhGH significantly increases growth velocity. This effect is most expressed during the first treatment year but, a significantly higher growth velocity in comparison to the pretreatment growth velocity is also seen during the following treatment years. While oxygen is vital to aerobic cells, some metabolites of oxygen are toxic to cells. These reactive oxygen metabolites have been recently suggested to mediate the pathophysiological processes of a wide spectrum of renal diseases, including acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal failure. Thus, investigators observed a protective effect of antioxidants when they were given exogenously in a number of experimental settings. Of note, in this regard, manifestations of a particular disease are determined by the dynamic balance between the pathogenic insult and the host's defense mechanisms. To determine the functional importance of intrinsic antioxidant .enzymes (AOE), therefore, we conducted a series of studies. Our early studies indicated 1) that exposure of the kidney to a short-term ischemiareperfusion leads to an acquisition of a significant renal resistance against reperfusion injury by raising AOE activities, whereas 2) ECF volume depletion, by depressing the AOE activities, predisposes the kidney to nephrotoxic injury, e.g., one with contrast medium. To further scrutinize the functional significance of the regulation of intrinsic renal AOE systems, we have recently conducted a series of in vivo and in vitro studies focusing on the therapeutic mechanism of glucocorticoids in oxidant-induced renal injury.",

Two factors are responsible for the poor oxygenation of the renal medulla; first, as a byproduct of the countercurrent mechanism that permits solutes to be concentrated along a codicopapillary gradient, oxygen diffuses directly from the descending to the ascending branches of the vasa recta. Second, in this region, lhe medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (mTAL) avidly consumes oxygen for sodium chloride transport, necessary for the generalion of concentration gradients. The net result is that the pO 2 in the depths of this region falls to very low levels, in the range of 10 mmHg. In this hypoxic environment, cells of the toTALs are particularly susceptible to excessive workload and may be a prime target of injury in renal insults. By contrast, in the cortex, glomerular filtration and bulk reabsorption of solute along the proximal tubule are supported by an exceptionally generous blood flow, which equals nearly a quarter of the total cardiac output. As the result of high tissue perfusion, over the metabolic needs of tubules, cortical pO2 is generally high, averaging 50 mmHg. In this region, however, the medullary rays (which are expansions of the renal medulla into the codex) receive a substantial portion of their oxygen supply from desaturated blood ascending from the renal medulla and may also be particularly vulnerable to hypoxic injury during renal hypoperfusion.",

For instance, prostaglandin E2, released by the renal medulla in response to regional hypoxia, induces local vasodilatation and reduces transpod work by the toTAL, thus reestablishing medullary oxygen balance. Likewise, adenosine, liberated from the breakdown of cellular ATP in circumstances of deficient oxygenation, acts upon intrarenal adenosine receptors to increase medullary blood flow while decreasing GFR and distal solute delivery (a major determinant of reabsorption workload in mTALs), thus restoring medullary oxygen sufficiency. Local release of the endothelial-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide may also play an important role in assuring a basal active medullary vasodilation. Interference with these paracrine mechanisms may predispose to focal hypoxic injury at sites of strategic importance for overall renal function.",

Although important advances have been made at the cellular level in understanding hypoxic injury (e.g., loss of cell polarity, production of free radicals, calcium entry and the activation of genes for protection or regeneration), the basic mechanisms responsible for organ failure remain elusive. The renal medulla, working on the brink of anoxia and site of concentration for many toxins, may be an important target for the synergistic events of hypoperfusion and nephrotoxic exposure that almost invadably precedes human acute renal failure. The renal structures most at risk for hypoxic damage in vivo are the thick ascending limb and the straight portion of the proximal tuhulP. (in the n.t~r medu!!~ ~qd in. the medullary rays). Injury to the Henle's loop may be padiculady detrimental to renal function, because of activation of tubuloglomerular feedback (there is little chance for correcting deficient salt reabsorption between the mTAL and the macula densa) and because of intraluminal obstruction by cast precipitation of Tamm-Horsfall protein, exclusively released by damaged toTALs.",

            "text": "The synergism between renal hypoperfusion and toxic insults derives from several factors including increased intrarenal concentration of toxins, drug interference with renal protective mechanisms, coprecipitation of Tamm-Horsfall protein with toxins (such as Bence-Jones protein, myoglobin or contrast material), enhanced tubuloglomerular feedback, and synergy at the cellular levels such as increased oxygen demand by toxic membrane damage and toxic-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Renal medullary hypoxia may play an important role in the susceptibility of the kidney to acute renal failure from synergistic hypoxic and toxic insults Recent developments during the past decades point to an important role of locally acting factors in the regulation of cell growth, inflammatory responses and kidney function. These factors are produced locally, e.g. they act near their sites of synthesis at specific receptors (\"local hormones\"). They act either I~y an autocrine, paracrine, or as intracrine mechanism. Up to now there is no generally accepted cla.~sification of locally acting factors, but besides eicosanoids (prostaglandins, leukotriens), histamine, bradykinin, the large group of growth factors and endothclin belong to that group. Circulating hormones can be measured in plasma, often simply be immunological methods and in general rite concentrations measured represent their biological activity. Therefore studies in man are possible and valuable. However, it is not clear, whether this statement is also true for locally produced and locally acting factors. One can speculate that measurements of locally produced and locally acting factors in plasma or urine does not represent their biological significance. Therefore, the production, biological effects and their responses via binding at specific receptors has been elegantly studic~ in cell culture systems. Studies in patients are more difficult, particularly from a methododieal point of view. Endothelin 1-21 (ET-I) belongs to a family of locally produced regulatory peptides with potent vasoconstrictor activity. In the kidney ET-1 exerts profound effects, e.g. increase in vascular resistance, decreases in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, and decrease in sodium reabsorption via reducing filtered load and through inhibition of Na*-K*-ATPase. Besides these potent renal effects ET has been discussed as an important factor in the pathogenesis of glomerular inflammation, cyclosporine ncphrotoxicity, and postischemic renal injury (1) . It has also been suggested that ET-I mediates hemodynamically induced acute renal failure (2) . Elevated urinary excretion of ET has been reported in patients with renal diseases (3) and in children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (4) . To study the biological significance of ET-1 in children with renal disemses, we measued urinary ET-1 excretion using a specific antibody to ET-1 (RPA 555, Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany). Urinary ET-I excretion in 60 children and adolescents averaged 0.46+0.13 pmol/kg body weight per day (mean_+SD). It was constant during childhood and adolescence (4-8 year, n:20, 0.49+0.13 pmol/kg per day, 9-12 years, n:20, 0.44+ 0.12, 13-18 years n:20, 0.45_+0.15. Compared to these normal controls elevated urinary excretions of ET-1 were found in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria (n:7, 1.72_+0.83 pmul/kg per day, chronic renal failure (n:14, 1.30+1.08), and following renal transplantation (n:8, 1.00+ 0.56; all groups P<0.01). However, ET-I excretion was unchanged in children with idiopathic steroid sensitve nephrotic syndrome (n: 0.33+0.19) and with stable chronic giomerulonephritis (n:8, 0.39-+0.14). ET-1 was elevated in two children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (3.95 and 0.88 pmol/kg per day). Urinary ET-I concentrations were similar in controls and in various patient groups. ET-1 excretion correlated positively with urine flow rate in normal controls (r: 0.70) and in all patients studied (r: 0.85). Eight healthy volunteers (23-27 years old, 4 female, 4 male) were studied before and after oral water load (20 ml/kg) to investigate the effect of ET-I excretion on urine flow rate. Urine was collected following overnight dehydration and 2 and 4 hours after water load. Urine flow rose tenfold in response to water load and urine concentration of ET-I fell only by 60% (from 27.3+5.3 fmol/ml to 10.1+ 2.6 fmol/ml after 2 h, and to 10.7-+4.5 fmol/ml after 4 h). ET-I excretion rose from 11.1+4.7 fmol/kg per h to 53.2 _+16.8 and 40.3_+13.8, respectively. These results indicate that urinary ET-1 excretion depends at least in part on urine flow rate. This is in contrast to earlier results (3) . Therefore the interpretetlon and the biological significance of elevated ET-1 excretion in renal diseases is difficult. References: Rfldiqer Waldherr De~t of Pathology~ University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 220, D-6900 Heidelberg, ~y Cytokines and growth factors are supposed to play an important role as mediators of inflanm~tion and as progression factors in various renal diseases. Most studies on the expression of cytokines~ growth factors and their receptors in the kidney have been performed in animals, particularly rodents, and in call culture experiInents. However, the extrapolation of these findings m~st be interpreted with caution and it is difficlllt to know to what extent these results are applicable to humans in view of the well-known species differences. The only possibility is to examine biopsy tissue. Although the apparent shortcomings and limitations of investigating renal biopsies are the facts that only a certain stage of the disease can be evaluated phenotypically and early lesions are frequently missed, it is absolutely necessary to validate experimental results in human material. We therefore looked for the expression of some these factors in kidney biopsies from patients with allograft rejection, mesangial IgA-glomerulonephritis (IgA-GN) and ANCA-positive (anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies) GN (Wegener's diseasef microscopic polyangiitis) by means of irmm/nocytochemistry (using polyclonal or monoolonal antibodies), in situ hybridization (using radioactive labelled riboprobes) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Allograft biopsies from 45 renal transplant patients were classified into three groups according to clinical and histological criteria: acute cellular rejection (ACR; n=25), chronic rejection (C~rR; n=8) and no rejection (NOR; n=12). Numerous infiltrating calls expressing IL-I$, TNF-~, TNF-#, IFN-y and IL-2Rec (Ii-2 receptor) were detected in all cases of ACR, whereas in patients with NoR or with ChrR only sporadic cells were noted. A marked immunoreactivity of Ii-2 was observed in mononuclear infiltrating calls in ACR. In contrast, Ii-2 positive calls were only occasionally detected in C~lrR and constantly absent in NoR. TNF-Rec and IFN-yRec were expressed by interstitial mononuclear cells as well as by glomerular and arterial e/idothelium in cases with ACR, and to a minor degree in NoR and in C~rR. The strong i~m,,~nostaining of IFN-TRec in tubular epithelium correlated with the neoexpression of MHC class II antigens. PDGF (AB, BB), PDGF-~Rec and TGF-B irmm/noreactivity was observed in infiltrating calls, fibroblasts and arterial endothelium. In addition, in C~R a marked staining of myofibroblasts was observed in arterial vessels. The results obtained at the protein level were confirmed by hybridizing tissue sections with 55Slabelled IL-I~, TNF-a and PDBF-~Rec riboprobes. Our findings indicate that a scenario of cytokines and growth factors is produced in situ in ACR reflecting marked inmmLnological activation. IL-2 seems the most reliable marker to differentiate ACR from other abnormalities. The low detection of these factors in NoR suggests that even in the absence of ACR a silent ~ological process may operate. The strong expression of PDGF and TGF-~ in ChR indicates that both factors play a pivotal role in the development of vascular lesions. In IgA-(IN (n=30), an increased mesangial PDGF-AB/BB reactivity was present in 17/30 cases. Cor~pared to the constitutively low expression of PDGF-~Rec on mesangial calls in normal renal tissue (n=5), we detected a markedly increased positivity in cases with mesangial proliferation. No change in the expression of PDGF-~Rec was observed. Mesangial expansion was associated with an increased expression of TGF-~, particularly of TGF-~3, and IL-6. TNF-o, IL-I~, IFN-y, IL-2, IL-2Rec and IFN-u positive interstitial cells were only occasionally noted in a few cases. Tubular IFN-yRec expression correlated with ~C class II positivity. These results suggest that PELF, TGF-~ and IL-6 may contribute to the development of mesangial proliferation and sclerosis in IgA-G~. In ANCA-positive GN (n=32), cases with active lesions (crescents, necroses, infiltrates, acute vasculitis) disclosed numerous infiltrating calls positive for TNF-~ and IL-I# at these sites. The production of the cytokines in situ was confirmed by in situ hybridization and PCR of the remaining biopsy tissue (n=6). TNF-Rec was expressed by infiltrating calls and endothelial calls of interstititial capillaries and larger vessels. Interstitial infiltrates were also positive for IL-2Rec, IFN-?, IFN-yRec, TGF-~, PDGF and PDGF-~Rec. PDGF and TGF-B reactivity was increased in endothelial calls. In contrast, patients with inactive or scleresing lesions showed only scattered positive calls. We conclude that the production of these cytokines in situ plays an i~rtant role in the induction of the inflarmnatory process and the development of the histological lesions in ANCA-positive GN.",

The long term outcome of 221 consecutive kidney grafts performed from 1973 to the 1 st january 1982 in the Enfants Malades hospital is reported in this study. For this cohort of patients graft survival was 48% at 10 years and 35% at 15 years. Patient survival was 85% at 10 years and 70% at 15 years. Presence of cytotoxic antibodies against more than 50% of the panel, and poor HLA matching was associated with a lower graft survival. One hundred and six patients had a functioning graft after 10 years, but on the 1 st january 1992, there were only 83 remaining, 22 other patients had another graft functioning again, 48 were waiting a second or a third graft on dialysis, 49 died and 12 were lost to follow up. Focusing on the 106 patients who had a functioning graft after 10 years, 14 went back to dialysis in the following years and 9 died (2 cancers, 2 hepatitis cirrhosis, 2 cystinosis, 1 septicemia, 1 pancreatitis, 1 cause unknown). At last examination 10 to 19 years after grafting 68% of the 83 functioning graft had a s. creatinine < 120 i.tmol/I, 20% between 120 and 250 and 11% > 250 ~tmol/l. Forty one patients had a graft biopsy after 10 years, 17 of them had glomerular lesions (11 allograft nephropathy, 4 recurrent MPGN and 2 de novo membranous nephritis), 26 had normal parenchyma or mild interstitial fibrosis and 19 normal vessels or mild arteritis. Several kinds of complications occured in patients after 10 years of grafting, they were mainly related to the i. s. treatment. Bone complications were related to corticosteroid : osteoporosis was detected in 34% of patients on X rays, but according to densitometry 46% patients had severe osteoporosis and only 17% might be considered to have normal bone density. Bone osteonecrosis was observed in 22 patients, 3 of the 11 with femoral head necrosis needed a surgical prothesis, but the incidence of this complication decreased after 1978 date of a decrease of corticosteroids in the protocol. Infectious complications were rather rare : 7 urinary tract infections + pyelonephritis, 2 salmonellosis, 2 septicemia, 1 otitis, 1 lung tuberculosis, 4 cutaneous mycosis, 5 herpes zoster, 2 varicella and 2 CMV infection were observed in 284 patient/year. B hepatitis was a matter of concern in these patients, 31 of 106 were HBs positive 10 years after grafting, 19 of them with Hbe antigen present, at last examination 17 had persistant cytolysis, 10 of 11 who underwent a liver biopsy had severe lesions, 1 had portal hypertension, 2 died from liver failure and 1 from hepatocarcinoma. The other patient with a malignancy died from a bladder sarcoma following the long term prescription of cyclophosphamide. C hepatitis serology was positive in 9 of 85 patients, 8 of the 9 were also bearing HBs antigen and only 2 of these patients had silent hepatitis. Late urological complications were rather rare : 9 had a lithiasis and 1 had an ureteral stenosis. A nervous break down was observed in 4 patients and 1 of them attempted suicide. A particular mention has to be made about the 12 patients with cystinosis who developed different extra renal complications of the disease (4 encephalopathy, 5 diabetes, 1 portal hypertension). The mean adult height of these patients was 155,7 cm _+ 10,1 in male, and 149,5 cm _+ 9,5 in female that is to say -3 SD and -2,2 SD respectively. Rehabilitation study showed that of the 106 patients who reached 10 years of grafting 43 had a full time employment, 5 had a part time or at home job, 31 were continuing studies or vocational training, 18 were unemployed and 9 were unable to work. Of the 83 patients with informative data on this point, 43 were living in their own home, of whom 22 had a marital life, while 38 were living with their parents and 2 in institution. Ten children were born from mother or father with a functioning graft and except for prematurity, these children now 1 to 9 years old are developing normally. Considering the clear improvement in patient survival during the last decade and the progresses in prevention and treatment of complications, the long term results of kidney transplantation in children will brobably improve in the future.",

On the other hand, fractional mesangial volume (VvM) correlates well with GFR, blood pressure and UAE.

There is an inverse relationship between VvM and SLE indicating that progressive mesangial expansion is at the expence of the peripheral capillary filtration surface.

Renal function parameters do not appear to indicate the degree of renal structural change present on renal biopsy in early diabetes. Individual D patients may vary markedly in the clinical expression of the developing lesions of diabetic nephropathy (DN).To evaluate this we examined the relationships among BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and G structure in 64 D patients without overt DN, divided into 3 groups according to albumin excretion rate (AER): normal AER (<22 mg/d) (N); low level miero~albuminuria (22-45 mg/d) (LM), and microalbuminuria (46-220 mg/d) (M). 32 N patients were normo-tensive (Nt) (MBP 84.4_+6.4 mm Hg, GFR 113+23 ml/min/ 1.73m 2) and 6 hypertensive (>140/84 or on antihypertensive therapy, GFR 109-+30) (Ht). 122 age and sex matched non-D kidney donors served as controls (C). In C glomerular basement membrane (GBM) width was 354_+53 nm, mesangial fractional volume (Vv M) .14_+.04 and surface density (Sv(PGBM)) .128_+.022 gm2/gm 8. In NNt GBM width was 512_+126 (p<0.001 vs C), Vv M .22_+.07 (p<0.001 vs C) and Sv (PGBM) .103_+.025 (P<0.001 vs C). No differences were observed in NHt vs NNt. 10 LM (AER 31_+6) patients were Nt (MBP 86_+6, GFR 124_+33, ns vs N) and only one was Ht. GBM width was 576+105, Vv M .21_+.06, Sv(PGBM) .108_+.028 (ns vs NNt). 7 M patients (AER 100_+47, GFR 110_+36) were hit, but their MBP (92_+5) was greater than NNt (p<0.005) and LM (p<0.05), 8 were Ht (AER 110_+40, GFR 97_+13). In MNt and MHt, respectively, GBM width was 581_+178 (ns vs NNt) and 713_+61 (p<0.001 vs NNt), Vv M was .26-+.07 (ns vs NNt) and .29_+.07 (p<0.05 vs NNt) and Sv(PGBM) was .075_+.018 (p<0.01 vs NNt) and .074_+.01 (p<0.005 vs NNt). GBM and VvM were significantly greater only in MHt vs NNt, while Sv(PGBM) was reduced in both M groups. In conclusion: 1) In all the D groups, including N patients, D glomerular lesions are detectable. 2) Patients with LM do not differ from N patients in G structure and BP levels. 3) M patients have higher GBM width and Vv M compared to N only when high BP is present. 4) MNt have significantly higher BP levels and lower Sv(PGBM) than N before a clear difference in other glomerular structures is evident. These data suggest that in D glomeruli may respond differently to similar degrees of mesangial expansion, and that it is those patients who have an early reduction in Sv(PGBM) who manifest M and rising BP.",

            "text": "Induction of experimental diabetes causes a rapid increase in renal and glomerular size accompanied by increases in kidney RNA and protein, demonstrable 36 h after the onset of glucosuria. Increased renal growth and function are preceded by a rise in renal tissue concentration of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) reaching a peak 24-48 h after the induction of diabetes and returning to basal levels after about 4 days. Diabetic kidney hypertrophy is linearly dependent ~ on blood glucose levels one week after induction of diabetes and the degree of kidney IGF-I accumulation 48 h after injection with streptozotocin is directly proportional to the prevailing blood glucose in rats with graded severities of diabetes. In addition, IGF-I infusion to diabetic rats commencing after the initial high growth rate has abated, with restoration of the initial high kidney IGF-I levels, reaccelerates diabetic renal hypertrophy. Concomitant with the rise in endogenous kidney IGF-I, a transient increase in kidney IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) is seen, supporting the notion that IGFBPs may modulate the renotropic action of IGF-I in diabetic renal enlargement. Diabetic dwarf rats with isolated growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I deficiency exhibit slower and lesser initial renal and glomerular hypertrophy as well as a smaller rise in kidney IGF-I than diabetic controls with intact pituitary, indicating that GH per se may be involved in the modulation of renal enlargement. Strict insulin treatment abolishes both the increase in kidney IGF-I and renal hypertrophy. A long-acting somatostatin analog (octreotide) equally inhibits kidney IGF-I accumulation and growth without affecting the blood glucose levels. These results indicate that IGF-I acts as an initiating growth factor for diabetic renal hypertrophy in experimental diabetes. At present there is no direct evidence that IGF-I is involved also in maintaining diabetic kidney hypertrophy and function.",

Furthermore, reduction in renal size and hyperfunction is seen in Type 1 diabetic patients treated with octreotide for a period of three months without discernible reductions in serum GH, glucagon or HbAlc, but with pronounced reductions in circulating IGF-I levels.",

In recent years we have seen the emergence of molecular biology as a tool for studying vasoactive hormone systems and complex diseases such as hypertension. The cloning of cDNA and genomic clones of genes relevant to cardiovascular regulation and their use as molecular probes has allowed investigators to examine the expression of these genes in vivo under normal and pathophysiologieal states. With recent advances in gene transfer technology and genetics these cloned gen~ become important tools with which we can probe the cardiovascular system. The renin-angiotensin system (HAS) is probably one of the most studied regulatory systems involved in arterial pressure and electrolyte balance. I will use this system as a model to demonstrate how recent advances in transgenic animals and molecular genetics have impacted hypertension research.",

In an attempt to develop model systems for this analysis investigators developed transgenic mouse models containing the renin gene. These initial studies, using genomic clones of mouse renin, demonstrated the utility of the approach by accurately reproducing tissue and cell-specific expression of the injected renin con~ructs (1, 2) . A second generation of constructs cumainin~ only the renin promoter region and a reporter gene allowed investigators for the first time to dissect the promoter region and identify sequences essential for tissno-specific renin expression (3).

Humes and co-workers have made a particularly i~oortant observation that T 3 enhances renal tubular cell replication by stimulating epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene expression. These studies would build on the known effects of thyroid hormone on a variety of growth factors and suggest that the ability to increase EGF receptor gene expression would potentiate the mitoqenic response to EGF and thereby accelerate the recovery of renal function. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that beneficial effect of T 4 is not related to a stabilization of the plasma membrane, and that the stimulation of recovery of cellular ATP which is associated with administration of the ho~none is related to an effect directly upon mitochondrial processes involved in post-injury ATP synthesis. Finally, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that the administration of thyroxin following an ischemic renal insult can protect the injured kidney from the additional toxicity conm~nly associated with the administration of Cyclosporin-A.

Holmberg ~ University Children's Hospitals Heidelberg I and Helsinki ~ The confrontation of a child or adolescent with the diagnosis of CRF implies many physical and emotional burdens which in most patients call for external support by their families. During the course of the disease the patients and their families are primarily confronted with the following emotional problems: mental shock by the recognition of the irreversible life-threatening state of CRF requiring a high degree of resistance against painful and unpleasant procedures, compliance with medical instructions and dependence on drugs, technical equipment and hospital staff. The disease is frequently accompanied by injuries to the patient's body (scars, growth retardation, delay of puberty etc.) which makes it visible to everyone. Social integration becomes a difficult task for a child with CRF. The relationship with parents and siblings is frequently neglected. The educational and vocational training is usually impaired, especially in patients with long-term dialysis treatment; even transplanted patients encounter problems in finding a suitable job. In addition, many families suffer from financial restraints induced by the disease. The individual psychosocial problems of CRF patients place extremely high demands on doctors and nurses. As a consequence professional psychosocial care for these patients has been integrated successfully in many pediatric dialysis and transplantation centers during the last decade. The structure of these services has to take into consideration the local and regional conditions. The wide spectrum of tasks that the members of a psychosocial team must fulfill requires a long specialized training closely integrated into the clinical institutions. One important aspect is the wide range of age, social level and severity of CRF to be covered by the psychosocial renal centers. The increasing number of infants and toddlers accepted for treatment of end-stage renal disease requires a thorough and regular assessment of psychomotor and cognitive development.",

As we cannot always predict which children will respond to hormone therapy, we may leave some even more frustrated by offering a treatment that does not deliver results. Most patients with an onset of CRF in childhood at some point outgrow the competence of pediatric care. This raises the following questions: i) What is the optimal age for a transfer to an adult unit? 2) Which are the clinical and psychological criteria to support the decision-making? 3) What is the psychosocial outcome of patients after discharge from the pediatric unit? Recent policies for the transfer of pediatric patients to adult units differ widely, e.g. in the eastern part of Germany patients were regularly transferred before the age of 18 years. In contrast, a recent study on 518 paediatric patients observed in western Germany revealed that nearly one-third were older than 18. An assessment of the late medical and psychological findings of patients who have left their pediatric unit might help in defining criteria for an optimal time of transfer. Preliminary results from a survey of 27 pediatric CRF patients who were discharged from our unit and entered an adult renal unit during the last 4 years are presented. Both clinical and psychosocial data were asked for by a questionnaire. 50 % of patients had been discharged more than 2 years ago. At the time of assessment the patients had a mean age of 22.5 (range 18-28 years); 15 of them had a functioning graft, 8 were on regular hemodialysis treatment and 4 were in preterminal CRF. All patients except 2 had graduated, 13 were taking vocational training, 9 working full-time, and 3 were without occupation. One-third of the patients received no financial support. 5 were married and one male had a child. Except for 2 all patients lived with their parents. Only 9 reported to practice sports regularly. Professional psychosocial support was not available in 75 % of the adult units where the patients were followed further, although half of them expressed their wish for such support being available. The findings will be compared with patients aged >18 years who remained under pediatric care. We conclude that the age for transfer of an adolescent with CRF from a pediatric to an adult renal unit must be chosen individually, taking into account medical as well as psychological findings. The psychosocial team of a pediatric unit seems to be in an optimal position to support a smooth and gradual detachment of the CRF patient, thus enabling him to reach autonomy and integration into adult and professional life.",

It is not always realized that application of newer technology is much more than just a matter of Finances: Besides careful fraining, a different approach to the work itself in terms of efficiency and quality is needed. Strong mobivstion is essential. Where should priorities be given? This mainly depends on the local situation and the historical background. The problems in the former Sovietunion and in some eastern European countries differ inherently from those in the southern hemisphere. Our own experience in Armenia, where a longterm medical programme emerged From acute help affer the earthquake of 7.12.88, has shown to us that in a particular situation_ it is possible to start with a sophisticated method (haemodialysis) before building up a solid infrastructure with basic nephrology and urology. Practical considerations: Since any technology is appropriate only as long as it can be integrated into a given system, the goals that can realistically be reached have first to be defined. The requirements to be met concerning time, funding, material, persons involved, responsibilities and training facilities are then defermined. A partnership (twinning) with another centre is an efficient way and can be very rewarding for either side. Prerequisites for twinning to become successf'ul are: Personal involvement, mutual respees mastering a common language, continuing support and acceptance of given limitations. What is appropriate technology? Basic principles are: Equipment must not necessarily be new, but should be sturdy and amenable to local servicing. Not the initial costs, but the subsequent longterm costs (e.g. for reagents) are critical. All anterior pituitary hormones are secreted in a pulsatile fashion. Both frequency and amplitude are important for the biological stimulus to the gonad. The pituitary gland acts as a modulator, increasing the amplitude of the signal, while the hypothalamus controls the pulse frequency. (InRH is the only hypothalamic-releasing hormone which controls the differential release of two pituitary gonadotrophins, LH and FSH. The exact mech~lim whereby this occurs has not yet been fully described, although changes in pulse frequency, within the physiological range, are not as important as had previously been believed and may predominantly reflect sex steroid concentrations.",

Low amplitude, high f~equeficy bursts of gonadotrophin secretion probably occur during early childhood which are relatively inf~eduant and not linked to the night time. When pulsatile CnP~q secretion has become entrained to the night, and every night, this is synonymous with the appearance of a milticystic ovarian morphology (> six cysts of > 4m~ in diametre). Sex steroid'levels continue to rise, related to the increased amplitude of nocturnal gonadotrophin pulses, a threshold is attained which induces secondary sexual characteristics. This is the onset of phanotypic puberty but the endocrine changes have continued throughout childhood. The establishment of high amplitude gonadotrophin poises during the daytime, as well as at night, is a prerequisite for the LH surge and the development of ovulatory menstrual cycles. In delayed pubertal development, the devotee of gonadotrophin insufficiency produces a clinical spectrtm between complete absence of secondary sexual characteristics and failure to attain ovulatory cycles.",

It may be that the effect is dese-dependent and ~my well limit the pharmacological use of CH treatment in conditions wbJ_ch b~ve endogenous puberty. The induced increase in ~owth rate with GH treatment may be coenteracted by an increased rate of epiphyseal closure. The increased GH secretion in pubertal children with chronic reeal failure is probably related to end-organ hyporesponsivesees. However, whether this hyporesponsiveness effects the gonad as well as cartilaginous Erowth plates is unknown. Delayed sexual maturation and impaired pubertal growth are major complications of advanced chronic renal failure (CRF). Reports from the EDTA Registry suggest that pubertal development in end-stage CRF starts with an average delay of about two years. In a recent retrospective longitudinal analysis of pubertal growth in CRF, we found a similar delay of the pubertal growth spurt (Pediatr Res 28:5-10). The age at onset of the growth spurt is inversely correlated with the duration of CRF. Whilst the duration of pubertal maturation does not appear to be prolonged, we observed subnormal testicular growth in boys with end-stage CRF, and late menarche followed by persistent menstrual cycle abnormalities are common in girls. The pubertal height gain is reduced to about 50 % of normal, resulting in an irreversible loss of growth potential and compromised final height.",

At entry, 25 patients were in preterminal CRF (GFR < 25 ml/min/1.73m2), 14 were on dialysis, and 31 after transplantation. Severe retardation of growth and development was documented at start of the study by a mean height SDS of -2 and a mean bone age delay of almost 2 years. Since pubertal development is associated with the emergence of a pulsatile secretory pattern of luteinizing hormone (LH), increasing LH bioactivity, and an amplification of episodic growth hormone (GH) secretion, studies of spontaneous LH and GH secretion are performed at annual intervals. Preliminary analyses demonstrate a reduction of LH peak frequency and fractional amplitude, and markedly reduced biopotency of the circulating LH in dialysed patients (Pediatr Nephrol 5:569-577). Differentiation of the LH profiles into the underlying secretory and eliminatory components by means of the deconvolution technique revealed that the production rate of LH is reduced by nearly two thirds in pubertal uremic patients. Since, probably due to impaired renal elimination, LH plasma half-life is prolonged, mean plasma levels are normal or even elevated. Whether this masked suppression of pulsatile LH secretion is of pathophysiological importance or rather reflects an adaptation to impaired metabolic clearance remains to be established. After transplantation, the observed changes appear to be reversible.",

            "text": "Pulsatile GH secretion appears to be altered primarily by modulation of peak amplitudes, whilst the frequency of GH peaks remains stable. The two major determinants of GH peak amplitude were pubertal progress (physiological increase to maximum at Puberty stage III/IV) and the degree of renal dysfunction (highest amplitudes in dialysed patients). In transplant patients, by contrast, the pubertal increase in GH peak amplitudes was diminished. We observed an inverse relationship between peak amplitude and corticosteroid dosage, suggesting suppression of GH release by these compounds. Since growth velocity was inversely correlated with GH peak amplitudes in transplant but not in uremic patients, it appears likely that pubertal growth failure is associated with GH resistance in the latter and with steroid-induced GH hyposecretion in the former. The further longitudinal follow-up of our patients should allow to correlate their endocrine abnormalities with clinical development. A)Ws studied the effects of chronic renal failure on the pituitar'y-cortisol axis and adrenal androgen function in 26 patients (16 male and l0 female), aged 6.5 to 22.5 years (mean 14.5). All of them were on Chronic hemodialysis. Pubic hair development was delayed in 56% of the patients. Serum cortisol was increased in 15 out of the 26 patients. Serum ,a 4-androstenedione was high in 11 out of 15 patients in Tanner's stage I or II and in 1 out of 11 patients in Tanner's stage III, IV or V ( p q0.01). Serum e ortisol was elevated in 10 out of 12 patients with high serum Ix 4-androstenedione and in only 5 out of 14 with normal A 4-androstenedione (p <0.02). Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was normal in 22 patients and elevated in 4 males. There was a significant inverse correlation between bone age and serum eortisol (r:-0.59: p<0.005) and a significant positive correlation between bone age and serum dehydoepiandrosterone sulphate (r:0.45 p <0.01). Serum ACTH was normal~ A reduction by 50% in cortisol and 78% in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found after dexamethasone suppression, but /k 4-androstenedione did not suppress after dexamethasone. After ACTH stimulation test cortisol increased by 50% and /% 4-androstenedione by 80%. Following cortieotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation 6 out of 10 patients (60%) showed an excessive ( ~ 810 nmol/1) rise in serum eortisol. Conclusions: The increased levels of eortisol and /k 4-an drostenedione with partial resistance to dexamethasone and excessive rise in cortisol after CRH suggest that these patients have a hypothalamie pituitary dysfunction similar to that found in Cushing's disease or in chronic stress. The difference in the responses of ~ 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate observed is consistent with the existence of different mechanisms of control for these two steroids.",

Our findings of low total T4 and free T4 levels associated with altered TSH response to TRH and an impaired nocturnal TSH surge, support the hypothesis that patients with ESRD and after Tx have central hypothyroidism. The presence of deficient TSH response to TRH in our Tx patients suggests that glucocorticoids which are known to decrease TSH secretion, may be acting predominantly at the pituitary level; perhaps partial recovery of the altered thyroid function can be achieved by lower doses of D.

            "text": "However, until the pathogenesis of each is better understood, they should be separated in any investigational study. (1) IgA nephropathy should be regarded as a syndrome. Schonlein Henoch purpura glomeru!onephritis (SHP-GN) and idiopathic IgA nephropathy (IgA-GN) represent the primary and the most frequent forms of this syndrome. SHP-GN and IgA-GN share the same histopathological features. Therefore, in spite of their difference in clinical presentation, a close relationship exists between these 2 diseases. In both, the glomerular involvement is characterized by a \"mesangiopathy\" with diffuse mesangial deposits that contain predominantly IgA and with varying degrees of hypercellularity and of superimposed crescent formation. For the sake of clinicopathologic correlations, 4 histopathologic categories may be individualized: characterized by the presence of a variable proportion of crescents superimposed on a proliferative endocapillary GN. We have subdivided this category in two grades, the cut-off point being 50% of crescentic glomerulL Several comprehensive clinicopathologic studies (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) have shown that in both diseases the best prognostic indicators are the severity of the presenting renal symptoms and particularly the amount of proteinuria as well as the histopathologic pattern. Overall, the larger the number of glomeruli affected by crescents, the poorer the prognosis. We have studied 151 consecutive children presenting with SHP-GN and followed for t to 18 years in order to determine the characteristics of the patients (pts) at risk of developing end stage renal failure (ESRF). Of the 91 pts with a nephretic syndrome (NS) at time of biopsy, 35 (38%) had a poor outcome defined by persisting signs of nephropathy and/or progression to ESRF. Fifty four of the 91 pts (59%) had shown on renal biopsy a EEGN with 50% or more of crescentic glomeruli. Pathology is a better discriminant prognostic feature than NS since, of the 68 pts with 50% or more of crescentic glomeruli 38 (55%) had a poor outcome, including 25 who progressed to ESRF. On long-term follow-up, Goldstein et al (7) have recently found that 17 pts deteriorated clinically from an initial assessment in 1971, 7 of whom had apparently recovered in 1976. We studied in parallel 157 consecutive children presenting with IgA-GN and tollowed for 1 to 16 years. Among the 119 pts with recurrent macroscopic hematuria, only 20 (17%) had a poor outcome, whereas of the 38 pts with microscopic hematuria, 21 (55%) had a poor outcome. By contrast, among the 25 pts with a NS 16, (64%) had a poor outcome. Twelve of these 25 pts (48%) had shown on renal biopsy a EEGN with 50% or more of crescentic glomeruli. Outcome was also closely related to histopathology~ w of the 21 pts with 50% or more of crescentic glomeruli, 12 (57%) had a poor outcome, including 8 who progressed to ESRF. Therefore, the 2 features which identify the severe forms of IgA nephropathies are the presence of a nephrotic syndrome and/or glomerular involvement characterized by 50% or more of crescentic glomeruli. However, in both diseases clinical recovery is possible and usually associated with histological improvement as demonstrated on repeat renal biopsies. A study of sequential specimens showed a disappearance of cellular proliferation and a decrease in the number and size of the crescents as well as a decrease or a disappearance of IgA deposits. The role of treatment in these improvements was difficult to assess since most patients with severe forms of IgA nephropathies had been treated. In the recent years we have undertaken a prospective study on the use of methlylprednisolone pulses in severe forms of IgA nephropathies. Our results indicate that this treatment is associated in a high proportion of cases with both a clinical and a histological improvement. Morever, the clinical tolerance of the treatment has always been excellent. ",

Moreover, a particular polymorphism of the immunoglobulin heavy chain switch region as well as an increase frequency of homozygous C4B nul, C3FF and BfFF phenotypes have been observed. The direct pathogenetic role of the IgA abnormalities noted in IgANs remain questionnable since they can be observed in individuals presenting with no renal signs. Moreover, IgA is a weak activator of complement and isolated glomerular IgA deposits -without IgG or IgM -do not generally induce histological lesions in experimental models. However, IgA molecules located in CIC containing also potent activators of the complement cascade -as IgG, IgM or antigens -may contribute to glomerular injury by favouring the renal deposition of the latter complexes by several ways : 1 ~ a decrease of the CIC clearance by the C3b-H function of the phagocytic mononuclear system ; 2 ~ an increase of CIC size ; 3 ~ an increase binding of CIC to renal leetins through IgA oligosaccharidic chains. IgA nephropathy is a leading cause of chronic renal disease and end-stage renal disease in adult patients, and recent long-term studies assessing the prognosis in children have challenged earlier views that IgA nephropathy represents a benign disorder. Thus IgA nephropathy presents a therapeutic challenge in both adults and children. Prospective multicenter therapeutic trials of specific treatments for IgA nephropathy in children are in progress in Japan. A purpose of our study is to treat children with IgA nephropathy early in the course of disease. Early detection and successful therapy is one of the major goals of our study. We started this study in March, 1990 and 130 children with IgA nephropathy have entered the trial. All patients had initial renal biopsies after 1990 and had no treatment before biopsy. We divided these patients into those with diffuse mesangial proliferation and those with focal or minimal mesangial proliferation based on light microscopy finding. Sixty patients with diffuse mesangial proliferation were randomized into the 2 treatment groups. Prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin and dipyridamole have been given in the group 1, and heparin-wartarin and dipyridamole have been given in the group 2. The duration of treatment is 24 months in both groups. The mean time of the start of treatment from onset or discovery of urinary abnormalities was 10 months. Interim results show significant reduction of urinary protein excretion in group 1 patients, but no reduction in group 2 patients. These data suggest that long-term glucocorticoid treatment combined with immunosuppressive, anticoagulant and antithrombotic drugs may be of benefit in those with evidence of disease of relatively short duration.",

In addition to the eytostatie etf~t proven by thymidinr and ufidine incorporation, it could be shown, that sodium dependent glucose transport, the aminoacid transport and the phosphate transport were inhibited by these substances. Recent clinical studies implicate, that the neph.rotoxicity of IFO developed mainly in patients, who have experienced a combinado, of IFO and Cisplatinum. This seems to indicate the potential additive toxic effect. Single ease reports demonstrate that a definite renal toxicity long time after cessation of cytostattc treatment can progress to severn, renal insufficiency without therapeutic chances. Preventive measures are based on the ongoing analysis of the causes. In a eonsel~sus conference 1991 (3) the following risk factors lmve been suspected to be most probable: Very young age,lFO-treatment in combination with Cisplatinum, irradiation, single kidneys, accumulative doses of IFO (more than 90 g/kg). In an ongoing attempt to analyse the mechanisms involved and to develop definite accurate risk factors, it may be soon possible to give recommendations for preventive procedures. In a model of chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, we have demonstrated that CsA treatment causes renal vasoconstriction, impaired RBF autoregulation, and abnormalities in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) characterized by a marked hypotensive response to acute inhibition of the RAS, and elevated PRA and renal renin content. To explore a possible association between the renal functional and RAS abnormalities, we examined renin distribution and measured microvasenlar responses to perfusion pressure (PP) and angiotensin II in blood perfused, juxtamedullary vessels in vitro. Pair-fed rats rseeived 25 mg/kg/day CsA s.c. or vehicle for 19-23 days. Responses of terminal juxtaglomerular (jAA) and mid-afferent arteriolar (mAA) segments were measured. PP was increased from 60 to 140 mmHg in 10 CsA and 13 control (CON) kidneys. A consistent finding was the marked thickening of arteriolar walls in the CsA rats. Autoregulatory responses were impaired by CsA. In the jAA, lumen diameter decreased by 37+3% (SE) in CGN, vs 95:9% in CsA. In the mAA, diameter was reduced by 34+4% in CON vs 185:6% in CsA. At 60 mmHg, CsA vessels were unresponsive to All (l riM): jAA diameter decreased by 245:4% in CON vs 2+4% in CsA. However, AII partially restored the autoregulatory responses in both segments.",

The percentage of juxtaglomerular apparatuses eontahaing renin was higher in CsA (845:5.5 %) than in the CON (615:7 %) group. The length of renin immunostaining along AA was higher in CsA (74+5 ttm) than in CON (375:5 #m). In contrast, neither renin mRNA levels (Northern analysis) nor its intrarenal distribution were altered by chronic CsA treatment. To further characterize the renin isoform(s) present in CsA treated kidneys, kidney tissue homogenate was analyzed by immtmobloning of denatured samples separated by polyaerylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS PAGE) or by analytical isoelectric focusing (IEF). The estimated molecular weight of immtmoreactive renin separated by SDS PAGE in CsA and CON kidney homogenate was similar (MW range 47,000-53,000 Da). However, immunoreaetive ranin separated by IEF showed the presence of an additional acidic isoform (pI 5.45:0.1) in CsA kidney homogenate not found in CON kidney homogenate (isoforms pI 6.25:0.2 and 5.7 5:0.1). Thus, CsA 1) causes loss of juxtamedullary AA reactivity and AII responsiveness, 2) induces recruitment of renin-containing ceils along the AA; 3) causes no change in renin mRNA levels or distribution; and 4) induces the production of an acidic isoform of renin suggesting that post-translational events may be responsible for the generation/or accumulation of renin(s) in the preglomerular mierovasculzture. It has been known for many years that a rapid increase in remnant kidney size occurs following unilateral nephrectomy (UNX).",

            "text": "However, the mechanisms that govern this accelerated rate of kidney growth have not been clarified. Furthermore, although there appear to be age-related differences in the rates and types of growth (i.e. relatively more rapid and hyperplastic increase in renal mass in young vs. slower, hypertrophic growth in adults), the changes are not well-defined. Recently, our laboratory has focussed on the possible role of the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis in this process, because of the growth-promoting effects of GH and the evidence that the presence of the anterior pituitary is required for a normal compensatory renal growth. In the first series of experiments plasma GH levels were determined over a 6 hr period in conscious, unrestrained shamoperated and UNX adult (14 week old) and weanling (27-28 days) male Wistar rats. Within 24 hr of UNX, the puisatilc release of GH increased 3-to 4-fold in adult rats (/'<0.05). Moreover, when pulsatile GH secretion was suppressed in UNX rats, with an i.v. injection of a synthetic peptide antagonist to GH-releasing factor (GRF-AN: [N-Ac-~ft1-A~g2]-GRF-(I-29)-NH2), compensatory renal growth was significantly attenuated (by 66%, P<0.05) in the adult remnant kidneys 24 hr post-UNX. In contrast, plasma GH levels were not elevated in weanling rats 24 hr post-UNX, and preferential renal growth was still observed in young rats treated with GRF-AN (65\u2022 which did not differ from remnant kidney growth seen in saline-treated UNX rats (69*-5%). The increase in renal growth in immature GH-suppressed rats occurred despite a significant reduction in body weight gain. These findings suggested that the initial phase of compensatory renal growth is GHdependent in adult rats and GH-independent in weanling rats. To further test this notion, experiments were performed to assess the genetic expression of the renal GH receptor (GHR). RNA was extracted from control and remnant kidneys (24 hr UNX) by the guanidium-isothiocyanate/CsC1 method, and the integrity of RNA was confirmed by analysis of the ethidiumbromide stained 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands. Solution hybridization/RNase protection assays were performed on 20/.~g of RNA from each control and remnant kidney using a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe for the GHR mRNA. Levels of GHR mRNA were elevated (3fold above controls) in adult, but not weanling, remnant kidneys. These results provided further evidence for the GH-dependence of compousatory renal growth in adult rats. We next evaluated the IGF-I component of the axis. Using antisense riboprobes in solution hybridization/RNase protection assays, renal IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) gone expression declined in adult remnant kidneys, but increased 3-to 4-fold in remnant kidney from immature rats. The changes in renal IGF-I mRNA were confirmed by/n s/tu hybridization and localized primarily, but not exclusively, to the inner stripe of the outer medulla. Associated with the increase in IGF-IR mRNA levels in remnant kidneys from weanling rats was a 47% rise in binding of t2sI-IGF-I to renal plasma membranes (P<0.05), which was localized to the cortical region of the kidney. These studies indicate that there are differential mechanisms governing compensatory renal growth in weanling and adult rats. Although GH and IGF-I appear to be involved, the axis is dissociated in this paradigm. Compensatory renal growth in adult rats appears to be GHdependent with an increase in GHR gene expression hut independent of IGF-I, whereas compensatory renal growth in the weanling rat is GHindependent, but associated with significant increases in renal IGF-I and IGF-I receptor gone expression, as well as increases in specific IGF-I binding.",

            "text": "To what extent the selective dependence of different aged rats on either GH or IGF-I represents an important element in the mechanism underlying the beterotypic pattern of compensatory renal growth (hypertrophy vs hyperplasia), is a central issue that remains to be elucidated. Background: Dopamine (DA} is an intrarenal natriuretic hormone. The proximal tubule (PT) cells are the main source of DA. L-DOPA enters PT cells and is converted to DA by the enzyme aromatic L-amino and decarboxylase (AADC). DA acts natriuretically by inhibiting the activity of Na+,K+ATPase (NKA) in several tubule segments. Inactivation of NKA activity is due to phosphorylation of the catalytic e subonit of the enzyme. The effect involves activation of the D1 receptor, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and activation of a DA and cAMP regulated phosphatase inhibitor, DARPP-32. In some cell types activation of the D1 receptor only is sufficient to inhibit NKA activity (example thick ascending limb, TAL, Henle cells). In other cell types NKA activity is inhibited by a synergistic action of the D1 and D2 receptors (example PT cells). Ontoaenv of renal dooamine system in rats: We have with immunohistochemistry located AADC to PT cells. AADC is present already in the fetal kidney, and the expression of the enzyme appears to reach a peak around 20 days el age (weanling period for rats). DA activation of adenylate cyclase and inhibition of NKA activity increases with age in PT cells. DA activation of adenylate cyclase and inhibition el NKA activity decreases with age in TAL cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that DA might play a role for cell differentiation. We have examined the presence of DARPP-32 in the fetal, infant and adolescent kidney. In the fetal kidney DARPP-32 is very abundant in the ureter bud and is also present in the mesenchymal cells surrounding the ureter bud. When nephrogenesis is completed, around the 8th postnatal day, the DARPP-32 signal fades to reappear in late infancy and reach a peak in the adult kidney In the adult kidney, DARPP-32 is present both in PT and TAL cells. Both immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting indicate a higher abundance in TAL. The non-specific phosphatase inhibitor, inhibitor-I, is not present to any larger extent in the tetal kidney, but is co-localized with and generally more abundant than DARPP-32 in the adult renal tubule cells. Conctusion: The dopamine system is present both during nephrogenesis and in tubular cells of the mature kidney, indicating that DA may be of significance both tor kidney differentiation and for regulation of tubular Na+ transport. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, glomerular capillary pressure and tubular ions transport. Numerous studies have been devoted to the analysis of the RAS during kidney entogenesis. The juxtaglemerular apparatus (JGA) differenciates in tight association with the developing nephrons and may be identified from the late S-body stage in the first metanephrons of 8 week old fetus. Renin has been detected from the 5th week of the intra-uterine life in human mesonephros. In the metanephros, the first renin-positive cells are detected in the absence of fully developed JGA. The distribution of renin and its mRNA shifts with maturation from large intrarenal arteries to the classical juxtaglomerular localization (1). The distribution of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) is also developmentally regulated. In fetal kidneys it is expressed on the apical and basolateral membranes of proximal tubular cells, before the differenciation of brush borders, and on glomeruiar endothelial cells as soon as the capillary invades the inferior cleft of the S-shaped body. Conversely in post-natal kidneys, ACE is found in endothelial cells of peritubular capillaries and progressively disappears from glomerular endothelial cells (2), Angiotensinogen (Ao) is present in proximal tubular cells of developing nephrons (2) . Its renal synthesis has been demonstrated by molecular biology techniques (3). Angiotensin II receptors have been ~shown to be present in kidneys of late gestation rat fetus but also in areas not normally expected to contain angiotensin II receptors (4) . Therefore, all the components of the RAS exist within the fetal kidney and may contribute to the control of intrarenal hemodynamics as in the adult kidney. In addition, it has been suggested that angiotensin II, which stimulates angiogenesis, is important in the glomerular growth of maturing kidney (2, 5) . Dysregulation of the RAS may be observed in developing kidneys in various pathologic conditions. Experimenta! studies have shown increase in renin content and renin gene expression in developing kidneys subjected to ureteral obstruction (6) . in 2 anuric neonates exposed to ACE inhibitors during pregnancy, we observed a marked increase in the number of kidney renin-positive cells, associated with severe tubule-interstitial lesions. Although this complication is rather rare (7) close surveillance of fetal urinary output and post-natal renal function is necessary when ACE inhibitors have to be prescribed during the last weeks of pregnancy. In anuric neonates whose mothers had been treated with indomethacin (ID) because of preterm labor or polyhydramnios, increase in renal renin was detected by immunohistochemistry. It was associated with ischemic changes of the deep cortex and more or less extensive cystic dilatation of superficial nephrons (8) . The increase in immunoreactive renin suggests that prior stimulation of the RAS could favor the appearance of renal failure in fetus exposed to prostaglandin inhibitors treatment.",

All these conditions can lead to renal insufficiency and failure. The vasoactive agents used in high-risk neonates can also stress the immature kidney whose perfusion and glomerular filtration are extremely labile. Most of the conditions that affect renal function do so by increasing the renal vascular tonel leading to renal hypoperfusion. Maintaining or restoring cardiac output, while decreasing the renal vascular resistance, is the best way to protect the kidney. This can be achieved by normalizing the homeostasis of body fluids composition and volume. Adequate ventilation and careful correction of the acidosis are also mandatory.",

Hypoxemia activates vasoactive forces that increase the renal vascular resistance, thus leading to the so-called vasomotor nephropathy. Experiments have been performed in newborn anesthetized rabbits to better define the vasoactive forces that are activated during hypoxemia, and to explore ways of preventing the occurrence of the vasomotor nephropathy. At the glomerular level, vasoactive agents vasoconstrict (angiotensin II) or vasodilate (adenosine) the efferent arteriole, while the combined effects of angiotensinII and adenosine result in afferent vasoconstriction. Circumstantial evidence indicates that endothelin also participates in the hypoxemia-induced renal vasoconstriction: a) the intravenous infusion of endothelin to normoxemic animals produces renal hemodynamic changes reminiscent of those induced by the hypoxemic stress, and b) the renal hemodynamic changes normally observed during a hypoxemic stress are partially blunted when a endothelin-1 antiserum is administered before the stress. The worsening of the renal response to hypoxemia in animals pretreated with indomethacin suggests that the prostaglandins play a role in protecting the stressed kidney. Also, the increase in RBF induced by hypoxemia when the release of angiotensin II and adenosine is inhibited by the administration of converting enzyme inhibitors and theophylline, respectively, suggests that nitric oxide could be released during hypoxemia to protect the stressed kidney.",

We have previously demonstrated that P depletion and euparathyroid vitamin D deficiency induce a taurinuria which is associated with reduced Na*-dependent T uptake by renal proximal tubule brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) and decreased affinity of the T symport. We studied the effect of P depletion and D deficiency on the stoiehiometry of the T-Na+-CI\" cotransporter in the proximal tubule. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed one of the following diets: I) CON (0.7~ P, 5.5 ~g~ D); 2) D*P\" (0.I~ P, 5.5 #g~ D); D'P + (0.7~ P, 0 #g~ D). All diets contained 1.2~ Ca. A group of rats fed D'P + were supplemented with 500 pmoles of 1,25[OH]2D , IM, one day prior to sacrifice (SUPP). T uptake by BBMV was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of external Na + or CI\" at 15 sec. P depletion resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in plasma Ca and a 3.6-fold decrease in plasma P compared to CON (p<O.001 # pmoles/mg protein/15 sec. We conclude that P depletion and vitamin D deficiency effect a stoichiometrie change in the T symport which involves Cl\" and spares Na \u00a7 We speculate that this alteration may reduce the affinity of the T cotransporter in the proximal tubule with consequent taurinuria. Introduction: Little attention has been paid to interplay among calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone and vitamin D in primary renal tubular hypokalemic alkalosis and hypomagnesemia with hypocalciuria (Gitelman syndrome). This tubular disorder has been often confused with classic Bartter syndrome and presents with tetanic crises complicating the course of febrile respiratory diseases in schoolchildren and adolescents. The diagnostic laboratory criteria include normal blood pressure, venous blood pFi >7.38, plasma bicarbonate >28s mmol/1, plasma magnesium <0.75 retool/l, and molar ratios of urinary calcium to ereatinine <0.20, urinary chloride to creatinine >8.50, and urinary magnesium to creatinine >0.15. Study design: Plasma and urinary electrolytes, and intact parathyroid hormone (two site immunoradiometric assay) and metabolites of vitamin D (25(OH)-Ds and t,25(OH)2-D3) in blood were studied after overnight fast in 13 untreated Gitelman patients aged 10-17-21 years (ranges and median) and 13 healthy controls aged 16-18-20 years. Various studies differ considerably in their assessment of proteinuric patterns in the course of transplant malfunction. Especially the differentiation between cyclosporine (CyA) toxicity end acute rejection has been a major problem. 734 urine samples from 38 patients after kidney transplantation were examined by gradient gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with consecutive Coomassie Blue (CB) and silver staining. ~22 histologically proven rejections and 20 CyA overdosage episodes were diagnosed in these patients. No changes in proteinuric patterns were seen in 9 of 22 patients after CB stain, whereas silver stain revealed a typical rise of glomerular protein bands in 19 of 22 cases. Discrimination between CyA overdosage and rejection was possible with a probability of p<O.O01 after silver stain. Secondly IgG, transferrin (TP), albumin (Alb), -microglobulin (M -MG), D2-microglobulin (D2-MG) were determined daily in 24h-urine samples of 127 allograft recipients using immunoluminometric assays. Ouring 64 rejections (both vascular and interstitial) a sudden rise in \"glomerular\" proteins (IgG, TF, Alb) could be seen with no changes in \"tubular\" proteinuria (~-MG, ~2-MG). Acute CyA toxicity showed no changes in the excretion of urinary proteins in 5 patients. Our findings suggest that application of highly sensitive silver stain instead of the conventional CB stain after SDS-PAGE and the daily determination of specific urinary proteins by immunometric assays offer considerable progress in monitoring renal transplant recipients. With the exception of supportive measures, modal\u2022 used to treat acute allograft rejection (AR) aredirectedat modulation of the immune system. Initially AR is characterized by per\u2022 vascular infiltration and ischemia consequent to cortical vasoconstriction. Because sANP increases intrarenal perfusion in states of vasoconstriction and alters glomerular capillary Starling forces to promote increased filtration, this study was undertaken to determine if administration of sANP lessens the severity of the vasomotor nephropathy caused by early AR. Seven mongrel dogs underwent unilateral nephrectomy and allotransplantation without immunosuppressive therapy.",

Cytokines are released upon stimulation of bacterial products such as LPS (endotoxin) from Gram-negative bacteria. These cytokines than mediate many of the inflammatory responses seen as e g increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis, fever and increased CRP. In this study we used ELISA assays to measure the two inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (I1-6) (Medgenix diagnostics) and interleukin 8 (I1-8) (British Bio-technology Limited) in the urine from newly admitted children between 0-7 years of age with acute first-time non-obstructive pyelonephritis. Children of the same age with fever of non-renal origin served as controls. I1-6 was detected in the urine of 58% of the children with acute pyelonephritis but only in one child with non-renal fever. I1-8 was detected in the urine of all children with pyelonephritis, median 300 pg/ml (range 68->2000 pg/ml). In only one child with nonrenal fever I1-8 could be detected in the urine at a concentration of 70 pg/ml. Conclusion: The presence of I1-8 in the urine seems to be a good indicator of pyelonephritis in children. Further larger studies are needed to verify our data. The effects of the drugs, CsA and FK on monocyte functions am controversial and not well understood. We have been using THP-1, a human monocytic leukemia cell line to study the effects of these drugs in comparison to DEX on rnonocyte functions. We have examined the ability of these drugs, alone and in combination, to suppress rnonokine production in vitro by THP-1 cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide, CsA added in increasing concentrations of 50-1000ng/ml suppressed IL-lbeta from the control of 857+198 (mea +n~SE) to 314-'l:137pg/ml but increasing concentrations of the drug greater than 50ng/ml had no further significant suppressive effect on IL-1 production. In the same manner FK added in concentrations of 1-10ng/ml suppressed production to 352+-126pg/ml but increasing the concentration of FK above lng/ml did not increase suppression of IL-1. DEX added in concentrations of from 0.1-100OHM did, however, decrease production of IL-1 in a dose dependent fashion from the control level to undetectable levels. FK was then added in increasing concentrations (O-4ng/ml) to 250ng/ml of CsA but it did not further suppress IL-1 production below thai caused by CsA alone. In the same way when ~ was added in increasing concentrations (0-500ng/ml) to 2ng/ml of FK, the mean IL-1 production did not change, DEX added in increasing concentrations (0-100nM) to either ~A or FK further suppressed IL-1. The addition of 100 ng/ml CSA or lng/ml FK to 100riM DEX suppressed IL-1 productiOn more than DEX alone, but further increases in the Concentrations of either CsA or FK caused no further suppression of monokine production. These data suggest that FK and CsA suppress IL-1 production by the same mechanism and that DEX works-by a different mechanism. Further studies may contribute to out understanding of mo,ocyte physiology. To determine if such effect is also present in vivo, we evaluated renal potassium excretion in 49 children with idiopathic hyperealciuria (UCaV = 5.5 + l.S mg/kg/day) and in 214 age-matched control children (UC~V = 1.9 + 0.3 mg/ kg/day). In comparison to controls, hypercalciuric children had significantly increased levels of sodium excretion (FENa = 0.7 + 0.3 % vs 0.6 + 0.3 %, p ~ 0.001) and decreased levels of frac{ionsl potassium excretion (7.2 + 2.9 % vs 9.2 + 3.4 %, p < 0.001), urinary potassium concentration to urinary sodium concentration (0.4 + 0.2 vs 0.6 + 1.0, p ~ 0.001) and transtubular potassium concentration gradient (4.2 + 1.5 vs 5.9 + 1.5, p < 0.001). After an oral calcium load, carried out according to the Pak protocol in SO hypercalciuric children, the increased rates of urinary calcium excretion (UCaV = 0.07 + 0.05 @ 0.20 + 0.ii mg/dl GF) were accompanied by increasedrates of urinary sodium excretion (FENa = 0.6 + O.S ~ i.I + 0.7 %) but by a significant decrease in transtubular potassium concentration gradient (8.6 + 2.7 ~ 6.5 ~ 3.1). All indices of potassium excretion correlated significantly and inversely with urinary calcium excretion (p<O.O01). These results support the conclusion that increased luminal calcium concentration also inhibits renal potassium secretion in man, probably by decreasing sodium conductance at the apical membrane of principal cells of distal and cortical collecting tubules, and thus decreasing the electrochemical driving force for potassium secretion. The observed increase in sodium excretion following a calcium load puts also into question the accepted interpretation that, when increased rates of both substances are present, hypercalciuria is secondary to increased sodium intake. The present results support the reverse conclusion that the hyperna~riuria is secondary to hypercalciuria. The natriuretic and diuretic effects observed after the administration of pyrogenic agents or endotoxin could be mediated by cytokins. In the rabbit, the systemic acute injection of human recombinant Interleukin-1 (/L-l) induces significant increases in urine flow and sodium excretion rates, along with marked decreases in systemic mean blood pressure (MBP) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The natriuretic and diuretic renal response to IL-1 could be due to a) a systemic effect of the cytokin, or b) a direct renal effect of the cytokin on tubular reabsorption. These hypotheses were tested in pentobarbital-anesthetized mechanically-ventilated rabbits undergoing standard inulin and PAH clearance studies. After a control period, experimental animals (n=10) were injected IL-113 (100 ~tg) in the left renal artery, while control animals (n=9) received the vehicle only. The intrarenal injection of IL-113 increased rectal temperature by 0.8~ but did not alter MBP, GFR or PAH clearance in the 2 hours following the injection. By contrast, urine flow rate and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) increased significantly as compared to the control period (diuresis: +29%, p<0.01; FENa: +51%, p<0.05) or to the controlateral kidney. There was no change in any of the measured parameters in the vehicle-injected control group. In contrast with the systemic injection, the intrarenal injection of ILl[3 did not result in an increase in the urinary excretion of PGE 2. We conclude that IL-1 directly inhibits the tubular reabsorption of sodium and water in the rabbit. The increased PGE 2 synthesis which occurs after the iv injection of IL-1 does not mediate the/L-l-induced natriuresis. Familial juvenile nephronophthisis (NPH), an autosomal recessive disease, is the commonest genetic cause for end stage renal failure in children. We are trying to map a gene for NPH by linkage analysis as an approach towards a molecular characterization of the genetic defect.",

We prospectively investigated renal function in 34 Nx children with regard to treatment nephrotoxicity and age at the time of Nx. 6 children, who underwent Nx for nonmalignant disease (normal contralateral kidney) served as controls (group C). Renal function study was mainly based on Cin (ml/min/1.73m 2) and Cpah (ml/min/1.73m2).

Over the past two years, sequential studies were obtained on 71 pediatric renal transplant patients of which 56 were first time transplants (49 living related donor and 7 cadaver donor transplants). Patients were studied 0.1 to 13 years post transplant. Twenty five patients required at least one biopsy for renal dysfunction. Eigh'~een patients showed mild to severe acute cellular and/or vascular rejection. These biopsied patients were all assessed with immunophenotyping panels. Although several markers are used in this assessment, the single most predictive parameter was the ratio of the CD4 + subsets [CD4 +,CD29 +:CD4+,CD45RA+] or the T inducers of help: T inducers of suppression {Tih:Tis). Tih:Tis increased over previous values obtained in these patients during biopsy proven rejection Imedian = 233% of baseline response, range = 133-400%, n = 18) as compared to patients .who did not have rejection (median = 93% of baseline response, range = 56-101%, n=7) (p<0.O01 by Mann Whitney U test). In fact al ._!l patients with rejection had an increase in Tih:Tis ratio, whereas only one of the non-rejecting group had a slight increase. In addition, this ratio decreased in parallel with the serum ereatinine and B~MG level after effective anti-rejection therapy. Changes in the CD4:CD8 ratio were no tt consistently altered during rejection episodes, but appeared to aid in diagnosing viral or bacterial infections, as has been found previously. When utilized in tandem, the CD4:CD8 and the Tih:Tis ratios are valuable additions to the follow up assessment of pediatric renal transplant patients, and, if used sequentially, may help predict rejection episodes. The diagnostic value of 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinuic acid (DMSA) scintigraphy, ultrasotlography and renal fimctional parameters (urine Naeetyl-B-D-glueosaminidase (NAG)/creatinine and urine albumin/ creatinine quotients) were studied in 39 children (11 boys, 28 girls; median age 9 mths, range 2 wks-9.4 yrs; <lyr: 28 patients; >lyr: 11 patients) with first-time acute pyelonephritis. The inclusion criteria were: 1. Urine culture >105 bacleria/ml; 2. Fever >38.50C; 3. CRP >20 rag/l; 4. No previous history of urinary tract infection; 5. No obstruction or duplex system. Ultrasound examination of the urinary tract was performed at admission and together with DMSA scintigraphy (<10 days from admission). Urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/creatinine quotients were analyzed daily, and after recovery (6-8 weeks) . DMSA uptake defects were present in 32/39 (82%) of the patients. In 7/28 (25%) children <lyr of age the DMSA scintigraphy was normal while all 11 children >lyr had changes (p=0.05). Ultrasonography revealed abnormalities in only 11/32 patients with positive DMSA scintigraphy. Urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/creatinine quotients were significantly higher in children <lyr of age with acute pyelonephritis, as well as in nonrenal fever controls, than in older children. In the younger age group (<1 yr) the urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/creatinine quotients, however, were significantly higher together with pyelonephritis than with non-renal fever. The urine NAG and albumin excretion had normalized at the 6-8 weeks' follow-up. The size and degree of reduced DMSA uptake (DMSA score) did not correlate with duration of disease at admission, maximum CRP or fever. Neither was there any correlation with urine NAG/creatinine and albumin/creatinine quotients in children >lyr of age. However, in the group <lyr the urine NAG/creatinine quotient showed a significant correlation with the DMSA score. We conclude that DMSA scintigraphy is a sensitive method to diagnose an acute pyelonephritis. Tubular parameters may further improve the diagnostics in the infant. The study was carried out to assess the possible involvement of AVP excess and free water retention in development of late hyponatremia by comparing the postnatal course of plasma level and urinary excretion of AVP & sodium as well as ereatinine osmolar & free water clearances in premature infants with (group S) & without (group NS) NaCI supplementation. Plasma total protein and albumin concentrations were also determined. Group NS consisted of 8 infants with a birth weight of 1150-1730 g (mean 1440 g) and gestational age of 28-32 weeks (mean 30.4 weeks). Group S included 8 infants with mean birth weight of 1390 g (range: 980-1700 g) and mean gestational age of 30.1 weeks (range: 27-32 weeks). Measurements were made on the 7th day and weekly thereafter until the 5th week of /lie. NaCI supplementation was given in a dose of 3-5 & 1.5-2.5 mEq/kg/day for 8-21 & 22-35 days, respectively. In group NS plasma sodium gradually declined from 142.5_+2.9 in 4-5 weeks (p<0.025) whereas in group S it remained unchanged. Fractional sodium excretion decreased with age in both groups; it proved to be significunfly higher when NaCI supplement was given (p<0.025). Plasma AVP tended to be higher in group S but did not differ significantly from that in NS group. Urinary AVP excretion, either expressed in terms of ug/day or ng/100 ml GFR was significantly higher in group S, although the age-related increase could not be seen when correction was made for GFR. ng/day (p<0.025) in group NS. NaC1 supplementation and the increased AVP excretion has no apparent influence on GFR, it was associated with significant decrease in free water excretion, plasma total protein and plasma albumin concentrations. These data suggest that NaCI supplementation prevents late hyponatremla at the expense of AVP-mediated free water retention and subsequent volume expansion. Renal function and morphometry of the progeny of rats submitted to 5~% dietary restriction (pair-fed with control group) throughout pregnancy (Rt group), during the first half of pregnancy (RI group) or during the second half of pregnancy (R2 group) were studied S months after birth. Glomerular filtration rate (GRF) and renal plasma flow (RPF) decreased significantly in all groups when compared to control (C)(GFR, 4.44+--0.12, 4.O4+-0.18 and 4.00+-0.16 vs 6.87+--O.17 and RPF, 19.06+-0.57, 17.00+1.14 and 13.31+0.50 vs 22.57+0.67 ~respeetively). Net acid excretion calculated per ml of GFR was either maintained or stimulated (RI group). A significant decline in the nt~nber of glomeFuli occurred in RI, R2 and Rt rats ( Hyperlipemia, a feature of nephrotic syndrome, may directly contribute to chronic renal injury. The present study investigated the ability of the lipid-lowering drugs probucol and lovastatin to modify the course of the acute tubulointerstitial disease in rats with nephrotic syndrome induced by purine aminonueleoside (PAN) We have previously shown that this model is associated with an interstitial influx of monocytes and an increase in renal steady state mRNA levels for transforming growth factor 81 '(TGFs several extracellular matrix genes (ECM), and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) [J Am Soc NephroI 1:550, I990] . Focal interstitial accumulation of ECM proteins occurs at 2-3 weeks. Three groups were studied: A--PAN alone; B--PAN+probucol; C--PAN+lovastatin. Animals were killed on day 9. Albuminuria on days 5 and 8 was similar in all groups. Compared to group A, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were decreased in group C but not B. The number of interstitial macrophages (ED-1 +, Mar-1 +, Ia +) was similar in the three groups. Both lipid-lowering'drugs decreased renal mRNA levels for collagen I (38% and 34% of relative densitometric units corrected for RNA loading for groups B and C compared to group A respectively), collagen III (60% and 32%), fibronectin (16% and 9%), stromelysin (69% and 11%), and TIMP (61% and 47%). In addition, mRNA levels for TGF~ were reduced (47% and 29%). Kidney mRNA levels for glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD), a constitutively-expressed gene, were similar in the three groups. These results suggest that lipidlowering drugs may decrease the renal accumulation of ECM by downregulating transcription of ECM and TIMP genes. Although the mechanism is unclear, this effect occurs despite persistent interstitial infiltration by monocytes and is not dependent on a significant reduction in plasma total cholesterol levels. We speculate that the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and the subsequent inhibition of TGF~ production play a central role. Recent evidence suggests that insulin resistance and hypertension may be pathogenetically related.",

There was a consistent increase in C3 production and secretion without any change in C2 or factor B biosynthesis. This'increase appeared after a 24 hour incubation period of the macrophages in the presence of IgA immune complexes. IgA immune complexes also induced a concomitant increase in TNF production (310 q: 24u/ml/5x105 cells vs. 12 :t: 8u/ml/5xl05 cells in the control). The presence of prednisolone (2xl0\"5M) or dexamethasone (lxl0\"7M) inhibited the IgA immune complex induced TNF production, but had no effect on C3 increased synthesis, suggesting that the effect of IgA immune complexes on complement, was not mediated by endogenous TNF production. These findings may be relevant to the local inflarmnatory response in IgA nephropathy. Maintenance of brain cell size during osmolal stress is a vital biological function and accumulation of electrolytes and compatible organic osmolytes within the cerebral cytosol is essential for this adaptation. We conducted the following studies to determine the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the cerebral cell volume regulation to hypernatremia (H) in developing rats. Male rats were studied at ages 12, 18 and 20 days. Adult animals were also examined. H was produced for 48 h by daily injections of i N NaCI, l-2ml/100 g BW/dose, designed to achieve a serum Na + concentration~ 175 mmol/L. Sham injected littermate animals were used as normonatremic controls. At the end of the study, the brain was excised. One half was dried at 70 ~ to determine water content and then dissolved in 5 N HNO 3 for electrolyte analysis. The other half was homogenized in 6% perchloric acid for HPLC determination of taurine, glutamine, inositol and creatinine content. Brain ~;ater declined steadily during development from 85% to 79.8%. This change correlated with a fall in cerebral taurine and total electrolyte content as the rats matured. In the face of equivalent levels of H, the percent loss of brain water was comparable at all ages studied. The increment in brain electrolyte and total organic osmolyte content, expressed as a percent above basal levels, was similar in the four groups studied. We conclude that immature rats have a fully developed capacity to regulate cerebral cell volume during H and de not lack any of the transport processes required for full expression of this adaptation. The brain of the developing rat acts as if it is designed to protect a higher \"set point\" for brain cell size. If cell volume regulation is a truly primitive system, this would be another example of ontogeny following phylogeny. (NDI) is an xlinked inherited disorder characterized by renal resistance to the action of the antidiuretlc hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). A Siblrian husky dog family is described that phenotypieally resembles human NDI. Three male dogs from a litter of Husky dogs presented with severe polyuria, polydipsia and low urine osmolallty. Hypertonic saline infusion raised plasma osmolality and plasma AVP indicating normal osmotic AVP release. A dehydration test and exogenous application of pharmacological doses of AVP and the long lasting AVP analogue desmopressln (DDAVP) demonstrated a deficient renal antldiuretic hormone response. Kidney membranes prepared from NDI-affeeted male huskies were examined for vasopressin binding and response. Compared to membranes from unaffected canines, those from the kidney inner medulla of NDi-dogs possessed normal V2-reeeptor numbers but a 10-fold lower affinity for [Arg8] vasopressin. Adenylate cyelase stimulation by AVP in contrast to that by forskolin or GTP-analoguee was similarly reduced in a dose responsive manner. The NDI-dogs showed physiological responses to very high doses of V2-specifle agonists, consistent with V2-receptors of a lower affinity. Prolonged treatment with V2-agonists, 1 -deamino [D-ArgS] VP (DDAVP) and 1-deamino [Val4, Sar7] AVP (dVSAVP), rendered the NDI-dogs near normal in terms of water intake and urine osmolality. Thus alteration of the vasopressin V2-receptor in the kidney appears to be the molecular basis of NDI in husky dogs. With very high potent V2-analogues, treatment appears to be possible. Infection with verocytotoxin (VT) producing E.coli is the main cause of the epidemic form of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. The endothelial cell, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the hemolytic uremic syndrome, is believed to be a putative target for VT. In vitro studies have demonstrated that endothelial cells become more sensitive to VT when inflammatory mediators are present. The inflammatory mediators TNFu and IL-1 are produced by monocytes and mesangial cells and may play a local role in the kidney.",

Furthermore, interleukin-1 (IL-1), lymphotoxin and lipopolysaccharide also markedly increase VT-1 binding. An exposure of only 6 hours to TNFo was already enough to enhance the number of VT-1 binding sites on the endothelial cells for at least 2 days. In order to demonstrate that the increase in VT binding was due to an increase in the functional VT receptor, glycolipid extracts of TNFmtreated cells were analysed by thin layer chromotography. An increase of globotriaosylceramide (GbOse3cer) was observed, suggesting that preincubation of human endothelial cells with TNFo leads to increase in GbOse3cer synthesis in these cells.",

Several renal tubular dysfunctions have been described in IDDM which are thought to be characteristic findings for the renal manifestation of the disease. In order to evaluate disturbances of renal potassium handling during the course of IDDM, serial measurements of urinary characteristics of potassium and sodium handling as well as those of plasma concentrations of aldosterone (Aldo), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary excretions of catecholamines were carried out in three groups of diabetic children (Group h newly diagnosed patients < 6 month, n = 8; Group Ih patients having diabetes > 5 years; n = 1 8; Group Ill: diabetic children in ketoacidosis (DKA) n = 9). Data were expressed as mean + SE and compared to those of healthy controls (C) (n = 12). Tra-~stubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was significantly low in each group of diabetics (Group I: 3. It is concluded that TI-KG is also a valuable method for the evaluation of mineralocorticoid action in distal and collecting tubules in pathological condition . Renal potassium handling and aldosterone bioactivity is impared in diabetes mellitus. The low TTKG is a characteristic feature of the renal involvement of diabetes which already persists from the very early course of the disease. Low aldosterone bioactivity may be an early manifestation of tubular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Deflazacort (DFZ) is an oxazolone derivative of prednisone, reported to have similar immtmosuppressive effectiveness but less undesirable effects upon electrolyte, mineral and lipid metabolism. In 1990 we started a program of switching our patients (P) with a functioning kidney graft who had not had acute rejections (AR) for at least 6 months (m), from methyl-predvi~one (MP) to DFZ. We report the evaluation of graft function (GF), new rejection episodes, statural growth and blood pressure (BP) control in 22 children from 5 to 18 years old, x 11.4. Comparison was made for each P and for the group between the period on MP and DFZ with a minimum follow-up of 6 m for each medication. Follow-up on DFZ ranged from 6 to 18 m. There were no changes in serum ereatinlne levels (MP 1.15 ___ 0.4 mg/di vs. DFZ 1.17-+0.45 mg/di, x -+ DS p=NS). Only 1 P presented 1 steroid respondent episode of AR 4 m after switching, compared to 3 episodes on 2P, while on MP. 8 children increased growth velocity in at least 1 eentile, 4 showed no changes and 3 decreased at least 1 eenfile. Mean SDS for stature increased + 0.55, due to an increase in 7 P of at least 1 SDS. BP control was evaluated by registering the need for medication at the end of each period. Children on no medication increased from 40% to 80% (P<0.05), while those requiring more than one hypotensive drug decreased from 27% to 0% (p<0.05). There were no significant changes in Cyelosporin A dosage between the 2 periods. There was an obvious decrease in \"cushingoid\" features in all P (Pictures will be shown). We conclude that: 1-Statural growth, although subject to the influence of several variables, showed a tendency to improve with DFZ, 2-The need for antihyper tensive medication diminighed significantly, and some children could stop taking them. 3-Alongside these apparent benefits, we could not detect any increased risks of rejection crisis nor any deterioration in GF. A longer follow-up is necessary to see if they persist with prolonged use of the drug. Acute saline volume expansion (VE) in the developing animal is associated with a blunted natriuresis when compared to the adult natriuresis. Our previous studies suggested that an attenuated RIHP response in the developing piglet (P) may participate in the blunted natriuresis of VE. The effect of acute saline loading (5%/bw) on RIHP and sodium excretion was examined in adult pigs (A), >70 days and developing piglets (P), 30 days. In response to VE, P excreted significantly less Sodium than A, AUNaV: 1.7 4-0.5 vs 3.8 -t-0.7 /zEq/min/gkw.",

Associated with the blunted natriuretic response in P was an attenuated increase in RIHP, 6.1 + 1.1 to 6.1 + 1.6 mmHg in response to VE. In contrast A increased RIHP from 8.8 + t.3 to 12.3 + 1.5 mmHg during VE. When RIHP was prevented from increasing during VE in A, the natriuretic response was significantly attenuated, AxUNaV: 0.93 +_ 0.12 /zEq/min/gkw. To further quantitate RIHP mediation of the blunted natriuresis in P, intrarenal (IR) infusion of the vasodilator acetylcholine (ACH) was used to increase RIHP in P during VE. IR ACH infusion during VE in P corrected the RIHP response from 6.9 + 1.1 to 12.9 + 2.0 mmHg, and restored the P natriuretic response, AUNaV: 4.5 + 1.0 #Eg/min/gkw to A capability. In summary: 1. The developing piglet (P) exhibits a blunted natriuresis of VE when compared to the adult pig (A). 2. Associated with the blunted natriuresis in P is an attenuated RIHP response to VE. 3. Correction of the attenuated RIHP increase in P by IR ACH during VE restores the natriuretic response of P to adult capability. Conclusions: The attenuated RIHP increase during VE mediates, in part, the diminished natriuresis of VE in P. To investigate the impact of pre-Tx patient status, allograft condition and postoperative management during the first three months on eady and late transplant function, we evaluated 44 successful renal Tx performed in our unit between 1984 and 1991. The long-term immunosuppressive regimen usually consisted of triple therapy. Early graft function was defined by the duration of dialysis treatment required post-Tx. Later function was determined by a single-injection inulin clearance obtained 3.2 _+ 2.2 years post-Tx. A total of 27 clinical, immunological and pharmacological variables were evaluated, and correlated with early and late graft function by stepwise multiple regression analysis. The main independent predictors of poor eady renal function were the percentage of antibodies against a selected cell panel before Tx (p < 0.0001) and the cold ischemia time of the graft (p < 0.02). In addition, pre-Tx treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) was associated with prolonged post-Tx dialysis (p < 0.10), and the pre-Tx hematocrit was positively correlated with the duration of post-Tx anuria (p < 0.05). The best single predictor of late function was the time since \"Ix (p < 0.0005), a long \"Ix period being associated with poor GFR. Independent of the time since Tx, the integrated average cyclosporin A dosage during the first three post-Tx months contributed positively (p < 0.05) and the mean blood pressure negatively (p < 0.12) to the prediction model. Pre-Tx treatment with recombinant growth hormone (GH) had a slight positive impact on GFR (p < 0.13). In contrast, the duration of post-Tx anuria or dialysis, the number of rejection crises or treatment with Ca-channel blockers had no significant effect on later GFR. Finally, we identified treatment with ACE inhibitors and blood pressure at the time of the clearance study as negative and Ca-channel blocker treatment and cyclosporin A dosage as positive predictors of GFR (all p < 0.05). We conclude that the existence of cytotoxic antibodies and ischemia time are the main predictors of early graft function. Pre-Tx EPO treatment may aggravate initial graft dysfunction by increasing blood viscosity. Late graft function is mainly determined by the time since \"Ix, adequate cyclosporin A dosage and good blood pressure control appear essential for long-term graft function. Pre-Tx GH treatment has no deleterious effect on late graft function. After uNx in childhood the remaining kidney has to function during a complete lifetime. Rat studies indicate that it may take 50% of the lifetime before changes in GFR occur. Human studies usually report a shorter follow-up. We have investigated cases of uNx below 16y of age and current age over 18y. Longest follow-up was 52y. Plasma inulin clearance (GFR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and albumin excretion (U~V) were measured. In iii cases, with no recorded damage of the remaining kidney, GFR (mean\u2022 was 86\u2022 ml/min.l.73m 2, i.e. about 70% of normal two-kidney level. Multiple regression analysis showed collinearity between current age and time post-uNx. Gender and age at uNx had no significant correlation with current GFR. Under 30y of age (n=60) mean GFR was stable (90\u2022 ml/min.l.73m2). In men over 30y (n=22) linear regression analysis indicated a fall in GFR and a rise in MAP and Ua~bV. In women no significant correlations were found. A second group consisted of 34 cases with recorded abnormalities of the remaining kidney. Compared to the group with an intact kidney remaining, a higher incidence of albuminuria and renal insufficiency was observed.",

The fall in GFR and the rise in MAP and UalbV in males over 30y, appears faster than reported for maleswith two kidneys. When an abnormal kidney remains there is an increased risk to develop albuminuria and renal insufficiency. The clinical outcome of VUR treated conservatively in infants and young children has hot been reported from any long-term prospective study. We enrolled 113 normotensive subjects (92F,21M) 1 mo-5 years old (62% <2 years) with grade I-I/I/V primary VUR in at least 1 ureter and without renal scarfing or dysfunctional micturition for a 5 year follow-up study. VUR was unilateral in 65 (58%;27R,38L) and bilateral in 48(42%). Of the 226 renal units, VUR was grade IV ih 4, III in 51, II in 81 I in 25 and 0 in 65. Treatment included antibiotic prophylaxis and surveillence for bacteriuria, annual VCUG until VUR resolved (no VURx2years), IVP at 1,3,5 years to assess renal growth (planimetric surface area) and scarring, and annual screening for renal injury and hypertension. To date, 64 patients have completed 5 year follow-up evaluations. Breakthrough UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria, all treated promptly, occurred in 21(34%) patients. Of 38 ureters with no VUR at diagnosis, 10(26%) were noted to have grade I-II VUR subsequently which persisted in 3 ureters at 5 years. Of the 88 ureters with VUR at diagnosis, 49% resolved and 11% were either unchanged or worse at 5 years. VUR resolved more often when VUR was grade I(82%) than grade 11(73%) or [I1(45%); no age-related difference was observed. Resolution was better also when VUR was unilateral left (72%) than unilateral right(46%) or bilateral(58%). GFR remained normal in all patients. Blood pressure was elevated in only 1 patient. Renal growth was impaired (>-2SD) in 20 kidneys of which 9 were scarred but unrelated to the grade of VUR. Scars were identified in 11 kidneys of which 5 had breakthrough infection, 4 after scarfing was noted. Cortical thinning (>-2.5SD) without calyceal deformity was seen in 6 other kidneys. The incidence of scarring in grade I VUR was 9%, II was 11% and HI was 27%. We conclude that renal injury is more likely with dilating VUR but can be associated even with mild VUR in infants and young children treated medically. GH induced carbohydrate intolerance has not been a problem in management of GH deficient children (GHD), these children have low insulin levels to begin with. Chronic GH hypersecretion as occurs in acromegalic adults is frequently associated with hyperinsulinemia and carbohydrate intolerance. Likewise non GHD subjects such as children on RRT (CRRT) treated with superphysiological doses for years may be exposed to the same risk. Mean final height of patients with nephropathic cystinosis is below 140 cm in females and below 145 cm in males. Cysteamine treatment is not able to induce catch-up growth if height has fallen below -2 SD. To improve growth in patients with a height below -2 SD, a multicenter study for treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) (I IU/kg/week) was started. 74 patients are recorded, 19 will finish the first treatment year in 1992, 6 have already finished the first year and 3 the second year.",

Chloroquine is an antimalarial and antirheumatic lysosomotropic drug which inhibits taurine uptake into and increases efflux from cultured human lymphoblastoid ceils (Tallan, Fed Proc 43:1779 ,1984 . It inhibits taurine uptake by rat lung slices (Lewis, Biochem Phaxmacol 39 (3): 431, 1990 ) and affects the uptake and release of cystlne from cystinotic fibroblasts (States, Metabolism 32 (3): 272, 1983) . Speculations on its mode of action include a proton gradient effect, a non-specific alteration in membrane integrity, and membrane stabilization. In this study, the effect of ehloroquine on the uptake of several amino acids by rat renal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) was examined. BBMV were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats by a method of magnesium precipitation and centrifugation, and incubated in the presence 100mM NaC1, radiolabelled amino acid, and varying concentrations of chloroquine. The effect of chloroquine on taurine efflux and binding was also examined. Chloroquine significantly inhibited the active, NaCl-dependent component of 10 IxM taurine uptake at all concentrations tested (100, 250, 500, 750 1000 g_M), but did not change equilibrium values. Analysis of these data indicate that the inhibition was competitive. It did not affect tattrine efflux or non-specific binding to lysed membranes, nor did it affect the NaCl-independent diffusional component of taurine transport. Chloroquine (1 raM) inhibited the initial rate uptake of the imino acids L-proline and glycine, and the dibasic amino acid L-lysine. It inhibited the uptake of D-glucose, but not the neutral a-amino acids Lalanine or L-methionine. Uptake of the decarboxylic amino acids, Lglutamic acid and L-aspartic acid, was significantly enhanced. With regard to amino acid uptake by BBMV, these finding do not support the currently proposed mechanisms of the action of chloroquine and further studies are indicated to determine why it affects the initial rate of active amino acid transport and serves as a probe of amino acid transport. Thirty-nine concurrent inulin clearance (Cin) and creatinine clearance (Ccr) studies were conducted on 31 pediatric patients in whom Cin ranged from 2.8 to 135.8 ml/min/l.73 m 2. Although there was good correlation between Ccr and Cin (r = .96), the Ccr consistently over estimated Cin and the 95% confidence interval for prediction of Cin from Ccr was large. The ratio of the Ccr/Cin was 1.36 + .22 for the entire group and 1.50 + .25 for the 17 studies with Cin <40 ml/min/l.73 m2.",

The pToportionality constants, k, for estimation of GFR from Pcr and L were calculated from our data with both Ciu and Ccr for GFR using the equation: k = GFR.Pcr/L ( The data from a 20 year old girl with refTux nephropathy was omitted from this analysis as an outlier (kin = .55, kcr = 1.00). Since Cin is the accepted standard for GFR, the proportionality factor used for calculation of GFR from Pcr and L should be derived using Cin in the equation k = GFR.Pcr/L, not Ccr.

Nineteen neonates, mean gestational age 31.1 + 2.8 wks and mean birthweight 1481 :f_.454 gm, were studied before and after a 20-minute loading infusion of 6 mg/Kg aminophylline (Am), at mean age of 4.5 +4.0 days, continued 12 hrs later by maintenance doses of 2 mg/Kg every 12 hrs. Consecutive serum and urine samples were collected before and immediately after the loading dose, 24 hrs after, and 5 days after while on maintenance dose. Water and electrolyte balance and renal function were studied, and are presented in the There was a marked effect immediately following Am load with maximum effect at 2-4 hrs. Most of the effects were no longer evident after 24 hrs despite continuing Am maintenance and there was no change in GFR or serum NA and K throughout the study. Thus in premature infants, Am loading dose, but not the maintenance dose, has an effect on tubular reabsoIption causing diuresis, natriuresis, kaluresis, calciuresis and uricosuria. Although estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR} is the most commonly used parameter of kidney function, obtaining an accurate measure of GFR is difficult and often frustrating. The inaccuracy in estimation of GFR using standard clearance procedures is commonly due to the difficulty in obtaining accurately timed, complete urine collections.",

We have carried out 40 studies on 32 cooperative subjects during which data for R-Cin (using voided urine collections) and lNF-Cinwere obtained (Table) . Measurement of inulin clearance suffers from the need of a constant intravenous infusion, In the present study, we used a non radioisotopic contrast agent, amidotrizoate meglumine 65 %, to measure GFR after a single subcutaneou s injection. Inulin and creatinine clearances were measured simultaneously. Sixty two measurements were performed in 50 patients (29 boys, 21 girls, mean age 11.6 yrs, 3.5 to 19.4), of whom 21 were diabetic, 18 had chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and 11 had a kidney graft. The dose of meglumine was 650 mg/1.73 m 2. Initial dose of inulin was 50 mg/kg , followed by a constant rate infusion calculated to maintain the plasma concentration at 20 -30 mg/dl. After a 60 min equilibration period, blood and urine samples were collected at the beginning and end of 4 periods of 30 min. Creatinine was measured by Jaffe kinetic method, inuline by a colorlmetric method and meglumine by HPLC. Our results indicate that meglumine clearance allows a more accurate approach of GFR than creatinine clearance. However it cannot stand for inulin as a \"true marker\" of GFR. In clinical practice, variation in newborn renal function in response to a given insult may be in part due to different magnitude of production of endogenous substances (e.g., endothelin, renin). The effect of endothelin on renal function during development is not well known. We correlated RBF (ml/min) blood pressure (MBP, mmHg) and other renal function changes with serum ET-I level in 20 7-10d piglets.",

We sugNest, based on this pharmacokinetic study, that the dosaRe of CAZ tn preterm Inlants in the first days of ]ire may be adjusted to 25 mg/kg once daily. In a large scale study on Ceftazidime pharmaeokineties glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured on day 3 and day 10 after birth in preterm neonates. 24 patients were antenatally exposed to DEXA with a mean doae of 24 mg. DEXA is known to stimulate pulmonary development. The effect of antenatal DEXA on the renal function is unknown. We compared the GFR of DEXA exposed children with the GFR in 94 children without intrauterine therapy and with the GFR in 47 children with intrauterine exposure to Indomethaein (INDO, mean dose 200 mg). GFR was measured using the continuous inulin infusion technique by enzymatic method. Influence of gestational age, antenatal exposure to INDO and DEXA was calculated by multiple regression analysis. p < 0.001 9 exposed versus not exposed On day 3 a significant increase in GFR was present (table 1) in the DEXA group compared to the 2 control groups. On day 10 differences could not be detected anymore. The high level of GFR in the DEXA group on day 3 after birth may be related to a direct vasodilating effect on the kidney or to enhancement of renal tubular sodium reabsorption. In low birth-weight (LBW) infants, creatinine clearance has been claimed to underestimate g!omemlar filtration rate (GFR). In order to better define the handling of creatinine by the immature kidney, clearance studies v~ere performed in newborn rabbits, an animal model whose nephrogenesis corresponds to that of premature infants. Results observed in newborn animals were compared to those obtained in adult rabbits. The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital, mechanically-ventilated and infused with inulin (adult rabbits) or inulin and creatinine (newborn rabbits).

Inulin being exclusively eliminated by glomerular filtration, the clearance of creatinine indicates a 23.6+2.7% fractional secretion rate of creatinine. Group2: Newborn rabbits (n=9) were infused with exogenous creatinine so as to obtain plasma creatinine concentrations in the same range as those observed in adult rabbits (74_+2 gmol/1). In these animals, creatinine clearance (1.13\u2022 significantly (p<0.01) underestimated the corresponding inulin clearance (1.34-+0.14), indicating a 12.6_+3.7% fractional reabsorption rate of creatinine. Group 3: In order to increase the creatinine filtered load and consequently decrease the relative contribution of creatinine reabsorption to its final clearance, newborn rabbits (n=l 1) were infused With exogenous creatinine so as to obtain plasma creatinine concentxations of 155\u2022 gmolB. In these animals, mean creatinine clearance (1.33_+0.56) did not differ significantly from inulin clearance (1.39~0.53).

In the immature animal, creatinine is significantly reabsorbed, resulting in creatinine clearance values that underestimate true GFR.

We conclude that the age of the paediatric patient should be taken into account when evaluating tubular and glomeruler proteinurie, particularly in the younger age group. To evaluate the ability of stress response, plasma and urinary catecholamine concentrations, urinary electrolytes and acid-base status were measured in IDDM children (Group h newly diagnosed 2-4 weeks, n=7; Group Ih duration 5-7 yr, n =9; Group IIh duration 10-13 yr, n = 12). The data were compared to healthy controls, n = 7, (X -+SD). Physical stress was induced by 2 W/kg/10 rain bycicle ergometer. IDDM children exhibited metabolic acidosis under stress (pH: Group I = 7.24+0.08; Group II = 7.25_+0.05; Group III = 7.19__+0.03 vs C = 7.36 +0.02). Stress induced an increase in the concentration of plasma norepinephrine (PNE) in each group, the most pronounced elevation was seen in Group I (19.36 __+8.8 nmol/I vs C = 8.3 +3.2, p<.02). Baseline PNE level showed a significant decrease with the duration of IDDM. Excretion of urinary NE (U,E) also increased under stress, however, the highest levels were measured in Group III (580 +__209 pmol/min/I.73m 2 vs 290 __+124 in Group I, p < .01 ). Baseline urinary doparnine (Up^) excretions were similar in each group. Stress caused an elevation in UDA only in C (2.05 +__1.8 vs 4.59 __+2.9 pmol/min/I.73m2). The ratio of baseline UNE/UDA was similar in Groups I, II and C, but higher in Group III. Stress induced a shift towards NE excretion only in diabetic children which was most pronounced in children having IDDM more than 10 years. Stress did not affect urine output in Groups I. and I1., but a decrease was observed in Group III (1.1 +__0.3 vs 0.7 _+0.3 ml/min/1.73m 2, p<.007). Urinary sodium excretion also decreased in Group III after physical loading (130 +47 vs 66 -+33 umol/min/1.73m2). Our data show, that physical stress induces a severe lactic acidosis in IDDM.in spite of the decreased systemic sympathetic activity, the renal catecholarnine response showed a shift towards vasoconstriction, sodium and fluid retention under physical stress in IDDM. These changes correlate with the duration of the underlying disease. Study design. Plasma and urinary electrolytes were determined after an overnight fast in 13 patients with Citelman's syndrome (age 10-20 years), 21 family members of patients (7 siblings~age 10-23 years;14 parents, age 30-52 years) and 13 healthy controls (aged 16-20 years). As urinary calcium excretion may be appreciably affected by sodium, it was also corrected for the sodium factor and expressed both as calcium to ereatinine ratio and as molar calcium to sodium ratio. Conclusions. The urinary calcium to creatinine ratio was reduced 0ot 0nly in patieets with Citelman's syndromebut also in a group of siblings and parents with normal plasma biochemical variables. Urinary calcium excretion discriminated patients and family members from controls more clearly after a slmpie correction for sodium excretion (urinary calcium to sodium ratio). The features of Bartter syndrome in the neonate include not only hypokalaemia, alkalosis and hyperreninaemia, but also severe polyuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis and growth retardation.",

            "text": "We recently evaluated two brothers with polyuria and polydipsia. Both of them were known to have this syndrome since the age of 3 years. The older brother. 23 y., underwent full evaluation following recovery from acute dehydration with severe hypernatremia. The diagnosis of nephrogenie diabetes insipidus was proved by lack of increase in urine osmolality above ll2mos/kg H20 in response to 14h. water deprivation and both nasal and intravenous l-dessraino (8-Darginine) vaso-pressin (d DVAP) stimulation tests. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion reached 12.7 Pg/ml after 14h. water deprivation while plasma osmolality was 328 mos/kg H20 which was referred as a maximal response. We ruled out nephrotoxic agents as a possible contribution to this abnormality. The younger brother, 4 y., was taught by his older one \"to drink a lot\". Stimulation tests revealed a \"partial\" response: an. elevation of urine osmolality from basal value of 56 mos/kg H 0 to 232 mos/kg H~0 after water deprivation and to 4~4 mos/kg H20 90 min. after nasal d DVAP adminb3tration. ADH secretion was maximal (11.8 Pg/m while plae:,a osmolality was 306 mos/kg H20 after 7h. of water deprivation. The younger brother was diagnosed, therefore, as a compulsive water drinker. The older brother began a treatment by Kaluril (Hydrochlorothiazide 50m 5 and Amiloride 5 mg) and Indomethaein 75mg, daily. After a period] of 2 months, the diuresis decreased from 9,000-10,000 ml/day to 3,000-4,000 ml/day and, his desire to drink regressed. The younger brother began a training for gradual change in his water drinking habits. In a period of 2 months, both polydipsia and polyuria were significantly decreased. We described one patient with a congenital tubular defect and his brother with a habitual non-familial, not genetically associated disturbance, both presented with polyuria polydipsia syndrome. CsA has a beneficial immunosuppressive effect on the expression of autoimmune interstitial nephritis, but also displays the potential to cause irreversibile interstitial damage by stimulating fibrogenesis. We aimed to explore the possibility that CsA may also exert beneficial \"immunosuppressive\" effects on tubular epithelial ceils, by altering transcription of genes important for T cell-epithelial cell interactions. We used the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with 32PdCTP to quantitate ICAM-1 expression in proximal tubular epithelial ceils (MCT) exposed to CsA. GAPDH, a housekeeping enzyme, was used to standardize the quantification. We found that ICAM-1 expression in MCT cells, pre-treated with TNFa, is 50% inhibited with 1-5 ug/ml CsA compared to cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) alone. This was confirmed by a northern blot analysis and correlated with inhibition of cell surface ICAM-1 expression determined by immunofluorescence studies. We next examined the effect of CsA on M52.28, a CD8 + cytotoxic and DTH-reactive T cell clone specific for 3M-1 antigen expressed by MCT cells. We found that coincubation of M52.28 with CsA (10-100 ng/ml) had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on LFA-I. FACS analysis was confirmatory of the results. Similar effects were seen in TNFct, ?IFN, IL-2, and IL-6 transcripts but no change in ICAM-1 expression. Since TNFot and ?IFN upregulate ICAM-1 expression on MCT cells, our studies provide evidence that CsA may in part be immunosuppressive through both direct and indirect modulation of LFA-1 (T cells) and ICAM-1 (MCT) expression. Endothelin (Et) is produced in vitro by normal kidney cells.,Recently, it has been described as autocrine and paracrine growth factor for epithelial cancer cell lines. In the present study we evaluate the Et production of nephroblastsma cells in culture. A cell line was obtained from pediatric Wilms' tumor. The cells were grown and established in TC 199 culture medium, and then characterized by phase contrast microscopy, electron microscopy and immunocytochemestry. Et level was measured in triplicated on surnatants collected at I, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 , 72 hours after the start of the culture, using a radioimmunoassay for human Etx and Et~. The cells, under Ig FCS condition, released Et as function of the time, reaching a plateau of 25 pmol/L \u2022215 ~ ceils after 24 hours. Insulin added to the culture medium at the concentration of 5 ~g/ml does not significantly modify the Et production, but induced several changes of cytsscheletric pattern of these cells. A lack of desmin staining and an increase of cytokeratin and laminin positivity were revealed. After addition of 10 \"~ M synthetic Etx to the culture medium, we bbserved a progressive reduction of cytokeratln and laminin positive cells, with unchanged staining for fibronectin, desmin and vimentin. Myosin and actin were always negative. The effects of Insulin and Et on this cell line will be discussed. Glomerular fibrin deposits may be the result of a dysfunctional plasminogen activating system. Since neutrophil elastase is a major proteolytic and bieregulatory protein, we examined its effect on the mesangial plasminogen activating system. Rat mesangial cell monolayers were incubated with 0 to 27.5nM of enzymatically active elastase or elastase inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DIP-elastase), with or without fucoidan (binds to elastase receptor) or cycloheximide (blocker of protein synthesis). The plasminogen activating activity (PAA) was determined in cell extracts and in serum free conditioned medium.",

Our results demonstrate that enzymatically active and inactive forms of neutrophil elastase modulate the mesangial plasminogen activating system and cause an increase in the net PAA. These findings suggest that the release of elastase by neutrophils in the glomeruli may enhance the lysis of glomerular fibrin deposits. Endothelial cells exposed to cytokines express adhesion molecules that promote attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cell surfaces in areas of inflammation. To defne the potential role of intracellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules (ELAM) in the development of the inflammatory response in the glomerulus in man, we studied their expression in normal and activated human glomerular endothelial cells (GCEC) and mesangia] cells (MC). GCEC and MC were isolated from normal human glomeruli and propagated separately in serum replete media. GCEC MC and human umbilical vein endothelial ceils (HUVE) were exposed to TNF (3.5 or 50 ng/ml) or IL-1 (1 or 30 U/ml) for 4 hrs. Cells were than stained for ICAM, ELAM, MHC class 1 or MHC class 2 by immunoperoxidase. The number of positive cells and intensity of staining was also assessed by FACS. Cell size of proximal kidney tubules is kept relatively constant by the dynamic action of the Na pump. When the pump is blocked by 1 mM ouabain, cells accumulate moderate numbers of cytoplasmic vesicles, but maintain an intact cytoskeleton and swell only 60% above control. By contrast, ceils accumulate many more vesicles and swell -90% if the microtubule inhibitor vincristine, 5 I-tM + the microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin B, 50 ~tM are used in conjunction with ouabain. Moreover, by transmission electronmicroscopy, the distribution of cytoplasmic vesicles is altered by the cytoskeletal disrupting agents -the vesicles accumulate in the apical half of cells and fail to approach the basolateral membrane. In this study we determined the effect of a high bath [K] on cell swelling, cytoskeletal integrity and cytoplasmic vesiculation. Single, nonperfused rabbit PST were dissected, crimped tightly between 2 pipets in isotonic medium (37~ pH 7.4) and their volume assessed optically with an image splitting eyepiece. PST volume increased massively (by 94% -as much as when ouabain + cytoskeletal inhibitors were used) within 30 rain incubation in a 150 mM [K] bath (n,16). To assess microtubule integrity under these conditions, isolated PST were incubated in an isotonic 150 mM [K] Ringer bath, fixed in methanol/acetone, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained using anti-p tubulin antibody and FITC-labeled anti-IgG antibody. Control mierotubules appeared as a fine, diffuse cytoplasmic meshwork of fibers, but in'150 mM [K] tubulin appeared collapsed in swirls around the nucleus with loss of the fine reticular pattern. F-actin distribution, assessed by rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence, appeared concentrated at the apical membrane in control PST with a thin fluorescent band seen along the basal membrane. The high [K] bath caused a more diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Scanning electronmicroscopy revealed vesiclelike structures in moderate numbers after ouabain, but in large numbers after high [K] . We conclude that PST cell swelling in ouabain is limited primarily by the cytoskeleton, and that high [K] allows massive swelling by redistributing cytoskeletal proteins. The sites and extent of glomerular IC deposition and the host immune response required to generate glomerular injury in man is not known. Because of the unique nature of the immune system in primates, a model of primate GN in cynomolgus monkey (CYN) was used to study this process over time. CYN (n=19) received daily IV bovine gamma globulin (BGG) for 8 to 12 wk after sensitization with BGG. Antibody (AB) responses, renal function and the extent of glomerular immune deposits were defined during the induction of acute GN. Each animal had 3 to 5 renal biopsies performed during GN. Results: All CYN developed glomerular deposits by 4 wk. Proteinuria developed by 4 to 8 wk. Severe GN, characterized by decreased GFR and/or heavy proteinuria, was seen in CYN with high AB titers or with moderate AB titers and high antigen excess. Mesangial deposits were most strongly associated with total BGG/kg while GBM deposits were most strongly associated with mean BGG precipitable AB. Severity of GN and proteinuria were related to the extent of LRE (r=0.79) and LRI (r=0.71) deposits and to the total dose of BGG/kg (r= 0.73) and mean BGG precipitable AB (r=0.84). Proteinuria became heavy when GBM deposits were greater than 20 % of GBM surface. Conclusion: The extent and timing of glomerular injury during the development of GN in the primate is influenced by antigen load and magnitude of the antibody response. Proteinurla strongly correlates to the degree of localization of deposits in the GBM. The severity of glomerular injury in primates appears to be more dependent on the host antibody response than total antigen exposure. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (I)3) has been shown to suppress the lymphoproliferative response (LPR) of normal peripheral blood mononuelear cells (PBMs). Since chronic renal failure (CRF) is associated with D3 deficiency, this study aimed at evaluating the in-vitro immunomodulatory effect of D3 supplementation on PBMs of CRF patients. PBMs of 18 pre-endstage CRF patients and 8 normal healthy controls were isolated by ficoll-hypaque gradient centfifugation, and cultured in complete RPMI media. LPR to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (0.5/zg/ml) with and without D3 supplementation (10-SM) was assessed by titriated thymidine uptake after a 16-hour pulse. LPR was measured as the difference between the mean counts per minute (clam) of triplicate stimulated cultures and that of unstimulated cultures. Plasma D3 levels were measured by radioimmunoassay following extraction and purification through a column containing C180H-aetivated matrix. Our results showed that CRF patients had a significantly lower LPR to PHA than controls (p<0.05).",

However, LPR to D3 paradoxically increased in group 1I. Plasma D3 levels were normal (> 10pg/ml) in all the controls, 3/12 of group I, and 0t6 of group II patients. In conclusion, although D3 supplementation may improve the LPR in some patients with CRF, this action was probably not a direct effect on lymphocyte proliferation, but rather via a secondary regulatory mechanism. Alterations of the immune system have been described in minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) but have not been fully elucidated in other forms of proteinuria. Using fluorescent labelled monoolonal antibodies and flow oytometric analysis (FACS) we studied peripheral blood T and B lymphocyte numbers and activation markers in children with heavy proteinuria but without clinically obvious infection. I0( 6-16)* 7(5-12) 6(4-10) 7(4-12) * p less than 0.01 compared with control (t-test) CD8 numbers in MCNS and FSGS were consistently higher than in controls or children with CNS.",

The data indicate that both MCNS and FSGS are characterised by an increase in suppressor T lymphocytes (CDS), but only in MCNS was an increase in T cell activation (CD4/25) noted. Culture supernatants of concanavarin A-stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells were comparatively studied in patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome(MCNS) and in those with some glomerular diseases(GD). Endotherial cell cytosolic Ca ++ was measured using the fluorescent Ca ++ indicator, Fura-2 AM, after being cultured with mononuclear cells culture supernatants. An influx of Ca ++ into cultured endotherial cells was revealed when they were cultured with culture supernatants of peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients during the active phase of MCNS. However, no influx was noticed when they were cultured with culture supernatants of peripheral mononuclear cells obtained from patients during the non-active phase of MCNS and with GD. This suggests that in MCNS, mononuelear cell culture supernatant makes endotherial cells contract and cause vascular permeability. The effects of culture supernatants of mononuclear cells on albumin diffusion across the endotherial cell monolayer were examined. Endotherial cells were grown on the bottom of an chemotaxis chamber and leakage of Trypan Blue-Albumin complex(TBAC), which was added in the chamber to the outer well, was measured. Culture supernatants of mononuclear cells in patients during the active phase of MCNS caused TBAC to leak across the endotherial cell monolayer. Those in patients during the non-active phase of MCNS and with GD did not cause TBAC leakage. The lymphokine is suggested to cause an increase in cultured endotherial cell monolayer permeability. In MCNS, endotherial cells were suggested to play an important role in vascular permeability. We have studied the steroid receptors (SR) in lymphocytes from normal children & from those suffering from nophrotic syndromes (NS). Radiostope binding assays (1,2-3H triamcinoloue acetonide) were investigated. In 6 cases isotope binding results were compared to those detected by MAb referred as M7.",

Later, we found higher SR numbers in the lymphoeytes. 4 of 9 patients presented similar steroid binding aff'~ty during the course of their glomerular disease. Therefore we suppose that the decrease in the number of SR and the steroid resistance arc not definitive. The investigation of steroid responsiveness in certain stages of glomerular disease might be important because it may influence the therapeutic protocol using other immunosuppressive drugs. The aim of the present study was to determine the INF, I L I and LTB4 production by L in children with GN. Material and Methods: 20 children aged 3-14 with GN were included in our study. 12 patients (pts) had neuphrotic syndrome (iNS) \u2022 hematuria; 5 steroid sensitive NS (SSNS Group I) 7 steriod resistant NS (SRNS Group H) and 8 pts had isolated hematuria (Group II 0. Renal biopsy was done in 15 cases -11 pts bad mesangioproliferative GN and 4 pts membranoproliferative GN. Control Group (IY) -19 healthy children aged 3-14. Alpha -and gamma -INF production by L were determined by J. Campbell et al. (1975) . I L l production by mouocytes (M) was determined by A. Chamblin et al. (1990) . LTB4 production by peripheral blood polymorphonuclear L (PMNL) was determined by B. Samuelsson (1979) . Results: All pts with GN especially with SSNS had low level of IFN production by L, (Table) . IL-1 produetiun by M was significantly low only in eases of SRNS. LTB4 production by PMNL was increased in pts with SSNS. These data could suggest dysfunction of cellular immunity. Pts with SRNS had impaired L and M function. On the other hand, pts with SSNS bad impaired L function simultaneously with increased LTB4 production by PMNL.

Development of F:VIIIc inhibitors is a rare event in childhood. We report two such cases revealed by haemorragic symptoms. First patient was a 14 years old caucasian boy who started a corticodependant nephrosis at 8, treated for a high threshold with chlormethine, levamisole and then chlorambucil. While on remission under low steroid therapy (.7mg/kg every other day), he presented with compressive hematomas of two legs and gross hematuria. APTr was prolonged (patient: 94\"/control: 30\"), F:VIIIc activity was less than 1%, and F:VIIIc AB was at 16 U Bethesda/ml. IV Ig (.4g/kg x 5 days) did not change AB titer but coincided with bleeding resolution. F:VIIIc increased slightly under prednisone (1.5mg/kg/d). Subsequent courses of IV Ig (lg/kg x 2d) allowed partial and transient rise of F:VIIIc up to 30%. Despite azathioprine (2mg/kg/d x3 months) and 4 bolus of cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m2), no improvement was seen. After 7 months of oral cyclophosphamide (1,5 mg/kg/d), F:VII/c rose to 20% while F:VIIIc AB disappeared.Second patient was a 14 years old black boy who started a lupus nephritis at 4, treated first by prednisone alone, then by bolus of cyclophosphamide. He has had no flare for 2 years, and remained under low steroid therapy (0.25 mg/kg every other day) when he developped a spontaneous massive hematoma of the right iliac muscle with acute anemia and cmral palsy. ESR was normal, anti-DNA antibodies were low (7%). APTr was prolonged (94\"/30\"), F:VIIIc activity was at 8%, F:VIIIc AB was present at 8 U Oxford/ml. He received blood transfusion, methylprednisolone (lg/kg), IV Ig (lg/kg once) and porcine F:VIII (Hyate C| In 22 hours, bleeding stopped, APTI\" returned to normal, F:VIIIc increased up to 500% and F:Vlllc AB disappeared.APTT remained normal during 4 months, under low prednisone therapy (.2mg/kg/d), when F:VIIIc AB r.elapsed (4U/ml) with prolonged APTT (68\"/35\") without any symptom.Under IV Ig (lg/kg x 2days), API\"r and F:VIIIc returned to normal and F:VIIIc AB disappeared. These results persisted at 6 months. These cases point out the possibility of auto-immune bleeding disorders in children with LED or nephrosis. The prolonged response observed in some cases of F:VIIIc inhibitors treated with IV Ig suggest an effect on auto-antibody synthesis. We examined the levels of IL-6 in urine of 21 children with different forms of GN. Eight patients had steroid sensitive NS, 13 -steroid-resistant. Nephrocalcinosis is a known complication in preterm infants requiring intensive care. The etiology is still on debate; hypercaiciuria due to furosemide and hyperoxalaria secondary to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are incriminated. We therefore studied prospectively urinary lithogenic and inhibitory factors in 24 infants < 33 weeks of gestation: 16 had TPN, and 8 were fed breastmilk and had glucose-electrolyte infusions (controls). The majority (20) had been mechanicaily ventilated. Each infant received a similar amount of furosemide and calcium gluconate. No dexamethasone was given. Urines were collected during 24 h on day 2 (period a), day 3 and once between days 4 and 10 (period c). Urinary calcium oxalate (CaOx) saturation was calculated by computer program equil 2 according to Finlayson, based on 11 urinary constituents. Renal ultrasonography was performed every second week until discharge. Results: 1) TPN: Ox/creadnine (treat) ratio was persistently high (203 mmol/mol) but not increasing. Ca/creat ratio increased from 1.0 to 1.6 mol/mol. Citrate/creat remained constant (0.45 mol/mol).The urinary CaOx saturation index increased significantly (a:2.6, c:4.8, p <0.05). 2) Controls: Ox/creat increased sligthly from 100 to 145, but remained on a lower level. Ca/creat was considerably lower (0.4/0.3). Citrate/creat increased steadily (0.27/0.58). CaOx saturation at period c was significantly lower (p <0 01) than in TPN (a:2.3 c:1.4). Nephrocalcinosis developed in 2 of the 16 infants with TPN. Conclusion: In the TPN group the increase in urinary CaOx saturation is mainly due to elevated Ca excretion, but the persistently high Ox/creat ratio also plays an important role. TPN infants are at risk for CaOx precipitation and nephrocalcinosis. We investigated the response of urinary calcium excretion to maintained calcium diet restriction in 49 children aged 2.5 to 14.5 years with IH classified according to the results of an oral calcium load performed as previously described (J Pediatr 1987,110:238-243) .",

We have prospectively studied for 6 to 30 months, 30 children (15 male, 15 female; aged 3 to 13 years old) with previously undlagnosed isolated hematurla in which HU was found. Positive familial history of nephrollthiasls was found in 40% Idiopathic hyperealciaria (IH) (UCa >4mg/kg/day) was found in 0% of the patients at the beginning but after 6 to 24 months, 20% presented it. They were submitted to the following treatments: purlne restricted diet (13%), allopurinol (4%), potassium citrate (1%) and no treated (83%), Treated children presented normal urieosuria and hematuria resolved completely as soon as uricosuria became normal. In the non-treated group, 13% and 6%' developed urolithiasis after 6 and /2 months, respectively. We coneinde that HU, llke IH, can theoretically produce micro calculi that damage the renal tuball with consequent hematurla. Furthermore, the recognition of this association will prevent unnecessary and, in some eases, invaslve diagnostic investigations. The treatment of this group may prevent renal stone formation. We studied the long-term evolution of 36 children, 22 males, with IH. At diagnosis, children's age ranged from 2.8 to 12.7 years and the urine calcium excretion (X+SD) was 6.5+1.7 mg/kg/day (range:4.3-13.0). Main presenting manifestations were recurrent abdominal pain, macroscopic hematuria, and lower urinary tract symptoms found in 13, 13, and 8 children, respectively. Four patients had passed renal stones and/or had urolithiasis detectable by ultrasounds or X-ray films. Three children had subnormal growth. During a follow-up of 4.0+2.0 years (range:l.5-9.7), physical examination of patients and biochemical analysis were performed every three months. Image studies were repeated yearly. Suppression of diet's dairy products resulted in normalization of calciuria and remission of clinical symptoms in 27 children (75%). One child developed new stones. Growth rate of patients did not change. Reintroduction of normal diet after at least one year of normocalciuria caused recurrence of hypercalciuria in 15 children. Twelve patients remained normocalciuric in the presence of ,normal calcium intake. This report shows the evolution of children with IH and serves to emphasize that IH is transient in 30% of patients in which normalization of diet resulted in no reappearance of IH.

Urinary measurement of calcium oxalate(UOx),citrate(UCit),magnesium (UMg),uric acid(UUA) and creatinine(UCr)were made.Renal function was cosidered too.

A significant increase in plasma FC and decrease in serum TG was observed only in the L-carnitine supplemented group.

L-carnitine supplementation improves hyperlipidemia and seems to potentiate the effects of exercise in these patients. Urolithiasis is extremely rare among children. Only 2% of all cases with renal calculi present before the age of 15. Since ESWL became the primary treatment for urolithiasis, only 200 children who recieved ESWL for renal or ureteral stones have been reported in the medical literature. During the last six years we have treated 58 children with urolithiasis. There were 43 boys and 15 girls, with a mean age of 7 years (range: 15 months -15 years). 5 children had bilateral urolithiasis. Two had complete staghorn calculi, Four had stones in the upper ureter and 9 had distal ureteral stones. Two boys had large stones in the urinary bladder. Stone size ranged between 4 to 35 mm, All children were treated with ESWL alone using the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor. In all cases with stones larger than 2.0 am, a urethral stent or a stent-nephrostomy were placed prior to the initial tretment, to prevent complete ureteral obstruction. 90% of the cases needed only one session of ESWL. Complete fragmentation of the stones was accomplished in 96% of the cases. 22.5% were free of stones within 24 hours, 57.6% within i0 days 80% within one month and 91% of the children were free of the stones in 3 months. In only one case an open oystolitnotomy was performed to remove a large residual stone. No significant complications were encountered following the treatments. The mean length of hospital stay post treatment was 1.4 days. Late side effects on renal growth or function were not encountered durin~ the 6 years of follow up. Hy~oertension was not found during periodic examinations in any of the children. Idiopathic hyperealci,.u'ia (IH) is a common metabolic disturbance in childhood and has often been associated with clinical fmdi~ such as recurrent hematuria and nephrolithlasls. We prospectively studied IH in 20 children with absorptive subtype (AH) submkted to a Ca restricted diet (400-500 rag/day) or rice bran during 6 to 36 months compared to an un-treated group. Bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar spine (L2-LA) was evaluated each 6 months as well as serum Ca, P, Cr clearance, 24 hour urinary Ca and uriaary cA/rIP excretions. BMD were normal in 16 patients and decreased in 4 at time of diagnosis. Mean UCa that was elevated, decreased after the treatment. Treated ehildren presented increased BMD compared to the tin-treated or uncontrolled children. Additionally 24 and 1,25 vitamin D, PTH and Gla-protein were compared in controlled (UCa < 4 mg/kg/day) & uncontrolled urinary Ca excretion. There was no observed correlation between these parameters as shown in the At the turn of the century the majority of German internists and pediatricians were convinced that for patients with chronic renal diseases there was no better place in the world than Egypt -as long as they could afford the journey. Franz Volhard in his book on Bright's disease 1918 called Egypt with it's dry desert climate an \"eldorado\" for renal patients. This concept, strange as it sounds for modern nephrologists, had three historical roots: 1) the traditional idea about the favourable influence of heat on renal diseases, already suggested by R. Bright in 1836 and, among many others, by Eduard Henoch in 1881, 2) the close relations of many German physicians like Bilharz, Griesinger, Ehrlich or Virchow to Egypt. It was the German Reil who made Heluan a modern health resort in 1871, and at least three Germans were personal physicians to the viceroy in Kairo in the last century, 3) the publication of the Austrian physician Anton Flora in 1869 about his medical experiences in Egypt. He was the first to conclude that the low urinary output in the desert climate might suggest a reduced work load for the kidneys. Since then the idea of the kidneys \"going on holidays\" in E~ypt became very popular in Germany. Unfortunately, not all patients survived the dangerous journey, and those surviving did not always show an improvement of their health. So the \"holiday theory\" became more and more doubtful.",

Schweitzer) set sail for Egypt in 1914, carrying with them plenty of German mineral water and a mobile laboratory. They analyzed their own urine for volume, concentration, N, PO 4 and NaCI in Heluan, Assuan and Berlin and published the conclusmn that the work load for the kidney is even higher in the desert and that it seemed not too wise to send patients with renal diseases to Egypt. Nevertheless, as late as 1942 Volhard still recommended Egypt as an \"eldorado\" for renal patients, but now with the exclusion of those in renal failure. P-IB.12 Hereditary renal hypouricemia Is a rare disorder, characterized by low serum uric acid and increased renal uric acid clearance. About 24 cases have been described in the medical literature, six of them in Israel. Most cases are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on routine serum analysis. Hypercalciuria of the hyperabsorgtive type was found in a third of the cases. Only 5 cases, all adults, presented with urinary stones. Of them 3 had uric acid calculi. We present a 15 month old infant with acute renal failure, anuria and sepsis due to bilateral obstructing ureteral uric acid stones. Initial treatment included insertion of bilateral percutaneous nepbrostomies. Metabolic investigation revealed serum uric acid of 0.4-1.0 mg% (normal for his age -2-5.5 mg%), renal uric acid clearance of 41 ml/min/l.73 sq. m, [normal 7.6-8.8 ) . No other metabolic disorders were found. The diagnosis of isolated renal hypouricemia was made. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed and complete fragmentation of the stones in both ureters was accomplished. Antegrade nephrostograms showed free flow along the ureter without filling defects and the nephrostomies were then removed. Chemical analysis of stone particles collected from the urine yielded uric acid. Metabolic survey of the Child's parents and 8 siblings disclosed 2 sisters and 2 brothers who had low serum uric acid levels and high values of renal uric acid clearance. This patient is the youngest reported case of hereditary renal hypouricemia and the smallest infant who underwent ESWL of ureteral stones. Urinary calcium excretion was evaluated in 56 children ( 24 boys and 32 girls; mean-age 5,3 years) with urinary tract disorders (UTD) other than calculi: 27 with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), 18 with non glomerular hematuria, ii with abdominal pain or sterile pyuria or dysuria. First,urine calcium-creatinine concentration ratio (Uca/Ucr) was assessed in urine obtained after a mill or diary products meal to screen for hypercalciuria. In all children with Uca/Ucr> 0,20 the 24 hours urine calcium and ereatinine excretion rate was assessed. Definitive diagnosis of Hypercalciuria (H) was made if Uoa was ~4mg/Kg/day and Uca/Ucr was confirmed ~0,20. To de fine Idiopath~;c Hypercalciuria (IH), causes of secondary H in children were excluded. The subtype of IH (absorptive versus renal)was identified by assessing Uca/Uer ratio before and thereafter an oral calcium load. IH was revealed in 17 children: 4 boys and 13 girls, 13 with the absorptive type and 4 with the renal type, 9 with UTI, 3 ~ith hematuria, 3 with abdominal pain, 1 with sterile pyuria and 1 with dysuria. Our results suggest that a significant proportion (30%) of non calculi UTD is related to IH in children. Nevertheless the ma jority of UTD, in our serie, is represented by UTI and not by hematuria. IH is more frequent in girls (76%) than in boys. The absorptive subtype of IH is more frequent than renal sub-typeS. UUO results in vasoconstriction of the ipsilateral kidney, and vasodilatation of the intact opposite kidney.",

Urine prostanoid excretion in neonatal obstructive uropathy was found to be increased together with raised sodium excretion after relief of obstruction (Kfihl et al., Ped Res 27: 103, 1990 ). The present study examined possible side differences of PGE2 and TXB2 excretion and a possible interaction with vasoactive hormones following relief of unilateral pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction. Patients received adequate infusion therapy to guarantee sufficient hydration. In 8 pts aged 0.1 to 13.5 years (median 1.6 years) bladder urine and pelvic fistula urine up to 10 days after pyeloplasty was examined for PGE2 and TXB2, electrolytes, creatinlne excretion. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), renin activity and antidiuretic hormone were determined simultaneously. Median PGE2 excretion was elevated 3-fold (p<0.05) on the obstructed side in comparison to the non obstructed side. It remained high during 10 postoperative days -day 1:35.0 ng/h per 1.73 m' body surface area (range 5.9 to 157.1); day 2:44.7 (17.9 to 115.6); day 10:31.1 (2.9 to 190.4) vs 9.5 (2.1 to 20.1). 5.2 (2,6 to 32,9) ; 8.7 (5,2 to 16,3) . TXB2 was elevated only in some patients (p=N.S.). Plasma hormones did not show significant changes after operation except for a temporary rise of plasma ANP indicating a good response to hydration. No significant correlations were found between PGE2 and sodium excretion, plasma ANP and sodium excretion, and PGE2 and plasma ANP. We conclude that exclusively the obstructed kidney releases high amounts of PGE2 after relief of obstruction. The PGE2 release seems to persist at least during the first 10 days after operation. The extent to which infants with antenatally detected urinary tract abnormalities should be investigated posmatally remains controversial. Urinary tract abnormalities were detected on obstetric ultrasound in 86 babies.",

All 79 live born infants were investigated by ultrasound, micmrating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and, where indicated, by volume expanded diuretic renography (VEDR).

We inveStigated the effect of copper sulphate on adhesion of E.coli to uropithelinl cells (UC) in vitro. The cytological material we reeelved by scraping off urethral surface. The UC were three times washed and re-suspended in Tris-buffcr (pH 7.4), then reduced to the concentration 11){){}(}00 UC per lml. The culture of E.coli was grown during 24h at 37C on the dense minimal encentration of copper sulphate (experiment) and without of them (coutrol). The main stages of the adhesion test were: incubation of lml UC with lmi of bacterial weight during 111 with constant shaking; filtration of non adhering E.coli; preparation imprints -smears for microscopic ~'~mlr)ation; staining & quantitative analysis of adhesion through light microscope. For e~timation of the adherence activity we used adhesion number (AN) -the middle number of E.eoli, which adhered at one UC and adhesion index (AI) -the percent of UC with 20 or more E.coli on its surface. We determined that the growth of E.coli on the environment with copper sulphate depressed the adherence of E.coli to UC. AI in experiment was in 12 times, and AN -4 times lower than in coutrol. We investigated the relationship of NAG, BMG and ALB levels in spot urines and RMC in patients with UTI. 7 patients were divided into 6 groups according to unilateral (13) or bilateral (13) vesico-uretcral reflex (VUR) with or without RMC including hypo or dysplasia and scar formation, which were determined on IVP or DMSA scan. These consisted of 0) U-VUR without RMC (UN), (2) U-VUR with RMC (Ur), (3) Uhydronephrosis due to PU stenosls (UO), (4) B-VUR without RMC, (5) B-VUR with mild RMC (Br), (6) B-VUR with moderate to severe RMCV (BR). 61 cases served as controls (NL).

Since these last techniques might show false/negative outcomes, investigation of scarring with DMSA scan was accepted as a gold standard. We followed 18 patients (1~ boys and 4-girls) with hepatitis B virus(HBV}-associateci nephropathy to discover the long-term prognosis. The main initial urinary finding was hematuria and proteinuria (72.2%). In 8 patients (4/4-.5%), nephrotic syndrome occurred during the course of disease. These 8 were treated with predonizolon and 3 patients achieved full remission. Histological studies confirmed membranous nephropathy in 10 patients (55.6%), and membranoprolifevative glomerulonephritis in 2 patients(1 l.l%). During the Iollow up period (range #8-1#4 months), 11 of the 18 patients (61.1%) with positive HBe antigenaemia showed seroconversion of eantigen. A total 15 patients revealed an improvement in the urinary findings, whereas 3 patients showed no improvement. Two of these three patients without any improvement in urinar/ysis developed end-stage renal failure and required maintenance dialysis. The seroconversion of HBe antigen and the pathological findings did not influence the long-term prognosis for the urinary findings or end-stage renal failure. Our results suggest that HBV-associated nephropathy ha~ a favorable prognosis. However, the patients with no improvement in urinary findings had a high probability to develop end-stage renal failure. A long-term follow-up is continuing for these patients. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in young, fertile women but little has been published about the occurrence in children. We therefore studied the clinical characteristics of S. saprophyficus UTI during childhood. Among 1500 children below 16 years of age attending an outpatient UTI clinic 1976-1987, we identified 59 children with S. saprophylicus bacteriuria. The majority were teenagers but II of 45 girls and 9 of 14 boys were under 13 years of age, the youngest being I year. All the infections were symptomatic and the clinical characteristics were similar in girls and boys. The typical presentation was acute dysuria, back or flank pain and temperature below 38.5~ In the majority C-reactive protein was low. The maximal renal concentrating capacity was transiently reduced in half of the children. Urography, performed in 37 children, showed no case with renal scarring or other important anomaly. Recurrences occurred in 14 patients, in 6 of these S. saprophyticus was the cause. We only included cases with significant bacteriuria (>100,000/ml) in our study. However, because of the tendency of these bacteria to form clusters, the number of colonies identified is usually low. Therefore a cut-off level of 10,000/ml is often used. The number of children presented here therefore represents minimum figures. ! Conclusion: Children with S. saprophyticus UTI mostly present with acute dysuria accompanied by back or flank pain without high fever.

It has been suggested that small numbers of bacteria frequently reach the bladder by ascending up the urethra but do not result in infection due to the defence mechanisms of the bladder. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of short episodes of bacterial colonization of the urinary tract in healthy infants. Urine samples were obtained by adhesive bags weekly for ten consecutive weeks from infants attending a Child Health Center. Those with growth of >50,000 colony forming units/ml with one dominating strain were asked to do suprapubic aspiration for confirmation of bacteriuria. Mter informed consent 96 families accepted to participate, starting age 1-7 weeks; 89 infants completed the study, 51 boys and 38 girls. A second study period during the second half of the first year was completed by 22 of the 38 girls. 18 infants were reexamined because of suspected bacteriuria which was confirmed in 7, 2 boys and 5 girls. The isolated bacteria were 5 strains of Escherichia coli and one each of Proteus mirabilis and Enterobacter cloacae. All the bacteriuric children were reported to be healthy and had C-reactive protein <6 mg/1; 3 had transient pyuria with >50 leukocytes/mm 3. Ultrasonography was performed in 6; no abnormality of the urinary tract was found. The 2 boys were found to have bacteriuria at the age of 2-3 months. Of the 38 girls studied during the first six months of life, none had bacteriuria; during the second six months period 5 of the 22 had short periods of bacteriuria. All the bacteriuric children remained asymptomatic and spontaneously eradicated the bacteria, in 5 of the 7 cases within two weeks. Conclusion: Transient bacteriuria is not unusual in healthy infants. Renal tuberculosis is a late sequel of primoinfection and rarely found in childhood. Although the renal parenchyme colonization occurs during the non-immune haematogeneous phase, the clinical manifestations have usually a late onset.",

            "text": "In conclusion, renal tuberculosis although rare in children, is a condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent macroscopic haematuria. Renal Na handfing is supposed to be disturbed during acute pyelonephritis (APN) in children. The reason for this disturbance is still debated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate changes in Na-homeostasis in children with APN in relation to pyelonephritic changes visualized with 99Tc-DMSA scan (DMSA), an indicator of proximal tubular function. 72 children, 59 girls and 13 boys, 0.2-15.9 (median 1.1) years of age with APN were studied. Blood and urine samples were taken on admission, DDAVP test with determination of osmolality, Na and urea in the urine and DMSA were performed within 5 days from admission. The uptake of DMSA was quantitated with a computorized method. GFR was estimated with formula clearance. 62 children were reinvestigated approximately 2 months later. In a few children fractional proximal reabsorption (FPR) and fractional distal reabsorption (FDR) were studied with lithium clearance and tubular phosphate reabsorption (TPR). Results: The mean CRP was 108 (range 10-320) rag/1. S-Na was 137\u2022 (range 128-145) mmol/1 during infection, lower than at follow-up, 139+3 (range 135-152) mmol/l (p< 0.02). Plasma aldosterone was higher during infection than at follow-up, 971+506 vs. 294+221 pmol/L GFR was lower during infection than at follow-up, 75_+24 vs. 83_+19 ml/min/1.73 m2, (p<0.02). TPR was lower during infection than at follow-up, 85+8 vs. 93+3 %. FPR during infection was low 55,8-66,4% and FDR was high 99,1-99,2%. Mean max. urine osmolality (MUO) was lower during infection, 533-+173 mOsm/kg, than at follow-up, 774+164 mOsm/kg (p<0.001). MUO was closely correlated to uUrea both during infection (r=-0.76, p<0.001) and at follow-up (r=0.81, p<0.001). MUO was not correlated to uNa during infection (r=-0.17, p=0.26) but at follow-up (r--0.54, p<0.001). S-Na during infection was inversely correlated to both CRP and changes on DMSA (r=--0.42, p< 0.01 vs. r=--0.31, p<0.05). There was no correlation between s-Na and GFR. We conclude that during APN in children there is a proximal tubular dysfunction that may lead to disturbances in Na reabsorption. It is suggested that this may lead to hyponatremia when the capacity of the distal tubule is overriddeq. Hypertension is believed to complicate vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), but the incidences is unclear. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of hypertension in children with primary, uncomplicated VUR and to study the relationship between blood pressure (BP), grade of reflux, age at diagnosis, number of urinary tract infections (UTI), renal scarring, treatment modality and duration of reflux. Subjects were identified retrospectively from chart reviews between 1974 and 1991. Follow-up was measured by the Dynamap 1800. All cystograms, intravenous pyelograms (IVP) and renal ultrasound were read independently by a single blinded observer.",

The colonization of the periurethral flora has been considered an important factor in the interaction between the host defenses and the invading bacteria. Objective: This study was designed to provide information on the composition of the periurethral flora in healthy newborns and to to assess if there is a seasonal influence on it. Newborns: Seventy-five healthy newborns (25 males, 50 females) were studied 24 to 48 hours after birth, at the Nursery of a main teaching hospital. Method: A moistened swab was used to collect samples from the periurethral area and urethral meatus. The swab was then inserted into a transport medium and sent promptly to the laboratory. Samples were obtained in August 1989 (n=30), March-April 1990 (n = 22) and July-August 1990 (n = 23). Results: The cultures were negative in 19 newborns (25%). In 21 (28%), both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were identified and in 35 (47%), the periurethral flora consisted of gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. E.cofi and Klebsiella sp were the more frequently gram-negative bacteria found. Streptococcus sp and Staphylococcus sp were the more commonly gram-positive bacteria identified. A significant seasonal variation was seen (p<0.01), both in the presence of sterile culture and in the colonization of the periurethral area with gram-negative bacteria. Conclusions: (1) 24 to 48 hours after birth there is periurethral colonization in 72% of healthy newborns; (2) in 40% of them, gram-negative bacteria are present in the periurethral area; (3) there is a seasonal variation in bacterial growth in the periurethral area and in the composition of the periurethral flora. Objective: the aim of this study was to assess changes in the prevalence and in antimicrobial susceptibility in children with urinary tract infection (UTI), seen at an Out-Patient Pediatric Nephrology Clinic of a teaching hospital. Study design: Urine samples were collected by suprapubic bladder aspiration. Antibiotic sensitivity was estimated by the Kirby-Bauer method. All positive urine cultures obtained during each period were included. From each patient, only the first positive urine culture was considered. The Results: First period: The more prevalent bacteria were: E.cofi (76%), Proteus (13%) and Klebsiella (8%). The E.coli antimicrobial susceptibility was: nitrofurantoin 92%, nalidixic acid 85%, cephalexin 65% and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 40%. Second period: The more common bacteria were E.cofi (82%), Proteus (13%) and Klebsiella (1%). The antimicrobial susceptibility of E.cofi was: nitrofurantoin 95%, nalidixic acid 92%, cephalexin 54% and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 85%. Conclusion: There was no significant modification in the prevalence of the two more common bacteria (E.cofi and Proteus). There was a significant decrease (p<0.05} in the prevalence of Klebsiella. There was no significant change in the antimicrobial susceptibility of E.cofi to nitrofurantoin and nalidixic acid, but there were significant modifications (p<0.05) in the sensitivity to cephalexin and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole.",

To describe the magnitude a n d duration of the defect in the renal concentrating capacity in acute pyelonephritis in children. 2. Assess the concentrating mechanisms in children with renal damage. Patients: A group of 88 children in a longitudinal study were evaluated after their first known acute pyelonephritis. The children were 0.2 tD6 years at inclusion and were followed three years or more. A total of 12 patients acquired or had renal damage. Methods: The desmopressin test (Minirin | F e rring AB, Sweden) was used to determine the renal concentrating capacity. Results: The concentrating capacity was lowered to a mean of -1.5 standard deviation score in the group of patients, as determined by tests during the first 0-5 days after start of antibiotic treatment. Significant lowering lasted until 3 months after the start of the infection. The patients with renal damage had as a group a more profound initial lowering. A normalization occurred after cure of the infection. After two years, children with damaged kidneys had a significant lowering again, this time without any signs of recurrent infection. Conclusion: Upper urinary tract infections i n children cause an initial transient reduction in the renal concentrating capacity. Renal damage after urinary tract infetion was associated whith a long term loss of concentrating capacity, years after cure of the infection. The presence of leucocyturia is not diagnostic of urinary tract infection (UTI). Recently, it has become important in adult patients in the differentiation between colonization and infection. The aim of this prospective study was to assess the value of leucocyturia for the diagnosis of UTI and for the differential diagnosis of colonization and infection in children. Urine was obtained in all patients by suprapubic bladder aspiration. Urine cultures and leucocytes counts were simultaneously performed in the same sample. Leucocytes were determined using uncentrifuged urine examined in a Fuchs-Rosenthal counting chamber. Urine samples from 244 patients (128 infants, 67 pre-school, 49 school-age children; 37 males, 207 females), seen at the Out-Patient Pediatric Nephrology Clinic from a teaching hospital were examined. One hundred twenty two consecutive positive urine samples were compared with 122 consecutive negative urine samples. Leucocyturia was demonstrated in 23 (19%) of the 122 positive urine cultures and innoqeof the 122 negative ones. The negative predictive value of leucocyturia for the diagnosis of UTI, with urine obtained by suprapubic bladder aspiration, is 55%, the sensibility is 19% and the specificity is 100%. Sixteen patients presented febrile UTI. Four (25%) of them had leucocyturia. The negative predictive value of leucocyturia for the diagnosis of febrile UTI is 82%, the sensitivity is 17% and the specificity is 88%. In children, leucocyturia is not useful for the diagnosis of UTI and is also inaccurate for the differentiation between colonization and infection. In the pathogenesis of E.coli in urinary tract infections (bTI) bacterial virulence factors, such as fimbriae, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular antigens play an important role. Until now 171 different O-antigens (LPS) and I03 different K-antigens (capsule) have be~ml described. We performed a retrospective, epiden~ologic study on E.coli serotypes from 328 chi~dre~l with ~ (M~an age 6.5 + 5.5 yrs). 19.1% of E.coli strains was nos typeable with the available ant isera. Boys (n=84) had 24 different O-types, %4hereas girls (n=244) had 72. The O-serotypes most frequently found were I-2-~-6-7-8-9-15-17-18-25-75 and accottnted for 48.6% of all strains. I_n boys 4--6-15-16-22-25-75-78 O-serotypes were more common; girls had more 1-7-8-9-11-17-77. In the age group < 1 yr \"more 2-4-6-75 were found, against 8-9 in the group > 10 yrs. Children with obstructive uropathy (OtP) had significantly more O-serotype 4-6-16-25 and 75, Whereas childre~ with uncomplicated recurrent UTI had more 1-7-11-18. In 37.~ of all E.coli strains a kno~m capsular antigen could be found. KI was the most common K-antigen, followed by K13. K1 was ~nantly associated with O-serotypes i-2-7-18, Ki3 with 6 and 25. Boys and girls had no differemce in K1-serotype, but boys had more K2-5-6-13. The frequency of non-capsular forms was the same in all ~hildren and in all age groups. We concluded from our studies that, with some differences, the same uropathogenic O-serotypes {1-2-4-6-7-8-9-1\"5-17-18-25-75) and K-serotypes (i-13) were found as has beetl ~ritten in I iterature. We performed a retrospective study in 15 boys and 25 girls who received quinolones (NorfloxacineR) with special indication for treatment of urinary tract i~fection (UTI). All 40 patients started to have a therapeutic treatment for 10-14 days (9-14 mg/kg/day in 2 dosages), mostly followed by a longer period of profy~actic treatment .(2-6 mg/kg/day in 1 dosage). All 15 boys (mean age 4.5 yrs -range 0.5-13.4) had obstructive ~thy (OtP) and complicated UTI, mostly caused by P~ (n=10). The mean duration of therapy was 48 days. 7 Girls also bad ccmpllcated UTI ((X/P or neturogenic bladder as result of meningom~lelocele (MM [7) , 18 girls had uncomplicated ~ without anatomical or ftElctional abnormalities in the urinary tract. All g~rls had a mean age of 8.2 yrs (range 0. 6-18.8) , and a longer period of treatment (296 days). The most frequent causative organism in girls was E.coli {n=le), mostly a multiresistant strain. 5 girls had Psetr]smcmas UTI. All patients had negative urine cultures after therapeutic treatalmlt with quinolctles. I girl got ~s sepsis with a qu/nolone resistant strain, and 7 patients got a Ulq caused by E~iterococcus during the profylactic treatment period. As side effects in all 40 patients we registered gastro-intestinal symptoms (3), and arthritis of the fhtm~ (i), probably not related to the use of quinolones. Quinolones can be used in c~il~ with OTI caused by Pseudomes Species and multiresistant E.coli. The medication can be taken orally When urosepsis is not suspected, on an outpatient basis. Since q~/inolones are not fully registered in children, prescription should, at the moment, remain in the hands of paediatric specialists. We have investigated individual renal ftmetions in patients with VUR using minas from individual kidneys through a ureteral catheterized stent tube inserted in anti-reflux operations. We measured 24 hours creatluine clearance (24 hr Cer). Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), urinary B microglobulin index (n-B2MG index), N-acetyl-Dglucosamiuidase (u-NAG index) and urinary macro albumin (u-alb). 24 hour Cer was performed 3 days after anti-reflux operation when urine collection was performed preeisaly without leaks of urine fi'om around the stent tube. 24 hour Ccr was iow and u-B MG index increased in individual kidneys with increasing severity of ~tYR. Increased u-NAG index and FENa did not correlate with the severity of VUR. walb increased in kidney with increasing severity of VUR but not ~i~ificantiy. The degree of u-alb correlated inversity with 24 hour Ccr (0.02 < p < 0.05).",

The disease began when she was 11 and was always controlled with steroids. At 13 years of age, she developed haemolytic anemia, severe digestive tract involvement requiring parenteral nutrition support, and bladder manifestations. She suffered from suprapubic pain and urinary incontinence. US revealed a large bilateral ureterohydronephrosis and an important thickening of the bladder wall ; the severity of the cystitis was confirmed by cystography and cystoscopy. The obstructive uropathy required bilateral ureteral catheter stents. The pathological examination of the bladder showed mild inflammatory infiltrate, arteriolar thrombosis and necrotic zones. The patient was treated with prednisone + cyclosphosphamide and had a favorable outcome. SLE cystitis is rarely described : less than 20 cases are published in adults. Urinary bladder involvement may be a primary manifestation of SLE but often occurs after several years of evolution under steroid therapy without cyclophosphamide, such as in our observations. All the patients had laboratory evidence of disease activity and most of them had profound gastrointestinal complaints concomitant with bladder symptoms. In our patients, despite ureteral catheterization in one case, the urological involvement was controlled with steroids \u2022 cyclosphosphamide ; however persistant urinary symptoms or bladder fibrosis have been reported. Lupus cystitis may be more frequent than thought and could be considered in children with SLE and lower urinary tract findings.",

According to our earlier investigations there is a metabolism-dependent tubular dysfunction in every diabetic patient which starts with.~he onset of IOOM. Oespite the reduced GFR in hyperglycaemic ketoacidosis (1) Renal abnormalities were p~esent at onset in 21 patients and subsequently developed in a further i0. Renal biopsies revealed glomerulonephritis (GN) in 25 patients (WHO Class Ill/IV in 14, V in 4, I~ in 4, and I in 3), interstitial nephritis in 3, and segmental arteritis in i. On repeat biopsy, 8 showed a worsening of GN yet remained in the same class while 1 showed a transition from class IV to V. Unusual complications included bullous skin eruptions, acute airway obstruction from vasculitic oedema of the tongue, femoral arterial thrombosis, interstitial lung disease, and intracranial lymphoma. 14 had negative ANA and/or anti-ds DNA antibodies at presentation. Despite aggressive treatment with prednisolone \u2022 azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, pulsed methylprednisnlone and plasma exchange in various combinations, end-stage renal failure developed in 4 and 4 others had chronic renal insufficiency at follow-up. Actuarial survival rates at 5 and i0 yr were 77% (n=13) and 52% (n=4) respectively. Deaths were due to fulminant lupus, pneumococcal necrotising fasciitis, haemorrhagic chickenpox, stroke, myocardial infarction and intestinal perforation. The data shows that SLE in childhood has protean features and a significant mortality and morbidity. RhG-CSF is a glycoprote!n which controls myelopoiesis and is increasingbf used in a variety ot neutropenias. To date, side effects on renal tunction have been reported on rare occasions and these cases have been poorly documenfedo We hereby report a case of biopsy proven .MG which occurred dufin~ rhG-CSF therapy, as well as our studies on me in vitro effects of rhG--CSF on mesangial cell proliferation (MC). An 8-year-old boy developea a~ranulocvtosis z months after chmkenpox. Treatment with orarpredNsqne (2mg/kg/d) and high dose i.v. 1%?_rnunoglob.ulins failed .tocorrectme neutropN1 count. RHG-CSF was administered at an initial dose ot 4,g/kg/d. The dose was increased up to 32#g/kg/d until a response was oSserved and &ranulocyte count normaIizeS. Six weeks later, tile patient presented M(_i with acute renal failure and hypertension. RhG-CSF was discontinued and within 4 days, renal function improved but he became neutropenic again, When rhG-CSF was resumea.at 16ug/kg/d renal function worsened wimin days. Based on temporal assooation between rhG-CSF treatment and occurrence of MG, we postulated that rhG-CSF was inducing MC proliferation possibly by a direct effect, or by means of other mediators. This hypothesis was evaluated with in vitro studies on MC. Rat MC from primary cultures were used for the experiments. Cells rendered quiescent in medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum(FSC) were stimulated wire various concentrations of rhG-CSF. 0.5% and 10% FCS were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Cell proliferation was studied with 3H-thymidine incorporation. Addition of rhG-CSF in different concentrations did not result in a_ny increase of DNA synthesis of MC. On the contrary, there was a slight tendency towards inhibition. With rhG-CSF concentrations of 5130, 1000 and 2000 mg/ml, we found a 17%, 20% and 16% inhibition, respectively. This was not statistically sienificant (p=0.4). In anomer experiment, MC were incubated for 2~ hours with rbG-CSF. The sup ernatant was then transferred onto fresh cultures of MC. We obser-ve~t a significant inhibition (p=0.001) of MC DNA synthesis. The rate of inhibnion at the various concentrations of rhG-CSF used was 65 \"-: 7% (r~G-CSF 500 ng/ml), 62 _+ 6% (1000 ng/ml) and 62 +_ 7% (2000 ng/ml). We postulate that rhG-CSF stimmated MC produce a soluble f~ctor which inhibits DNA synthesis of MC. We are curren@ t~ing to identify this factor. To conclude our results are not in favor of a direct effect of rhG-CSF on the pathogenes s of the glomerulonephrit s observed in this patient. China, 3National Laboratory for 0ncogenes and Related Genes, Shanghai Cancer Institute 22 cases of membranous nephropathy were studied in 162 renal biopsies in children with primary glomerular diseases (13.6%). The age of onset ranged from 3 to 12 years. 19 boys and 3 girls, Among them, 19 cases presented clinically as nephrolic syndrome and 3 eases as nephritis syndrome. HBV markers were tested in sera of all cases, 20 (90.9%) showed positive resul,ts (HBsAg 19/22+, AntiHBs 1/22+, AntiHBc 14/21+, HBeAg 7/14+, AnfiiHBe 1/14+, one case only positive for AntiHBe). HBsAg and/or HBeAg and/or HBeAg were detected in 10 out of 16 cases (62.5%i along the glomerular capillary wall under immunoflureseent-examination. HBV DNA was examined in 4 cases from the renal tissues, digested with EcoR1 and hybridized with 32p labeled HBV DNA probe afte E gel electrophoresis and southern transfer. HBV DNA was present in 2 cases in the integrated form and*~ ~ non-replicating or mu~at~d free form rather than DNA derived from contaminated Danes particles of sera. Only 17 of the renmining 140 patients were serum HBsAg positive (12.1%). These findings ~trongly suggest that membranous nephropathy in children is closely related to HBV infection in China.

In post-transplantation immunosuppression the use of Cyclosporine A (CSA) has improved survival and reduced steroid-toxicity. We therefore retrospectively analyzed 13 children with lupus nephritis who received CSA as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. 9 girls and 4 boys aged 8.4 to 17.5 years (median12.6) were followed for 1.6 to 12.2 years (median 3.5). The ARA-criteda for SLE were met by all but 1 patient, who had a family history of SLE and whose disease was classified as serenegative. Renal biopsy showed Mesangioproliferative GN in 6, MPGN in 3 and Membranous GN in 4 patients. A total of 264 patient months of CSA therapy could be evaluated (Range 3 to 51 months, median 18.2) and compared with 488 patient months without CSA. In all patients the indication for CSA therapy was uncontrolled disease activity under steroids, in 9 patients massive steroid toxicity was present. In 10 children CSA was combined with Prednisone (Pred), 3 children received Pred, Azathioprine (Aza) and CSA. CSA dosage was adjusted to keep whole blood trough levels between 80 to 140 ng/mL During CSA therapy, renal and extrarenal disease activity decreased sigificantly whereas the serological markers did not improve. Mean proteinuria decreased from 786 to 312 mg/sqm/day, creatinine clearance remained stable (100.3 vs 95.5 mllmin11.73sqm). Mean daily steroid dose was 18.7 mg before, 13.2 mg during and 18.1mg after CSA, respectively. The mean frequency of relapse was 0.02/month (CSA+Pred), 0.041/month (Pred), 0.047/month (Pred+Aza). No serbus side-effects were seen under CSA. Infections did not increase during CSA therapy. In one patient a mild elevation of serum creatinine normalized after discontinuation of CSA. We conclude from our data that CSA can be used to intensify the immunesuppressive therapy of SLE and reduce steroid dose and toxicity. The aims in this study were to produce monoclonal antibodies against human albumin and to develop a simple, rapid, and sensitive sandwich ELISA using anti-human albumin monoclonal antibodies for detecting microalbuminuria. Four monoelonal antibodies (MHA-1, MHA-2, MHA-3, and MHA-4) which reacted selectively against human albumin were produced by hybridoma technology. Isotype of each monoclonal antibody was found to be IgG1. All monoclonal antibodies except MHA-I were species-specific on ELISA and immunoblotting. Utilizing inhibition ELISA, it was speculated that these four antibodies recognized respectively 4 different epitopes of albumin. Sandwich ELISA using two monoclonal antibodies (MHA-4 as capture antibody and MHA-2 as detector antibody), which reacted with different epitopes, were developed to detect microalbuminuria. Dynamic range of this assay was from 30 to 500 ~.g/1 and im lower limit of detection was 30 gg/l, corresponding to 1.Sag of albumin per well. The imra-assay and the inter-assay coefficient of variation were 3.3-4.0% and 6.8-8.0%, respectively. Analytical recovery ranged from 92 to 103%. Concentrations of 84 urine samples were measured by the sandwich ELISA and competitve radioimmunoassay. Correlation between two assays was good (r=0.983, p<0.005)over a range of albumin concentration tested. Albumin excretions in 24 hour urine samples from non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients (mean 16.7rag/day, n=39, 8yr duration) were significantly increased (p<0.05) as compared with those from healthy subjects (mean 5.6mgMay). However, 24 hour urine albumin excretions in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients (mean ll.lmg/day, n=25, 6.8yr duration) were not significantly different from those in normal control. We suggest that this assay has good analytical charaeterisitcs and is suitable and easily accessable for detection of microalbuminuria in clinical medicine. alterationsin the tubular transport of electrolytes.

During ketoacidosis endothelin excretion is unaltered but E/creatinine ratio is significantly enhanced associated with a significantly lower GFR.

In marked contrast the effects of HG were largely reversed when incubation was limited to 1-hr. These acute effects are more compatible with osmolality rather than pH-induced activation of existing ATPase molecules which appear not to involve synthesis and membrane incorporation of new transport proteins.

This was associated with higher levels of albuminuria compared with group A, although this is not statistically significant due to the small numbers involved. The rise in RBP excretion was a short-lived phenomenon, despite more persistent albuminuria. We postulate that during albumin infusions a high concentration of albumin in the proximal tubular fluid may inhibit tubular reabsorption of RBP. Albuminuria achieved similar levels on two occassions in group A to those in group B without provoking high urine levels of RBP. The relationship between albuminuria and RBP excretion is therefore not a simple one, and it is possibile that some other factor associated with albumin infusion may have a role. We have studied the bone mineral content (BMC) of the lumbar spine in 29 children (9 girls) treated with corticosteroid therapy over a long period, using dual photon absorptiometry. The BMC was measured by SOPHOS L XRA densitometer which uses 153 gadolinium as the radiation source, and was compared with the values of BMC measured on normal children by a Hologic QDR-1000 densitometer which uses an X ray tube as the radiation source*.The children's average age was 7,1 yrs (2,7 to 15,8 yrs) and the average duration of the treatment, was 3,4 yrs (0,5 to 13 yrs). All the children had a normal GFR and received daily oral supplements of calcium (400 mg/day) and Vit.D (600 IU/day). The mean height standard deviation score for chronological age (h SDS) was -0,52 (-2,8 to 2). The bone age was significantly lower than the chronological age (6,5 vs 7,2; p=0,O01) . There was a positive correlation between the BMC and the age as well as between the BMC and the bone age as in normal children. The mean of the standard deviation score of the BMC was -0,48 for the boys and 0,21 for the girls (p=0,002). There was no correlation between the BMC and the length of the corticosteroid therapy.The values of the BMC were normal except in four prepubertal boys presenting growth retardation. This work demonstrates that the BMC is not modified by a prolonged corticosteroid therapy associated with calcium and vitamin D supplements.

Furukawa and R.Yabuta Dept.or Pediatr., Juntendo University School of Hedicine, Tokyo 113, Japan Recent studies reveal that the levels or soluble CD4 (sCD4) and sC08 in serum correlate with the T cell subset activation. He have measured these levels of 19 patients with nephrotic syndrome who had ~teroid therapy (11 with steroid-sensiti~;e cases ;8 with steroid-dependent/resistant cases) at either the onset of the disease or the relapsing stage. [hese concentrat ions in serum were determined using CELLFREE CD4 and T8 test,kits (T .cell Sciences,Cambridge,HA), and the measurements were done before and after the therapy. Serum sCg8 levels before therapy were significantly higher than normal age-matched controls and these returned to normal range after therapy especially in steroid sensitive cases (figure). have respectively nephrotic and non nephrotic range proteinuria. The most frequent infectious complication was pneumonia followed by peritonitis.The most frequently isolated etiological agent was S.Dneumoniae.cyclophosphamide was chosen as cytotoxic agent in most cases and was successful in 48/98 pts(48.9%).In conclusion: 10.3% of our patients developed loss of renal function;persistent or acquired steroid resistance ocurred in 100% of the children who went into CRF/ESRD;the histological pattern of the biopsied kidney was not a good prognosticator of renal function loss in our pts. Proteinuria in adriamycin nephrosis (AN) is partly mediated by increased thromboxane (Tx) production. Since adriamycin (ADR) is a free radical (FR) stimulant, we administered dimethylthiourea (DMTU), a FR scavenger and stimulator of renal glutathione (GSH), with fish oil (FO). which reduces Tx, to see if they are synergistically protective in rats with AN. In the first experiment, male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats (200 gms) received ADR+corn oil (CO) (Group i) or ADR+DMTU+CO (Group 2) or ADR+DMTU+FO (Group 3). ADR was given as 5 mg/kg IV and DMTU as 750 and 250 mg/kg at 18 and 4 hours pre ADR and 250 mg/kg IP daily.",

The renal effects of the hormone are blunted in patients and in experimental models of nephrotic syndrome (NS). The present study was designed to evaluate the characteristics of renal ANP binding sites in rats with experimental NS induced by adriamycin (ADR) injection (5mg/kg, single dose i.v.). Three weeks after ADR or vehicle injection, urinary protein excretion was higher in ADR treated (226\u2022 hr) than in control animals (3~\u2022 hr). Groups of ADR treated rats (n=S) and control animals (n=S) were sacrificed by decapitation, their kidneys removed, and glomeruli and renal medullary tissues were isolated. Characterization of two receptor subtypes to ANP was achieved by displacement experiments of bound Z2Sl ANP to glomerular or papillary membranes with ANP(99-126) or des(18-22)ANP (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) , an analogue binding to ANP clearance receptors (ANPc) only. The density of total glomerular binding sites (Bma x) was significantly decreased in ADR vs. control rats (151\u2022 vs. 418\u2022 fmol/mg prot.p<O.05). This decrease was mainly due to a change in the \"biologically active\" receptors (66\u2022 vs. 115\u2022 fmol/mg prot.p<O.05). The Bmax of the total receptors in medullary membranes of ADR and control animals did not differ significantly (46\u2022 vs. 79\u2022 fmel/mg prot. p=NS). Likewise the dissociation constants (Kd) of the receptors for ANP in glomerular or medullary membranes of ADR and control animals did not differ significantly. The data demonstrate a decrease in the density of ANP receptors in glomeruli of ADR treated rats. Such a decrease may contribute, in part, to the blunted natriuretic response to ANP in ADR induced NS.",

It has been generally stated that \"minimal\" fetal renal pelvic dilatation is physiological.However,the finding of significant VUR in 4 of 18 babies (22%) and PUJ obstruction in one strongly indicates that this finding requires postnatal investigation. Fifteen infants with asymptomatie unilateral obstructive hydronephrosis were diagnosed and operated at our clinic 1988-1991. The diagnosis was suggested prenatally by ultrasound and confirmed postnatally by IVP and renography under intravenous fluid provocation, combined with Furosemid.

Ten infants (50%) had abnormal VCUG's: six vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and four with bladder trabeculation alone. Only two had abnormal ultrasounds--both with hydronephrosis secondary to VUR. High leak point pressures (LPP) were seen in nine of 20 infants (45%) and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) was seen in seven infants (35%). Of the nine babies with elevated LPP's, seven had abnormal VCUG's and of the seven children with DSD, five had abnormal VCUG's. Conversely, of the ten infants with abnormal VCUG's, eight had abnormal urodynamics: I-DSD alone, 3-elevated LPP alone, 4-both. Two infants with VUR (Grade III and Grade IV respectively) had low pressure bladders withouut DSD. Significantly, all four infants with trabeculation alone had abnormal uredynamic findings.

We used the criteria suggested by the Society for Fetal Urology (May 1989) to grade FIN and LTD. The grading method will be presented. We evaluated 103 infants (73 boys, 30 girls) who presented before 1 year old for FIN (76) or HUN (27) . For cases of HN obstruction was diagnosed in 56 (74%) involving 61 (3%) of 97 dilated kidneys. In dilated kidneys with obstructed HN, the mean grade of HN was 3.4+7 (s.d); while in dilated kidneys without obstructed FIN the mean grade of HN was 1.6-+8 (9< .05). When the value to predict obstruction is set at HN Gr > 3, there was 88% sensitivity and 95% specificity. For cases of HUN, obstruction was diagnosed in 15 (56%) involving 17 (50%) of 34 dilated renal units. When the degree of dilation is examined as a score, HUN score = Gr HN+Gr UD, the best correlation of dilation with obstruction was noted. In cases of non obstructed HUN, the average HUN score was 5.8_+1.9 (p<.00l). When the value to predict obstruction is set at HUN score ~5, there was 94% sensidvlty and 80% specificity. Although ezami,atious of ultrasound images cannot be used to diagnose nephroureteral obstruction, the diagnosis of obstruction is linked with the grade of HN or score of HUN. Retrograde ureterography is commonly performed just prior to pyeloplasty in cases of uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). A total of 103 patients were operated on at our institution for UPJO over an Ii year period (1979 Ii year period ( -1990 . Ninety-seven records were available for review. The objective of our review was to determine if retrograde ureterography uncovered any significant secondary findings. Thirty six patients did not have pre-operative retrogrades. In 17 of these patients the ureters were visualized preoperatively by other radiographic techniques (IVP-3; antegrade study-8; VCU-6). Nineteen patients did not have retrogrades performed for technical reasons. There remained 61 patients in whom 66 retrograde ureterograms were performed immediately prior to surgery (5 patients had bilateral studies). In 65 of the 66 UPJOs, the findings on retrograde ureterography did not alter the surgical approach. An upper tract procedure was performed as initially planned on 63 renal units (54 dismembered pyeloplasties; 6 ureterocalycostomies; 2 nephrectomies; 1Culp pyeloplasty). Two patients with bilateral UPJOs had retrogrades performed on the less affected side although repair was not undertaken. Based on this review, the routine performance of preoperative retrograde ureterography for UPJO may not be indicated.",

From an overall population of 2030600 children under 15 years of age, reflux was reported in 822 patients and classified as primary VUR in 662 (67%). Data on sex, age of diagnosis, clinical presentation, degree of VUR and scarring at presentation, management and outcome, were obtained. There was a female predominance in all the age groups studied with the exception of the first year of life where the number of males was higher. Bilateral reflux was present in 50% of the eases and the number with mild, moderate and severe VUR was similar in all age groups. Renal scarring, on DMSA, was initially present in 176/492 (58,6%) patients. Of these, 18/176 (10%) were hypertensive and 28/176 (16%) had impaired renal function. These complications correlated with the degree of scarring and age of diagnosis. Only 20% of the patients reported underwent surgical treatment, which was performed mainly in subjects with severe reflux and recurrent urinary infections. New renal scars as well as breakthrough infections and new cases of hypertension and reduced renal function were observed in both medical and surgical treatments, at the latest follow up. Due to a number of reasons this study probably underestimates the real prevalence of VUR in the Country. However it is useful as a baseline for a planned national prospective study, on this condition. Aim : To assess the observe(i cc~lience, knowledge and attitude of the patients and parents currently at-tending the paediatric transplantatian follow up clinic. Patients and Methods : A questia~naire designed to evaluate general charantsristics, confirm cc~Dliance, explore atti~ades and knowledge ~s administered to 56 transplant (TP) patiente and theL-parents. Patients have previously been divided into non compliant (NC), doubtful (D) ~nd co~pliant (C) ~oups based on (i) admission of not -=~ medicatian (if) admit medication has\\finished (iii) missed clinic visit such Chat medication would have been insufficient (iv) COrLeirmed by retrospective CyA analysis.

            "text": "To prove all these the authors will present a film. Failure of growth is a frequent feature after RT. D is an oxazs line compound derived from prednisolone with a similar antiinflammatory action but fewer side effects. We studied changes in kidney function, growth velocity(GV),weight for heightratio (Wt/Ht), thyroid function, before and two years after substitution of methylprednisone(MP) by D in l0 patients aged 9 to 16 years, 4 years after RT; 8 were in Tanner stage I and 2in Tanner IV. In 3 patients, immunosuppressive treatment includ~ azathioprine and MP while in the other 7, a triple therapy including cyclosporine, was used. MP (6 + 0.3 mg/day) (x + SEM) it was replaced by D (9.6 ! 0.5 mg/day~for a period of 2years. Serum creatinine (Cr) and Cr clearance did not show any signif leant changes before and during D treatment, 1.22+ 0.i vs 1.3 + 0.2 mg/dl, and 69 + 8 vs 73 + ii ml/min/l.73 m ,respectively In 8 Tanner I patients, GV increased from 1.7 + 0.4 to 4.1 + 0.8 cm/yr (p<0.005); 4 of them reached GV>4 cm/yr. Wt/Ht decreased from 27 + 7 to 21 ! 7% (p<0.02)~ean concentrations of total thyroxine-(T4) (8.6 ! 0.4 ug/dl),total triiodothyron ! ne (T3) (1.7 + 0.2 ng/ml)and basal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (3.1 + O.2 mU/L) were normal,while mean free T4 level (I.i ! 0.06-ng/dl) was below the normal control mean (p<0.01). Five patients on MP and 5 on D had deficient TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH).Circadian TSH pattern was studied in i0 patients, 5 on MP and 5 on D therapy. Four out of I0 patients had a nocturnal TSH surge below the normal range (95% confidence limits 47% to 300%). In pediatric patients after RT on D treatment: I) renal function remained stable; 2) Wt/Ht deereased;3)GV increased and 4)thyroid funetion'remained stable. The association of low free T4, deficient TSH response to TRH and impaired nocturnal TSH surge, support the hypothesis that some RT patients on glucocorticeid therapy have central hypothyroidism. Results of renal transplantation (Tx) in children under 5 years of age have been reported to be inferior to those in older children with a mortality of up to 15%, a lower graft survival and. vascular complications in 20%. CMV-infections have been a common complication. We report our experiences with renal Tx in 23 children less than 5 y of age transplanted after 1987. Mean age at Tx was 2.4 y (1.2-4.3y, 10 pts <2y) mean follow-up time was 2.2 y (0.1-4.6 y) and all pts had been at least 3 mo on CCPD prioi to Tx (mean time on CCPD was 9 mo). All pts were transfused prior to Tx and one miss-match in A, B and DR loci was accepted. Mean donor age was 28.7 y (4-40 y) and 11 were LRD:s. All grafm were placed retropefitoneally in the fight iliac fossa, mean cold ischemia-fime was 25.7 h (19.3-39.0 h). Triple immunosuppression was used and CyA started preoperatively at a pharmacokinetically determined individual dose devided into 3 doses/d. Anti-CMV immunoglobulin prophylaxis was given for 3 rno if the donor was CMV+. Patient survival is 100% and graft survival 91%. No vascular complications have been encountered. CMV-infection responding to gancyclovir was seen in,2 pts and led to nephrofic syndrome and chronic rejection in one. Mean serum creatinine concentration is 76 umol/L, mean GFR 68.7 ml/min/1.73m2 and catch-up growth is seen in most pts 6-12 mo after Tx. One lymphocele with stenosis of the urether has been the only urological complication.",

            "text": "We conclude that results of renal \"Ix in 1-5 y old children are similar to those of older age groups with the present mode of treamaent. One factor responsible for the better results is presumably the use of kidneys from young adults for young children reducing vascular complications and pre-Tx CCPD which brings the child in a better clinical status to Tx. Tissue-typing, pre-Tx transfusions and tailor-made immunosuppression might be additional factors. Although CMV-infections have been sparse the role of Anti-CMV immunoglobulin is not clear. Over last two years, renal transplantation was perfermed in ten children. Five weighed between I~ te 29 Kg;five weighed between 11 te 15 Kg. Seven were males, three females.

All ethers have nermal renal functions at 3 months te 2 years after trausplantatien with geed rehabilitatien.hate referrals, passive attitudes, cultural barriers, secie economic status are some ef the factors which influence transplant presrams in deve!eping countries. Exogenous addition of catalase, one of the cellular regulators of free radical oxygen species, has been of limited success in extending the viability threshold of transplanted organs after long hypothermic preservation. We have previously shown that catalase is prone to oxidative injury during ichemiaJrepertusion (Gulati et al. Arch Biochem Biophys 1992 In Press) . To understand the possible mechanism of this limited success, we have studied the effect of cold flush hypoth ~rmic perfusion with EC vs UW preservative solutions on endogenous catalase. The kidneys of Sprague-Dawley rats were flushed in situ with either EC or UW Solution, then surgically removed and preserved at 4~ for various times in each solution. Controls were cold flush perfused only. Kidneys in each group were analyzed morphologically by electronmicrograpy and part homogenized for enzymatic and wete'n blot analysis. Enzymatic activity is reported graphically as percent control. Western blot demonstrated approximately the same levels of catalase at all time intervals for both EC and UW solution. This would indicate that the decrease in catalase activity is due to inactivation rather than degradation. UW has a significant protective effect over EC on catalase activity for 48 hours, however the subsequent deactivation of this enzyme in both solutions may represent the rate limiting factor for its role in oxidative injury. Since february 1989, routine monitoring of a combination of biological markers in serum (O reactive protein, CRP and neopterin/creatinin ratio, N/C) and in urine (micrealbuminuria, Ms) were performed in kidney transplanted children in order to allow early detection and diagnosis of allografts rejection and/or infections. Ma, CRP and N/C were determinated each third day on hospitalized patients and at every outpatient visit there-after. Ma (normals lower than 50mg/l or 20mg/day) and CBP (normal$ lower than lOmg/l) were measured by immunonephelemetric method. N was determined by radioimmunological assay and N/C ratio was used in order to dissociate raised serum neopterin levels caused by impaired renal function from elevations due to activated cellular immunity (monocytes/macrophages exposed to interferon). Patients (N=42) were divided into 5 groups according to infection (bacterial or viral), siclosporine overdosage (whole blood determination, BIA polyclonal, residual level higher than 500mg/ml), non-specific (urinary tract obstruction or reflux, renal arterial stenosis). Children with stability had normal values for Ms, CRP and specially for N/O (117 t 32, N=42 patients, n:1715 prelevemelts). During acute graft rejection (17 episodes), CRP usually remained constant but a dramatic increase occured both for Ma (range : 64 to more than 300mg/l) and for N/C (range : 162 to 340). The highest rise of N/C (range : 253 to 847) without rise of Ma can be correlated with viral infections (C~9] usually).No biological marker taken alone was, in all cases, specific enough but, besides clinical manifestations (clinical evolution) combination of these three biological markers used routinely (biological evolution) may be considered as a useful tool for the follow up of transplanted children.

            "text": "Besides the risk of recurrence of proteinuria, the nephrotic syndrome (NS) may be complicated with deep-vein thrombosis. The occurrence of extensive thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (lVC) is a technical obstacle to renal transplantation (T), that can be overcome by using the portal vein for transplant vein anastomosis. Patient 1 is a girl with diffuse mesangial sclerosis. The NS began when she was 9 month-old ; she required dialysis 11 months later and bilateral nephrectomy was performed because of severe arterial hypertension. A first renal T was attempted when she was 5, but it was not achieved because of thrombosis of the IVC, without previous clinical evidence. She was successfully transplanted when she was 6.5 (cadaver, 12 y) since the implantation of the transplant vein was allowed on the portal vein ; the arterial anastomosis used the aorta. There was no major complication during the post-operative period. After a 5 yearfollow-up, the GFR is normal (SCr = 78 p.mol/I) and there is no evidence (biological tests, doppler ultrasound, liver biopsy) of portal hypertension nor hepatic dysfunction. Patient 2 experienced NS related 1o FSGS when she was 1 yr-oid. ESRF required dialysis when she was 4 and bilateral nephrectomy was done when she was 5.5. A first renal T was performed at age 6 ; the presence of a thrombosis involving the whole IVC prompted to use the ovarian vein for graft implantation, but early thrombosis led to transplantectomy. A second T was carried out when she was 6.5 (cadaver, 7 y) ; portal venous drainage and arterial anastomosis were achieved in the same conditions that in pt 1. The postoperative period was complicated with a recurrence of the NS on day 5, that was controlled by plasma exchanges + switch of azathioprine to cyclosphosphamide. 14 months later, the GFR is normal (SCr = 50 #mol,'l) and there is no proteinuria. Doppler imaging, biological tests and biopsy of the liver show no abnormality. In case ol extensive thrombosis of the IVC, when neither the primitive lilac veins nor the supra-rena~ part of the tVC can be used, the implantation of the transplaht vein can be successfully achieved on the portal vein without significant hemodynamic nor functional change of the liver. Our patients had no rejection episode and their current renal function is normal. Portal drainage seems to be the only alternative in such children ; however the difficulty of transplant biopsy and the ability of ureteral lengthening cannot be appraised.

I0 Sixty renal transplantations (tx) were performed in 53 children, 27 boys and 26 girls, less than 16 years of age (median 6.8 yrs; range 5 mos -15.6 yrs) between December 1981 and December 1991.55% of the children were _< 7 yrs and 23% <_.2 yrs. 42 children had congenital nephropadfies, most commonly dysplasia, polycystic kidney disease, juvenile nephronophtisls and congenital nephrosis. 11 children had acquired renal diseases mostly glomerulonephrids. Padents with congenital diseases were transplanted at a significantly lower age (5.9i-0.6 yrsmean +SEM) than those with acquired diseases (10.1+1.4 yrs). 29 children were on dialysis prior to tx (22 on PD, 4 on liD, 3 on both). There were 53 primary transplants, six second and one third tranplant. 42 of the grafts were obtained from living donors (40 parents and 2 grandmothers) and 18 came from cadaveric donors. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine and prednisolone in 13 children. 40 children also received azathioprine. Six patients have died (3 with functioning grafts) and 4 of them were < 2 yrs of age. 12 grafts have been lost (acute or chronic rejection 5, technical failure 3, patient death 3 and recurrence of disease 1). The median height SDS of the children at tx was -2.23 SDS (range -10.0 -1.97 SDS). The median height SDS at 1, 2 and 3 yrs after tx was -1.81, -1.14 and -1.21 S DS respectively. 51% of the children were on antihypertensive treatment before primary tx, 79% during the ftrst year and 30% after 5 yrs. The mean GFRs, measured as clearances of inulin, am presented in Fig. There was no significant change in absolute GFR during follow-up. GFR related to BSA decreased signiticantly from the fifth year specially in cadaveric recipients. In conclusion, most children survive with improved growth and development and with a satisfactory renal function after kidney transplantation. The effectiveness of OKT3 in reversal of steroid resistant rejection has previously been demonstrated in pediatric renal transplant recipients. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to determine the efficacy and both immunologic and infectious comp, lications seen in a pediatric renal transplant population receiving OKT3 induction. Twenty cadaveric renal transplant patients (mean age 12.5 +4.8 yrs) received 14 days (mean 13.0 -I-2.8 days) of OKT3 (mean dose 0.16 +0.09 mg/kg/dose) along with prednlsone 0.5 mg/kg/day, azathiaprine 2 mg/kg/day and cyclosporine 5 mg/kg/day which was increased to obtain therapeutic levels before the discontinuation of OKT3. Four children had immediate post operative vascular thrombosis, only 1 of which was felt to be technical in origin. Two of the other 3 children had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis but were not nephrotie at the time of transplant. 75% experienced rejection episodes within the first 2 months post transplant (mean 27 +15 days) with 1 patient having a break-through rejection during his OKT3 induction. Actuarial patient and graft survival, excluding the 4 immediate graft losses, were 100 and 62%, respectively, at both 1 and 5 years. Clinically significant cytomegalovirus infection occurred in 4 patients (1 episode occurred after a second course of OKT3) and resulted in graft loss in 2 patients. Circulating OKT3 levels ranging from 1000-32,000 ng/ml were seen in all patients within the first 48 hours. One patient required an increase in OKT3 dose, concomitant with OKT3 antibody formation on day 8. There was a rapid and total depletion of circulating CD3 + lymphocytes in all patients. Antiisotypic and anti-idiotypic OKT3 antibodies were assessed by ELISA and antiidiotypic antibodies were detected by immunofiuorescence inhibition assay. Positive OKT3 antibody titers were, detected in 11/19 children by ELISA and 10/15 children by immunofluorescence inhibition assay. In summary, we have found 1) OKT3 induction therapy is associated with a high incidence of vascular thrombosis, the etiology of which is unclear but deserves further investigation, 2) the incidence of early acute rejection, time to first rejection and long term graft survival does not appear to have been beneficially affected by the use of induction therapy and 3) there is a high incidence of sensitization against OKT3.

In addition ~o usual immunosuppressive therapies for renal transplantation, both were on small doses of prednisone (MC-5mg,JG-2.5mgOD). Both were suspected to have abruptly stopped prednisone therapy. Both had problems with hyypertension. JG had chronic otitis media (OM) with effusion. MC had hypertensive encephalopathy prior to renal transplantation.

Departments of Pediatrics, University Freiburg I, Germany, and Budapest 2, Hungary Endothelin 1-21 (E) is a peptfde that is vasoactive and potentially diuretic. It is produced by endothelial and renal epithelial cells, in vitro. Renal excretion probably reflects intrarenal (epithelial cell?) E production. Renal excretion of E determined by RIA was highest in preterm neonates (N=20, gestational ages 25 to 38 weeks) at 25 weeks and decreased with age (E/crea). In children age 4-16 years excretion of E after water diuresis increased from 98 to 278 pg/mg creatinine (p<0.01, N=4) and after furosemide from 113 to 220 (p<0.01, N=5). In children with biopsy proven renal disease the excretion was as follows (pg/mg creatinine): Focal segmental sclerosis (N=8) 168\u2022 Minimal change disease (N=5) 138\u2022 Lupus nephritis (N=2) 92\u2022 After renal transplantation (NTx) under cyclosporin treatment (N=I2) urinary E was 185\u2022 pg/mg.

            "text": "Endothelin excretion is significantly higher in neonates and infants which may contribute to the increased intrarenal resistance resulting in lower glomerular filtration rate. In children with renal disease endothelin is enhanced and highest in transplanted children with cyclosporin treatment suggesting that intrarenal mechanisms may influence vascular resistance potentially through endothelin release. In this report we describe a first large series in which a novel method for obtaining isolated glomeruli (GL) from human kidneys was evaluated. We modified FNA processing to obtain glomeruli from adult and pediatric transplanted (n=56) and native kidneys (n=6). FNA was done with 25-23 gauge spinal needles using classical Helsinki method and the aspirate was suspended in 5ml of RPMI 1640. GL in the aspirate were trapped by the following procedure: Centrifugation of the sample in gelatine coated tubes at i000 rpm for i0 min, removal of the supernatant and addition of 3 drops of normal human plasma to the pellet. In the next step, 3 drops of I:I000 solution of bovine thrombine were added to produce a stable clot which retained GL in its fibrin mesh. The clot containing GL was processed by the conventional methods for light and electron microscopy. Results: 5-6 GL per sample were obtained in 44 out of 62 samples (70%), 25% of FNA had no GL, in 5% GL were distorted. The FNA diagnosis of pathologic conditions: Rejection Neph., Membranous Neph., Minimal Change Dis., Diabetic Neph., FSGS and Amyloidosis was confirmed in all cases (n=13) where parallel tissue biopsies were also done. There were no complications and patients accepted repeated FNA when required. The advantages of this method are its simplicity and safety,the disadvantages -lack of information on renal parenchyma. We conclude that FNA method can be recommended for study of GL pathology especially in solitary kidneys and in follow-up of renal therapy. The messages transduced by cytokines are critical to the response to alloantigen. Graft infiltrating cells are responsible for the development of either rejection of or tolerance to the allograft. There is increasing information that different patterns of cytokine production at the site of some immune responses may determine or reflect the direction of the ongoing immune response (Modlin et al 1991) . Determination of the pattern of cytokine production by\" peripheral blood or graft infiltrating cells may be helpful in monitoring the immune response to the allograft and selection of immunosuppressive therapy. We have developed a nonradioactive technique to quantitate the presence and frequency of cells generating mRNA for interleukin 2 (IL2). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and phorbyl myristate acetate and sedimented onto microscope slides. After fixation they are stored or hybridized directly. Digestion with proteinase K, prehybridization and hybridization are performed using standard techniques. A 24 base antisense oligonucleotide against human IL2 is 3' labelled with digoxigenin (DUG) (Boehringer Mannheim) labelled dUTP. Immunohistochemical detection is performed with a monoclonal anti-DIG antibody, a biotin-labelled second antibody and preformed complexes of avidin-biotin-alkaline phosphatase (Vector) and finally nitroblue tetrazolium. Slides are counterstained and specific staining is quantitated using image analysis. Patients (pts) whose sera contain high levels of anti-class I HLA antibodies (abe), as measured by>75% reactivity against a panel of T lymphocytes in the complememt-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay, have inferior access and success of renal transplantation. There are currently no safe and successful ways to reduce such sensitization. In vitro, IVIg down regulates T and B cell immune responses of HSDP (Yadin, SPR 1991) and Jordan has suggested that in vivo administration dramatically reduced anti-HLA ab in one HSDP (ASN, 1991) . In 3 HSDP we gave I'r 400 rng/kg once weekly for 4 weeks. One pt also underwent plasma exchange (PE) before each IVIg infusion. We then examined the effects on the HSDP's anti-class I HLA abs, as measured by the CDC panel reactive antibody (PRA) of the HSDP's sera after each infusion and at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the last infusion. With PE and IVlg there was no change in the PRA Of the undiluted sera, but at 1:4 and 1:16 dilutions the PRA decreased from 27-60%. In one of the pts who received IVIg only, the PRA declined 14-22% when sera were diluted 1:4. Both pts also had subtle decreases in the strength of discrete anti-class 1 HLA ab specificities (HLA A1 and A24). These effects were not long lasting: in both, PRA returned to baseline by 2 weeks after treatments. To explore the mechanism of this subtle effect, we examined the IVIg for anti-HLA class I anti-idiotypic (id) abs against 4 specificities in 10 experiments, A-11, A-24, A-26 and B-35, using the short anti-id CDC ab blocking assay. We found anti-id abs in 7 of the 10 experiments. We conclude that in HSDP, IVIg, either alone or with PE, had only a subtle effect in decreasing anti-HLA sensitization, perhaps mediated through anti-id. This effect is short lived, and to be successful either a different IVIg regimen and/or adjunctive immunosuppression may be necessary. In animal model Endothelin (Et) has an important role in the pathogenesis of ischemic acute renal failure and Cyclosporin induced nephrotoxicity. Recently, Et has been proposed as plasmatic marker of acute vascular rejection in kidney transplant. We investigated the immunohistochemical distribution of this peptide on renal biopsies of kidney transplant patients. In the last three months, 10 biopsies were analyzed: 8 out of tO were scheduled biopsies; the other two were performed during episodes of acute rejection. At the same time, Et plasma level and Et urinary excretion were evaluated using a standard radioimmunoassay method. In 4/10 biopsies, With no r~levant histopathological changes, only a weak Et staining of vascular endothelium was observed, as in normal kidney sections. In the other six biopsies a positivity of inflammatory cells <6/6), tubuli <4/6), and glomeruli (3/6) was revealed, according to the histological evidence of foci of inflammatory infiltrate, tubular changes and glomerular hypercellularity. Excluding one case of acute vascular rejection, the plasma level and urinary excretion of Endothelin were not significant different to the normal values of healthy .age matched subjects. Our preliminary results suggest that Et could be a local agent of renal damage in different pathological conditions. Its significance as sistemic marker to monitor the graft function and survival has to be further investigated. Growth retardation is a common problem in children with chronic renal failure (CRF). Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment has given increased height velocity in CRF children older than 3 years. If this treatment is also effective in younger children has, however, not previously been shown. In the present study two boys, 15 and 20 months old, with CRF (CIn 22 and 20 ml/min/1.73m 2, respectively; single injection of inulin~ from refluxnephropathy and cystic kidney dysplasia, respectively, were given rhGH (GenotropinR; 0.15 IU/kg/d s.c.). Both had been short (67 ca, -6SD; 77 cm, -3SD), but apparently well-nourished (8.6 kg, -2SD; 9.5 kg, -2.2SD), and it had not been possible to improve growth by normalization of the acidbase and calcium-phosphate balance, or by tube feeding. During the first 4 months of rhGH treatment good catch-ut) growth (9 cm=27 cm/yr; 7.3 cm=22 cm/yr) was seen, after which the patients tended to follow a new height channel (at 10 months: -2.2SD; -1.6SD). After 6 months the GFR (CI,) was unchanged (24 ml/ min/1.73m 2) in one of the patients }~ut had possfl~ly declined somewhat in the other (15 ml/min/1.73m2). A severe vomiting problem in one of the patients did not improve. Serum concentratio~ of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) were low (23/~g/1; 29/~g/1) before rhGH treatment and 12h serum profiles showed a single GH peak (max: 20 t~g/1; 8.5 /~g/1) and elevated levels of IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1; range: 89-169 t~g/1; 160-300 #g/l) inspite of high or normal insulin levels (range: 33-116 mUff; 15-28mU/1). After 3 months of rhGH treatment the IGF-1 levels were markedly increased (171 ~g/l; 205 ~g/1). The results encourage rhGH treatment also in uremic children below two years of age in order to achieve normal stature. HIV nephropathy (HIVN) is now considered as a distinct clinicopathologic entity, and evidence points currently to a direct implication of the HIV in HIVN. Proteinuria and azotemia are the more frequent biological symptoms, and mesangial hyperplasia, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis the predominant histological glomemlar lesions. Incidence of HIVN, defined by biological markers, has been reported to reach 57% in perinatally infected children (CHANDER et al. Kidney int 1989) . As since June 1987 all of the perinatally infected children followed in our institution are treated with antiretroviral agents as soon as the diagnosis is made -ie at least two plasma mononuclear cells culture positive for HIV -, the study of the incidence of HIVN in this population is of particular interest. We prospectively screened outpatient symptomatic (S) and asymptomatic (A) non febrile perinatally HW infected children for biological markers of glomerular abnormality. BUN and plasma creatinine (PCr) were measured in a discrete analyser (RAXT, Technicon); microalbuminuria was measured by nephelometry on a single morning urine sample, and results were expressed using urinary microalbumin (mg) / ereatinine (mmol.) ratio (U~A/Cr); GFR was estimated from PCr according to the Schwartz method; hematuria and proteinuria were checked by dipsticks. Results: 27 children aged 44 month on average (range 5-120) have now been studied (59% male, 55% black); 2 children were asymptomatic (A) and 25 were symptomatic (S). Among the S children, 7 had AIDS according to the 1989 CDC criteria, 16 had a CD4/CD8 ratio < i., 10 were positive for P24 antigenemia. All the dipsticks were negative for proteinuria and hematuria; mean BUN was 4 mmol./L (range: 1.8-6.5); GFR remained in the normal range for age: before 12 months of age, mean GFR was 55 mL/mn/1.73 m2 (range 50-60); between 12 and 24 months mean GFR was 98 mL/mn/1.73 m2 (range 82-112); after 24 months mean GFR was 115 mL/mn/1.73 m2 (range 88-163,); UgA/Cr was upon 3 in 4 patients among which 1 had AIDS. Conclusion: We observed minor biological markers of glomerular abnormality in this studied population of non hospitalized HIV infected children but no nephrotic syndrome nor chronic renal failure was found. Despite these results must be asserted by a larger sample, it raise the question of the role of an early antiretroviral therapy for the prevention of HIV nephropathy. The survival time of patients with CF has increased significantly in the last 10 years. This has caused new problems. A growing number Of our patients older than 15 years show severe renal complications like renal stone formation, immune complex nephritis or diabetic nephropathy. 3/26 patients (a~[ed 18,20 and 21 yrs.) had a hematuria due to calcium oxalate kidney stones. 7/14 patients had an urinary calcium excretion of more than 4 mg calcium/kg bodyweight/day. Stone formation can be explained by enteral hyperoxaluria due to fat malabsorption in CF. 2 patients (22 and 27 yrs.), suffering from chronic pulmonary infection (pseudomonas) had elevated serum levels of pseudomonas antibodies and IgA. Both developed purpura, arthritis, microhematuria und proteinuria of > 3g/d. While physical symptoms disappeared both hematuria and proteinuria persisted and serum IgA levels increased to 1500 mg/dl. There was a temporary decrease of creatinine clearance (62 ml/min/1,73m') in one of these patients. Kidney biopsy revealed severe IgA-nephropathy which could be explained by increased IgA production due to chronic pulmonary infection and diminuished liver clearance of immune complexes in CF.",

In such areas almost half the population has an important degree of proteinuria by the age of 40 years. The reason for this is obscure but preliminary studies suggest a high correlation between haematuria of glomerular origin in school children and chronic renal failure in adults. Beta-haemolytic streptococcal skin infections are extremely common in these communities with high anti-DNA'ase B titres in over 90% of the children. Outbreaks of acute post-streptoccocal nephritis (AGN) occur every few years. In a follow-up study of 48 children following a recent epidemic of AGN, 14/35 children had haematuria 14 months later. This was comparable however to the incidence in age-and sexmatched controls (13/30). This had fallen to 3/30 patients after three years follow-up. Histological lesions in aboriginal adults with chronic renal failure show an unusually high incidence of membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis, non-IgA mesangial disease, glomerulomegaly and diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Subepithelial humps are found in a number of different types of lesion suggesting a possible streptococcal aetiology. We are exploring the suggestion that chronic and/or frequent streptococcal infections in childhood, in conjunction with possible genetic and other environmental factors, may lead to a different type of immune response, and hence a different pattern of renal disease than that found in classical AGN. An impaired renal Isemodynamic ressonse to amino acid (AA) infusion has been reported as a poor prognostic factor ]n some chronic renal diseases ACE inhibitors decrease urinary protein excretion and it has been suggested that they might s]ow the progression of renal damage.

Barsotti*, Bambino Gesu Children's Research Hospital, ~-a Sapianza\" University, Rome 00100, ITALY Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (AT/N) can be due to infection, drugs ingestion and systemic diseases. We report the case of identical female twins who developed ATIN 1 year apart with identical clinical and histnlogleal picture. Cases: Case i, at 14 years of age, and Case 2 at 15 years, both showed pal/or, weight less (3-4 kg in 10-30 days). At admission: (Case 1 -Case 2): ESR: 120-112ram, serum creatinlne: 160-150 Izmol/1, Hb: 10.2-10.5 g/dl, serum protein: 8.4-8.8 g%, gamma globulin: 29-20%, lgA: 2260-2180 rug%, ANA positive (+ +) only in Case 1 A-DNA, A-histone and antleardiollpin antibodies negative in both; C3 and C4 were normal. Protenurla: 0.5-0.7 g/day; slight mlcrohematuria in both. HLA B W22,40,DR4,W6. Only Case 1 developed bilateral uveitis 3 months after the onset. In both sisters, history revealed the use of nimesulide (FANS) and eotrimoxazole respectively 3 months and 10 days before symptoms. Renal biopsies: Typical ATIN with eosinophilla; no glomerular lesions at light and electron microscopy and negative immtmofluorescenco (IF) staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C-B, Clq, fibrinugen. Kappa and lambda fight chains. Both sisters were treated with Prednlsone (lmg/kg/day, tapered off until 0.amg/kg/every other day). In Case 1 -therapy was started two months after the onset of the symptoms, while in Case 2 it was started immediately. Clinical and functional improvement was observed. Treatment was stopped after 1 year in case 1 & after 14 months in Case 2. Follow-up: After 15 months without therapy in Case 1 & 8 months in Case 2, GFR is 100 myra'/1.73 sqm and 110 ml/m'/1.73sqm respectively; both eases have negatiuve urinalysis. Comments: To out knowledge this is the first description of ATIN with familial occurrence as well as in twins. The poss/bi/ity of a SLE can be reasonably excluded beeanse of the absence of 4 erlteda of ARA, the absence of HLA DIL3 and the presence of isolated tubnlointerstitial lesions without glomerular abnormalities with negative IF staining. On the basis of our findings, it can be hypothesized that in our cases a genetic predisposition to ATIN exists, probably assodated with a drug hypersensitivity.

We evaluated in vitro action of different doses of 1.25D (0.01-1.0 riM) and CHL (0.1-30 ug/ml) on blood lymphocyte proliferation in 8 children with different morphological types of GN resistant to cytotoxic treatment. We fotmd that L25D has a dose dependent antiproliferative effect. Treatment of the cells with 1.2513 raised their anti-proliferative sensitivity to CHL in 7/8 children. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 20 children with GN, resistant to immtmo-suppressive treatment, who received CHL and I~OI-ID during 2-4 months lc~OI-ID, transformed in the fiver into 1.25\"D, was prescribed in the dose of 0.5-I.5 ug/day for the correction of hypocalcemla and osteoporosis.

The remission in the children with GN receiving 1.25I) and CHL was perhaps caused by synergistic actions of these drugs. Ten months (M) following allogenic or autologous BMT, 1/3 patients (pts) develop hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or isolated renal insufficiency with or without hypertension. Renal pathology is analogous to radiation nephritis and is attributed to preparatory radiation. We have performed BMT in 69(44M,25F)children;42(23M, 19F,ages 2-19yrs)survived >6 months. BMT was performed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (6),aplastic anemic (2),myelodysplasia (2), myelogenous leukemia-chronic (2),acute (1 ),neuroblastoma ( 1 ),and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome(l). Pre-BMT conditioning included cytosine arabinoside,cyclophosphamide, methyl prednisone and total body irradiation 1400 r 9 fractions. Busulfan 4mg/kg/d x2 was used in 8/15 pts. Bone marrow donors were either family members (7)or unrelated (8) . All marrows were T-cell depleted using a CD3 antibody. Supportive therapies included cyclosporin A (stopped by day 180), Acyclovir,Trimethoprim sulfa,IV gamma globulin and CMV negative blood products. All pts engrafted. Graft-vs-host disease was < grade 2. Renal involvement occurred in 15/42(10M,5F)and was characterized by hematuria,proteinuria, hypertension,rising BUN, creatinine and reduced GFR in 13/15 pts. 6 pts had HUS-like syndrome 8M after BMT. 7 had isolated renal insufficiency(RI). 2/15 pts without clinical renal involvement developed lymphoproliferative renal infiltration (LP) on tissue examination. 4 pts(2 HUS,2LP)died. Renal functions improved in 4(2 HUS,2 RI);stable in 7. Conctusions:l)Long term renal toxicity is an added complication of partially matched BMT occurring in 1/3 of the pts manifesting as HUS or isolated renal insufficiency. 2)Preparatory radiation is the most likely etiology of HUS-like syndrome while cyclosporin may contribute to renal insufficiency. 3)Improvement in renal functions occurs in 1/3 of pts. Clin/cat features and natural course of acute TINU syndrome in 5 adolescent pts (3 female, 2 male) are presented. Initial non-specific symptoms proceeding nephropathy by 3-4 weeks were anorexia and weight loss ha all, fever and malaise ha 3, abdominal, flank & joint pain ha one pt each. Except for pallor, no further clinical abnormalities were found. Inflammatory syndrome consisted of markedly increased ESR in all 5, high plasma proteins and gamma globulins in 4 pts. Urinalysis showed moderate proteinuria, sterile leucocyturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria and isostheunria in all except for aminoaciduria ha 1 pt. Plasma creatinine was increased in all.

Jaundice and hepatomegaly were not present but liver enzymes were moderately increased. Hemoperfusion was performed 16 and 40 hours after ingestion respectively along with conservative therapy. Alfa amanitin was demonstrated by thin layer chromatography before and after the first hemoperfusion session but was not detected after the second. Liver enzymes showed marked increase for two days after hemoperfusion but later decreased and returned to normal levels on the 28 m day. A cousin of our patients who also had ingested Amanita but refused hospitalisation and therapy succumbed. We believe that hemoperfusion is life saving in Amanita poisoning besides conservative therapy. It has been suggested that in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), streptococcal neurominidase may remove sialle acid from some normal plasma or tissue components, thus rendering it antigenic. We investigated serum and urine free static acid levels, using thiobarbituric acid method, in 30 patientS with APSGN. Initially, free slafic acid levels were found to be significantly elevated in the sera of patients with APSGN (75.0 ~ 21.0pgr/ml). Serial determinations in 30 patients indicated that free sialic acid levels decreased with time, usually returning to normal levels after 12 weeks. Control subjects were 20 healthy children and 10 patients with chronic renal failure. Determinations in patient~ chronic renal failure were found to higher (14.3 $1.05pgr/ml) than the control group (p<ll.05). This level was significanty lower than those of APSGN patients (p<0.05). In our study, negative correlations could be found between serum h-ee sialic acid and C3 levels. Urinary siaile acid levels were no~ related to serum levels and were not markedly different in patient~ and control subjects. We conclude that neurominidase activity and antiglobuUn forma tion may be a central factor in the pathogenesis of APSGN, but we think that further studies, including other renal diseases, will help to define whether this phenomen is specific for APSGN or not. Complement is considered to be one of the factors contributing to the severity and progression of IgA nephrathy. Immunofluorescent studies in IgA nephropathy have shown the presence of MAC neoantigen or polymerized C9 in glomerular immune deposits. Since S-protein is invariably colocalized with C5b-9 deposition, it is questionable whether the MAC found in human nephritic tissues is physiologically active. Investigation of the combination of an inherited terminal complement deficiency and glomerulonephritis in a single patient could elucidate the pathogenetic role of MAC.",

These findings characterize adults with IOAN and are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of this nephropathy. Our multiconter collaborative study was devoted to investigate the relevance of these serologic abnomalitias in children affected by I~N. Seventy-seven children were studied., in 43 of them a diagnosis of IgAN was made on prevalent IgA meeangial deposits; 19 represented the control disease group (CD), including other biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis or unbiopsed idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; 15 children had a past history of urological problems without any immunological disease (U).

Beta 2-microglobulin levels were measured with an ELISA in single voided urines from 859 boys and 840 girls. Their logarithm-transformed frequency distribution was skewed with a right side tailing. The upper limit of the 98% confidence interval was 660 ~tg/1 in the boys and 690 ~tg/1 in the girls. There was no significant sex-related difference. Adjustment by specific gravity was attempted but found dispensable. Of the 1699 children screened, 11 had levels above the upper limit of the 98% confidence interval. Fanally, 2 children(a boy and a girl)proved to have renal disease. Their beta 2microglobulin levels were 10,000 ktgll and 2,000 pg/1. On further examination the boy had mixed-type proteinuria and the girl unilateral renal agenesis associated with chronic renal failure. In practice, 600 ~tg/1 would serve as an actual cut-off level for both sexes with safety. We studied in vitro binding of secretory IgA1 to the glomeruli of 16 patients with IgA nephropathy. The secretory IgA1 was purified from human milk and saliva. Part of frozen sections of renal biopsy specimens were immersed overnignt at 4~ in 0.02M citrate buffer, pH 3.2. Secretory IgA1 of 1 mg/ml was applied to the non-treated or acidtreated sections. The secretory IgA1 bound to the glomeruli was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human secretory component (SC)and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antisera. Similarly, glomerular IgA and SC were examined in the nontreated or acid -treated sections by immunofluorescence. Acid treatment abolished IgA immunofluorescence in only 2 patients, whereas in 11 patients IgA fluorescence did not completely disappear, and in 3 unchanged. Glomerular SC was detected in none of the sections examined, irrespective of acid treatment. Secretory IgA1 from milk was bound to the non-treated glomeruli in 14 patients including 4 with faint binding, and faintly bound to the acid-treated glomeruli in only 2. That from saliva was faintly bound to the non-treated glomemli in 6 patients, and bound to the acid-trated glomemli in none of the 16 patients studied. The results suggest that there is heterogeneity in the elution of glomerular IgA by acid and that exogenous antigens are present in the glomeruli in some of patients with IgA nephorpathy. Although the causes of SMAS and NP (left renal vein entrapment) are considered structually to be the same, simultaneous presentation of these two conditons are not well recognized.

In our study, 41 patients (47.6%) with renal involvement out of 86 patients, diagnosed as HSP between January 1990 -January 1992 were included. Patients' ages varied from 4 to 14 and the mean age was 9,8. Female/. Male ratio was 19/22. Of the patients with renal involvement, 12 (29%) had mlcroseopie bematuria alone, 17 (41%) had hematuria plus proteinuria, 3 (7%) had nephritic syndrome & 9 (21%) had nephritis/nephrotie syndrome, the mean durattlon of follow-up of the 9 patieents with nephritis/nephrofie syndrome symptoms was 9 months (3-22 months) . In group of nephrltie/ nephrotle syndrome, 4 had renal biopsy. There was endo and extracapillury glomerulonephrltis (RPGN) in 2 patients, and focal neo'otiT]ng glomorulonephritis and mesenglal proliferation in 1 patient, and focal selerosing glomerulonephritls in 1 patient. All specimens showed mesengial IgA deposition on immunofluoreseent microscopic studies. Two patients with biopsy,confirmed severe crescentic glomerulonephritis and another 2 patients who fulfilled the clinical and bioehemieal criteria of RPGN were ~dmlni~tered methyl prednisolone pulse therapy & cyelophosphamlde plus dipyridamole. In 4 patients with RPGN, before treatment BUN and ereatinine levels were high (respectively 41-88, 1,5 -3 mg/dl) but decreasing to normal ranges within 3 months. Along with this, in 1 patient, urinalysis showed normal findings after 7 months. This study provides further evidence that pulse treatment in HSN presenting with RPGN may be beneficial. T, a sulfur amino acid, is an antioxidant that protects cells against oxygen free radical injury. The kidney regulates body T balance by modulating proximal reabsorption in response to altered dietary intake. There is no information about T localization in normal or diseased kidneys. Therefore, using an antibody to a taurine-glutaraldehyde-BSA conjugate, we determined T distribution in renal tissue. Normal rats (n=4), those with diabetes induced by the I.V. injection of streptozocin (STZ)(n=8), chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy (PAMN), bilateral ureteral ligation for 48 h (n=3) and 5/6 nephrectomy for ~ weeks (n=4), were studied. Normal renal tissue displayed moderate T staining in medullary tubules with minimal amounts in glomeruli and proximal tubules. STZ-diabetes and PAMN induced an increased intensity of T staining in all structures, especially medullary tubules; these changes were more prominent in diabetic rats. In STZ-diabetic rats, there was also enhanced staining of glomeruli and proximal tubules. The immunohistochemieal changes in rats with diabetic nephropathy and PAMNwere exaggerated in rats given i% T drinking waters. The models of acute and chronic renal failure did not affect renal distribution of T. The immunohistochemical studies correlated with the protective effect of T in the various disease states, i.e. T attenuated the severity of the renal structural and functional damage in rats with STZ-diabetes and PAMN in association with increased tissue staining for T. These results suggest that T is preferentially localized to medullary regions of the kidney where it protects against oxidant injury in selective disease states. Elevated rates of UAE appear to predict diabetic nephropathy in adult diabetics although the actual \"pathological\" cut-off has been derived retrospectively. In children the UAE rate may exceed control values yet not reach this predictive level of nephropathy. In healthy children a weak, positive correlation between age and UAE is apparent. To examine this relationship more closely, a single overnight urine sample was obtained from 888 healthy children aged 5 to 17 years (420 females, 468 males).",

UAE was expressed as an excretion rate and as an alb/creat ratio, and analysed as log transformed data. Each yearly age group was compared to every other using a \"t\" test. This analysis revealed a mgnificant increase in UAE at 7-9 years in girls, and at 8-10 years in boys that was not seen at any other age. When expressed as an alb/creat ratio UAE did not increase. The abrupt increase in UAE that we have described coincides with the age of adrenarche and the associated BP increase seen in normal children. As serum albumen concentration and tubular reabsorption of protein do not change during this period, it might reflect an effect of increased adrenal androgen concentrations upon haemodynamic or sieving characteristics of glomerular filtration of albumen. In this study we want to compare the usual method for localisation of the site of hematuria, the microscopial demonstration of the number of dysmorphic erythrocytcs, with a new immunochemical method. The immunocytochemical slaining method to discriminate renal from non-renal hematuria, reported by Abrass and Laird for fresh urine (Am.J. Kidney Dis. 9, [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] 1987) was adapted. Erythrocytcs in hematuria of renal origin are coated with Tamm-Horsfall protein, in contrast to those in hematuria of non-renal origin. Following fixation on slides by ac~ton, erythrocytes in urine were stained using antiserum against Tamm-Horsfall protein. Reactions were visualised by a biotinylated second antibody, avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase, producing an insoluble reaction product. In urine from kidney transplantation patients collected from the catheter localised in the pelvis 84.7% of the erythroyetcs stained by the immunoperoxidase method whereas in urine collected from the catheter localiscd in the bladder 13.1% of the erythrocytes were stained. In a group of patients with proven renal hematuria the number of dysmorphic erythrocytes were 69. 8 \u2022 26.7% (n=32) , by the immunoperoxidase method 89.8 -+ 7.6% were stained. For samples of non-renal hematuria the number of dysmorphic erythrocytca was 15.8 _+ 12.9% (n=20) and by the immunoperoxidase method 12.4 _+ 10.5% were stained. Immunochemical staining resulted in sharper discrimination of renal and non-renal hematuria than inspection of the morphology of erythrocytes in urine. Moreover the analysis of the urine after f~xation can be postponed. Four patients with nephropathy and male pseudohermophroditism, including a pair of identical twine, were studied. All patients had female external genitalia, one with mild hypertrophy of clitoris, but showed a 46XY karyotype. Nephropathy was discovered by chance proteinuria in all patients.",

In order to evaluate the morphologir changes induced by CSA in 17 patients (pts) who underwent HTx, we performed renal biopsies (RB) 5 to 12 months (m : 7.5) after HTx. Nine pts were less than 2 years of age and 8 were aged 2 to 13 years. All pts received oral CSA and azathioprine and steroids were given for several months in l0 pts. The morphologic changes observed on RB were classified according to the severity of tubulo-imarstitial (Tt) damage. Grade 0 was considered when there were no significant change of the renal parenchyme (5 pts). Grade I was diagnosed when a few scattered tubules with thickened basement membranes were present (7 pts). Grade II was diagnosed when biopsy showed several feel of atrophic tubules with thickened basement membranes within stripes of interstitial fibrosis (3 pts) and Grade llI when confluent or extensive areas of interstitial fibrosis with atrophic and/or collapsed tubules were observed (2 pts Our results show that TI lesions likely related to CSA may occur as early as 6 months post HTx and that, after a comparable duration of treatment, the morphologic changes may be very variable. There is apparently a relationship between the severity of TI damage and CSA dosage since pts with grades 0 and [ received lass CSA than pts with grades H and Ill. However, 1 pt with grade I received a mean dose of 748 malta 2 for 6 months, whereas 1 pt with grade Ill received 205 mg/m 2 also for 6 months. The same holds true for GFR and concenUating ability which was lower in pts with grades II and Ill as compared to pts with grades 0 and L However, GFR was decreased in 2 pts with grade I, whereas it wa~ normal in 1 pt with grade IIL At latest examination, with a mean follow-up of 3 years (range 1 l]12 yr -5 1/12 yr), none of the ctfildren had reached ESRF, but 8 pts had a decreased GFR : 1 with grade 0, 3 with grade I, 2 with grade I1 and the 2 patients with grade III. The continuation of CSA trea~nont after RB might explain these ]ong term results. Due to high risk of hepatic carcinoma the treatment of choice in tyrosinemia is early liver transplantation (Tx). However, multiple renal stones and severely impaired renal function have been reported before 1 year of age, Combined liver and renal transplantations have been made. As the enzyme -defect persists in the kidneys after liver transplantation the long term prognosis of renal function is of importance. We report renal function and histology in 6 patients with tyrssinemia 7 to 28 months (mean 19.5 months) after liver transplantation.",

Of 594 patients with FMF aged 3-14 yrs under our care, 81 (13.6 ~) developed amyloid nephropathy (AN). The aim of the study was to evaluate parameters that would help to identify patients at risk of developing AN. For this purpose, 37 different parameters were studied by stepwise diseriminant analysis (BMDP) in the families of 85 patients with FMF. Of these, 41 had no AN, 29 had proteinuria and 15 had chronic renal failure. Results: The combination of the following parameters was found to discriminate best between the ] subgroups: Presence or absence of pancreatic involvement, paternal age (at birth of patient), sedimentation rate and intracellular (leucoeytic) alkaline phosphatase, myeloperoxidase and suecinatedehydrogenase out of attack. Linear discriminaot factors For the 3 subgroups of patients were constructed. Percent correct classification was 80 % in subgroups 1 (no AN) and 3 (renal failure), and 30 Z in subgroup 2 (proteinuria). Conclusion: Diaeriminant analysis allows to identify patients at high risk of developing AN. These are primary candidates for therapeutic trials to prevent AN. There are many causes of the nephrotic syndrome {NS). In children, minimal change is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome beyond the first year of life. Although it is still unclear whether FSGS is part of the spectrum of minimal change NS or a distinct entity, it is clear that there are idiopathic, exogenously induce and familial forms of FSGS. A recessive mode of transmission has been described in patients with FSGS and there are a few reports of apparently dominant transmission of FSGS.",

Mitochondrial myopathy is a multisystemic disorder mainly involving skeletal muscle and the central nervous system but rarely cardiac muscle or the kidneys. We report three cases of this disease with renal involvement. Case 1 -aged 16 months -developed failure to thrive, mental retardation, and tremor.with a severe metabolic acidosis, like in Leigh disease. She had renal tubular dysfunction including : proximal renal tubular acidosis, hypercalciuria and excessive excretion of potassium. Biochemical investigations of the muscle biopsy revealed a defect of the complex IV of the respiratory chain. Cases 2 and 3 -both aged 6 years -developed a Kearns -Sayre syndrome with diabetes mellitus (cases 2 and 3) and pancreatic insufficiency (case 3). Renal defect associated in both cases renal tubular acidosis, phosphaturia, aminoaciduria, glucosuria, hypercalciuria and isosthenuria mimicking de Toni Debre Fanconi syndrome.

Two models are used. The ligation model results in an early, severe hypertension (HT), which is unsensitive to sodium (Na) diet, sensitive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI), and is associated with low PRA, but high RR. The excision model causes much milder and later HT, which is sensitive to Na diet, and unsensitive to ACEI unless dietary Na is moderately reduced (from 0.50 to 0.25%) as shown on a previous work. There are no data on PRA and RR. The aim of the study was to evaluate renin changes in the last model. Sham-operated rats (S) and uremic rats (U) (excision of 70% renal mass) received a 0.50% Na diet (SNa \u00a7 UNa +) or a 0.25% Na diet (SNa-, UNa-). At week 6, blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail-cuff method. PRA was measured by RIA of Ag I using the human antibody trapping method. RR was estimated by immunofluorescence as the number of renin positive juxtaglomeralar apparatus (JGA) per 100 glomemli. PRA and RR were lower in U compared to S rats. Both were enhanced by Na reduction in the two conditions, but even under stimulation they remained lower in U rats. Conversely to the ligation model, RR was low in U rats and was detected in JGA and not in glomeruli.",

These data may help in understanding the different HT characteristics in the two models and hence in its mechanism. Glomerulosclerosis is a major feature in many kinds of progressive glcmerular injury leading to renal dysfunction in men. Similarly in experimental animals a variety of glomerulosclerosis were reported previously but in them mesangial matrix expansion is hardly observed. An injection of anti-Thy I antibody(ATS) induces mesanial matrix increase but it spontaneously resolves. To elucidate i~T~tnologically mediated glomerulosclerosis, we induced a model of chronic mesangial cell injury in the rat with repeated injections of ATS. ATS was raised in rabbits by in~unization with fresh thymus cells from infant rats. An intravenous injection of ATS was repeated in a week interval in 20 Lewis rats. The rats were sacrificed at 2,3,4, and 6 weeks after induction of glomerulonephritis. Light microscopy revealed mild hypercellularity(macrophage/mesangial cells) and increase of mesangial matirx at 2 and 3 weeks. A progressive increase in mesangial matrix with diffuse glomerulosclerosis was observed at 4 and 6 weeks. Serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels increased in rats with glomerulosclerosis. Electron microscopy of rats at 6 weeks d~nonstrated a prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum in the mesangial cells and collagenous fibrills in the meangial matrix. Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed increase in type IV collagen and laminin staining in the mesangial matrix. Our findings suggested that repeated inmunologic injury to the mesangial cells results in the accumulation of extracellular matrix due to mesangial cell dysfunction and the development of glomerulosclerosis. Acute normocapnic hypoxemia is associated with a significant fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF). The role of angiotensin II and intrarenal adenosine in the pathogenesis of the hypoxemia-induced renal changes is still controversial. Experiments were thus performed in 29 pentobarbital-anesthefized mechanically-ventilated rabbits made acutely hypoxemic. GFR and RBF were assessed by the clearance of inulin and PAH, respectively. Each animal acted as its own control. Group 1: in 8 control rabbits, acute hypoxemia significantly decreased GFR (-16_+3%), RBF (-12+3%) and filtration fraction (FF) (-4_+2%), while the renal vascular resistance (RVR) increased by 17_+4%. These changes suggest preglomerular vasoconstriction and postglomerular vasodilatation. Group 2: in 7 rabbits, the iv injection of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, perindoprilat (20 mg/kg) increased RBF (+18+4%) and decreased RVR (-14_+3%) without changing GFR.",

These results, as well as the decrease in FF (-18_+2%), suggest that hypoxemia vasodilates the afferent and the efferent vessels when angiotensin II formation is inhibited. The role of intrarenal adenosine, a second putative mediator of the hypoxemiainduced renal changes, was further assessed in 7 hypoxemic animals (Group 4) pretreated with perindoprilat and theophylline, an antagonist of adenosine.

Thi's group po~%ulated that PI positivity may be protective (toxin bot~nd to \u1ebd but latter not d~ed because not synthesizing protein), and PI negativity a risk renter in HUS (increased toxin hotrod to vulnerable nucleated endothelial cells). We therefore investigated HUS patients (= 21) for P1 status end whether this affected renal fenction outcome if follcmed for at least 6 nmnths, and groups of blank African = 36 and caucasian : 41 paediatric renal patients without HUS, and adult blood donors : bleck = 197 and caucasian = 157. In both the blood donors and r~ paed. renal patients, the blanks have significantly greater Pla positivity, which may be a factor in protecting them from HWS. This may occur with the erytkLroczrte bound toxin being cleared in the reticule-endothelial system. Other possible factors such as differing HIA antigens and verocytetoxin antibodies were not addressed in this study. Changes in erythrocyte lipid peroxidation (measured as the concentration of malonyl dialdehyde, MDA), glutathione (GSH) metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase, l;P-ase; catalase and superoxide dysmutase SOD), haemoglobin (Hb) metabolites (met Hb, carboxy Hb COHb), the in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide induced haemolysis (acetylphenylhydrazine APH test) were studied in six children with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) (age 6.7+4.1 years ~+SO) and six age-and sex--matched contr#is. The level of MDA was significantly higher and eatalase activity was lower in the whole blood haemolysates than in the controls (p-' 0.05). SO0 and OR-ass activity were normal. Oxidized GSH (GSSG) concentration was significantly higher in the patients than in the controls (26. 2!4.2-, 10 .9~1.8 nM/g Hb respectively). The percentages of earboxy Hb and met Hb were higher also in HUS (5.2+ 0.2-, 2.8!0.3%) than in the controls (p< 0.01) GSH-stability was lower. Incubation of ROCs for 1 h with APH induced a more pronounced decrease in the concentration of GSH (p,L O.OOl), and an increase in oxidized products of Hb, met Hb and haemichrome (p/ O.OOl), but only in HUS patients. We also observed that these results returned to normal after clinical recovery. Oxidative damage has an important role in the pathogenesis of HUS. Gubler et al [Ann P6diatr (Paris) 1990, 37 : 78-82] . We report a patient with similar findings. Parents were healthy and were apparently not cousins. Family history was marked by a severe jaundice and neonatal death of their first two children. The third child had severe jaundice due to an hemolytic syndrome and was treated with 4 exchange-transfusions in the first 6 days of life. Microscopic hematuria and Transient mild renal failure were observed during this p6riod. Between the age of 4 to 10 years, he was followed in an outpatient clinic for splenomegaly, chronic hemolytic anemia and thrombopenia. Hematological investigation failed to find the cause of hemolysis but fragmented erythrocytes were observed. He developed proteinuria at the age of 8, mild hypertension at 9, and chronic renal failure at 1O years. Renal biopsy, performed at 10 years, showed thickened and split capillary walls. Hemodialysis was performed from the age of t4. The onset of dialysis was marked by uncontrolled hypertension, severe attacks of thrombopenia and hemolytic anemia necessitating blood transfusion in spite of erythropoietin injections. Bilateral nephrectomy, performed 2 months after the onset of dialysis, resulted in a stable level of hemoglobin, normal platelet count, disappearance of fragmented circulating erythrocytes and normal blood pressure without any antihypertensive drugs. Electron microscopic study of a renal fragment stained with phosphotungstic acid disclosed numerous bundles of interstitial collagen fibrils in the mesangial matrix and the glomerular basement membrane as described in the Nail-Patella syndrome nephropathy. This boy had unilateral lobster claw in place of the left hand. Bilateral patella were in normal place and he had no fingernails dysplasia, no iliac horns and no webbing at the elbow joints.",

Acute renal failure (ARF) in infancy and childhood is associated with a mortality ranging from 11% to 61% in various series. This study aimed at analyzing the factors that affected the outcome of 46 children with ARF, presenting over a 5 year period te the Department of Paediatrics, NUS. There were 32 boys and 14 gifts, with ages ranging from 0-18 years (mean 4.6 + 4.6 years). Mortality in this series was 41.3%. Causes of ARF included acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (58.7%), glomer-nephritis (32.6%), obstractive uropathy (6.5%) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (2.2%). A multivariate discriminant analysis considering mortality as a dependent variable was performed with the following variables: sex, race, age, aetiology, oliguria, hypotension, fits, blood urea, serum creatinine, disseminated intravaseular coagulopathy (DIVC), assisted ventilation (VENT) and need for dialysis.

            "text": "We conclude that person-to-person spread of enteric pathogens is an important factor for an individual child's risk of developing HUS. In order to avoid underestimating the true importance of food risk factors for HUS, this study emphasizes the need to assess the food exposure history of the index case of gastroenteritis within a family. ACE inhibitors have been considered usefull to decrease progression in chronic renal failure. We evaluated enalapril treatment in 25 patients (16 girls and 9 boys) with persistent proteinuria after a HUS with severe acute renal failure, at a mean age of 16.4 months (r: 5 -70). Renal sonogra phy in 19 children showed in fifteen, abnormal parench~al structure and, or decreased renal size. All patients were followed during 22.5 months (r : 5 -70) with controlled protein intake for RDA and sodium dietary restriction. Later with the same dietary conditions and enalapril therapy (0.18 mg/kg/daily, r: 0.08 -0.40) during 20.62 months (r: 4 -60). Proteinuri~ decreased from 65.55 + 10.8 to 10.15 + 2.2 mg/m2/ hour (mean + 5EH) (P< 0.001) aft~ enalapril treatment while creatinine ~learance was 80.04 + 5.IB before and 87.9 + 5.68 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 after medication. This average fa~of protein urinary excretion was 79.95% ( r: 28 -100 ). Conclusions: I) Enalapril therapy associated with controlled protein intake for RDA and mild sodium dietary restriction has been useful in decreasing proteinuria excretion; 2) Renal function measured by creatinine clearance was preserved during the period of treatment. PMNLs are implicated in the pathogenesis of D+ HUS. At presentation the PMNL count is elevated and high values predict poor outcome. PMNL activation is reflected by raised al-antitrysin (aI-AT) bound elastase. We investigated possible mechanisms of activation by measuring cytokines IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor u (TNF u) plus anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). TNF u levels were raised in 1 of 16 D+ HUB children but in no patients were ANCA detected. Serum IL-8 levels were significantly elevated in D+ n=25; n=9; p<0.05 ); compared with controls 10.7 (5.4-19, n=17) (geometric mean pg/ml, observed range). Children with elevated PMNL counts due to other causes also had raised n=15; p<O.001 ), but in renal failure levels were only slightly increased: 15.1 (1-130, n=10; p<0.05) . In D+ HUS serum IL-8 levels at presentation correlated with the PMNL count (r=0.73, p<0.001) and the three highest counts were seen in children who died in the acute phase. IL-8 levels returned to normal within 48-72hr of admission before the PMNL count fell. The data suggest that in D+ HUS PMNLs are recruited by IL-8 and that serum IL-8 levels predict disease severity, Between 1980 and 1991 136 patients with D+ HUS were admitted to the HSC,GOS, 19 (14%) of whom had central nervous system involvement. There were i0 M and 9 F, with a median age of 2.5 yr; range i-ii.i, and median polymorphonuclear leucocyte count at presentation of 23.3 xlog/l; range 9.6-45.3. 14 had convulsions, 12 were ventilated and all required dialysis for renal failure. 13 were treated with plasma exchange receiving a median of 6 plasma volume x 2exchanges (range 1-13) and I0 received a prostacyclin infusion (3-15 ng/kg/min). Eieetroencephalograms (EEGs) were performed on 16 and all were abnormal with changes consistent with encephalopathy. 12 had CT brain scans; 5 of which were reported as normal, 5 showed signs of cerebral oedema and 2 evidence of cerebral infarction. 6 also had single photon emission computerised tomograms (SPECT) of the brain using HMPAO labelled to technetium ; 2 studies were reported as normal, 3 showed areas of reduced cerebral perfusion and 1 was a technical failure. 8 of 19 (42%) patients died, 6 with cerebral and gastrointestinal complications and 2 with severe pseudomembranous ischaemic proctocolitis.",

We note that Case 2 had a single sibling who died in the perinatal period with external features of Potter's Syndrome. Postmortem revealed hypoplastic lungs but normal kidneys. The regulation of glomerular filtration rate in the newborn is critically dependent upon efferent arteriolar tone. We hypothesize that these two infants with structurally nor~nal kidneys developed renal failure as a result of primary disturbances of renal vascular sutoregulation involving the RAS. Lipid peroxldation in blood plasma, which plays a role in the pathngenesls of HUS and c~-toceferol plasma concentration, was studied in various studies of HUS. The acute period of discase is marked by an increased malonildialdehyde (IVIDA) level. Its level decreased after hcmodialysis, but was still much higher than the norm. The high level of MDA was preserved even after recovery. In the course of a long follow-up, this index returned to normal, but in cases with proteinurla it remained very high. The concentration of lipid pero~dation intermediate products also underwent certain changes. The increase of dien conjugate was espedally marked during all observation periods. As it was mentioned in other publications, the concentration of vitamin E in blood plasma decreases. At the same time our observations show that during an acute period of disease (before treatment) this level i~ increased and is especialiy high in severe forms of the disease. In a dynamic phase during treatment its concentration decreased below the norm. In the course of long term follow-up, we have noticed authentically increased vitamin E levels in the plasma (which correlated with an increased level of MDA).",

Marked TI infiltration by CD4 + lymphoeytes and diffuse TI fibrosis were the salient features at week 8 and 16 in ADR rats,which also_~resented a 50~ reduction of GFR ( Tubulo-Interstitial (TI) fibrosis is the hallmark of many human and experimental nephropathies being also strictly correlated with declining GFR. We used immunofluorescence to characterize the composition of extracellular matrix in experimental TI fibrosis;in situ hybridization and studies with cells in culture were utilized for defining the cell origin of extracellular matrix proteins. Experimental TI fibrosis was induced in 9 Sprague Dawley rats by 2 adriamycin(ADR)doses,which were sacrificed after 4 months when they had developed renal insufficiency (Iothalamate CI. reduced by 50%). At this time all ADR rats presented marked TI infiltration by CD4 + lymphocytes and diffuse fibrosis which was positive to anti-col III and anti-col V antibodies while col I and col IV were absent. In situ hybridization employing a 27 bp oligonucleotide specific for the 5' UTR region of ~oi III confirmed the diffuese deposition of col IIl within the tubulo-interstitium and excluded any direct participation of tubular epithelial cells in the formation of these deposits. Further studies were then performed with cultured cells in vitro to exclude the origin of sol llI from epithelial cells. In such conditions renal fibroblasts but not tubular epithelia were stimulated to synthesize collagen (+40% SH proline incorporation) by conditioned media obtained from rats with severe TI fibrosis. We conclude that col IIl is the major component of TI deposits in ADR experimental fibrosis. Interstitial fibroblasts but not tubular epithelial cells represent the site of synthesis of col III,and are responsible for TI fibrosis. Further studies on the regulation of col III synthesis by renal fibroblasts are essential to understand the mechanisms responsible of TI fibrosis in experimental models of the disease. ",

During intravenous glucose tolerance tests, the K values (slope of log serum glucose decay curve) were lower in patients (i.01 \u2022 0.i0) before treatment than controls (1.65 i 0.15; P < 0.02).

Insulin sensitivity increased by 46% (P < 0.01) in patients following EPO therapy to 10.04 \u2022 1.04 (not different from controls). Thus following correction of anemia and amelioration of iron overload by EPO therapy, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were reversed in hemodialysis patients. Eight children (mean age 12.2 yrs) being on regular dialysis (7 HD, 1 CAPD) were treated by recombinant human erythropoietin (Eprex R, Cilag AG) iv. or sc. 2-3 times a week. All patients were strongly transfusion-dependent. The initial dose of 160 U/kg/week was gradually increased to 400 U/kg/weekduring the first six weeks. The haematocrit level (Htc) rose from O. 18 to 0.33 (target Htc) by the 10-12. weeks. A dose of 250-300 U/kg/week was required to maintain the target Htc. Since the third week of Eprex a treatment no further blood transfusions were necessary. At the third month of treatmnet a close linear correlation could be observed between the Eprex R dosage and the reticulocyte (Rtc) count (r=0.88), while the Htc level failed to show a similar correlation. Consequently the Rtc count revailed to be a more sensible indicator of the actual dosage of erythropoietin than the Htc. None of the main potential hazards (seisures, hypertensive encephalopathy, clotting problems) occured during the t{eatment. The Iong-lierm efficacy of hemodialysis characterized by the mean serum creatinine remained unchanged. Several allergic reactions could be noticed as side effects: frequent eosinophiIia and one case of \"flu-like\" syndrome, All of our treated patients have shown-,a substantial improvement in the quality of life with increased appetite, body-weight and physical activity. The only child having a very high level of cytotoxic antibodies (95%) presented a considerable fall to 20% within 14 month of treatment, According to this data treatment with Eprex R is a safe and effective therapy of the anaemia of children with chronic renal failure on regular dialysis. The long-term (5-24 me, mean 15 mo) safety and efficacy of rhEPO in the treatment of the anemia of CRF was prospectively studied in 34 children (age:0.2-17.5 yr). 12 patients (pt) were on hemodialysis (HD), 14 pt were on chronic cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and 8 were predialysis (Pre-D) with CRCI-25\u2022 ml/min/l.73 m 2, Therapy was initiated with 50 U/kg once a week and adjusted according to response. was achieved by week 8 in CCPD and pre-D (SC route, 2X/wk) and by 14 weeks in HD (IV route, 3X/wk). Transfusion (Tx) requirements decreased from 1.2 and 0.75 tx/pt-m 0 prior to rhEPO to 0.12 and 0 tx/pt-mo in HD and CCPD, respectively. Ferritin levels decreased by 75% in II patients with iron overload. 6 patients (2 CCPD and 4 HD) required intravenous iron administration to elicit a hemopoietic response. Circulating lymphocytotoxic antibodies decreased by 45% in 8 pt with high titers; two pts were successfully transplanted. The incidence of clotted A-V accesses was 0.21/ pt-mo with rhEPO (vs 0.08 prior to rhEPO, p<O.05). There was no change in the freq-uency of hyperkalemic, hypertensive or epileptic episodes. None of the pt developed de novo hypertension. 2 pre-D pt started dialysis @ 12 and 48 wks of treatment. There was no significant change in caloric intake or cardiac function. Response to rhEP0 was affected by infection (r=-0.542, p<0.02), Fe deficiency (r=0.763, p<0.01) and PTH levels (r=-0.879. p<0.001). We conclude that rhEP0 is a safe and efficacious alternative to frequent transfusions in children, with resultant decrease in hypersensitization rates and consequent successful transplantation.",

Although short-term studies of adult predialysis patients treated by EPO showed a stable GFR it is unknown if in the long-run renal function deteriorates faster than expected. We have treated 11 anemic children with PRF aged 0.6-17.2 years (Hb 6.3-9.3 g/dl, serum creatinine=SCR 1.1-7.7 , mean 4.4 mg/dl) by subcutaneous erythropoietin (ClLAG) given once per week for periods of 11-95 (mean 56) weeks (in 6 pts up to end stage). Hematologic parameters, SCR and growth were regularly checked. After a correction dose of 150 U/kg/wk Hb increased by 2 g/dl in 2-8 (mean 6.6) wks except in one child who was severely iron deficient. The Hb target level of 11.5-13.5 g/dl was reached in 18-203 days and was maintained by dose adaptation. At last observation mean maintenance dose was 130 (80-300) u]kg/wk and mean SCR 6.5 mg]dl. Serum ferriUn levels declined in all pts despite iron supplementation. Blood pressure increased in 3 pts by >20 mmHg and antihypertensive medication was intensified in 4 pts whilst 6 needed no antihypertensive drugs. The change of renal function was assessed by serial SCR measurements in 7 children followed for > 300 days before and after start of EPO. The slope of the regression line of 1/SCR values did not change significantly (p < 0.75). One child (SCR 5.4 mg/dl at start of EPO) developed severe hypertension and deteriorated rapidly reaching ESRD after 5 mos. Mean SDS score of body height did not change significantly after EPO The best timing of rhEPO application is still under debate up to now. To elucidate whether a s.c. treatment 3 times per week is superior to a procedure performed once per week, we have treated 22 pediatric patients with preterminal renal failure (age 0.3-17.0, mean 6.2 yrs, Scr 1.3-13.6, mean 4.4 mg/dl) in a prospective randomized multi-centre study. 10 patients (mean Hb 8.5 g/dl) received rhEPO (ERYPO, CILAG) s.c. in a dosage of 50 U/kg three times per week (group 3x) and 12 patients (mean Hb 7.9 g/dl) of 150 U/kg once per week (group Ix). 4 patients were excluded from the analysis: non-response due to severe intractable infection (1), transplantation (1), dialysis (1), non-compliance (1). The response intervals (increase of Hb>2.0 g/dl) did not significantly differ between both groups and amounted to 6 weeks in group 3x (n=7) and 8 weeks in group Ix (n= 11) with corresponding weekly doses of 129 and 131 U/kg respectively. The correction intervals (Hb> 11.5 g/dl), however, significantly differed from each other with 9.3 weeks in group 3x and 15.6 weeks in group Ix (p<0.01) by means of comparable correction doses of 135 und 158 U/kg /week, respectively. The sustaining doses did not significantly differ between both groups (103 vs 111 U/kg / week). Side effects were only rather limited and equally distributed between both ~roups never indicating a deterioration of glomerular filtrat:on rate. 1/Scr changed from 0.238 to 0.198 in group 3x and from 0.354 to 0.396 in group Ix. Differences in blood pressure behaviour could not be detected. Data suggest that the shorter correction interval in group 3x will easily be overcome by the burdens and costs of a s.c.-injection three tt~es per week so that routine rhEPO application once per weel~ should be preferred especially in children, if there is no reed for a rapid correction otanemta. Up to now in children with terminal renal failure no amelioration of growth rate was observed under treatment with rhEPO leading only to subphysiologieal Hb blood concentrations. In a prospective multi-centre study we therefore investigated the effect of rhEPO (ERYPO, C1LAG) in children with PTRF achieving normal Hb concentrations (target range 11.5 -13.5 g/dl). Treatment was started in 20 patients with 150 U/kg rhEPO s.e./wk. 4 patients dropped out of the study because of non-response, start of dialysis, transplantation and non-compliance. In the remaining 16 patients (mean age 6.3 yrs, mean Hb 8.1 g/dl, mean Scr 3.8 mg/dl) body length had changed within the last 6 months period before rhEPO treatment from t08.3 to 110.4 cm and increased to t14.2 cm after 6 months of treatment. Growth velocity increased from 4.65 +/-2.82 to 7.59 +/-5.92 cm/yr with a Z-score normalizing from -2.35 to + 0.08 ( p < 0.001 ). When restricting the analysis to prepubertal children ( N = t2 ) a comparable increase of Z-score from -2.79 to + 0.17 was detected, The individual analysis revealed a better growth under rhEPO in 13/16 pts with 7 pts leveling up with their Z-score in the positive range. Bone age was not unduly accelerated. For the first time these data suggest that growth of children with PTRF can be significantly ameliorated and even normalized in most cases by rhEPO administration leading to physiologic Hb levels, but a longer observation period is necessary for definite conclusions. R-HuEPO was administered to seven children (6 boys and 1 girl) aged 1,5 to 13,2 years (mean age 7,7 years) with pre-dialysis Chronic Renal Failure (mean serum ereatinine 3,96~1,45 mg/dl) and normochromic and normocytic anemia (mean Hb 7,7~i,08 gr/dl mean Ht 0,23~0,03). All children were normotensive. R-HuEPO was administered subcutaneously three times weekly at a mean dose of 50 U/Kg per injection during the first month(correction ph~ se). Subsequently the dose was modified according to Hb and Ht levels(maintenance phase).Mean follow-up was 9 months(2 months -2 years). At the end of the correction phase all children obtained the target levels of Hb and Ht (9,91\u2022 gr/dl,p<0,001; 0,30~0,02,p=0,001 ). An increase in reticulocyte counts was seen already within one week of the r-HuEPO treatment. In the m~ intenance phase the dosage of r-HuEPO was decreased at twice s week in a child and it was doubled in another one; it was unchanged in the remaining. There was no difference in the serum potassium and phosphorus levels before and during the treutment. The mean ereatinine serum level showed a significant increase at the end of the study (6,88~2,53 mg/dl, p=0,001) . Non changes in blood pressure levels were recorded. As side effect a flu-like syndrome was seen in two children following the fi~ st injection of r-HuEPO. Our results suggest that r-HuEPO is safe and effective in pre-dialysis children without adverse ef fects on blood pressure and serum potassium. There was a signi ficant decrease of renal function, but we found no difference in slopes between the pre-treatment and post-treatment periods with respect to the inverse of the creatinine levels. In 8 children on dialysis therapy we have studied the in vivo response to rhEPO, as well as the in vitro characteristics of their BM and circulating erythroid and granulomonocytic progenitors (BFU-E and GM-CFC, respectively), including BFU-E response to low concentrations of rhEPO. In addition, the possible presence of inhibitory factors to erythropoiesis in the patients' serum or conditioned medium (CM) produced by their mononuclear cells was evaluated. Patients were studied before, 1 and 4 weeks and 4 months following rhEPO therapy. All patients responded to the administration of rhEPO with a marked amelioration of their anemia. Prior to rbEPO therapy, BM and circulating BFU-E in RRT patients were 1.8-2.2 times greater than in 8 age-matched healthy controls, and significantly more responsive (2.5-2.6 fold) to low (1/10 to 1/2 of the optimal) concentrations of rhEPO than cells from the controls subjects. Four weeks following rhEPO therapy the increase in the number of BFU-E and the increased sensitivity of rhEPO returned to normal. Addition of patients' serum and CM (10%) to cultures of normal BFU-E and GM-CFC targets, did not inhibit their colony numbers. BM and circulating GM-CFCs frequencies were comparable to those of the controls, prior to and following rhEPO therapy.",

Treatment with rHuEpo can eliminate many symptoms that had been atm~outed to uremia. Repetitive punctures in children undergoing three times weekly SC rHuEpe can result in noncompliance with the therapeutic regimen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficaoj of once weekly SC injection of rHuEpo in children with ESRD on CAPD.

Any of the 5 normotensive patients developed hypertension. We concluded that once weekly 150U/kg SC rHuEpo is effective in correcting anemia in children on CAPD. This regimen results in few side effects, decreases the cost of treatment and produces less distress to the patients by avoiding repetitive injections. The study population consisted of 13 children with congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). Peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) was started at the time of nephrectomy. Subcutaneous r-HuEPO-treatment was begun when blood Hgb value had fallen < 70 g/I. The mean age was 2.1 years (range 1.0 -6.1 y) and the mean weight 10.7 kg (range 7.9 -19.6 kg). The initial r-HuEPOdose was 20 IU/kg x3/wk and was increased by 10 IU/kg/2-4 wk up to 50 IU/kg according to the .response in Hgb. Of the 13 children 8 achieved a Hgb level of 100 g/I in a mean time of 22 wk (range 12-36 wk) where~s 5 did not in 16 wk (range 8-32 wk). In 2 patients the treatment was interrupted because of renal transplantation. The mean r-HuEPO-dose during the study was 39 IU/kg (range 27-47 IU/kg). The individual increment in erythrocyte mass varied between -4.0 and 2.2 ml/kg/mo. A poor association was found between the mean r-HuEPO-dosa and the erythrocyte mass increment (r=0.56, p= 0.0456).",

We conclude that children with CNF on CCPD have protein malnutrition after nefrectomy and this limits their ability to respond to r-HuEPO-treatment, in addition, the severity of uremia, reflected by high serum urea nitrogen concentrations, also reduces the utilization of storage iron for hemoglobin production. RhEPO is established as effective treatment for the anaemia of ESRF but experience of its use in young children managed conservatively or by peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is limited. 13 children age 0.1 -7.9 yrs, 5 pre-dialysis, 2 post-transplant (estimated GFR 4 -12 mls/min/1.73m 2) and 6 on CAPD were treated with s/c RhEPO in an initial dose of 50 -100 u/kg/wk as a single or divided dose for a mean (range) of 11 (4 -23) mths.",

Recent literature has advocated aggressive medical management of XLH in children with 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (D) and phosphate (P) to maximize statural growth and minimize skeletal deformities. Attention has focused on hypercalcemia as the major complication of treatment. Hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (NC) have not received adequate attention. In particular three questions arise: I) does treatment with D and P cause NC, or can it be an intrinsic part of XLH 2) does hypercalciuria (UCa/UCreat ~ .20) correlate with NC 3) is there renal morbidity associated with NC. Renal morbidity is defined as at least one of the following: renal colic, gross unexplained hematuria, renal insufficiency of any degree or passage of gravel or a kidney stone. 10 adults and 4 children with XLH and no history of any form of D or P treatment (Group I) and i0 adults and 8 children with a history of treatment with any form of vitamin D or P (II) had renal ultrasound read by a single pediatric radiologist, blinded to treatment status. RESULTS: No Group I patients had NC; 5 adults and 5 children had NC in Group II, .2 of whom developed it while actively treated. Hypercalciuric episodes were noted in 2/3 adults and 4/5 children in Group II. 4/5 adults and all 5 children in Group II with NC received D plus P. A single isolated episode of hypercalciuria was also noted in 2/3 children in Group II without NC. No patients in Group II experienced symptoms of renal morbidity by history or serum creatinine levels. CONCLUSIONS: i) Data suggests NC is a complication of the treatment; 2) Hypercalciuria may play a role in the development of NC; 3) No renal morbidity was noted in Group II patients; 4) The potential role of P therapy in the pathogenesis of NC remains to be determined. Two well-growing, asymptomatic brothers are described with hypophosphatanmlc hyperphesphaturia, hypercalcinria, tubular proteinuria, slight osteopoenia and medullary nephroealcinosis. In the In:st months of life both presented with hemoglobinuria and proteinuria. A renal biopsy performed at age 3.5 in case 1 was normal. At follow-up (14 years Case 1, 5 years Case 2) we determined the presence of hyperphosphatufia, progressively decreasing sP concentrations, hypercalciaria, microglobinuria, elevated sALP (90% bone fraction), a decreasing GFR and urinary concentration ability, and progression of osteopoenia (by mineralometry) and nephrocalcinosls (by US). sCa, PTH, s and ur Na, K, Mg, glucose & amino acids remained always normal. Extensive metabolic evaluation in both brothers excluded the known causes of uephrocalcinesis, intestinal malabsorption & hepatic diseases, & demonstrated phosphate leak, an increase of 1,25 (OH)2 D3 to suprapbysiolog!cal levels concurrent with progressively decreasing sP concentrations, augmented intestinal absorption of P and absorptive hypercalcinria. Phosphate supplementation as the sole therapy normalized sP and t,25 (OH)2 D3 concentrations, ar calcium excretion & bone mineral content. The rate of GFR decline and nephroealcinosls appeared to lessen. The only biochemical abnormality detected in the parents, the sister and 5 relatives in three generations was microglobinurla in the mother. This familial syndrome is biochemlcally similar to hereditary hypophosphataemic hypercalciuric rickets, but it differs because of the absence of rickets, and the presence of nephrocaleinesis and tubular proteinuria. CMA is a widely accepted cause for rickets or for osteopenia, but the relationship between CMA and bone disease as well as the mechanism(s) involved remain controversial.",

PTH was measured with 1-34 antibody.In acidotic rats, histomorphometry of tibia diaphysis showed reduction in bone formation rate (double tetracycline labelling), and in osteoid seam thickness with enhanced endosteal bone resorption (surface not covered by labelling).There was no modification of plasma PTH and 25(OH)D and a slight not significant decrement of 1,25(OH)2D (p>0.10). Clinical and experimental studies showed that CMA induces bone osteopenia but does not directly cause rickets or osteomalacia.The bone alterations did not depend upon vitamin D metabolites or PTH modification.When observed in children, rickets appeared to result from associated vitamin D deficiency and not from CMA per se. In the early stages of childhood chronic renal failure (CRF) renal osteodystrophy and stunted growth are a therapeutical challenge! Most frequent causes of childhood CRF are apart from nephritic diseases malformations of the urinary tract such'as obstructive uropathy, renal hypoplasia/dysplasia and reflux nephropathy. Renal osteodystrophy may already develop at a 50% reduction of renal function. As part of the uraemic syndrome secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPTH) and osteodystrophy are rather frequent at a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 25% of normal. Consequences in childhood are rather serious, because the epiphyses are still open and growth mainly affects bone mineralisation and remodeling, which are at a much higher turn-over-rate than in adults. Bony les~ons are osteitis fibrosa and osteosclerosis due to sHPTH as well as osteomalacia by reduced bony mineralisation. Clinical manifestations are stunted growth, skeletal deformity, myopathy, bone pain, impairment of gait, metaphyseal fractures and slippage of epiphyses. An exemplary report of the rare case of a 12-years old boy with CRF due to reflux nephropathy and classical clinical and laboratory features of renal osteodystrophy shall be given. Since the disease is a complex, multifactorial disturbance due to changes in the metabolism of vitamin D3, phosphate and Parathyroid hormone (PTH)~ treatment has to cover a wide range. Therapeutic goals are the normalisation of serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and PTH, the correction of metabolic acidosis as well as the prevention or cure of the skeletal changes. Ireatment includes dietary regimens (phosphate restriction), calcium carbonate (correction of hypoca!caemia, metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphataemia), calcium gluconate {prevention of hypocalcaemia) and oral substitution of vitamin D3 resp. 1,25(OH)2-vit-D3. The effectiveness of this schedule on the skeletal changes ~l~be~de~ons~ated. A successful renal transplantation is supposed to improve bone metabolic disturbances caused by chronic renal insufficiency. The objective of the study was to evaluate bone mineral status in children before and after renal transplantation (Tx). A longitudinal survey of bone mineral density (BMD) was performed in 22 children (11 girls, 11 boys) who received Tx at age 1.5 to 15.5 years. A triple immunosuppressive therapy including prednisone, azathioprine and cyciosporine was used after Tx. BMD of the lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray abcorptiometry using Hologic QDR systems in all children within one year preceding Tx (TO), 6 months after Tx in 17 patients (T6) and 12 months after \"Ix in 12 patients (T12). Renal function was stable in both groups at the time of repeated examination : mean _+ SD serum creatinine level = 72. 5 in chronic renal failure parathyroid glands show an abnormal responsiveness to hypocalcemic stimuli such as high serum phosphorus (P) levels. 5 males (7-16 yrs), withERI (Clcr 36-57 ml/min/1.73 sqm) secondary to tubulo-interstitial disease, with normal clinical, radiological and biochemical findings of bone metabolism and who had never received Vitamin D, were given an infusion of P (20 mg/Kg) in 30' Calcemia (Ca),P and PTH-NH2 were measured before and at 30 and 180 minutes after the end of the infusion The same test was repeated after 3 months therapy with oral calcitrio} (CT) (5-10 ng/Kg). Results: Mean (-+SD); Delta PTH = (PTH basal-infusion)/(PTH ,basal+infusion)/2; ~ vs. basal; ~p<O.05 vs, pre-CT. During a follow up period of 7 years, we evaluated BMD of 32 hemodialysed and transplanted childran. Total and mean BMD of lumbar spine and BMD of femoral neck were measured by dual energy with gadolinium, in 19 boys and 13 girls (12 to 20 years old). All these patients but 4 underwent a renal transplantation during the study. In hemodialysis, hyperparathyroidism has been controlled with calciuim carbonate and vitamin D supplement. After transplantation treatment consisted of Azathioprine, steroids and cyclosporine. All transplanted patients had a well functioning kidney during the follow up.",

Steroids used in our transplantation protocol have a marked negative effect on BMD during the first year of Tx. The increase of BMD goes on after the end of statural growth. Renal osteodystrophy(ROD) and growth was assessed in 20 children undergoing CAPD. Mean age at the onset of CAPD was 7 years and duration of CAPD was between 1 and 7 years with an average of 3 years and 3 months. Serum calcium and inorganic phosphorus levels were maintained within normal limits in these patients. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and C-PTH levels and abnormal radiological bone changes of ROD were observed in patients with severe ROD, but they ~ not correlate in patients with mild ROD. Fifteen patients showed the radiological bone changes of ROD with deterioration and improvement in some patients. In I0 children under 6 years of age 5 showed the radiological changes of rickets and 7 showed the changes of secondary hyperparathyroidisms(2nd-HPT). In i0 children over 7 years of age 3 showed the changes of rickets and 8 had the'changes of 2nd-HPT. Administration of vitamin D seems to be necessary to prevent ROD during CAPD treatment. The growth of older children was poor during CAPD, but catch up growth was observed in young children under the age of 6 years. The growth was affected by rickets in young children, but the presence of mild 2nd-HPT seems to have little influence on growth in older children. On examination, the boy was of short stature (-2 BD). Him arterial pressure was 140/80 mm My and renal function was normal. X-ray films sho~ed two ~seous cysts of the ulna and ultrasou~ scan a hypoplasia of the right kidney. On DTPA ~intigraphy, slomerular filtrati~ rates were 65 and 6 ml/mn for the left right kidneys respectively, computeri~-ed engiogrephy eho~ed sten~es of the left renal artery and the hepatic artery ; the right renal artery could not be vieualimed. The pla~-~a renin activity of the riBht renal vein was three times that Of the left one. To evaluate the role of renal prostanolds, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma vasopressin (VP) in the development and maintenance of AH in GN we've performed RIA of 2~-hour urinary prostaglandins (I~G), PRA and VP in 6 non-uremic and 8 non-dialysed uremic hypertensive children with chronic GN, 22 normotensive non-uremlc children with GN and nephrotlc syndrome and in I7 health~ children (controls). All of them were free fmam drug therapy and sodlum-restricted. All GN groups demonstrated lowered production of vasodepressory renal prostacycllne (by urinary 6-keto-lOGF-I@~ ) whleh decreased gradually from normotensive to non-uremic and uremic hypertensive Stoups-and correlated with creatinine clearance (r = 0.6I, p< 0.05). Renal I~E2 was deereagea only in uremic hypertensive patients. Plasma VP was normal in hypertensive groups and slightly elevated in normotensive GN. PRA was increased together with sodium retention in normotenslve nephrotlcs and hypertensive non-uremlc children which had highest levels, while in uremic hypertenalves PEA was normal. No correlations with the level of BP were found. So, in non-uremlc children with GN AE may be medl ated by high PRA and sodium retention. In uremic children AS is likely to be due to decreased renal vasodepressory prostaglandins synthesis. VP probably does not play any role in the development of AS. We have recently reported that glomerular ANG I1-R density in 4-5wk old pre-hypertensive (PHT) is X1.5 that of adult SHR. Recent evidence also suggests that ANG II-R subtypes may change during development. The purpose of this study was to characterize ANG II-R subtypes in isolated glomeruli from 4wk PHT and 12wk adult SHR and WKY. Ligand binding studies were performed with [1zsI]-ANG II in the presence of varying concentrations of the ANG II-R nonpeptide antagonists DUP 753 and PD '~o~F~~ 123319, which selectively bind to type 1 (ATI) and type 2 (AT2) ANG ][I'R ! iI~ ~i~. ~ ~ sub-types, respectively. In the PHT~ SHR, inhibition of [125I]-ANG II binding by DUP 753 (Figure) indicated a single population of receptors ,. (K1=210!-_10 nM). Minimal radioligand binding inhibition (15%) was achieved -'~*\"\"'~\"~' \"~ with PD 123319, even at 104M. Similar inhibition curves were demonstrated for the adult SHR and WKY (I~=200!42 vs K~=200i-_49 nM). We conclude that AT] subtype is the predominant glomerular ANG I/-R in the PHT SHR and while glomendar ANG II-R density decreases with the onset of hypertension AT l remains the prevalent subtypes. AT 1 is also the principle subtype in the adult WKY. Compared to single blood pressure (BP) ABPM every 20 minutes gives a more representative impression of BP. ABPM was performed in 18 HD pts aged 8-20 years, treated 3x4 h/week (mean interdialytic weight gain 4%) and in 17 PD pts (no weight gain) aged 7-19 years using the Spacelab 90207 device. ABPM was used in the whole interdialytic intervall (44h) in HD and during 24h in PD. The data were compared with the average of 10 routine BP recordings taken at home in PD and before dialysis in HD. Hypertension was defined as systolic or diastolic BP>95: th percentile (95c) for height. Antihypertensive drugs were given in 7 HD and 15 PD. Blood samples were taken simultaneously with ABPM for determination of vasoactive hormones. Results: hypertension was noted by routine recordings in 8 pts of either group and by ABPM in 6 HD and 16 PD pts. Four HD pts with elevated predialysis routine BP were normotensive when assessed by ABPM. Routine BP was below the 95c in HD (-10 mmHg systolic and -3 mmHg diastolic) and near this limit (-4 systolic, +2 diastolic) in PD. ABPM daytime means were below the 95c in HD (-8 systolic, -3 diastolic) but, in contrast, above this limit in PD (+8 systolic and +13 systolic; p<0,01 between the 2 groups). The nocturnal drop of mean BP was normal in PD (11 mmHg) and reduced to 4 mmHg in HD. BP of the second day of ABPM was not significantly different to the first day in HD. Median plasma atrial natriuretic peptide was increased only in HD pts (53 fmol/I in HD vs 18 fmol/I in PD, p< 0,0001) whereas plasma renin activity and aldosterone were within normal range. In conclusion, ABPM detects that hypertension is more prevalent in PD than in HD patients, despite signs of volume overload in the latter group. Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disease of the nervous system .It affects 1:2500/1:3000 persons in the general population. Vessel alterations can be observed in neurofibromatosis and may be classified in three different types (Reubi):simple intimal,intimalaneurismal and perierterial-nodular. It is possible to identify features of more than one of the pure types in the same vascular lesion.We describe two children who presented with severe arterial hypertension,in whom the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis was reached only after careful histological analysis of the kidney.The first case had a sole lesion of the right renal artery ,a nephrectomy was performed, with good clinical results.The second case was found to have an almost universal involvement of small,medium and large diameter arteries,this patient presented with severe hypertension of difficult clinical management and died at 5 years of age,in chronic renal failure.ln conclusion,the vascular lesions of neurofibromstosis,if carefully identified in the renal tissue can be of value for the diagnosis of this disease.

The results were compared to the European BP centlles (de Man etal., J Hypertens 9: 109, 1991). The day's mean of BP was calculated as difference in standarddeviations (SD) to the mean of the reference group with corresponding body height. The decline of the BP at night was given as the percent of the day's mean. RAS is the most common correctable form of secondary hypertension in children and adults. A satisfactory non-invasive screening test for RAS detection has not been available. Duplex ultrasound scanning of renal arteries using the conventional anterior abdominal approach to diagnose RAS by identifying Doppler waveform abnormalities in the area of stenosis has been associated with an unacceptable rate of technical failure and has limited accuracy. We report the use of a recently developed duplex screening test for the diagnosis of haemodynamically significant RAS. This technique assesses Doppler signal characteristics in the distal renal artery at the kidney hilum to detect the presence of haemodynamically significant RAS proximally. With the patient in the decubitus position, the hilum of each kidney is insonated via the flank using a 3MHz B-mode mechanical sector transducer with a 5MHz pulsed Doppler. The renal artery is visualized as a pulsation in the renal hilum and the Doppler cursor positioned in the vessel with a wide (15ram) sample volume and a 0 degree angle. Sample Doppler signals are recorded on heat-sensitive paper. The time between commencement of the systolic upstroke and the initial systolic peak is measured (acceleration time AT). Haemodynamically significant stenosis is defined by an AT of greater than 100 msec. No sedation or other preparation is necessary. The average investigation takes 10 minutes per kidney. Initially 58 patients withoul significant hypertension but with available angiograms were screened; none had RAS by AT criteria but four had significant stenosis by the angiographie criteron of >50% luminal narrowing in the renal artery (three had bilateral stenosis). Ten patients (eight adults, two children) with severe hypertension uncontrolled by maximum doses of three or more drugs were screened; 7 (6 adults, 1 child) had unilateral significant RAS by AT and by angiographic criteria, 3 (2 adults, 1 child) had no RAS detected by either technique. Three patients (2 adults, 1 child) underwent corrective surgery with subsequent significant amelioration of hypertension and normalization of Doppler signal. These preliminary results suggest that this practical, atraumatic and accurate screening test would be of value in children with resistant hypertension. C 178 P-IVA.41",

            "text": "Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats is one of the most commonly used animal model for studying genetic hypertension that develop hypertension when fed a high salt (HS) diet. Since kidneys of DS rats exhibit an impaired intrinsic natriuretic capacity, we examined the effect of HS diet on Na+,K+-ATPase mRNA content in the renal cortex of prehypertensive (24-day-old) DS and Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats. The mRNA abundance of both Na+,K+-ATPase ~1 and 13 subunits .was similar in the renal cortex from DS and DR rats on normal salt (NS) diet. After 2 days on HS diet, the abundance of al and l~ mRNA was increased in DS (2.01_+0.60-fold vs. 2.18+0.63-fold, P<0.05 for both subunit) but not in DR rats. The effect of HS diet on Na +,K+-ATPase mRNA abundance was not a pressure effect, since mean arterial pressure was still the same in 25-day-old DS and DR rats on HS diet for 3 days. The abundance of (zl and I~ mRNA in denervated kidneys from DS rats was also increased to a similar extent in response to HS diet (1.97+0.18-fold vs. 1.75+0.20-fold). The content of c~1 and protein in cortical homogenate was the same in 25-day-old DS and DR rats on both NS diet and HS diet for 3 days. Na+,K \u00a7 activity was determined in permeabilized proximal tubule segments and in renal cortical homogenate from 25-day-old DS and DR rats. In both proximal tubule and homogenate, Na+,K+-ATPase activity was similar in DS and DR rats on NS diet. Three days on HS diet resulted in a 2-fold increase in proximal tubule Na+,K+-ATPase activity in DS (P<0.05) but not in DR rats. The activity in cortical homogenate did not change during HS diet. In summary, HS diet induces an early increase in mRNA for both Na+,K+-ATPase subunits in prehypertensive DS rats, which is associated with an increase in Na \u00a7 activity in intact proximal tubular cells. These effects may contributes to salt retention in DS rats on HS diet. During the last years, it has been stressed that there is an high incidence of infection in C.R.F. patients associated with high mortality. Some significance has been attributed to dialysis procedures, to steroid treatment and to the basic pathology etc., without dearly establishing the importance of each one of these factors. For this reason some immunologic parameters have been evaluated in 20 pediatric patients with different degrees of C.R.F. of non immunologic cause, eutrophic, that ~ did not receive steroid, immunosuppressive treatment or dialysis.",

That would give possibility to intend an emergency curative procedure in order toprevent renal loss particularly when blood flow abolition in renal artery is present. Although a protein restricted diet is frequently used in chronic renal failure it is as yet not proven whether it has a beneficial effect on renal function of children with chronic renal failure. We wanted to know if a protein restricted diet can slow down or even prevent progression of chronic renal failure and whether growth of these children is affected. 56 children with chronic renal failure (GFR 18-63 ml/min/1.73m 2) entered the study. Age 2-17 years, mean 9 years and 4 months. Diagnosis: glomerulopathy (9); reflux nephropathy, obstructive uropathy and/or dysplasia (36), miscellaneous (11). To minimize interobserver variations one single paediatrician and one dieti,tian visited the patients in the different centres throughout the course of the study. After an observation period of three months the children were randomly assigned to a protein restricted group (0.8-1.1 g protein/kg/day) or a control group. Results after a follow-up of three-years: 1. GFR does not differ significantly between the protein restricted and the control group. 2. Statural growth was equal in both groups. 3.

The treatment of chronic renal diseases has developed in recent decades, However, with even such treatments as steroid and immunosuppressive drugs, chronic renal diseases often progress relentlessly to end-stage renal failure. Alternatively, to postpone the initiation of dialysis therapy, oral administration of adsorbent for the removal of uremic toxins in the gastrointestinal tract has been tried in chronic renal failure (CRF). The spherical carbonaceous adsorbent(AST-120) ha5 been used in various stages of CRF with good results. We used it in the management of 20 patients with CRF, aged 5 to 17 years old. Following a base line period, it was administered to patients undergoing conservative therapy at daily dose of 2.4 g per 40 kg body weight, 3 times a day for period of 1.8 to 80.3 months. Value of serum crsatinine (S-CRTN) at start of study was 4.2\u2022176 (Mean\u2022 mg/dl. Clinical courses were followed by several biochemical parameters before and after administration of the oral adsorbent. The results were evaluated by reciprocal S-CRTN versus time plots and analysis of Wilcoxon test (W-test). Slope of reciprocal S-CRTN versus time plots, pre-and post-administration of the oral adsorbent were -1550.6\u2022 (I0 -s dl/mg-month) and -913.2\u2022 respectively in 20 patients. Seventeen out of 20 patients (85%) were revealed effective to oral adsorbent therapy and W-test was significant (p<0.01). Uremic symptoms such as anorexia, pruritus and anemia were improved after administration of oral adsorbent. Most of side effects were rather mild gastrointestinal symptoms. We concluded that oral adsorbent (AST-120) was effective 4~. patients ~ CRF in conservative therapy, and observed satisfactory outcome even in patients ~ early stage of CRF. A developmental delay and encephalolmtby have been described in children with chronic renal failure (CRF). If compared to normal% the cognitive and motor development is delayed in these patients, It is questionable whether an early start of renal replacement therapy may positively influence their development. Over a period of 3 years a prospective study was performed with regard to the cognitive and neurological development of young children (< 5 years of age) with CRF (ereatinine clearance < 25 mi/min/1.73m2). As a part of this study brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) and somatoseasory evoked potentials (SSEP) were measured every 6 mont~. The study population consisted of 23 children; in 18 of them CRF was present from birth. Sufficient data for analysis were available in 19 (BAEP) and 22 (SSEP) children, respectively. BAEP's showed a significant delay of peak I, indicating peripheral disturbances of conduction, possibly due to cochlear dysfunction. Brainstem conduction was normal. There were no differences between the children treated conservatively (N=9) and those treated with CAPD (N=10). SSEP's showed in the younger age group (<2.5 years) a delayed thalamo-cortieal conduction, possibly indicating a delayed myelinatiun in these young children, since this phenomenon was not observed in the older are group. There were no differences between the children treated conservatively (N=10) and those treated with CAPD (N=12). It is concluded that the results of this study of BAEP and SSEP do not support the view, that earlier start of renal replacement start might be beneficial for the cognitive and motor development of young children with CRF. Today, HD prescription has to take into account the recent technology advancements : conventional or highly permeable membranes, acetate or bicarbonate or buffer free (biofiltration BF) dialysate, ultrafiltration control, diffusive (HD) or convective (hemofiltration HF) or diffusive snd convective (hemodiafiltration, HDF) epuration, sodium in the dialysate (NED) and/or ultrsfiltration (UF) rate modelling, compartmental epuration against water (NeD modelling), or phosphate (bicarbonate modelling) cellular sequestration. Most of the children benefits from capillary membranes and controlled UF. Only a few patients need UF r~te and NeD modelling to improve weight loss tolerance over session. Despite a larger range of molecular weight compounds epuration (ie B2 microglobulin) and more cardiovascular stability (HF effect), HDF is only ocoasionnaly performed in children. Use of highly permeable membranes requires enhancement of dialysate purity (to limit retrofiltration adverse effects) and adjustment of dialysate composition (to limit buffer or calcium intoxication). Today, dialysis dosis prescription is based on the ratio urea cleared volume (KT) over urea volume of distribution (V). Single pool urea kinetic modelling allows direct calculation of KT/V (delivered dialysis dogie) and protein catabolic rate (PCR) and urea time average concentration (TAC-urea) determination (quality of nutrition in regard to quality of epuration). Because of the real but only relative inaccuracy of the single pool model, partial dialysate collection,or, two pool model,two hours post session urea level use (to avoid error of post dialysis urea rebound) are proposed. We have the chance to test since more than ten years these new dialysis modalities, specially HDF, then NaD and UF modelling and bicarbonate modelling (BF with free buffer dialysate neither acetate nor bicarbonate) and to prescribe dialysis dosis by KT/V, PCRn, TAC-urea monitoring. Vascular access is a serious problem for pediatric hemodialysls patients. Under certain conditions it is necessary to use arteriovenous shunting processes. In this report we present 18 months followup results on 14 pediatric patients with synthetic vascular grafts inserted between May to September 1990. PTFE ringed grafts of 6 nun I.D were placed in 14 patients (8 boys, fi girls with ages ranging from 8 to 15) between the superficial femoral artery and the saphanofcmoral junction. In 10 patients (7_1%) grafts were functioning without problems after 14-20 months (17 + 1.3 months).",

More widespread familiarity has led to its use in an increasing variety of clinical settings. To evaluate the efficacy of CH, we determined the short-term survival (as measured by subsequent discharge from the hospital) of 77 critically ill patients, aged 1 day to 19 years, treated on 78 occasions with either continuous arteriovenous (CAVIl) or venovenons (CVVH) hemofiltration, or arteriovenous (CAVH-D) or venovenous (CVVH-D) hernodiafiltration from 1/88 -11/91. Indications for therapy included uremia, metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, and voltime overload. Eight of 16 patients with ARF due to sepsis/hypotension or SLE survived, as did 7 of 8 due to HUS. Four of 9 patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, 5 of whom had Fontan procedures, survived. None of 3 with cardiac transplant, AV malformation, or aortic coarctation survived. One of 3 patients with ALL and none of 7 with bone marrow transplant survived. Two patients with complications due to Rh incompatibility or Thalassemia died. One child treated for tumor lysis syndrome survived. Overall survival for ARDS was 6 of 22 patients, most with multiple organ failure. One infant was successfully treated with CH for ARF while on ECMO. Three of 9 children treated for complications of liver transplantation survived, while a patient with intussusception died. Treatment of 5 patients with congenital metabolic disorders was highly successful. Two of 2 neonates and one older child treated for hyperammonemia survived, as well as 1 neonate with primary lactic acidosis. Despite the lack of a control population treated with peritoneal or hemodialysis, the overall survival rate of 41% (32 of 78 treatments) indicates that a significant percentage of patients requiring acute therapy for life-threatening fluid, electrolyte, and metabolic derangements can be effectively and safely managed with CH. In our experience, CH is an efficacious alternative to peritoneal or hemc~tialysis, and can be used safely in the acute management of a wide range of illnesses encountered in pediatrics. The onset of end-stage renal failure together with a]! the associated medical complications of uremia comes as a shock to the child and his family despite any or all the previous psychological preparation. The onset of ESRF and subsequent hemodialysis is the beginning of a new scope of a variety of potential medical complications as well as restrictions and deprivations imposed on the child. It also becomes apparent that life as the family knew it will never be the same again. Beyond the practical problems of food, the whole family must cope with the reality of a child ~uho is not normal and healthy. When the initial shock is over, it is the task of the doctor and the family to achieve some measure of normai life and reinforce the child's confidence in dealing with his school and play world. The most successful tools that medical workers could use to achieve adjustment and coping skills would seem to be to encourage open and frank communication, both within the family and between family and medical staff. The complex saga of the kidney patient is linked intimately with the saga of the healtheare team. The nature of hemodialysis brings together a new pseudofamily structure, possessiveness and overprotectiveness become critical components in the resolution of care. In recent years, patients undergoing dialysis due to chronic renal failure have remarkably increased in number. From early childhood, these patients have often suffered from renal diseases and have complained of many physical and psychosocial problems. We would like to report a study with regards to the onset of renal disease, initial laboratory findings, psyehosoeial problems in their sehooldays in 695 adult eases who were maintained on dialysis. The results obtained were as follows:l) In 695 patients, the original of renal failure was chronic glomerulonephritis (61.0%), diabetic nephropathy (17.0%), nephrotie syndrome (7.5%), chronic pyelonephritis (33%), renal tuberculosis (3.0%), lupus nephritis (1.4%) and Alport's syndrome (1.4%), respeetlvely.",

            "text": "3) The renal diseases were initially detected by urinary masssereaning at school in 22 cases out of 695. 4) 31 eases out of 85, had experienced long absences during their sehooldays and 38 patients had lost their jobs owing to their bad physical condition. These results indicate that dialysis patients with early onset of disease have more difficult problems in their lives than those with later onset. Complement deficiencies occur in the nephrotic syndrome due to urinary protein loss. It was decided to study the complement system in children treated with CAPD with protein loss into the peritoneal cavity. In 16 patients (mean age 7.0 years, standard deviation 4.2 years) classical and alternative complement activity and serum level~ of seven components (Clq, C4, C3, C3d, B, D and P) were measured 9 Values were compared to those of a sex-and age-matched control-group of 44 healthy children 9 Mean total classical complement activity (CH50) was 471 U/ml in the CAPD-group and 375 U/ml in the control-group (P < 0.025). For total alternative complement activity (AP50) there was no difference between the two groups. The mean Clq level was 14.6 mg % in CAPD patients, which was slightly elevated compared to controls (12.6 mg %; P < 0.025). C4 and especially C3d levels were markedly elevated. Mean C4 level was 41.9 mg % in CAPD patients and 26.9 in controls (P < 0.001). Mean C3d level was 20.4 ~g/ml in CAPD patients and 6.7 in controls (P < 0.001). C3 levels were not different between CAPD-and control-group. Of the measured components of the alternative pathway (B, D and P) there was a statistically significant difference between the groups for factors D and P. Mean factor D level was 103.9 U/ml in CAPD patients, whereas it was only 6.2 in controls (P < 0.001). Mean Properdin level was 21.1 /xg/ml in CAPD patients and 16.8 in controls (P < 0.01). It is concluded that there is no deficiency of complement in these patients. High levels of C3d and D can be explained as a consequence of reduction of elimination by the kidney. The increased levels of the other factors are presumably due to an increased synthesis. The stimulus for this is not yet known. Nigl~tly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) is an automated form oF ;ntermittent peritoneal dialysis which has potential medical and psychosocia I advantaqes i n comparison w i th CAPD/CC PD, due to izhe Iack. of daytime excl~anges. Data on solute/water removal in chil@er~ on NIPD are nevertheless scarce, so that no clear indications for NIPD can yet be formulated in pediatric age. For this reason, 12 patients, mean age I 0 49 +5.81 years, mean body weight 23.73 .~ 10.92 kg, with a residual creatinine clearance 1.70 ~ 230 and urea clearance 154 ._ ;tcJS~ ml/min/I 73 sqm, on NIPD for 147 _+ 5.4 months, underwent cleaf~n<ze studies ovec 3 days Mean dialysis infusion volume was 460.08 _* 19630 ml/kg/day with 10.33 ~_ 1.22 h. dialysis time. Peritoneal and combined (.residual plus peritoneal) creatinine and urea clearances ar~ ultraf.i Itrate/glucose absorption ratio were assessed. Peritoneal cre~iNr~ and urea clearances were 6.36-+ 2.96 and 8.49 + 3.35 I./day/l.7~ ~qm respectively Combined creatinine and urea clearances averaged 6.12 ~_ 2.21 and 696 +_ 2.16 ml/min/1.73 sqm, resulting in serum creatinme and urea values or 7.78 _+ 1.90 and 115.58 +_ 29.93 mg/dl respectively Ultrafiltration rate.was 1694_* 16.34ml/g glucose absorbed NIPD orovided similar or improved solute and water clearances compared with those reported in chi Idren and adults on CAPD/CCPD, without inconvenient tong periods in b~d These data indicate that NIPD is a suitable treatment in pediatric end-stage renal disease. Hypogonadism and growth retardation are frequent findings in pediatric patients under continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The aim of this study was to analyze whether or not the amount of hormones lost through dialysis plays a role in these alterations. Ten children ( 7 to 14 year old; 4 male, 6 female ) under CAPD were studied. Concentrations of I~H, TSH and testosterone were measured in serum and in dialysis solutions. S(mmtcmetry and sexual development (Tanner scale) were evaluated. Growth retardation was present in all patients, who were below percentile 3, however, hypogonadism was not observed. A positive correlation was found between sert~ hormonal concentrations and the excretion through dialysis solutions.The amount extracted in dialysis was estimated as being less than I% of the daily amount synthetized. Serum concentrations of the measured hormones were within the normal range for sex and age, except for LH (r=0.935,p < 0.001 ). Our findings showed that the loss of sexual hormones associated to CAPD was relatively small and is agreement with the lack of alterations on sexual maturity in the population studied~ In spite of these results, there was growth retardation, that suggest the role of other factor in the uremic children participating in this abnormality. It is suggested that tidal dialysis (TD) is more efficient than conventional automated cycling dialysis (CD) because the peritoneal space is stirred and never emptied. We devised a model to calculate ID and CD clearances and compared these predictions to measured values in children.",

The advent of various modifications of standard CAPD, such as CCPD, NPD and tidal PD, has created the need for objective individual evaluation of peritoneal solute transfer and efficacy of dialysis. A Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) has been introduced for adult PD patients (Twardowski 1987) . To standardize a PET for pediatric use, we performed equilibration studies in 20 CAPD/CCPD patients aged 1.9 to 19.8 years. 1000 lnl/m 2 body surface area of a 2.3 % glucose PD solution were instilled in the peritoneal cavity. Glucose, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and phosphate were measured in the dialysate 7 times during 4 hours (D), and in plasma (P) after 2 hours dwell time. At 4 hours, the mean (\u2022 SD) D/P ratio was 1.06 _+ 0.16 for urea, 0.79 -+ 0.14 for creatinine, 0.82 -+ 0.21 for potassium, 0.92 ---0.04 for sodium and 0.79 -+ 0.30 for phosphate. Mean D/D^ of glucose was 0.36 -+ 0.13. The 4-hour solute equilibration curves w~re analytically best approximated by logarithmic functions for urea (mean R2=0.983), creatinine (R2=0.973) and potassium (R2=0.979), by a linear function for phos-phate (R2=0.964), and by an exponential model for glucose (R z= 0.969). The linear or exponential regression coefficients were used to express the peritoneal solute transfer rates. Although the transfer rates of most solutes were correlated with each other, the individual variation of peritoneal permeability for different solutes was hish, Close associ-ations were observed between the glucose and creatzmne transfer rates (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) and between ultrafiltration rate and glucose (r=-0.90, p<0.0005) and creatinine (r=-0.88, p<0.005). Peritoneal permea-bility for all solutes tended to be inversely correlated with body size (urea transfer rate vs. height: r=0.49, p<0.05). We conclude that the PET may supply useful reformation on peritoneal solute transfer characteristics in children on PD and facilitate individualized PD prescription. Using a dwell volume scaled according to body surface area, small solute transfer rates decrease and glucose resorption increases with incre~ing body size. The purpose of our study was to evaluate LV morphology and function in HD children and the underlying hemodynamic factors. We performed 27 Doppler-echocardiograms with simultaneaous study of the fistula flow in 17 HD patients (9 male/8 female) aged 2.7 -20.3 years with Hb values of 7 -12 (mean 9.3) g/l.; all except one were treated by erythropoietin. 11 underwent an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) over 45 hrs. Based on the predialysis blood pressure (PDBP), ten patients were normotensive (4 treated by antihypertensives) and 4 hypertensive without drugs; 3 showed elevated PDBP despite treatment. ABPM mean daytime values were similar to PDBP in 7 children and discordant in 4. Mean LV wall thickness was increased (8.7\u2022 mm/m 2 vs 6.2\u2022 in control subjects, p<0.002). LV mass, calculated according to Devereux et el, ranged from 60 to 229 g/m 2 and was increased above normal limits in 11/17 pts. Cardiac index (CI = aortic flow/body surface area) ranged from 2.0 to 7.2 I/minim2 being increased above 3.5 I/minim 2 in 7/14 pts. Fistula flow ranged'from 0.44 to 1.73 I/minim 2. Shortening fraction, reflecting LV systolic function, was decreased (< 0.28) in 2/17 pts. The maximal velocities of early (E) and atrial (A) mitral flow pics suggested a subnormal LV diastolic function (E/A<2) in 12/15 examinations performed at HR < 80/min. No correlation was found between LV mass and PDBP or ABPM whereas LV mass was correlated to CI (r=0.68, p<0.005);.CI in turn was directly correlated to fistula flow (r=0.65, p<0.05) and inversely to Hb (r=-0.7, p<0.02). In conclusion, LV mass is frequently increased in pediatric HD pts. and is related to an increase in CI rather than to elevated blood pressure. The systolic LV function is usually preserved whereas the diastolic LV function seems to be disturbed. Plasma and muscle free ~ were determined in ~ children who started CArD at an age ranging from 8 to 16 months. The dialysis schedule was 4 exchanges per day of 40-45 ml/k~. Muscle biopsies were performed after 2-23 months of CAPD wh~e surgery was required for hernia repair or catheter replacement. Samples were taken from rectus abdominis, after an overnight dwell with 1.36% glucose dialysis solution, and the childPen were fastin~ from 12-15 hours. Data were compared with muscle samples from a control group of IO children with normal renal fanetion who were undergoin E elective surgery. Muscle intracellular water wan calculated usin E the chloride method. Plasma levels of most of essential AA (leucine, valine, threonine, lysine) and of some non-essential AA (serine, glutamine, aspaz,a~ine) were significantly Deduned. Plasma l-3-methylhistidine, citrulline, glutamic acid concentrations and the glycine/serine ratio were significantly increaned. Muscle AApattern of CAPD children and controls was similar except for a Deduction of leucine levels and an increase of aspartie and glutamic acid concentrations in dialysed patients. In comparison with data observed in patients with chronic renal failure or durin E maintenance hemodialysis, CAPD children showed a better preserved muscle AA pattern. Such finding could be explained by a modification of AA metabolism probably related to the CAPD hyperinsulinism. The reduced plasma levels of AA during CAPD might be attributed both to the chronic AA losses with the effluent dialysis fluid and to a shift, probably insulin related, of the AA from the extra-to the intracellular compartment. The results were as follows: From these data , younger children showed more severe impairment of growth at the onset of CAPD and better improvement of their gro~th than older children. It seemed difficult for children with end stage renal failure to grow well, but it seemed possible to improve their growth to some degree. The Italian Registry of Pediatric CPD is a permanent national registry, which started its activity in 1986. Since then i19 pediatric patients (age < 15 years at the start of CPD) have been enrolled and at present 15 dialysis centres are taking part in the Registry. The age of patients at the start of CPD was 8.5 \u2022 4.9 years, and 21 children were younger than 2 years. Only CAPD was utilized in 1986, while automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) accounted for 5~% and 65% of the treated patients in 1989 and 1990, respectively. In this report we focused our attention on patient hospitalization / rate, patient and technique survival, and reasons for terminating CPD.The evaluation of the hospitalization rate refers to the 1989-1990 period. During a total of 901.5 months of CPD, 2814 days of hospitalization were registered, with an incidence of ~.i days/month. The hospitalization rate of patients who started CPD during the 2-year observation period (5.3 days/month) was different from that of patients already on CPD (2.2 days/month). The survival of patients was 99% and 91.3% at 1 and ~ years, while the technique survival at the same times was 98% and 79.3%. Sixty-nine patients ended CPD treatment during the 5-year observation period: 49 received a renal transplant; 8 patients were switched to hemodialysis (excessive peritonitis 5 cases, uncontrolled hypertension 1 case, patient/family preference 2 cases); 7 patients died after an average of 39.5 months of CPD, due to cardiac complications (2 patients), sepsis (I), cerebral hemorrhage (i), bowel infarction (i), while 2 patients died suddenly at home of unknown cause.

Laboratory findings were : erythrocyte sedimentation rate 120, normal blood cell count, negative blood cultures. Viral serologic tests were negative. No tubercle bacilli were isolated from gastric lavage. Chest X-rays were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography and CT-scan showed enlarged lymph nodes around the hepatic and celiac vessels. Liver and lymph nodes biopsy revealed diffuse non caseating granulomas. Four-drug antituberculous regimen was given for 2 months. Nevertheless, the disease worsened with high fever, weight loss, increased hepato end splenomegaly. Abdominal lymph nodes became palpable. Tubercle bacilli research remained negative on gastric and bronehoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lymph node calture. BAL showed lymphocytosis (25 %), with helper/suppressor ratio of 8, 4 (N = 0,87 \u2022 0,15). Angiotensin converting enzyme level was 504 UI/I (N = 60-135). Polarized light examination of another lymph node biopsy and of liver biopsy showed abnormal particles inside granulomas. X-rays microprobe analysis did not find silicone but demonstrated whewellite deposits also recognized by infrared spectroscopy. Corticotherapy (2 mg/kg/day) induced dramatic general improvement. Hepatosplenomegaly, lymph nodes and fever disappeared. In conclusion, the cllnical presentation of this patient was similar to that of HD patients with granulomatosis induced by silicone deposits. But, in the present case, the granulomas appear to have developped around oxalate deposits, which, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously. The inhibition of the biological activity of insulin -like growth factors in renal insufficiency is not understood. It has been said that the excess of Insuline-like growth factor Binding proteins (IGF BP) may explain this phenomenon (1). We have studied the IGF BP in seven haemodialysed children (aged 8-14 1/2 yrs), with severe growth retardation. The mean Height Standard Deviation Score (Ht SDS) i for chronological age was -3,4 (0 to -11). A standardized insulin or glucagon kerlon GH provocation test was carried out. Six children had a GH peak above 10 ng/ml. A normal night GH profil was ,observed in the seventh child. Plasma IGF I, determined by specificl RIA, was normal. Analysis of the IGF BP using western ligand blotting was carried out before and after haemodialysis. This method reveals five IGF BP with molecular weight of 24, 30, 34,39 and 42 Kda, When .separated by western blotting, the sera showed a ':significant increase of IGF BP1 (30 KDa protein) and IGF BP2 (34 K Da protein). IGF BP3 (39 and 42 K Da proteins) seemed to be' slightly reduced. The IGF BP profil was not modified by haemodialysis. These results confirm a modification of the IGF BP in renal insufficiency.The abnormalities are similar to some previous results (2) but differ from others (1) . Future studies will be necessary to elucidate the role of these proteins in modulating the actions of the Nutritional status, assessed by anthropometric and biochemical methods, and muscle water, protein and amino acid composition, were evaluated in ii TxC and in a control group of i0 children with normal renal function who were undergoing elective surgery. Samples of the rectus abdominis muscle were taken when surgery was performed in the control children and when the peritoneal catheter was removed in TxC. Height was reduced in the TxC compared to the controls but skinfold thickness, arm muscle circumference and serum proteins were normal.The muscle content of total, extra and intraeellular water, and of alkali-soluble proteins (ASP), DNA and the ASP-DNA ratio in TxC was not significantly different from that in the controls, although a high significant correlation (r= -0.864) between the prednisone dose and the ASP/DNA ratio in muscle it was found. Plasma leucine level was significantly decreased, whereas plasma citrulline, alanine + taurine levels and the glycine/serine ratio were increased. Muscle threonine, aspartic acid, taarine + alanine and glycine levels as well as the glycine/serine ratio were iareased in TxC. Our data show that three months after transplantation, during corticosteroid therapy and despite its influence on muscle protein content, nutritional status and muscle composition were well preserved At the same time it was possible to evidentiate a near normal muscle AA pattern and plasma AA abnormalities which can be related to the prednisone therapy. The early correction in TxC of plasma and muscle AA abnorma]ities observed in chronic renal failure can be considered a further confirmation of the fundamental role of uremia itself in their genesis. The aim of our study was to deteamine B in children under hemodialysis (ED) treatment. We measured B in g children (3 boys and 6 girls), 7-18 years old, average 12 years, before and after every ED within 6 weeks. 27 adults on HD were measured for comparison. B was measured using a tetrapolar method, almost insensitive to the electrode-skin impedance, in supine position with 2 Silver-Trace electrodes on right am and 2 on right leg in the same place. We used MTT-01 device (Medical Electronics) Czech made, using 50 k~z and 800 uA. The number of repeated measurements ranged from 6-18, average 13.5. Our results: l.There are very high individual differences in B and total body water expressed as % of body weight (TBW%) in individual patients using the same method of treatment, calculated from equation TBW% = [height(am) z* 67.6] / [B(oh~) * weight(kg)] 2.The reproducibility of individual measurements is very good, the standard error was in range 1.9-4% . 3.The TBW% in adult~ before ED was significantly higher compared to children and adolescents (p<~,02).",

The most significant loss in all growth parameters occurred during the first 6 months with iO of 12 patients showing growth loss to an average length of -1.9 SDS. The maximum decline in growth measurements occurred at 12 months: L-SDS=-2.2; W-SDS=-I.7; BMI=-3.7. While ponderal indices (W-SDS and dBMI) showed recovery during the second year, LV-SDS remained negative and length S~S stabilized near -2 SDS. LV-SDS did not correlate with either nutrient intakes or degree of renal insufficiency at any age. However, average LV-SDS did relate significantly and inversely to C-terminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Our observations suggest that the critical period of growth loss in uremic infants is during the first 6 months of life when nutrient intakes are poorly controlled and requirements may exceed RDA. Inadequately treated bone disease as evidenced by elevated PTH had a negative impact on linear growth predicting the need for closer monitoring of Vitamin D therapy in these infants.

            "text": "Growth defect remains a problem in chronic renal failure, particularly during infancy which is normally associated with high growth velocity. Data on growth in uremic infants remain scarce. The aim was to describe growth in infants with well controlled treatment and steady GFR and to compare periods with different growth velocity. Twelve infants aged 1-10 months, with GFR ranging from 6 to 40 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (mean: 18.7 + 2.8), were followed for at least one year. Ten were growth retarded (-4.0 to -0.5 SD) and two had a normal height for age. Protein diet was 100% RDA (2.0-2.2 g/kg/day) as human milk or 60% RDA (1.3 g/kg/day) plus essential amino-acids. Energy intake was 100% RDA; it was increased if growth was lagging and was reduced if obesity developed. Tube feeding was necessary in 7/12 infants. Mineral and vitamin supplements were added when required. During follow-up length for age improved in 4 infants (+0.5 to +1.5 SD), remained on the same SD in 5,~ and deteriorated in 3 (-1.5 to -1.0 SD). Weight for age increased in 7 (+0.5 to +3.8), remained on the same SD in 3, and decreased in 2 (-0.5 SD). At last evaluation, 4 children were between -2.0 and -3.0 SD, 3 between -2.0 and -1.0 SD, 4 between -1.0 and normal mean, and one was on +0.5 SD. Energy intake had been reduced to 70-80% RDA in 4 infants, increased in 3, and left near 100% RDA in 5. Mean resting energy expenditure in the fed state, measured in 7 infants by indirect calorimetry, was 60.2 \u2022 1.8 kcal/kg/day. Mean nitrogen balance under human milk (n = 7) was +340 + 5.0 mg/kg/day. All infants had normal blood pressure, normal acido-basic and hydro-electrolytic status, normal plasma albumin and transferrin levels. All had low plasma phosphorus (P) with high total and ionized calcium levels, as usually found in breast-fed infants. Plasma intact PTH was normal in all but 3. Comparing infants with stable, improved or decreased height for age, we found no difference in all the parameters investigated, particularly GFR, protein diet and blood urea, energy intake and energy expenditure, weight for height SD and biological data including plasma P and PTH. In conclusion: in well managed children growth velocity is normal in the majority of cases, but catch-up growth remains rare and height SD loss still occurs. These differences are accounted for by none of the currently available measured parameters and remain unexplained. We studied night time 12-hour plasma GH and GH-BP profiles, GH response to clonidine and IGF-I in 15 prepubertal ~hildren (10M, 5F) with CRF (GFR <25 ml/min/l.73m ~) (8 hemo, 5 peritoneal dialysis) 8.1!I.0 yrs (m\u2022 height SDS -2.5\u2022 and 30 prepuhertal age and sex matched normal short children (NS) height -2.3\u2022 SDS. Spontaneous (area under the curve) and stimulated GH (mcg/L) were significantly higher in the CRF (96~45 and 32.7+9.2) than in the NS patients (36.5+6 and 21.5+7.1 ) respectively (p<0.O01). GH-BP (mean 12hr, % of normal adult plasma) was lower in the CRF than in the NS subjects (45_+6.5 vs 59.5~7.6 respectively p<0.01). IGF-I levels were similar in both groups. Height velocity (cm/yr) after GH therapy (Serono and Novo-Nordisk, 0.125 U/kg/day in CRF and 0.i U/kg/day in NS) increased from 4.0\u2022 to 7.1 and from 3.8~0.8 to 8.4+1.2 respectively (p NS). The increment in weight increment was significantly smaller in the CRF patients. GH therapy induced a smaller increment in GH-BP and IGF-I (nMol/L) in the CRF as compared to the NS group (18.1\u2022 and 4.7\u2022 vs 28.1\u2022 and 8.4+6.3 respectively p<0.01). Both GH-BP and IGF-I are dependent on nutritional status. A partial explanation to the difference between the groups is that both caloric intake and weight gain were beter in the NS than in the CRF patients. Growth retardation is a frequent sequelae of CRF in children, and the prognosis for normal adult height is poor. We assessed the efficacy and safety of human growth hormone (hGH) in the treatment of such children. Nine children with CRF (M6, F3) m+gD 10.2+3.9 ~ (3.7-16.3y) were treated with r-hGH (Saizen Serene), 4 H/m /d s.c. Four patients were on chronic dialysis 2 and the remaining 5 had GFR values from iO to 17 ml/min/l.73m . Patients were measured every 3 mos. and bone age (BA) was determined prior to therapy and at 6 mos. of treatment. After 6 mos. of r-hGH therapy, growth velocity (GV) increased by a meanof 2.6!2.7 em/y (95% C.I.: 0.6-4.7), p ~ 0.05. Dividing the patients into 2 groups according to whether they were on chronic dialysis, the mean increment in GV was 4.1+2.4 cm/y (95% C. The treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is still a much debated question; particularly there is considerable controversy regarding the management of severe VUR in neonates (especially VUR bilateral grade 5/5, because of its likely development towards chronic renal failure (CRF)). In many instances a medical prophylactic treatment is adopted by those who rely on a spontaneous disappearance of VUR. Those who favour temporary diversion (cystostomy) try to avoid the infections that may occur during medical treatment and the possibility of complications due to early surgical treatment.",

Despite the obvious appeal of treatin~g meflux by a brief endoscopic procedure, concern remains about the long term safety of substances currently employed, particularly with regard to migration to distance organs. Under general anesthesia, 5 dogs were injected endoscopically with small volumes of Teflon paste in the manner used to correct reflux in children. Teflon particles were recovered from the lungs and brain within one week of injection. Long term cerebral changes induded pedvascuiar exudates and patchy demyelinatioa. Morphometric studies of alternative substances ~ currently in use, e.g., collagen and silicon paste show that these also contain small particles and are therefore likely to pose the same hazard. Lower urinary tract obstruction in the fetus is associated with poor perinatal outcome. A!though animal studies have demonstrated that early urinary decompression prevents lung hypoplasia and renal dysplasia, vesico-amniotic shunting has yielded disappointing results. Careful selection of ,pregnancies for prenatal treatment is crucial. Once other abnormalities have been excluded, the degree of renal damage is the major determinant of outcome. However, the antenatal assessment of fetal renal function is not standardized. Oligohydramnios is a poor prognostic sign, but is related more to the degree of obstructio6 than to urine production. In detecting the presence of urinary tract abnormalities, antenatal ultrasound has been reported to achieve sensitivity and specificity as high as 88% and 99% respectively. Identification of the specific pathology is however inaccurate, in particular, with respect to the upper urinary tract, misdiagnoses between hydronephrotic and multicystic kidneys have been reported in up to 53% of cases. Although the characteristic ultrasound appearances are distinct, gross pelvi-calyceal dilatations and multicystic kidneys with a large dominant cyst are indeed difficult to differentiate even postnatally. Since up to 40-50% of newborns with hydronephrosis require surgery, whereas conservative management is increasingly adopted for multicystic dysplasia, more accurate methods of antenatal diagnosis would facilitate prenatal counselling and postnatal investigation.",

            "text": "In order to facilitate differential diagnosis and antenatal assessment of renal damage in fetuses with lower urinary tract obstruction, urine has been aspirated from bladder or kidneys in a number of fetuses with urinary tract abnormalities and in a control group of 26 fetuses with normal amniotic fluid volume and anatomy ranging from 16-33 weeks' gestation. In the control group, urinary sodium and phosphate decreased and creatinine increased with gestational age, suggesting increasing glomerular filtration rate and progressive maturation of tubular function. Urinary sodium and calcium were significantly higher in fetuses with renal dysplasia compared with those with lower urinary tract obstruction but normal renal histology or normal clinical outcome. The highest sensitivity in the diagnosis of renal dysplasia was achieved by urinary calcium (100%), while sodium yielded the best specificity (80%). In doubtful cases, serial urinary samples, but not the determination of bladder pressure, helped in identifying those fetuses which might benefit from intrauterine shunting. Urinary I]-2microglobulin and NAG appeared to decrease with gestation in fetuses with or without renal dysplasia. Multiple regression analysis showed that this change with gestation is independent of urinary sodium only for NAG, but not for 8-2microglobulin. In the assessment of upper urinary tract lesions, urinary concentrations of sodium, calcium and phosphate were sigrlificantly lower in hydronephrotic than in multycystic kidneys, whereas urea and creatinine levels were higher. Determination of urinary phosphate enabled differential diagnosis with no false positive or negative cases. Amongst hydronephrotic kidneys, no biochemical parameter accurately predicted postnatal function, although creatinine was increased in all non-functioning kidneys. The degree of impairment of renal function in hydronephrotic kidneys, as documented by the urinary concentration of sodium, correlated with gestational age. Since the duration of hydronephrosis has a negative effect on renal function, the current policy of expectant management with antenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis warrants review. Fetal obstruction of the urinary tract may have a variety of consequences, including perinatal death, renal failure in infancy, or survival withour sequelae. In 101 consecutive cases of prenatally diagnosed bilateral obstructive uropathy, 15 fetal urinary parameters were determined. In order to identify prenatal factors predictive of postnatal renal function in childhood, survivors were followed prospectively from prenatal life to at least one year postnatally. A significant positive correlation was found between fetal urinary 112 microglobulin and serum creatinine at the age of one year (r=0,78, p<0.OOO1). For the prenatal prediction of high postnatal serum creatinine, the fetal urinary level of I]2 microglobuline was both specific and sensitive, sodium was sensitive but lacked specificity, glucose, phosphorus, calcium, osmolarity, and total proteins were specific, but lacked sensitivity. Our results provide a new approach for prenatal management of congenital obstructive uropathies, by allowing prenatal identification of the fetuses at risk for survival with postnatal renal failure. These fetuses might benefit from in utero therapy, while no attemps at prenatal uro-amniotic shunting should be made when a sponteously good outcome ~s predicted by fetal urinalysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first successful attempt at prenatal prediction of postnatal function after one year of life. The dilatation leads to a flap valve mechanism and to a functional obstruction of the bladder outlet and finally to secondary dilatation of the upper urinary tract.",

The second layer is placed in a simple interrupted fashion through the subcutaneous tissue in such a manner as to cover the original suture line.

We routinely use a Firlit-Kluge urethral stent placed into the bladder and leave it in place for one week. A double layer bit-occlusive dressing is applied cireunfferentiany to the penile shaft. Optimal management of children with gross vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) andrenal dysplasia (RD) remains unsettled. We reviewed 8 patients with gross VUR associated with RD, treated and followed up in our departments since their birth, with reference to their management (operative vs. non-operative) and outcome. All patients (6 boys, 2 girls) were initially seen between l and8weeks of age. Initial plasma creatinine levels ranged between 2.2-2.7 mg/dl, and all had gross (gradeV) bilateral VUR. 2patients presented with febrile urinary infection, 6 with failure to thrive and 2 following prenatal U/S diagnosis. BPwas normal in all of them. 4patients were managed with primary ureteric reimplantation and 4 conservatively with continuous chemoproph~(laxis for at least 5 years. Assessment of renal function (RF] at the end of a 5-year period showed no differences in plasma creatinine level between the surgical (mean: 2.6, range: 1.8-3.2 mg/dl) and non-surgical (mean: 2.8, range: 2.1-2.gmg/dl)group. Thefrequency of break through urinary infection was identical in both groups (total: 4 episodes/group or O.2/pt/year). At the end of follow up, 2/8 ureters in the surgical groupand 7/8 ureters in the nonsurgical group werestill refluxing (>grade Ill). These data indicate that anti-reflux surgery does not affect the longterm outcome of RF in neonates with gross VUR and RD. If urinary infection can be sufficiently suppressed with chemoprophylaxis, conservative management with appropriate nephrological monitoring can be the primary mode of treatment. This prospective study was designed to establish the natural history of primary VUR, according to sex and grade. The criterion for entering the study was VUR identified during the investigation that follows a urinary tract infection (UTI). At entry, VUR was diagnosed by micturating cystogram. During follow-up, direct radionuclide cystogram (DRC) was repeated yearly. Reflux nephropathy (RN) was diagnosed by DMSA scan at entry and during follow-up. Two hundred-two children (mean-age: 31.5 + 23.3 months; 43 males and 159 females) were enrolled in the study. There were 314 refluxing ureters. High-grade VUR occurred in 141 ureters and low-grade in 163 ureters. The diagnosis of VUR was made significantly earlier in boys than in girls, both in low and high grade VUR (p<0.001). At entry, RN was present, on DMSA scan, in 44% of the 314 refluxing kidneys. There was no significant difference among boys and girls in the prevalence of RN. The renal lesions were more severe in boys, independently of the grade of VUR (p<O.05) Breakthrough UTI was significantly more common in girls compared to boys, both in low and high grade VUR (p<0.05). Mean follow-up was 68.7 __+ 31.2 months. Child's age at the time of the first of two DRC without VUR was considered the age of spontaneous resolution of VUR. Using life-tables estimations and analyzing data stratified to patient's sex and grade of VUR, we found that although VUR lasted longer in boys compared to girls, this difference was not statistically significant. During follow-up, 7 children developed new scars, related to breakthrough UTI. There was no significant difference among boys and girls on development of new scars. To better understand the natural history of VUR, children must be stratified by sex and grade of VUR. Prenatal diagnosis offers a good opportunity to study the natural history of vesicoureteric reflux prior to infections (UT]) We diagnosed primary VUR witha rnicturating cystogram, within the first two weeks of life, in 22 infant. ~ (34 ref!uxing kidneys), w~e,l~ a prenatally recognized hydronephrosis. 18 were Males (29 refluxing kidneys) and 4 Were Females (5 refluxing kidneys).

Eight children underwent transurethral incision (TUI) of the uretarocele as their primary therapy, six had a partial nephrouretereetomy of the ureterocele segment and one ureterocele disappeared without treatment. The mean follow up was 30 months. The children all had a renal ultrasound and a voiding cystourethrogram performed to doetmaent the anatomy, and either an excretory urogram or renal scintigraphy preoperatively to evaluate the presence of absence of function in the renal segment subtended by the ureteroeele. In those cases with a functioning upper pole moiety preoperatively, TUI ureterocele preserved or improved function in the hydronephrotic segment, but when no evidence of function was noted preoperatively, TUI did not result in the return of any function. The ureterocele segments treated by partial nephrourcterectomy did not demonstrate any evidence of function preoperatively & all demonstrated histologic evidence of severe dysplasin inconsistent with the potential return of renal function. Following TUI of the ureterocele, reflux into the ureteroccle segment was documented in only one third of cases & thus far has not required surgical intervent/on.

We conclude that all neonates with duplex collecting systems & a ureterocele should have a conical renal scan to evaluate function in the upper pole segment subtended by the ureterocele.

This would seem to cast a doubt upon the conception that antenstally detected megamnter is a different entity from that in diagnosed later. Four patients with Type III posterior urethral valves are discussed. Two infants presented at two months of age with failure to thrive and renal insufficiency, one as a newborn with Potter's facies and bronchopulmonary dysplasia and one as a premature newborn with oligohydra~mios. In all four cases a urethral catheter could not be passed into the bladder. In Case 1 a retrograde urethrogram allowed contrast to go beyond the valvular obstruction into the bladder and in the three subsequent cases suprapubic percutaneous cystograms were performed. All revealed large smooth-walled bladders and small \"beak-like\" posterior urethras. In case i, rm/itiple attempts to pass a urethral catheter failed and he was managed with icop-c~taneous ureterostomy. He later required transpubic urethroplasty for dense stricture, secondary to repeated urethral trauma. Two infants were managed with vesicostomy and later transurethral valve ablation. One child died of respiratory failure shortly after birth. Of the three survivors, one has undergone transplantation and two have renal insufficiency. Thirteen additional cases of Type III valves have been reported in the past, for a total of 17 cases. Age of presentation ranged from one day to six years with clinical histories ranging from azotemia in infancy to mild dysuria in older boys. In 5 cases difficulty to catheterize was noted. Ten died and 4 have known renal insufficiency. The unusual smooth bladder and narrow posterior urethra were described.

The primary indications for these tissues arc in those patients who have functioning kidneys but who have renal insufficiency where the metabolic problems might be obviated. To date we have used the stomach in bladder reconstruction in 4 patients. These include a patient with an exstrophy of the bladder, 1 patient with myelomenigocele, 1 patient with posterior urethral valves and a patient with an end stage bladder secondary to multiple operations for vesicouretaral reflux. Besides using the bladder, we have recently had experience with two patients where massively dilated ureters have been used for bladder rccoustrruction including one patient with end stage renal disease secondary to prune belly syndrome and a patient with renal insufficiency and posterior urethral valves. The bladder capacity in all six patients has increased dramatically & the compliance most importantly, has been improved on urodynamic studies. All patients with uretero-cystoplasty & two with gastrocystoplasty void spontaneously to completion whereas the final 2 do require clean intermittent catheterization.

All received 100% RDA for proteins (2.0-2.2 g/kg/day) and energy, with tube-feeding when necessary (i-e 6 infants). The dietary P (25-30 mg/kg/day), Ca (70-80 mg/kg/day) and vitamin D (9-10 IU/kg/day) were the same in all children. During follow-up, 4 children remained on the same SD, 2 lost height SD (-1.0 and -1.5) and 2 had catch-up growth (+1.0 SD). Plasma P ranged from 0.76 to 1.80 mmol/1 (mean: 1.43 + 0.10) with total Ca ranging from 2.16 to 3.01 mmol/1 (mean: 2.61 + 0.03) and ionized Ca (Ca ++) ranging from 1.13 to 1.61 mmol/1 (mean: 1.36 + 0.03). Plasma P was lower in infants with lowest GFR; TRP was low in all (mean: 69 + 8 %). The high plasma Ca and Ca ++ levels led to give small amounts of vitamin D (< 0.1 p.g/day 1-alfa) or to withdraw it. All children had normal (10-25 ng/ml) 1-84 PTH levels, except one who had both low GFR (7 ml/min/1.73 m e) and low 25 and 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D levels (6 ng/mt and 14 pg/ml). Two further infants developed a rapid rise in PTH (533 and 783 pg/ml), when given P supplement. Two developed rickets with high alkaline phosphatases (around 1000 IU/ml): one had received Ca supplement resulting in dietary Ca/P ratio > 4, and one had low plasma t,25 (OH)2 vitamin D levels with low GFR. In conclusion: feeding human milk supply low amounts of P resulting in low P and high Ca values, which are also observed in normal breast-fed infants without adverse effects",

Recent advances in immunology, surgery, and dialysis have rendered pediatric renal transplantation almost routine. But new challenges have appeared for clinicians and patients; novel drugs, a shortage of donor organs, recurrent renal disease, late complications, increasing risks from transfusion, et cetera. This symposium brings together four preeminent clinicians, collectively representing more than one century of practical experience in the arena of pediatric nephrology and -transplantation. They will comment on various facets of pediatric renal transplantation today: Professor Michel Broyer (Paris) presents data on the long term outcomes of transplanted children.

University Hospitals of D-7800 Freiburg and IB-2650 Edegem/AntwerpGlomerular and proximal tubular function was analyzed in 10 children treated with IFO (2-9 g/m2*cycle) according to the protocols NHL-BFM 90, ALL-BFM 90, CESS 86, CWS 86, HIT 90 and MAKEI 86. 26 cycles were analyzed before and during, 13 cycles additionally 2-3 days after IFO treatment and compared with a group of 23 normal children and a diuresis group (31/m2*d) (n=10). Tubular enzymes of different cell compartments (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), alanine-aminopeptidase (AAP), fructose 1-6 bisphosphatase (FBP)) were measured to detect proximal tubular damage. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) was measured as specific marker of the S3-segment. Proximal tubular reabsorption capacity was monitored by ~I-and B2-microglobulin (~I-MG,B.-MG) and fractional ' ; ' phosphate reabsorptlon. Albumln excretlon and creatinine-clearance were chosen as glomerular parameters. Results= Significant increase and pathologic values could be seen in 7/7 proximal tubular parameters during IFO and in 4/7 (NAG, AAP, ~I-MG, IAP) 2-3 days after IFO. Increased MG excretion was of tubular origin, proved by constant MG serum levels, increased MG clearance and fractional excretion. No significant changes were seen with the glomerular markers. A significant but comparatively small increase in tubular (AAP, FBP, ~I-MG, 6.-MG) but not in glomerular markers could be observed in the diuresis group. Conclusion: In spite of nephroprotection (MESNA and hydration), chemotherapy with IFO caused renal proximal tubular but not qlomerular damage.",

National University of Singapore, Singapore 0511.. In lupus nephritis (LN), the plenmorphic histological appearance of glomerular endothelial, mesangial and epithelial cell proliferation in association with infiltration by mononuclear cells suggest a possible role of cytoldne-mediated immune interaction. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on cells is a prerequisite for immune recognition by activated T-cells. This study investigated the role of cytoldnes in modulating MHC expression on endothelial cells (EC) in LN. ECs were isolated from human umbilical cords by collagenase digestion and cultured in complete M199 media on 96-well microtiter trays. Sera from 40 LN patients and 31 healthy controls were added in quadruplicates at 10% v/v and 72 hours post-stimulation when the ECs had reached confluency, MHC class I (MHC-I) and II (MHC-II) expression were measured by an EIA using the monoclonal antibodies (Ab) W6/32 and L243 respectively. Intefferon-z (IFN-~-) stimulated cells were used as positive controls. A stimulation index (SI) was derived: OD(test)/OD(standard). The mean SI for MHC-[ of active LN patients (1.29+0.29) was higher than inactive patients (1.12_+0.18)(p<0.04) and controls (1.01 +0.10)(p<0.0001). Of the 17 LN patients who showed upregulation of MHC-I, 65% had concomitant MHC-II induction. To identify the possible cytokines involved in the modulation of MHC expression, inhibition studies were performed using polyclonal Abs to tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), lymphotoxin (TNF-B), IFN-r, IFN-a and IFN-B. Preincobation of sera with Ab to TNF-o~ and INF-B in some patients resulted in loss of ability to upregulate MHC-I on ECs. Hence the cytoldnes TNF-a and IFN-a may be important in modulating MHC expression of ECs in some patients with active LN, thereby facilitating the immune injury.

IL-6 was detectible over 10 pg/ml ( limit of detection ) in all children but 2 with steroid sensitive and I with steroid resistant NS. No significant correlation was found between urinary IL-6 and protein levels.The values of IL-6 in steroid sensitive NS (61 ~ 9.0 pg/ml, M ~ m) were not significantly different compared with steroid resistant NS (133 ~ 62 pg/ml). Regarding the morphological variant of GN, the levels of IL-6 were: FSGS -35 and 30 pg/ml; membranoproliferative GN -14 and 20 pg/ml. High levels of IL-6 were detected in 5 from 8 patients with mesangial proliferative GN -374 + 64 pg/ml, whereas 3 other had 21 + 5 pg/ml. Our--preliminary data demonstrate the presence of IL-6 in urine of children affected by different forms of glomerulonmphritis with nephrotic syndrome. This may suggest the involvement of IL-6 in pathogenesis of GN in children as potential growth factor produced by a variety of cells including cells of renal origin.

Miler. A. Wawro. K. Kilis-Ps!rusitisk~ Department of the Pediatric Nephrotogy, Medical Academy, Wroct'aw Poland. The aim of Ihe study was to investigate Ihe clinical course and the results of treatment in 14 children with glomerulonephritis, in the course of Schoenlein-Henoch disease. The group under investigation consisted of 5 boys and 9 girls aged from 4.5 to 15 years, with the mean age of 5.7~ Typical skin lesions were observed in aN of these children, problems with joints occurred in 4 patients, 5 children complained of abdominal discomfort which in 2 of them had acute, severe character. Nephrotic syndrome was found in 6 patients. Histopatological studies revealed changes typical for glomerulonephritis: segmentalis ac. (4), mesangio-proliferativa (4), focalis (3), mesangio-capillaris (2), submicroscopica (1). All children with nephrotic syndrome were administered prednisone in the dose of I-2 mg/k.g of body weight. In 5 cases pulse doses of steroids were given m intravenous infusions in the form of methylprednisolone spurt, in the daily do~s of 30 mg/kg. In 4 cases chlorambucil was used. Complele recovery, was obtained in 10 children, slight proteinuria and haematuria persist in 3 children, and in one patient the nephrotic syndrome is still present. None of the patients had persistent renal insufficiency. Conclusion: In cases resistant to the conventional methods of treatment, pulse doses of steroids administered in intravenous infusions may be helpful in the treatment of Schoenlein-Henoch glomerulopathy.

This study refers to cases with Wilms tumor admitted & operated in pediatric surgery clinics in the university centers in Romania & it establishes the impact of some factors on the incidence of this tumor in children, as: -Radiation (the effect of Chernobil, Ukraine, Kozlodui Bulgary) -High frequency of the urogenital malformations (as a consequence of the law which forbade abortions). -Malnutrition -Irrational chemurgy of the agriculture -Other chemical factors We made a map of Romania which contains the main endemic zones of Wilms tumor in children and the correlations with the above mentioned factors and the ponderosity of some in different zones. Prognosis was determined by histology and sta#ng of the tumor. The results of our study represent a material for the ecologists and other responsible factors from Romania and in the same time an alarm sign for other countries.

Histological examination showed a typical membrano-proliferative glomeralonephritis with unusual tubular dilatations filled with large plasma protein-casts and prominent degenerative changes of visceral epithelium on one hand, and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates with edema, on the other hand. These histologic changes suggested the pattern of HIVassociated Nephropathy i.e. the nephropathY of HIV infection. The subsequent serologic testing for AIDS indicated that the patient was positive.

A researcher unaware of the case or control status administered tests on cognitive ability, behaviour, and academic achievement.Results: HUS patients had numerically lower cognitive and achievement scores and higher behaviour problem ratings than their controls on every measure (p<0.001, binomial test). Trends (0.01 <p<0.10) were evident for the Wechsler Full Scale and verbal IQ scores (Verbal IQ mean+SD: 104.5+16 vs 113.6+13.35; p=0.04) and for measures of attention, reading comprehension, and vocabulary.Conclusion: These results provide preliminary evidence of a post-HUS central nervous system deficit, and deserve further investigation in a larger study.",

Haack, the pituitary adrenocortical axis have been described in adult patients with CRF. We examined plasma concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulfate (DHEA-S) and androstenedione (AND) in 59 male pediatric patients, pubertal (genital/breast) stage (PS) 1-5, at different stages of CRF and compared them with 58 male controls (C). Blood was taken at 7 am. In prepubertal dialyzed (D) children DHEA (72 _+ 27 ng/dl vs 205 + 134 in C) and DHEA-S (12 + 17 ng/dl vs 94 + 76 ~ C) were decreased (p <0.05), whilst on conservative therapy (CT) they were within normal limits. In mid-pubertal D pts (PS 2/3) DHEA-S was also decreased (45 + 34 ug/dl vs 149 + 110, p <0.05). AND was high--in preand mid-pubertal pts on CT (50 + 3.3 ng/dl vs 24 + 20 in C, ns) but normal in D. In transplanted--pts the levels of all adrenal androgens were severely depressed, independent of PS. In conclusion, in D pts adrenal androgen production from zona reticularis is reduced before start of puberty, whilst in CT and D pts androstanedione is normal or elevated which is compatible with a relative stimulation of the ACTH dependent zona fasciculata responsible for hypercortisolism in CRF. Low androgen levels in TP pts seem to be related to steroid medication.

The anti-HCV positive samples ~ere further assayed by 4-RIBA (Orto Diagnostics) and PCR for HDV-RNA detection. 5 ~ genome non ceding region primers ~ere used. The asseciations aith some variables such as dialysis duration, number of ~Lood transfusions and ALT level ~ere also evaluated. The statistical analysis uas performed by means of t-student test for unpaired data. Results: 3 out of 20 (15 Z) under HD and 7 out of 55 (21 g) TP patients resulted positive to both anti-HCV EL~SA and 4-RIBA tests.

Boston, MA. 02114, USA.In vitro studies suggest that there is a shift in \"set-point\" for PTH secretion: however, this issue has not been addressed in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Thus, we studied 17 dialyzed pts aged 15+ 2 yr (SD) on CCPD for 23 _+ 14 mo. and 14 volunteers aged 21 +__ 2 yr. All subjects received a two hour intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate (2-8 mg/kg/hr) and sodium citrate 428-102 mg/kg/hr) hormone levels during acute changes in serum ionized calcium (ica). Serum iPTH (IRMA) and iCa were measured 20, i0 and 0 min before, and every i0 min during infusions. The \"set-point\" for calcium, defined as the level of iCa at which iPTH levels were reduced by 50% from maximum values was determined.None of the pts received calcitriol for 4 wks prior to testing, and 14 of 17 had bone biopsy evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism.Conclusion: The \"set-point\" for PTH secretion did not differ between the two groups.Serum iCa increases more rapidly in nl subjects.P-IVA.29 EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT ORAL PHOSPHATE TREATMENT ALONE IS NOT A CAUSE OF NEPHROCALCINOSIS IN HEREDITARY HYP0PHOSPHA-TEMIC RICKETS.

Path.~ Chaim Sheba Med. Cent., and the Dept. of Computer Systems, Tel Aviv Univ., Israel.The treatment of X-linked Hypophosphatemia (HLX) consists of pharmacological doses of vitamin D metabolites (Vit;D) and oral phosphate supplementation (PiTt). Transient increase in urinary calcium (U Ca) excretion, and in serum calcium (Ca) levels are well known signs of Vit.D intoxication. However, despite careful control of U Ca excretion, the danger of nephrocalcinosis (NC) in treated patients has been emphasized. Therefore, it has recently been suggested, that PiTt by itself, or PiTt induced hyperoxaluria (a type of enteric hyperoxaluria) might be a causative factor of NC other than Ca in these trated XLH patients. In order to assess this important pathophysiological issue, we measured urinary oxalate (U Oxal) and phosphate (U Pi) excretion in 12 No correlation was found between the dosage of oral phosphate supplements or U Pi excretion and U Oxal excretion, either in the HHRH or in the XLH groups. MC presenting as hyDerechogenicity of the medullary pyramids was found in 2 of the 5 XLH patients and only in 2 HHRH patients who had been treated with excessive dosages of Vit.D and calcium prior to the true diagnosis. We conclude: I. PiTt alone is not a cause of NC in Hereditary Hypophosphatemic Rickets; 2. In XLH patients NC seems due to Vit.D overdosage at one stage or another of the long term treatment, or to a lack of compliance in PiTt leading to repeated transient undetected hyperealciuric episodes.P-IVA.30 RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY AND GROWTH IN CHILDREN UNDERGOING CAPD K.litaka*, T.Ito, M.Hojo, S.Horiike, T.Sakai Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan 228",

The effects of rhGH therapy on calcium regulation in SSG children without growth hormone (GH) deficiency are unknown. We prospectively studied 12 prepubartal SSG children (9 boys and 3 girls) with normal 24 hour GH secretion profiles. Ages ware 4.9 to 12 years (mean 9.6). rhGH was administered on six days par week subcutaneously, mean dose of 0.55 U/kg/wk. The results (expressed as means _ SD) ware: Nine boys with severe chronic renal failure aged between 4.8 and 15.6 years at the onset of the study, who have previously been reported after one year's treatment, have hada further 12 months' therapy with recombinant human growth hormone (Genotropin, Kabi, 30 IU/m2/week). They have continued on a strict low protein, low phosphate diet supplemented with keto and amino forms of the essential amino actds and histidine and additional ener~. They have been divided into two groups -prepubertai (testlcular volume <8 ml at end of treatment, n=5) and pubertal (testicular volume >8 mi, n=4).Mean height velocity in both groups remained significantly greater in the second year of treatment compared with at the onset of the study two years previously, but growth proceeded at a lesser rate than in the first year. The rate of deterioration of renal function remained unchanged compared with the firstyear although five children entered the dialysis program during this second year as predicted. Bone age advanced 12 months during the second 12 month period. There appeared to be no ill effects.Recombinant human growth hormone appears to be safe and effective in treating children with chronic renal failure for two years, although the growth rate, while remaining improved, slows down in the second year of treatment. We sought to determine if the anabolic effect of treatment with growth hormone in chronic renal failure (CRF) may sufficiently reduce renal solute load to slow deterioration in gllomerular filtration rate (GFR). Seven children, aged 2 -1 years, with moderately severe CRF (GFR 10 -24 ml/min/1.73 m 2) were treated with daily subcutaneous human growth hormone, 1 U/kg/week for 12 months. As expected, mean growth velocity increased from 5.1 cm/year (range 1.4 -9.4) to 9.5 cm/year (range 6.3 -11.1) and height standard deviation scores improved from -3.2 below the mean (range -2.0 to -4.4) to -2.4 (range -1.2 to -4.0).In the 12 months before treatment with growth hormone, mean GFR fell from 19.3 ml/min/1.73 m 2 to 16.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2. In the next 12 months on growth hormone, mean GFR fell further to 13.5 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Therefore the rate of deterioration of GFR was unaffected during treatment with growth hormone. Plasma urea concentrations fell in most patients during the first month of growth hormone treatment from a mean of 20.0 mmol/1 pretreatment to 14.8 mmol/1 after one month (p = 0.006) but then slowly returned to pretreatment levels over the next 12 months.We concluded that GH treatment initially lowers blood urea concentrations in children with CRF, probably by stimulating anabolic incorporation of dietary nitrogen into body protein. Despite the reduction in renal solute load however, renal functional deterioration continued unchanged. Acromegaly, a state of excess GH has bean reported to be associated with hypertension possibly due to salt and water retention. We were therefore interested to find out if BP changes occur in the course of long-term treatment with GH in children with various causes for short stature. BP was measured in 175 children entering the GH treatment program at 8 week intervals using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Diastolic BP was recorded at Korotkoff 4 phase. Standard deviation scores (SDS) for BP were calculated from data of the Second Task Force on BP Control in Children 1987 (Pediatrics 1987;79: 1-25). Because these children were small for their chronological age (CA), BP SDS were calculated also for bone age (BA). Thus far, 85 children had completed more than 2.5 years of observation on GH treatment; range 2. Chronic renal failure (CRF) in the young is complicated by growth retardation, hyperpara--thyroidism and uremic osteodystrophy. Many children with CRF are now being treated with GH. GH has a direct mitogenic effect on osteoblasts in culture.We studied the effect of GH therapy on parameters affected by osteoblastic activity like serum alkaline phosphatase (AP), bone GLAprotein (BGP) and bone mass density (BMD, by duel photon absorption) in poorly growing children with and without CRF. Fifteen (4F/IIM) healthy children with short stature (SS) and ten (3F/7M) children on renal replacement therapy (RRT) (5 hemo,5 peritoneal dialysis) 4.5-12.4 years of age were treated with GH in a dose of 0.i-0.125 IU/Kg/Day daily (Bin-Technology General, Israel) for one year. IGF-I, BGP, and BMD of spine were determined before treatment and after one year. During 1 year of GH therapy the changes in the SS and RRT groups were 190% and 180% in height velocity (p<0.01), 12% and no change in bone mass density, 230 % and 190 % in IGF-I, 140% and 125% in AP, 45% and 40% in BGP in the respective groups. BGP was significantly higher in the RRT group. We conclude that GH treatment increases growth velocity, and IGF-I in both groups of patients. Increase in osteoblastic activity was greater in children without RRT. Center. Results are presented on the pediatric patients. They ( or their parents) were interviewed regarding eight variables-sex,treatment type,rellgion,education levels, fluency in Hebrew and other languages , income, self-assessment of compliance, and family support . They were asked to record a three consecutive day food intake (later computer analysed).Blood test results were monitored, including potassium, phosphorous, BUN( for HD) patients, total protein (CAPD) patients, and weight gain between dialyses ( for HD). Dietary parameters checked were potassium, phosphorus, protein ( gm/kg body weight) and fluid intake. Overall dietary compliance was assessed using a PKPF (phosphorus,potassium,protein and fluid) intake index for HD patients, and a PKP (phosphorus,potassium,protein) index for CAPD. These were correlated with blood test results. Most correlations were weak. The dietary PKPF/PKP index was checked against the variables. Significant differences were noted for treatment type, (HD patients showing better compliance), language fluency-( those with no knowledge of Hebrew showed significantly worse compliance) and meligionthe Jewish patients had better compliance than the non-Jewish, mainly Arab patients. There may also be a strong cultural factor. Results indicate the need to carry out further research and develop dietary teaching tools which incorporate awareness of language and cultural differences.",

            "text": "Urine formation starts around the 10th week of gestation. Fetal urine is the major constituent of amniotic fluid and its production increases progressively throughout gestation. It approaches 28 ml per min near term. The urine is hypotonic, with concentrations of sodium, chloride and glucose well below their plasma values. This indicates active solute reabsorption by the renal tubular cells. Fetal kidney or urine tract malformations may give rise to oligohydranmios and/or impaired solute reabsorption, as evidenced by increased fetal urine solute concentrations. Because the placenta functions as a hemodialyser perfectly adapted to the fetal needs, fetal growth and functional maturation do not appear to be governed by functional requirements. The fetal kidney participates, however, in the regulation of fetal arterial pressure and hormonal synthesis.Hormonal factors modulate the fetal circulation and renal hemodynamics. At low renal perfusion pressures, as present in the fetus, glomerular ultrafiltration, the rate of which is governed by the balance between afferent and efferent vascular tone, glomerular capillary permeability and area, and the plasma oncotic pressure, depends Closely on the efferent vasoconstriction maintained by angiotensin II. Other factors such as the renal sympathetic nervous system, the prostaglandins, the kallikrein-kinin system, and the atrial natriuretic peptide also seem to play key roles in modulating the development of renal hemodynamics.Clamping of the cord is the signal for a striking increase in renal function. GFR rises rapidly, its value doubling during the first two weeks of life. So do renal blood flow and solute reabsorptive capacity. Changes that seem to be responsible for the rapid maturation of renal function include a decrease in renal vascular resistance, an increase in systemic blood pressure and effective filtration pressure, and an increase in the glomerular permeability and filtering area. The hemodynamic changes occurring during maturation are also mediated by vasoactive substances such as the prostaglandins and angiotensin II.Overactivation of intrarenal vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II, thromboxane A2, leukotrienes and endothelin, may severely impair the renal perfusion during development.Such an overactivation may result from endogenous stresses (hypoxemia, hypovolemia, hypotension), or urinary obstruction.Interference with the synthesis of these agents may also have dramatic effects on the development of renal function. Clinical examples include the inhibition of PG synthesis by indomethacin, the inhibition of angiotensin II formation by converting enzyme inhibitors, and the stimulation of ctadrenergic receptors by drugs such as tolazoline. The role of more recently discovered vasoactive agents, such as the atrial natriuretic peptide, nitric oxide or endothelin, in protecting or impairing the function of the stressed immature kidney is the object of present investigations.

            "text": "Before the advent of antenatal ultrasound, congenital uropathias llke vesico ureteral were mainly discovered during evaluation of urinary tract infection.The increase of prenatal ultrasonograpby allows recognition of VUR in the asymptomatic neonate and offers the opportunity to study the natural history of tins ,common anomaly before urinary tract infection appears.Intra-renal reflux (IRR) is more frequently observed in neonates and infants than in other children. Sterile IRR is harmless but provides potential access for bacteria into the renal parenehyma. The combination of IRR and urinary infection leads to renal damage and scar formation which may be prevented by appropriate uatibacterial prophylaxis. A full investigation of the urinary tract is necesary if ultrasound performed at birth and at day 5 confirms hydronephrosis. Neonates are immediately given prophylactic antibacterial therapy. Mictudtion cystography is performed at the end of the first week when upper tract dilatation is found on pre and postnatal ultrasonography.Neonatal recognition of VUR shows a strong male preponderance similar to other types of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract; Even severe grade 4 VUR can disappear spontaneously in half of the eases and improve in a further quarter after two years. A longer follow-up would probably show that a majority of these VUR's are going to disappear since VUR observed at a later age is essentially a female pathology.Differential renal function assessment using 99m Te-DTPA is carried out in all infants at 1 month of age and repeated at 6 months and thereafter once a year. A progressive increase of the renal function related to normal renal maturation is complete after 2 years of life in most children. However, VUR is associated with a small & dyxplastie kidney in few eases. Kidney function is less than 20% as measured by 99m Te-DTPA and typical dysplastie lesions corresponding to embryological defects in relation with the ureteral bud mal-developmeot kidney theory of Stephans.Despite the conventional practice of administering low dose antibiotic prophyla)ds, the incidence of breakthrough urinary tract infectious has been Mgh in some series. In our experience, 15% of infants presented with a proven urinary infection (uptake defect on DSMA scan in the acute phase before 2 months of life in all cases.There is a close relation between the time of onset of the appropriate treatment and the development of renal lesions explaining in our series the rapid and good recovery on DSMA scan without deterioration of renal fanetion. Surgery has been reserved for neonates and infants with breakthrough infection: they are considered as being at high risk for kidney damage. This attitude does not imply that they would develop recurrent urinary infection and potential further renal lesions. Until this point is proven we adopt a cautious attitude meaning surgically correetlon of the VUR when appropriate antibacterial prophylaxis fails. The incidence of urethrccutaneous fistulae, the most common complication of hypospadias repair, can be reduced significantly by preventing crossing suture lines.",

            "text": "Virtually all modern hypospadias repairs involve the intersection of at least a portion of the urethroplasty and the skin closure. It is at this junction that fistulae occur most frequently.By interposing a layer of tissue between urethroplasty and skin these crossing suture lines can be prevented.Smith (1) introduced a two-stage hypospadias repair which utilized a de-epithelialized flap in a \"double~breasted\" style to cover a midline tubularized urethroplasty.Complications of this second stage were at a minimum.This same philosophy was then applied to the repair of urethrocutaneous fistulae (2, 3) and, finally, to single stage hypospadiaa repairs. (4) The de-epithelialized flap can be added to all types of hypospadias repair other than simple glanuloplasties when adequate skin exists.After forming the urethra the remainder of the hooded prepuce is split and the cutis is removed in strips from a portion of one of these flaps using a tenotomy scissors.That de-epithelialized tissue is brought over the neo-urethra and sutured to the deep penile fascia with 7-0 absorbable suture. Ideally this flap extends from the new meatus at the tip of the glans to the proximal anastomosis. In a review of 84 single stage hypospadias repairs of all varieties only 3 acquired urethrocutaneous fistulae. (4) The application of the de-epithelialized flap to hypospadias repair significantly reduces the complication rate.It can be applied to most forms of hypospadias and is recommended as a simple adjunct to hypospadiology.We want to present our experience with the tubeless pyel~ plasty in the first year of life. Material and methods. From January to December '90, 395 infants and children for a total of 425 hydronephrosis have been operated on in our Department. Primary nephrectomy was carried out in ii patients (2.6%). 135 patients for a total of 147 hydronephrosis were less than one year old. in these infants 4 primary nephrectomies, 2 HellstrSm procedures, 46 Anderson-Hynes reduetive pyeloplasty with ureteral stent and 95 tubeless pyeloplasty without reduction of the size of the pelvis were carried out. Rssults. In 3 of the ~6 hydronephrosis in which a reduotive pyeloplasty with ureteral stent was carried out, a postoperative urine leakage:occurred, in 2 cases requiring a reoperation. In this group we had 2 failures due to postoperative strictures at the anastomotic site. In the group of 95 tubeless pyeloplasties without pelvic reduction we carried out 3 reoperations due to excessive urine leakage. In this group we had ~ failures due to anastomotic strictures. Conclusion. In our.opinion and experience the tubeless, non reductive pyelopladty is a safe and effective method to treat hydronephrosis also in the first year of life. In addition the tubeless technique does reduce hospitalization significantly. At the same time it is our opinion [that the reduction of the size of the pelvis is rarely necessary. The diagnosis of renal obstruction in asymptomatic nowboras with hydronephrosis is difficult. The diuretic ranogram conventionally used to examine ehildran with hydroncphrosis was modified to meet the special needs of newborns by a consortium of members of the Society for Fetal Urology and Pediatric Nuclear Medicine Club (May 1989) . This modified renogram is called the \"Well Tempered Renogram (~) (protocol to be shown). About 150 imfants fi-om five different medical centers in the USA have been studied by ~ to date. Herein, the results of the Chicago Chil~ dreus Memorial Hospital are presented.There were 33 asymptomatic infants with hydronephrosis tested. Of the various parameters checked on the WTR, the best criteria to diagnose obstruction combined checking the values of the diuretic clearance after lusix injection (t 89 and the grade of hydronephrusis o,I ultrasound. The best correlation with surgically proven renal obstruction was a t 89 above 6mln in a kidney which showed hydronephrosis Gr~3 (polvocalyceal dilation) on the post WTR ultrasound. There was no instance of clinical obstruction when the t 89 was <6mln. The diagnostic accuracy during the value of the WTR t~ and other data from rcnogrmm and scan is about 60%, while correlation of the t 89 and the grade of hydronephrosis shows 98% accuracy.It appears the dual assessment (tV~ and grade of hydroncphrosis) is the most accurate means to evaluate dilated kidneys of newborns for obstruction. All 3 casea with poor results were reoperated and after second operation turned to Good (1 cane) and Acceptable (2 canes)respectively. Bad results were followed by nephrectomy in 3 of 4 cases. In all of these cases renal functlon was very poor (I case 27%; and Three cases uo functioning kidney at urography). In cases with renal function less than 45% (xxx) function improved after surgery. IT is emphasixed that renal function doesn't decrease after surgery. The fusctiou can improve after early operation or reoperation. Surgery is useless in cases with MAG-3 function less than 10~t or huge Hidronephrosis at urography.

All the repairs have been completed as l-stage'prooed~ res, 2 for severe previously unoperated forms and 3 for cripples. The full thickness mucosal graft can be harvested from the inner surface of the cheek or the upper/lower lip, used as a patch or tube, alone or combined either with bladder mucosa or with preputial skin when available.Complications included 1 major fistula (probably related to distal meatal stenosis), 2 minor fistulas but no urethral stricture or diverticulum in the initial follow-up. Both the cosmetic and functional final outcome were good, suggesting that buooal mueosa can be used for hypospadias reconstruction as an alternative to bladder mucosa, when local skin is not available. Over a five year period, 26 patients aged 6 months to 14 years have undergone total abdominal rcconfiguration and ancillary procedures such as transabdominal orchidopcxy and when necessary urinary tract reconstruction for prune bony syndrome. This tcchnlque has been vastly improved so that the umbilicus is now preserved. Using the \"pants over vest\" pllcation of the abdominal musculature (as descrlbcd by Ehrlich, and most recently by Monffort) with resec.tlon of the redundant cutaneous tissue has left a satisfactory cosmetic appearance in all cases. Initially sloughing of the umbilicus with secondary healing was a problem in three patients in whom preservation of the umbilicus was attempted. Since then, when the umbilicus was left undisturbed on the underlying subcutaneous bed rather than on a pedide there have been no subsequent complications. One patient did separate a slight dehiscence of his skin anastomosis only which healed promptly by secondary intention leaving him with a good cosmetic result. Prenatal enthusiasm and satisfaction with the ultimate result has been universal in this patient group. Likewise patient satisfaction in the older children has been dramatic and been associated with improved self-image.We advocate abdominal reconstruction in children currently at six months of age in concert with orehidopexy whleh we feel can at times be done without the Fowler-Stepheus technique at this early age. This stud.y was performed as a part of longer research activity on children's urinary tract smooth musculature. All the 80 patients involved in the investigations suffered from urinary tract malformations and therefore underwent surgery. Children's ages ranged between 1 week and 15 years. Samples were taken from different segments of urinary tracts only at surgery. Immediately after cessation of blood supply specimens were prepared carefully for electron microscopy. Characteristic patterns like smooth muscle cells' sizes, organelles, pinocytotic vesicles, close contacts, amount of intercellular matrix, collagen and collagen fibres were examined. Specimens of nine children undergone urine diversion were obtained and investigated electron microscopically twice, first at diversion and later at undiversion surgery. Temporary cystostomy were performed on three of them for voiding disorders and temporary terminal ureterocutaneostomy were done on six patients for vesieoureterorenal reflux or stenotic ureterovesical junction. At present marks of regeneration of impaired smooth muscle microarchitecture will be discussed. Increased interstitial collagen and collagen fibres desintegrated. Smooth muscle cells rebuilded close contacts by producing cytoplasma processes between each other. Cell organelles and pinocytotic vesicles can be seen as signs of renewed cell activity. Taking into consideration that smooth muscle layer is able to regenerate in some extent pediatric surgeons and urologists should try to spare kidney parenchyma as far as it is possible.",
