Efficacy studies in ferret and NHP models are in their final completion stage. Biodistribution studies with similar ChAd vaccines (AdCh63 ME-TRAP, AdCh63 MSP-1 and AdCh3NSmut) in mice have previously been performed and showed no evidence of replication of the virus or presence of disseminated infection after IM injections. Given these data, biodistribution studies were not performed based on advice from the MHRA. Toxicology studies have not been conducted on AZD1222. A toxicology study in mice for another ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine expressing a related betacoronavirus S surface antigen (ChAdOx1 MERS) is shown for reference.

AZD1222 CTM was sourced from: 1) CBF at the University of Oxford; 2) Advent, Italy, and 3) Cobra Biologics. For control, the MenACWY vaccine was administrated in Studies COV001, COV002, and the first dose of COV003, and 0.9% normal saline (0.9% NaCl) was administered in Study COV005 and the second dose of Study COV003 for participants who received two doses. Table 4 presents the actual AZD1222 dose levels participants received across the 4 studies by the CTM source and SD or LD designation. For the pooled analyses, a designation of SD or LD was given to each of the AZD1222 dose levels. Generally, 5 \u00d7 10 10 vp or equivalent is designated as a SD, and 2.2 \u00d7 10 10 vp or 2.5 \u00d7 10 10 vp are designated as a LD. Due to a potency miscalculation, participants in Study COV002 groups 1, 2, 4 and 5a who were to receive 5 \u00d7 10 10 vp (Abs260) Advent as the first dose per protocol, received a lower dose of approximately 2 \u00d7 10 10 vp (qPCR). Study COV005 groups 1 and 2 also had the LD vaccine. One source of heterogeneity relates to logistical constraints in the context of the rapid conditions in which this clinical program and scale up manufacturing were initiated in parallel, which led to delays in clinical study material availability for second dose vaccinations in studies to be included in the pooled analyses. This resulted in the fact that, for some participants, the interval between the first and second doses (ie, dose schedule) exceeded 1 month. Dose schedule of two doses will be summarized and homogeneity among different dose schedules will be investigated when needed.",

[9] However, in preclinical studies of ChAdOx1 immunisation and MERS-CoV challenge, no ADE was observed in hDPP4 transgenic mice, dromedary camels or non-human primates (van Doremalen et al, manuscript submitted). [10, 11] The risks of inducing lung immunopathology in the event of COVID-19 disease following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination are unknown. Challenge studies on ferrets and NHPs are underway and these pre-clinical studies will report on presence or absence of lung pathology. Results will be reviewed as soon as they emerge and will inform discussions on risk/benefit to participants receiving the IMP. All pathology data arising from challenge studies of other SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates will also be taken into account. Replication deficient vectors, however, avoid that risk while maintaining the advantages of native antigen presentation, elicitation of T cell immunity and the ability to express multiple antigens [16] . Subunit vaccines usually require the use of adjuvants and whilst DNA and RNA vaccines can offer manufacturing advantages, they are often poorly immunogenic requiring multiple doses, which is highly undesirable in the context of a pandemic.",

This dosing range is based on a target 5 \u00d7 10 10 viral particles per dose and a \u00b1 30% range to take into account process and method variabilities. When the planned clinical dosage of Symbiosis' product is compared to that of CBF and Advent products, the resulting Symbiosis' product dosage at 0.5 mL for lot 20481A is somewhat lower in total viral particle per dose (20% from the lower range limit), slightly higher in total viral genome copies per dose (12% from the higher range limit), and slightly lower in total infectious particle per dose (8% from the lower range limit). These differences are considered to be comparable to or within the variabilities from the analytical methods used in concentration determination (A260, qPCR, and infectivity) and the dosing volumes during clinical administration. In summary, with a 0.5 mL dosing volume for Symbiosis' product, the strength difference from CBF and Advent products is not expected to have significant clinical impact in terms of reactogenicity and immunogenicity/efficacy.

The dose of 5x10 10 that of CBF and Advent products, the resulting Symbiosis' product dosage at 0.5 mL for lot 20481A is somewhat lower in total viral particle per dose (20% from the lower range limit), slightly higher in total viral genome copies per dose (12% from the higher range limit), and slightly lower in total infectious particle per dose (8% from the lower range limit). These differences are considered to be comparable to or within the variabilities from the analytical methods used in concentration determination (A260, qPCR, and infectivity) and the dosing volumes during clinical administration.

SAHPRA and WHREC had been informed of this decision based on the earlier protocol requirements. Also, considering the unpredictability of the force of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the lower than anticipated attack rate for the primary-endpoint cases in the study being undertaken in the UK, the sample size for Group 2 (efficacy cohort) was expanded from the 550 included in protocol version 1.0, dated 24 th April 2020. This will involve enrolling up to a total of 1900 people in Group-2, which will provide 80% power to detect at least a 60% vaccine efficacy (lower bound of 95%CI >0) with an attack rate of 3.5% in the placebo arm. Ongoing review of the number of COVID-19 endpoint cases accrued during the course of the study, may lend itself to enrolling smaller number of participants should the attack rate be higher than 3.5%. The sample size for Group-1 has been increased to 70 to accommodate for the higher than anticipated infection rate with SARS-CoV-2 (6 of initial 24 randomized subjects in Group-1). Similarly, in anticipation of approximately one-third of Group-3 participants possibly being already infected with SARS-CoV-2, the sample size will be increased to 100 to have approximately 30 sero-negative vaccinees and placebo recipients enrolled into the study.

Despite unprecedented containment measures adopted by the Chinese government, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the world. The WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 th January 2020. As of 22 nd April 2020, over 2.5 million cases have been reported with more than 177 000 deaths globally (Worldometers.info).",

ChAd63). A first-in-man dose escalation study using the ChAdOx1 vector encoding an influenza antigen (FLU004), safely administered ChAdOx1 NP+M1 at doses ranging from 5 x 10 8 to 5 x 10 10 vp. Subsequent review of the data identified an optimal dose of 2.5 x 10 10 vp balancing immunogenicity and reactogenicity. This dose has subsequently been given to over hundreds of volunteers in numerous larger phase 1 studies at the Jenner Institute. ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have thus far demonstrated to be very well tolerated. The vast majority of AEs have been mild-moderate and there have been no SARs until this date.",

In order to support the analytical comparability assessment, A260 testing of Advent's process (K.0007, K.0008, and K.0009 lots) was performed, where corrections to the absorbance due to excess polysorbate 80 were made to compensate for polysorbate 80 concentrations above the formulation target of 0.1% (w/v).Differences in strength related attributes (ie, virus particle concentration, virus genome concentration, and infectious virus concentration) are noted.

This will allow for the eventual grouping of effectiveness of COVID-19 has caused a major disruption in health systems with significant socioeconomic impacts. Containment measures have failed to stop the spread of the virus, which has reached pandemic levels. Currently, there are no specific treatments available against COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is sorely needed. Live attenuated viruses have historically been one of the most immunogenic platforms available, as they have the ability to present multiple antigens throughout the viral life cycle in their native conformations. However, the manufacture of live attenuated viruses requires complex measures of containment and biosafety. In addition, live attenuated viruses carry the risk of inadequate attenuation, causing widespread disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Given that COVID-19 is a serious and potentially fatal disease, which disproportionately affects elderly people with comorbidities, producing a vaccine with live attenuated viruses is the least viable option. The replication of competent viral vectors may pose a similar threat in relation to the disease spread in immunosuppressed individuals.Vectors with poor replication, however, avoid this risk by maintaining the advantages of the presentation of native antigens, increased immunity of T cells and the ability to express multiple antigens15  . Subunit vaccines generally require the use of adjuvants and, although DNA and RNA vaccines can offer manufacturing advantages, they are often precariously immunogenic and require multiple doses, which is highly undesirable in the context of a pandemic.Chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vectors have been safely administered to thousands of people targeting a wide range of infectious diseases.

This assay is being developed and validated in collaboration with Dr David Montefiori, Duke University. Pseudotyped neutralization assay: The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay (optimized in collaboration with Dr Nicole-Doria-Rose, VRC) is an adaptation of a highly validated HIV neutralization assay routinely in use at the NICD. The SARS-CoV-2 assay measures neutralization of pseudotyped virus in ACE2-over-expressing 293T target cells (developed by Dr Michael Farzan, The Scripps Research Institute) as a function of a reduction in Luc reporter gene expression. The pseudotyped virus consists of lentiviral particles that are deficient for lentiviral env, but have surface SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and package the gene for firefly luciferase. Infected cells express luciferase, and luciferase activity is quantified by relative light units (RLU) of luminescence. Virus is applied to cells with or without preincubation with antibodies; neutralizing antibodies reduce infection, resulting in lower RLUs. Serial dilution of antibodies can be used to produce a dose-response curve to quantify potency. The assay is performed in 96well flat-bottom black culture plates for high throughput capacity and enhanced luciferase signal Use of a clonal cell line provides enhanced precision and uniformity. Controls will be neutralizing monoclonal antibodies expressed in-house as well as COVID-19 HIV positive and negative serum samples. Live virus neutralization assays: This assay, being developed at the NICD by Prof Janusz Paweska utilizes live SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cultured for one week in Vero cells. After visualization of microscopic cytopathic effects by microscopy, cultures are confirmed positive by PCR and viral stocks cryopreserved. Microneutralization assays will be performed by incubation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Vero cells with or without pre-incubation with antibodies.

Containment measures have failed to stop the spread of virus, which is now at pandemic levels. There are currently no specific treatments available against COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is urgently needed. Live attenuated viruses have historically been among the most immunogenic platforms available, as they have the capacity to present multiple antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations. However, manufacturing live-attenuated viruses requires complex containment and biosafety measures. Furthermore, live-attenuated viruses carry the risks of inadequate attenuation causing disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Given that severe disease and fatal COVID-19 disproportionally affect older adults with co-morbidities, making a live-attenuated virus vaccine is a less viable option. Replication competent viral vectors could pose a similar threat for disseminated disease in the immuno-suppressed.",

Most importantly, a ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine expressing the full-length Spike protein from another Betacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, has been given to 31 participants to date as part of MERS001 and MERS002 trials. ChAdOx1 MERS was given at doses ranging from 5x10 9 vp to 5x10 10 vp (table 2) with no serious adverse reactions reported.

            "text": "Clinical experience with ChAdOx1 MERS The COVID-19 epidemic has caused major disruption to healthcare systems with significant socioeconomic impacts. Containment measures have failed to stop the spread of virus, which has reached pandemic levels. There are currently no specific treatments available against COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is urgently needed. Live attenuated viruses have historically been among the most immunogenic platforms available, as they have the capacity to present multiple antigens across the viral life cycle in their native conformations. However, manufacturing live-attenuated viruses requires complex containment and biosafety measures. Furthermore, live-attenuated viruses carry the risks of inadequate attenuation causing disseminated disease, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Given that severe disease and fatal COVID-19 disproportionally affect older adults with co-morbidities, making a liveattenuated virus vaccine is a less viable option. Replication competent viral vectors could pose a similar threat for disseminated disease in the immuno-suppressed. Replication deficient vectors, however, avoid that risk while maintaining the advantages of native antigen presentation, elicitation of T cell immunity and the ability to express multiple antigens 17 . Subunit vaccines usually require the use of adjuvants and whilst DNA and RNA vaccines can offer manufacturing advantages, they are often poorly immunogenic requiring multiple doses, which is highly undesirable in the context of a pandemic. Chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vectors have been safely administered to thousands of people using a wide range of infectious disease targets. ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have been given to over 320 volunteers with no safety concerns and have been shown to be highly immunogenic at single dose administration. Of relevance, a single dose of a ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine expressing full-length spike protein from another betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) has shown to induce neutralising antibodies in recent clinical trials. The use of an active comparator (MenACWY) will minimise the chances of accidental participant unblinding, decreasing bias in reactogenicity or safety reporting and/or health seeking behaviours once symptomatic for COVID-19.The use of prophylactic paracetamol reduces the incidence and severity of fever and other adverse events following immunisation (AEFI). It has been previously recommended following Meningococcal B vaccine administration without negatively impacting its immunogenicity profile (reference: Bexsero SmPC). Given the potential higher reactogenicity profile of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at 5x10 10 vp doses, a prophylactic paracetamol dose has been introduced in order to minimise severity of commonly observed local and systemic AEFI.",

Subsequent review of the data identified an optimal dose of 2.5 x 10 10 vp balancing immunogenicity and reactogenicity. This dose has subsequently been given to hundreds of participants in numerous larger phase 1 studies at the Jenner Institute.ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have thus far demonstrated to be very well tolerated. The vast majority of AEs have been mild-moderate and there have been no SARs until this date.Another simian adenovirus vector (ChAd63) has been safely administered at doses up to 2 x 10 11 vp with an optimal dose of 5 x 10 10 vp, balancing immunogenicity and reactogenicity.MERS001 was the first clinical trial of a ChAdOx1 vectored expressing the full-length Spike protein from a separate, but related betacoronavirus. ChAdOx1 MERS has been given to 31 participants to date at doses ranging from 5x10 9 vp to 5x10 10 vp. Despite higher reactogeniticy observed at the 5x10 10 vp, this dose was safe, with self-limiting AEs and no SARs recorded. The 5x1010  vp was the most immunogenic, in terms of inducing neutralising antibodies against MERS-CoV using a live virus assay (Folegatti et al. Lancet Infect Dis,2020, in press). Given the immunology findings and safety profile observed with a ChAdOx1 vectored vaccine against MERS-CoV, the 5x10 10 vp dose was chosen for ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.The trial conducted in the UK is the first in human assessment of the SARS-CoV 2 S antigenic insert.16  As other batches of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 become available, including for this ChAdOx1 nCoV-19_ZA_PhI/II trial, a staggered approach will be used for use of thefirst 5 vaccines of each new batch. Safety of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 will be monitored in real time and should unacceptable adverse events or safety concerns arise, doses will be decreased via an amendment. As of 19 th August 2020, a total of 9981 participants have been enrolled in the COV001/COV002 studies in the UK and 3688 in Cov003 in Brazil. Several different batches of vaccine have been produced for the clinical trials: at Oxford University in the UK, Advent in Italy and at COBRA in the UK. Dosing of the vaccine has been based on Abs260 (Oxford and COBRA) or qPCR (Advent) depending on the manufacturers release specifications. Emerging data from 6 different assays, provides more information on the dosing and provides insight into consistency across different batches. For batch K.0008, used in South Africa, dosing was based on the qPCR data from Advent to obtain approximately 5 x 10 10 vp as the preferred dose level. For batch K.0011 from Advent, the dose has been adjusted to an equivalent of 7.5 x 10 10 vp on the Advent qPCR to ensure consistency across batches with the extended panel of assays. In future Astra Zeneca will be developing the vaccine and responsible for subsequent batches, and their assays are included in the table below. An analytical comparability assessment of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) manufactured by CBF, Advent and Cobra Biologics was conducted using a comprehensive set of physiochemical and biological release and characterization tests. In order to support the analytical comparability assessment, A260 testing of Advent's process (K.0007, K.0008, K.0009 and K.0011 lots) was performed, where corrections to the absorbance due to excess polysorbate 80 were made to compensate for polysorbate 80 concentrations above the formulation target of 0.1% (w/v). Differences in strength related attributes (ie, virus particle concentration, virus genome concentration, and infectious virus concentration) are noted. These differences in strength is further examined for potential impact on clinical dosing. The target clinical dosage of CBF's product is 5 \u00d7 10 10 viral particles per dose based on vp/mL concentration determined by UV spectroscopy (A260), whereas that of Advent's product is 5 \u00d7 10 10 viral genome copies per dose based on vg/mL concentration determined by qPCR.
