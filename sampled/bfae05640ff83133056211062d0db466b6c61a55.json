Usually, the circumstances that led to drowning are not apparent from the autopsy findings but can be reconstructed from reports of witnesses and the police. Because the reflex drive to seek air is triggered by hypercarbia, not hypoxia, loss of consciousness and drowning can ensue after hyperventilation and breath-holding by experienced swimmers who then drown without a struggle. There are no specific autopsy findings. A search for trauma, including a posterior neck dissection, should be made in all instances.

(1) Careful investigation of the scene and study of reports of witnesses and the police are essential. The investigation should ascertain the site of diving (currents and other underwater hazards), the estimated depth, the water temperature (exposure to cold), and a description of water clarity. Electrocution should be considered if the site has electric underwater cables (see \"Injury, electric\"). Cerebral concussion should be considered if explosives were used in the vicinity. Knowledge of the method of recovery of the body and the type of resuscitation efforts can aid in the interpretation of apparent wounds. The medical history of the diving victim should be sought, as it may lead to a diagnosis for which the autopsy is typically silent, such as seizure disorder, or may reveal asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis, all of which increase the risk of air trapping and arterial air embolism.",

Because scuba divers risk arterial air embolism if they ascend with a closed glottis, on can attempt to document gas bubbles at autopsy, but their interpretation is problematic: Bodies recovered immediately are subjected to resuscitation efforts, which can by themselves produce extra-alveolar air artifacts, and bodies not recovered immediately tend to be found in a putrefied condition, full of postmortem gas. In the remaining cases, the pathologist must consider the potential of introducing artifactual gas bubbles by the forcible retraction of the chest plate and by sawing the calvarium. The following procedures apply primarily to scuba diving accidents. Interrogation of witnesses is important; the behavior and complaints of the decedent, if any, might help distinguish between a natural death by heart disease and an unnatural death by air embolism.",

Likewise, foreign material in wounds can sometimes be matched to suspect vehicles, and should be sought and retained as evidence. For pedestrians, the distance between the impact point on the lower extremities and the soles of the feet should be recorded. The legs should be opened to inspect tibial fractures; cortical fractures initiate propagation opposite to the side of impact, where they usually have a pulled-apart appearance, and then splinter the cortex at the side of impact. Abrasions are better impact markers than contusions, because subcutaneous blood extravasation can be caused not only by impact to the skin, but also from blood extravasating from underlying fractures. If no cutaneous abrasions or fractures of the leg bones are found, the skin of the legs should be incised to expose contusions.",

A sensitive diag-nostic test is based on the determination of this CAG sequence, which can be done on fresh-frozen tissue or blood (1) . In the absence of genetic confirmation, sampling of organs and tissues cannot be excessive because a complex differential diagnosis must be resolved.

Contamination of the autopsy table should be prevented by covering it with a disposable, non-permeable plastic sheet. Autopsy generally should be restricted to the brain. If organs in the chest or abdomen need to be examined, this is best done in situ. To prevent aerosolization of potentially infectious bone dust, a hood or other protective device should be used while opening the skull with a Stryker saw. After completing the autopsy, instruments and other potentially contaminated objects should be autoclaved in a steam autoclave (1 h at 134\u00b0C). Porous load is considered more effective than gravity displacement autoclaves. Immerse autopsy instruments in distilled water before and during autoclaving, in order to protect them from corrosion. Ifno autoclave is available, chemical disinfection (see below) is a satisfactory alternative. Disposable items should be put in a container for infectious hospital waste and ultimately incinerated. Contaminated objects not suitable for autoclaving (such as the Stryker saw) should be soaked with a2NNaOH solution for 1 h (alternatively, 1 NNaOH may be used for 2 h). Contaminated surfaces should be thoroughly washed with the same solution. Aluminum should be treated for 2 h with a fresh 5% NaOCI (sodium hypochlorite) solution with at least 20,000 ppm free chloride. Wash waters should be collected; if no autoclave is available, 2 N NaOH or >4 volumes of 5% sodium hypochlorite bleach should be added to the water and left for a minimum of 2 h before being discarded. Before removing the body from the autopsy room, it should be sponged with 5% sodium hypochlorite.",

The formerly recommended procedure of clamping the internal mammary vessels below the sternoclavicular joints, and then cutting across the sternum distal to these clamped vessels so that the sternoclavicular joint area remains intact, is designed to prevent the production of a vacuum that pulls air into the veins. The procedure is not necessary if the air is welldocumented by roentgenography before autopsy. At autopsy, a large fatal pulmonary air embolism is readily apparent. The right atrium and ventricle are distended with fine, frothy, brightred blood, which also may distend the pulmonary arteries and superior vena cava. Microbiologic examination ofblood and pericardial sac contents may help to rule out the presence of gas-forming bacteria that may simulate air embolism (Fig. II-I). However, the presence of putrefactive emphysema in any part of the body points toward a bacterial origin of the gas.

Causes ofchronic asphyxia include prolonged exposure to high altitude and chronic pulmonary disease. Profound medial hypertrophy of small pulmonary arteries and of pulmonary veins from chronic exposure to hypoxia. Acute pulmonary edema may also occur in chronic hypoxia.

After death, air can be introduced into the lungs, or putrefaction gases might be present. However, air artificially introduced after death will not distend the alveoli and can be squeezed out, whereas this does not seem to be the case after active ventilation. The distribution of fat in the fetal zone of the adrenal cortex may indicate whether intrauterine death was acute, more prolonged, or chronic (3). This is particularly helpful if the stillborn baby is macerated. If the mother died also, see under \"Death, abortion-associated\" Strangulation NOTE: In many instances, procedures described under \"Hom-icide\" must also be followed.

Avoid searing the tissue surface since this will produce an aerosol. Keep no more than one scalpel in the dissecting area at anyone time.

(B) Two sections of glass tubing, approx 3 mm inside diameter, each bent at an angle of 120\u00b0. One of these sections should be longer than the other. The shorter one should reach just through and be even with the inner surface of the stopper. The longer one should reach to within 1 or 1.5 cm of the bottom of the bottle. Both tubes should fit tightly into the holes of the stopper. (C) One separatory funnel (60-100 mL, pear-shaped) connected to the longer section of bent glass tubing by rubber tubing 100 cm in length (F). An amber, pure gum rubber tubing, such as is used on blood-diluting pipets, has proved satisfactory.
