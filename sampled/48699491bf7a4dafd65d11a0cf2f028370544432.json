            "text": "Background: Host genetic factors are associated with outcomes of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) is a key member in interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. Recent studies suggested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IFN pathway genes are associated with outcomes of HBV infection and response to IFNa therapy. Methods: We enrolled 400 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 254 subjects with inactive carrier state, and 258 CHB patients received IFNa treatment, with therapy efficacy evaluated. Three SNPs: rs2780895, rs4244165 and rs17127024 in JAK1 were genotyped using a polymerase chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) protocol to investigate whether SNPs in JAK1 were associated with outcomes of HBV infection and response to IFNa therapy. Results: SNP rs17127024 was associated with outcomes of HBV infection in allele frequency (P = 0.012) and genotype distributions (P = 0.029), while SNP rs4244165 was associated with outcomes of HBV infection only in genotype distributions (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of these SNPs between response group and non-response group to IFNa therapy. Conclusions: SNPs rs4244165 and rs17127024 in JAK1 were associated with outcomes of HBV infection, but not with response to IFNa therapy.",

In this study, we examined possible genetic association of DNMT1 polymorphisms with HBV clearance and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Five common polymorphic sites were selected, considering their allele frequencies, haplotype-tagging status and LDs for genotyping in largerscale subjects (n = 1,093). Result: Statistical analysis demonstrated that two intron polymorphisms, DNMT1 +34542G[C and DNMT1 +38565G[T, showed significant association with the resolution of HBV infection in the co-dominant model (OR = 1.30, P = 0.005, P corr = 0.03), and co-dominant/recessive model (OR = 1.34-1.74, P = 0.002-0.004, P corr = 0.01-0.03), respectively.

Background/Aim: To study the distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes and sub-genotypes in China. Methods: The nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) method established in our lab was applied for detection of genotypes A-D and subgenotypes B1, B2, C1 and C2 of HBV strains from China. A total of 544 sera samples of patients with HBV chronic infection from eight provinces located in the north (Jilin, Beijing), south (Shenzhen and Guangxi), east (Shangdong), west (Xinjiang) and center (Henan and Hebei) of China respectively were detected by the nPCR method. 114 of the 544 samples were selected randomly and their PCR products were sequenced directly to confirm the results examined by nPCR methods. Results: 68.38% (372/544) of the 544 samples were genotype C, 8.09% (44/544) of that were genotype B, 8.09% (44/544) were D, and 15.44% (84/544) were mixed genotypes, none of the other genotypes was found. The major subgenotype of B were B2 (72.73%, 32/44), and that of C were C2 (93.28%, 347/372).

Further analyses by stratifying gender found differential metabolic associations between genders. Subgroup analysis on subjects younger than 45 years showed chronic HBV infection was independently associated with lower BMI, TG, HDL levels, higher serum adiponectin and ALT levels in male gender. Conclusions: Chronic HBV infection is independently associated with favorable anthropometric and metabolic profiles as well as higher serum adiponectin level.

Methods: A 5 years dynamic observation and research on 220 chronic HBV carriers in WuXi district has been taken via viewing the clinical symptom, histology, virology and HBV immunological markers, et al. Results: 35 of 220 patients, accounting for 15.9%, showed hepatitis B reactivation. The hepatitis B reactivation rate of patients with obvious hepatic tissue inflammation (CG 2 ) was 27% (33/122) and the patients with mild hepatic tissue inflammation (G 0 -G 1 ) was 2% (2/98) , showing a significant differences (v 2 = 25.41, P \\ 0.01) and reactivation rate of patients with high inflammation was clearly higher ones with mild inflammation. 27 of 35 hepatitis B reactivation cases were older than 40 years, showing the significant statistical differences between the dissimilar age group cases and hepatitis B reactivation rate (v 2 = 6.72, P \\ 0.01), moreover no relation between the sex and hepatitis B reactivation rate.

Methods: Intrahepatic and peripheral NK cell frequency, phenotype and function were comprehensively investigated in 46 immune activation (IA) patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 24 immune tolerant (IT) carriers, as well as 21 healthy individuals. Flow cytometric, immunohistochemical, and immunofunctional assays were performed to analyze the impact of NK cell function on liver pathogenesis. Results: Hepatic NK cells in vivo were preferentially accumulated in liver necrotic regions of IA patients where they were activated and skewed towards to cytotoxicity but without an accompanied increase in interferon-c production; by contrast, they were less seen in the fibrotic than non-fibrotic region in the livers of these IA patients. Importantly, the up-regulation of hepatic NK cell cytotoxicity was preferentially dependent on the increased interleukin (IL)-12, IL-15 and IL-18 and reduced IL-10 cytokine expression seen in vivo in livers of IA patients, and was found to be closely associated with the severity of liver injury and fibrosis in these patients.

Methods: We constructed a mathematical model of HBV infection in Australia which simulated acute and chronic HBV infections in Australia from 1951 to 2050, attendant mortality, and the impact of existing vaccination programs which are the cornerstone of our public health response. Results: The model estimates that in 2009 the number of people living with chronic HBV in Australia will reach 160,000, increasing by another 20,000 over the next decade. Fewer than 60% of these infections have been diagnosed. Lifetime attributable mortality in Australians with chronic HBV is estimated to be 22.5%, resulting in over 20,000 deaths in the first half of this century. Annual acute infections are expected to fall 75% by 2050 with current immunisation coverage, averting approximately 800 attributable deaths at the cost of vaccinating 18 million people with 65 million doses of vaccine. HBsAg prevalence in Australia in 2050 is predicted to be 0.74% with current vaccination levels, compared with 0.78% with no vaccination at all. Conclusions: This model, validated using external data, suggests a significant and growing burden of chronic HBV in Australia, a burden which no domestic vaccination program can address, and of which our surveillance system has detected less than two thirds.

Each case of AHB reported to NNSS during 1990-2008 was residency and age matched with four controls randomly selected through household registration information. Results of maternal HBV screening at pregnancy and records of HBV vaccination in infancy were analyzed for case and control subjects. Results: The ID of AHB for unvaccinated and vaccinated cohorts was 3.62 and 0.24 persons/10 5 person-years, respectively.

The mean duration since HBeAg seroconversion to HBsAg seroclearance was 76.2 months. Twenty-six (66.7%) patients had undergone HBsAg seroconversion (HBsAb positive), and 13 (33.3%) had only HBsAg loss. Mean HBV viral load was 2.82 9 10 7 IU/mL before initiation of antiviral treatment. HBV-DNA showed positive results in two patients (5.1%) after HBsAg seroclearance in treated patients by lamivudine. One patient of these had a HBsAg reversion 8 months after HBsAg loss. Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma did not develop in any of the 26 patients without evidence of liver cirrhosis at the time of HBsAg seroclearance. Conclusion: The outcome following HBsAg seroclearance after antiviral treatment is excellent and continuous acquisition of HBsAg seroclearance shoud be monitored with HBsAb and HBV-DNA level. Background: To investigate the incidence and distribution of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level in chronic hepatitis B and Liver cirrhosis (CHB/LC) patients. Method: The definition of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level means that serum HBV DNA level of CHB/LC patients spontaneously decreases to 1% (decrease of 2log 10 ) or less than 1% of the previous level (C100,000 copies/ mL) within 12 weeks without any antiviral and immunoregulatory drug. The incidence, demographic features and distribution of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level in CHB/LC patients with different clinical types were studied with prospectively epidemiological methods. Results: Among all the CHB/LC patients (n = 315) with previous HBV DNA level C100,000 copies/mL, spontaneous decerase of HBV DNA level occurred in 171 (54.3%) patients within the observation period of 12 weeks, including 61 (19.4%) patients with undetectable HBV DNA level (\\1,000 copies/mL), and 110 (34.9%) patients with detectable HBV DNA level, but decrease more than 2log 10 s. Stratified by age and clinical types, the incidence (25.0%, 2/8) of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level in juvenile patients (B19 years) was lower than that (58. 6%, 116/198) in young patients (20-39 years), with significant difference (v 2 = 2.956, P = 0.048), and the incidence (78.7%, 48/61) of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level in patients with hepatic failure was higher than that (48.4%, 123/254) in patients without hepatic failure (v 2 = 5.528, P = 0.002). The incidence (75.0%, 21/28) of spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level in patients with HEV/HBV co-infection was higher than that (51.8%, 146/282) in patients with HBV infection alone (v 2 = 5.530, P = 0.019). Conclusion: Spontaneous decrease of HBV DNA level is a quite common phenomenon during the natural progressing courses of CHB/LC patients, especially in patients with hepatic failure and those with HEV/HBV coinfection. In this situation, the efficacy of antiviral therapies may be overestimated.",

Hepatitis virus is the leading cause of cancer related death in Mongolia with HBV being responsible for half the incidence. Our study is the first of the kind that combines data on HBV viral load and other serology markers in Mongolian patients. Aim: We are committed to unveil which of the diagnostic modalities are important for clinicians to assess the current state of liver disease for chronic hepatitis B patients. Method: Statistical analysis was performed in 300 randomly selected patients who were tested for HBV viral load at Happy Veritas, Clinical Diagnostics Laboratory. Diagnostic methods by Taqman Real-Time PCR, HBV-combo rapid tests, biochemistry, CBC were used in the study. Result: 300 patients with positive HBsAg were tested for viral load. Only 40.6% of patients had detectable viral load of [500 copies/ml. Serum HBV DNA negativity rate was 58% in cirrhotic patients, whereas 51% was negative in non-cirrhotic patients with no significant difference between the two. HBeAg positivity was 5.3% among HBsAg positive patients. Though the mean age of HBV positive patients were 38, it was 22 for HBeAg(+) patients. Summary: HBV viral load is not important for estimating progression of chronic liver disease. Though viral load is important to assess response to treatment in chronic HBV patients, HBV DNA positive patients make only 40% of HBsAg positive patients. It is difficult to assume that HBV DNA negative patients are healthy carriers because they still have ALT elevations and liver fibrosis. In such cases HBsAg quantification could be of use to those patients. HBsAg is hardly used to assess treatment response, but there is immense pressure to develop sensitive, wide range reproducible assays for that purpose. Though HBeAg positivity has important role in assessing HBV infection and in decision making in western countries, it is not the case in Mongolia, like other Asian countries. HBeAg(+) patients make only a small portion of HBV infected population.",

Methods: Haematological, biochemical and serological parameters were calculated using commercially available automated techniques. Serum HBV-DNA was determined by using the Cobas Amplicor HBV Test (lower limit of quantification: 300 copies/ml) in both maternal (n = 76) and cord blood (n = 73) available samples. Results: Fifteen women exhibited SPB (14.7%).

Methods: Consecutive patients with CHB who were admitted for liver biopsy were enrolled. Patients underwent LSMs and blood tests on the same day as the liver biopsy. Results: One-hundred eighty patients were randomly classified to the training set (n = 120) or validation set (n = 60).

Hyaluronic acid, a 2 -macroglobulin, and LSMs were significant factors for predicting significant fibrosis on multiple regression analysis. With this model, although 50% of patients in training set could avoid liver biopsy, 8.3% of patients in validation set were misdiagnosed. To establish more accurate criteria, patients in training set were classified into two groups according to their LSMs. a 2 -macroglobulin and hyaluronic acid were the only significant factors for predicting significant fibrosis in low-LSM group (\\7.2 kPa) and in high-LSM group (C7.2 kPa), respectively.

Aims: To investigate the dynamic changes of liver stiffness measurements (LSM) by FibroScan \u00d2 in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) flare and evaluate the relationship between LSM and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin. Methods: Forty-nine consecutive treatment na\u00efve patients with CHB flare [ALT [5 times upper limit of normal range (ULN)] were enrolled and divided into two groups: group Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A (n = 14) and group CTP B/C (n = 35). Fibroscan \u00d2 was performed every 7-10 days during hospitalization and every 1-3 months for follow-up outpatients. Hematology and liver function were tested at the same time. Liver biopsy was performed during hospitalization for 11 patients. Results: Total of 167 LSM were performed. Overall, a statistically significant, positive correlation was found between LSM and ALT, LSM and bilirubin, whereas a positive partial correlation was only found between LSM and bilirubin (r = 0.468, P \\ 0.001). Following with continuously declined ALT and bilirubin, LSM fell down to lower than cirrhosis cut-off 13.4 kPa in 10 patients with high initial LSM and without clinical signals or typical images of cirrhosis (4 patients proved by biopsy) (Fig. 1) . Whereas, LSM remained larger than 13.4kPa in 10 patients, including 4 biopsy proved patient (Fig. 2 ), 3 patients with clinical sign or images of cirrhosis. In patients with ALT normalization, bilirubin and CTP score were increased in patients with LSM larger than 13.4 kPa (P \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Although influenced by ALT, LSM was majorly affected by bilirubin in patients with CHB flare. In CTP A patients, dynamic evaluation of LSM associated with bilirubin and ALT was essential to improve accuracy of FibroScan \u00d2 for cirrhosis diagnosis.",

All nine individuals harbor mixtures of YIDD and YVDD mutants, some of them confirmed by sequencing of the cloned PCR products. The rt204ATA (YIDD) is the most prevalent variant in treatment naive patients, and is the only variant detected in the cultured cells. The mutant/WT ratio for the precore and BCP mutations in the same patients is more variable and often higher than that for YMDD. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the rate of YMDD mutant generation in tissue culture and in treatment na\u00efve individuals may be dictated mostly by viral factor(s). The rate at which these mutants increase in people following introduction of antiviral agents may reflect host contributions to the process and the degree of liver disease. Since YMDD mutations confer resistance to lamivudine, the extent to which this information can be used to predict the time at which drug resistance breakthrough occurs, and other disease pathologies, will be discussed.",

A universal double-stranded DNA control or standard that can be used in all commercial HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification kits is urgently needed. Methods: By aligning all HBV genotypes (A-H), we found that the surface antigen gene and precore-core gene regions of HBV are the most conserved regions among the different HBV genotypes. We constructed a chimeric fragment by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and obtained a 1,349-bp HBV C+S fragment. We then packaged the fragment into lambda phages using a traditional lambda phage cloning procedure. Results: The obtained armoured DNA was resistant to DNase I digestion and was stable, noninfectious to humans, and could be easily extracted using commercial kits. More importantly, the armoured DNA can be used with all HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification kits. Conclusions: The lambda phage packaging system can be used as an excellent expression platform for armoured DNA. The obtained armoured DNA possessed all characteristics of an excellent positive control or standard. In addition, this armoured DNA is likely to be appropriate for all commercial HBV DNA nucleic acid amplification detection kits. Thus, the constructed armoured DNA can probably be used as a universal positive control or standard in HBV DNA assays. The pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver failure is very complicated and it has achieved great progress in recent years. On the recent literature, combining with the novel findings of our research team, here, we summarized the pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver failure as follows: (1) both host and viral factors are contributed to the pathogenesis of HBV-associated liver failure; (2) polymorphisms G-201A from CXCL10, -592C and -819C from IL-10 are closely related to hepatitis flares and liver failure; (3) genotype C and B, particularly B/C co-infection, are correlated with liver failure; (4) quasispecies studies during antiviral therapy by using NAs is quite important; (5) attention should be paid to missed detection in HBV DNA by real-time PCR.",

Full length rhHBV-Pol tagged with a 5 0 polyhistidine tag (843 amino acids) was expressed at a high level in an Escherichia coli system. SDS lysis buffer was utilized to dissolve insoluble rhHBV-Pol, and Ni-NTA resin affinity chromatography was utilized for rhHBV-Pol purification. The majority of rhHBV-Pol was eluted with 100 mM imidazole in the presence of NP-40, which is a weak detergent that was used to keep dissolved rhHBV-Pol insoluble. A high-concentration reducing agent was utilized throughout purification steps to keep soluble rhHBV-Pol from forming disulfide bonds. Purified rhHBV-Pol showed both stable reverse transcriptase activity and DNA polymerase activity. The purified protein was highly pure and had stable reverse transcriptase activity. The ability of this purification approach to yield rhHBV-Pol in an enzymatically active form may facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis B.",

Our aim was to produce antibodies with T cell receptor (TCR) like features able to specifically recognize HBV peptide/MHCclass I complexes and distinguish HBV infected hepatocytes from non-infected ones. These antibodies were used to analyze the distribution and quantification of pMHC on HBV infected cells and their ability to deliver compounds to infected cells. Methods: Antibody secreting B-cell hybridomas were generated from mice immunized with HBVc18-27/A201 or HBVe183-91/A201 monomers. The number of pMHC on individual cells was enumerated by flow cytometry based quantification technique, while HBV antigen was quantified by Western blot. Confocal microscopy was used to detect intracellular delivery of fluorescent dye. Results: After screening several hybridomas, five were found producing antibodies that recognize T2 cells pulsed with core 18-27 (2 clones) or env 183-91 peptides (3 clones) but not T2 cells pulsed with irrelevant HLA-A0201 binding peptide. The TCR-like antibodies recognized the pMHC expressed naturally after endogenous processing on HBV infected cells. The binding of the antibodies was not inhibited by the presence of serum HBV antigens. These antibodies were used to quantify pMHC complexes expressed on different cell types. On average, 1 9 10 5 core proteins produced one pMHC on B cells, while in hepatocytes, a single pMHC requires endogenous synthesis of approximately 1.5 9 10 6 proteins, implicating the limited antigen processing ability of hepatocytes. Furthermore, TCR-like antibodies could deliver the fluorescent dye to the endosomal compartment of HBVinfected hepatocytes. Conclusions: We have produced TCR-like antibodies recognizing HBV infected cells. These antibodies open the possibilities to obtain precise quantitative analysis of the pMHC on HBV infected hepatocytes and provide the base for new therapeutic strategies for targeted delivery of drugs to HBV infected cells. Background: As a major therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) triggers intracellular signal transduction including JAK-STAT pathway to produce numbers of antiviral effectors. However, patients with chronic hepatitis B usually show low response to IFN-alpha treatment and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Methods: HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were used to examine the Type I IFN receptors expression, STAT1 phosphorylation and methylation.

S-adenosylmethionine treatment effectively improved the HBV-caused STAT1 demethylation and attenuated STAT1-PIAS1 binding, followed by increased PKR and 2 0 , 5 0 -OAS mRNA expression. Combined with IFN-alpha, S-adenosylmethionine treatment significantly reduced the HBsAg and HBeAg protein levels and the HBV DNA in the supernatant of HepG2.2.15 cells. Conclusions: STAT1 demethylation and subsequent STAT1-PIAS1 interaction are involved in the mechanism of IFN-alpha antagonistic activity of HBV. By improving STAT1 methylation, S-adenosylmethionine can sensitize in a great degree the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha.",

            "text": "Overexpression of Toll-Like Receptor Background: HBV carriers constitute major reservoir, especially in developing countries. Generally they are recommended for regular check up and treatment is recommended when patients have liver damage. This is mainly attributable to lack of information about extent of liver damage. Aim of this study was to assess extent of liver damage in HBeAg -ve patients who were completely unaware of their HBV infection in Bangladesh. Methods: In this retrospective study, we reviewed the records of 310 HBeAgve CHB patients. They were tested for serologic markers of HBV, anti-HCV and ALT. All underwent per-cutaneous liver biopsy. Result: 77.4% (240/310) were males and 22.6% (70/310) females. Patients were between 13 and 60 years of age. ALT was raised [2 times UNL (cutoff 42 U/L) in 7.1% (22/310). 37.4% (116/310) had high HBV DNA ([10 5 copies/ml by PCR), while low DNA (\\10 5 copies/ml) was seen in 62. 6% (194/310) . In those with high DNA, significant necro-inflammation (HAI-NI [ 7) was seen in 46.6% (54/116) and significant fibrosis (HAI-NI [ 3) in 30.2% (35/116). The figures were 31. 4% (61/194) and 14.4% (28/ 194) , respectively, in those having low viral load. None tested positive for HCV infection. Conclusion: Machinery should be developed to characterize undetected HBV carriers in developing countries by multi-center studies. We have shown that considerable number of these patients suffers from progressive liver damage.",

HBV DNA has been shown to contain CpG islands that are methylated in human tissue, which suggests a role for methylation in regulating viral protein production. Methods: This study was conducted during a 1 year follow-up to characterize the viral kinetics in HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B. We count the mutation rate within the period of viral kinetic changes comparing the stationary pattern and fluctuated pattern. Fifty three patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B were enrolled. Results: We compared mutation rates of nucleotides and amino acids in different phases between stationary and fluctuated viral kinetic patterns. The fluctuated pattern had statistically significantly higher mutation rate of nucleotides than stationary pattern for the following nucleotide segments, full length genome, core gene, spacer of polymerase gene, negative regulatory element (NRE), NRE gamma domain, and basic core promoter. CpG island 1 (nt55-281) is equal to the partially location of spacer of polymerase. CpG island 2 (nt1,228-1,663 ) is equal to the location of NRE (nt1, 626) and CURS_A (nt1, 704) . CpG island 3 (nt2, 446 ) is equal to the location of terminal protein of polymerase. Conclusions: The fluctuated pattern had statistically significantly higher mutation rate of nucleotides than stationary pattern in CpG island 1 and 2 for the following nucleotide segments. This project will help us to understand the relationship between not only the possible virologic factor and viral kinetics but also the mutation sites and CpG islands methylation and provide potential model for viral kinetic in natural course patients.",

The frequency of hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)-specific Th17 cells was characterized and produced cytokines were determined by flow cytomix. Our data indicated that HBcAg stimulation promotes the production of IL-17A, IL-22, IL-6, TGF-b and IL-10 in CHB patients, but not in normal control. Furthermore, endogenous IL-10 inhibited HBcAg-stimulated production of IL-17A, IL-22, IL-6, but not TGF-b. Treatment with IL-10 inhibited the HBcAg-stimulated activation of Th17 cells while anti-IL-10 antibody significantly increased the frequency of Th17 and Th1 cells. Hence, HBcAg induced IL-10 negatively regulates Ag-specific Th17 cells immune response in CHB patients and this could represent one example of an evasion strategy by the virus to subvert specific antiviral T cell responses of the host.",

Results: The expression level of APOBEC3G in PBMC of healthy people was very low. The expression level of APOBEC3G in PBMC of patients with chronic hepatitis B, chronic severe hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or liver cancer were all significantly higher than that of healthy people (P \\ 0.01), while there was no statistical difference on expression of APOBEC3G in PBMC among these patients (P [ 0.05) and there was also no statistical difference on APOBEC3G in liver tissue between chronic hepatitis B patients and hepatocellular carcinoma patients (P [ 0.05). CLSM observations indicated that the localization of APOBEC3G protein was in cytoplasms of PBMC and liver cells and was not in the nucli. Conclusion: It is suggested that chronic HBV infection could increase the expression of APOBEC3G, but high expression of APOBEC3G may be only the satellite phenomenon of chronic HBV infection.

Methods: Full-length genomic sequences of HBV isolated in different regions of China were retrieved from GenBank, genotyping and sequence comparison were carried, and reference sequences were compiled through genotyping and sequence comparison by choosing the most frequently occured nucleotide at the same position, the mutation rate of each site was calculated and classified as high, moderate and low by analyzing the mutation at each position. These DNA sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences were then compared with other reference sequences, and amino acid sequences of different coding regions likewise. Results: The reference sequences for HBV genotypes B and C that are dominant in China were successfully established and the mutation rate at each position was determined.These seuences are different from other reference sequences that have been published.The homology between the genomic sequence of Bc and those of Ba, Bj were 99.32, 95.52% respectively, Cc and those of C, Caus were 99.27, 95.01% respectively, the homology between the S gene of Bc and those of Ba, Bj were 99.71, 98.68% respectively, Cc and those of C, Caus were 99.27, 95.01% respectively, suggesting homology between Bc and Ba is higher than that between Bc and Bj,Cc and C is higher than that between Cc and Caus.The amino acid sequences of different coding regions are also different,and the distribution of the base of 1,762, 1,764, 1,858 between genotypes B and C have significant differences.

The association of HBV genotypes and basal core promoter (BCP) and precore (PC) mutations with the clinical characteristics is increasingly recognized but the data is still poor in China. This study is to investigate these virologic features and clinical implications between large-size patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB) and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: One hundred and eighty-two AHB patients and 325 CHB patients were investigated. HBV genotypes and BCP/PC mutations were determined by direct PCR sequencing. Mutations at ten interested sites of the BCP/PC region were compared between the two groups of patients. Results: AHB patients had a significantly higher ratio of genotype B to C than CHB patients (37.4-62.6% vs.16.6-83.4%, P \\ 0.001). The prevalence of BCP/PC wild-type virus was 60.4% in AHB patients in contrast to 28.9% in CHB patients. Significantly lower prevalence of A1762T, G1764A, G1896A, and G1899A but higher prevalence of T1758C was found in AHB patients. Interestingly, T1758C and A1762T/G1764A appeared mutual restraint. Genotype B virus had lower BCP mutation frequency and similar PC mutation frequency compared to genotype C virus. AHB patients with BCP/PC mutant virus had higher viral load, whereas CHB patients with BCP/PC mutant virus had lower viral load and elevated alanine aminotransferase, in comparison with those with the wild-type virus. Conclusion: Patients with genotype B virus, BCP/PC wild-type virus or T1758C mutant virus were more susceptible to develop AHB, whereas high prevalence of the BCP/PC mutations was associated with CHB development.",

Results: We found that either EI or EII was able to stabilize HBV core and X promoters in vivo. Among the tested constructs, HBV core promoter linked to hepatitis B enhancer I and enhancer II (EI-EII-Pcore) and X promoter linked to enhancer I and enhancer II (EI-EII-Px), can direct constant and high level of gene expression in the liver of mice, but EI-EII-Px shows less specificity than the EI-EII-Pcore sequence. Conclusions: EI-EII-Pcore and EI-EII-Px are the most potent in application in gene therapy protocols.

At present, the interaction between human immune response and the virus is considered as a crucial factor.HBV exists as quasispecies. The research on the relationship between HBV quasispecies and the pathogenesis of the hepatitis B has not been reported. Methods: Three acute hepatitis B, three HBV carriers, three chronic hepatitis B and three chronic severe hepatitis B were recruited.All the patients are male, HBeAg positive.The genotype of HBV is C. HBV S gene was amplified from sera of these patients. In each patient, 20 clones of HBV fragment were randomly selected and sequenced. Results: The complexity of the severe chronic hepatitis B is significantly different from that of the acute hepatitis B (p \\ 0.05), and there is no difference among the other groups. In the T cell epitope 45, 47, 85 amino acid sites of the HBV S gene, the constitution of quasispecies in the chronic hepatitis B is different from that fo HBV carriers and the acute hepatitis B (p = 0.01), and it seems to be different from that of the chronic severe hepatitis, but it is not statistically proved. Besides,in the acute hepatitis B, HBV carrier and chronic hepatitis B, the constitution of quasispecies is different from one to another in the a determinant 126 amino acid site of the HBV S gene (p \\ 0.05). Conclusion: The difference of the constitution of quasispecies in some T cell epitopes and a determinant of HBV S gene may be related to the clinical outcomes of hepatitis B, of which the mechanism remains to be further investigated. Background: Oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) is current standard for treatment of chronic hepatitis B. However, emergence of viral resistant mutations and rebound of HBV DNA results in disease progression. Empirical adding of another NUCs is recommended but this practice is not always successful. The aim of this study is to evaluate HBV polymerase mutation patterns and its role in management NUCs treatment. Methods: Chronic hepatitis B patients who had received one or more of NUCs regularly who had [1log 10 HBV DNA rebound and [2,000 IU/mL from September 2007 to 31 September 2008 were included. HBV polymerase resistance profile was performed by using line probe assay INNO-LiPA HBV DR v2 (LiPA; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's recommendation.",

Methods: The TCRBV gene families in 11patients with CHB and 4 normal controls (NC) were examined by the real-time PCR with DNA melting curve analysis, and we further determine sequence bias and characteristics of TCRBV CDR3 gene family by analyzing the gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) of PCR products from 24 TCRBV gene families. Results: We found that the GMSP of most of the TCRBV CDR3 gene families in NC showed a diverse multimodal shape, however, The GMSP of specific TCRBV gene families in T cells in the livers and in the peripheral blood showed a single peak in all 11 CHB patients, furthermore, specific TCRBV families in T cells in the livers and/or in the peripheral blood in 6 patients with CHB shared the same motif ''Q Y'' in CDR3. More interesting is that a shared TCR CDR3 bsequence was found in peripheral blood and in the liver of specific TCRBV families in 1 patient with CHB. Conclusion: Some of the GMSP of TCRBV gene families in T cells in the livers and in the peripheral blood in patients with CHB has been changed compared to NC and some patients with CHB may result as a shared TCR CDR3 bsequence in peripheral blood and in the liver.",

Methods: Full-length HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences were amplified and sequenced directly among 156 treatment-na\u00efve and 170 NA-treated patients with chronic genotype C HBV infection, who were enrolled from five hospitals in four northern cities of China during January 2007 to July 2009. Deduced amino acids at 11 previously-reported NAr mutation positions (including rtL80, rtI169, rtV173, rtL180, rtA181, rtT184, rtA194, rtS202, rtM204, rtN236 and rtM250) in RT region were analyzed. Result: Among 326 HBV isolates, 17.48% (57/326) harbored NAr mutations which were all found in treated-patients (57/170, 33.53%). The most prevalent NAr mutations were rtM204V/I (40/170, 23.53%), rtL180M (25/170, 14.71%) and rtL80V/I (20/170, 11.76%), respectively, which exclusively belonged to lamivudine (LMV) resistance pathway. This was in line with the fact that 66.47% (113/170) of treated-patients were receiving or experienced LMV treatment at sampling. The prevalence of NAr mutations belonging to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) resistance pathway was relatively lower with rtA181T/V (18/170, 10.59%) and rtN236T (7/170, 4.12%) . No mutations occurred at rtI169, rtT184, rtA194 and rtS202. Twenty-four kinds of mutation patterns were detected in 57 mutants. Single site mutation was found in 16 isolates, while double, triple, quadruple and quintuple combination mutations were found in 29, 10, 1 and 1 isolates, respectively. The most predominant mutation patterns were rtM204I+rtL80I (8/57, 14.04%) and rtM204V+rtL180M (8/57, 14.04%). Conclusion: The prevalence of NAr mutations in treatment-na\u00efve patients was not found.

We examined whether HBV RNA is useful for the pathogenesis and treatment response of hepatitis B. Methods: We studied 74 patients in four groups during different stages of chronic HBV infection and 47 patients with lamivudine treatment. HBV DNA and RNA were extracted from the serum of these patients. The nucleic acids were amplified by the real-time PCR with or without reverse transcription (RT). The amount of HBV RNA was determined by the differences between real-time PCR and RT-real-time PCR. Result: Serum HBV RNA was detectable in 63.5% of the chronically HBVinfected patients. No correlation was observed between the serum HBV RNA and ALT (n.s.). The ratio of HBV RNA in all the HBV nucleic acids (HBV RNA%) was ranged between 10 and 20% in each infection stage. HBV RNA% in HBeAg-ASC group was lower than HBeAb-ASC group (11.5 vs. 21.0%, p = 0.0186). After 1-month lamivudine treatment, more patients with HBV RNA% increase were observed in the patients with viral breakthrough (VBT) than the group without VBT (22/28 vs. 7/19, p = 0.006). Conclusion: Serum HBV RNA was detectable in each stage of chronic HBV infection. HBV RNA% at 1 month after the commencement of lamivudine treatment could be a potential predictor of VBT.",

Methods: Blood samples were retrieved from China northern patients with HBV infection. Serum HBV-DNA was acquired from samples and amplified with routine PCR. Sequences of the cloning products were got and analyzed. Results: 201 patients were enrolled in the study, which included acute hepatitis B (7 cases), asyptomatic hepatits B virus carriers (13 cases), chronic hepatitis B (89 cases), liver cirrohsis (62 cases) and HBV related carcinoma (30 cases). Nucleotide sites such as nt C1726, T1727, G1730, G1752 and G1799 in BCP and precore region of HBV genome have genotype specificity. The result shows that G1776A (OR = 10.7, 95% CI: 2.4-48.1, P = 0.002), A1846T (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.2-11, 7 , P = 0.02), G1896A (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.4-8.3 , P = 0.01) and mutation sites C3 (OR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.1-6.4, P = 0.027) may be associated with HBeAg negativity. G1896A mutation may be correlated with disease progression (P = 0.004) and be essential in many mutation combinations. In mutants bearing more than three substitutions, 53% had G1896A (35/66), and only 8% (8/98) in strains with point mutations less than 3 (P \\ 0.05). The experiment also hints various substitutions could coexist in one strain after long history of HBV infection. Our experiment shows HBV preS1 and preS2 region deletion could coexist in the same patient and often occur in liver cirrhosis patients. Conclusion: A1727G mutation is a common mutation in northern China. A novel G1776A mutation is identified to be statistically responsible for HBeAg negativity. G1896A mutation may be the risk factor in liver disease progression and prognosis independent of age. HBV preS gene deletion may be associated with progression of liver disease.",

Recently, we have established a simple HBV replication mouse model using hydrodynamic tail vein injection of HBV replication competent plasmid (pHBV4.1) into Balb/C mice. In present study, the application of this mouse model in several aspects of HBV biology was evaluated. Methods: To determining its application in detecting the efficacy of anti-HBV agents, polyinosinic-polytidylin acid (polyIC, interferon inducer) and nucleotide analogues (adefovir and entecavir) were administrated to HBV replication mouse model with wild-type pHBV4.1 injected, and the inhibiting efficacy of these agents on HBV DNA replication was evaluated. To identify its application in biological study of HBV drug-resistance mutants, single-point mutation (rtM204I, ayw subtype) and double-point mutation (rtA181V+ rtN236T, ayw subtype) were injected respectively and their corresponding HBV DNA replication intermediates in liver was assessed. Results: Compared with mouse models without antiviral agent treatment, the HBV DNA replication intermediates in polyIC treated group was significantly decreased; and after the treatment of ETV and ADV, the level of HBV DNA replication were decreased by 75 and 35% respectively. These findings suggested that HBV DNA replication in our mouse model could be inhibited by administration of anti-viral agents. For mouse model injected with rtM204I and rtA181V+rtN236T mutant HBV, HBV DNA replication could still be detected, but the level of HBV DNA replication of mutant plasmids decreased a lot compared with the mouse model with wild-type HBV. Conclusions: The HBV replication mouse model we established was a useful tool to study the biology of HBV. It could be applied to detecting the efficacy of antiviral agents and studying the biological characteristics of HBV drug-resistance mutants.

The role of HBx in regulating HBV transcription and replication were investigated in HepG2 in vitro. The execution of HBx function requires the participation of host cell protein factors, whose types and levels may be different between HepG2 cell lines in vitro and liver cells in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible role of HBx in regulating HBV transcription and replication in vivo. Methods: HBV replication mouse models were established using hydrodynamic tail vein injection of wild-type or HBx-minus HBV genome (with defective X gene), and HBx expression plasmid. After injection, mice were sacrificed on day 3, and liver tissue was collected and total RNA and DNA were extracted. The levels of HBV mRNA in the liver were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization, and the levels of HBV DNA replication intermediates in the liver were detected by Southern blot hybridization. Results: The levels of 3.5-kb HBV RNA and HBV DNA replication intermediates of HBx-minus HBV mutants in liver were lower than that of wild-type HBV genome or HBx-minus HBV genome plus HBx expression plasmid. The absence of HBx expression caused the reduction of HBV transcription and replication and the decreases could be restored by expression of HBx in liver tissue. Conclusions: HBV mutant genome with defective X gene led to decreased levels of HBV DNA and HBx has augmentation effects on HBV transcription and replication in vivo of mouse.

Method: 50 patients with HBV-related liver diseases including 35 cases with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) and 15 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) were enrolled into this study.10 healthy people were taken as control. SOCS-1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) freshly obtained from all the subjects were detected by real-time quantitative retroverse polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) and their correlations with clinical data were analyzed by SPSS statistics software. Result: SOCS-1 mRNA levels in PBMC of HBV-related liver disease group were significantly higher than those of control (P \\ 0.05) and those of CHB group were significantly higher than those of ACLF group (P \\ 0.05). SOCS-1 mRNA levels were found negatively correlated with serum HBV DNA levels and HBeAg titers in HBV-related liver disease group (R = -0.555, p \\ 0.05 and R = -0.48, p \\ 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: The decline of SOCS-1 gene expression in PBMC of ACLF group may contribute to the pathogenesis of ACLF. The expression of SOCS-1 gene is influenced by HBV in vivo. Background and Aims: Antiviral resistance is one of the most important factors for treatment failure with nucleos(t)ide analogues in CHB. Pre-existing drug resistance mutations may occur in untreated patients and may affect their treatment outcomes. A few prior limited studies report high rate of HBV rt mutations in reportedly treatment-na\u00efve patients though methods of assessing the absence of prior therapy in such studies were not well defined. Our goal is to establish the prevalence of clinically-relevant HBV rt mutations in truly treatment-na\u00efve patients with CHB using a sensitive line probe assay. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 70 CHB patients at 2 U.S. gastroenterology clinics during 2/09-5/09 and used the INNO-LiPA HBV DR3 test (Innogenetics, Belgium) to detect relevant mutations in the HBV rt at the following positions: 80, 173, 180, 181, 204, 236, 184, 194, 202, 233, and 250 . All patients gave written consent and were interviewed using a detailed questionnaire to illicit a history of prior anti-HBV treatment (herbal or conventional Western therapy). Results: The majority of patients were Asians (97%) and foreign-born (97%) with median age being 42 . Family history of CHB and HCC were present in 54 and 17%, respectively. None had cirrhosis or liver cancer. Median ALT was 25 (7-164). Median HBV DNA was 4.5 log 10 IU/mL (2.8-8.7 ) and most had either genotype B or C (94%). HBeAg was positive in 22%. All patients were found to have viral populations that were sensitive to lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, and entecavir and none had any detectable HBV rt mutations.",

In this study, we analyzed the frequency of circulating Tregs in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection as well as the expression of PD-1 and BTLA on CD4 + T cells and their relationships with HBV-related clinical markers. Methods: Flow cytometry was performed to assess the expression of PD-1 and BTLA on the CD4 + Tcells and circulating CD4 + CD25 high Tregs of 39 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and 19 healthy controls (NC). Result: We found that the frequency of CD4 + CD25 high Tregs and PD-1 expression on CD4 + T cells was significantly increased in CHB patients compared with normal controls. However, BTLA expression on CD4 + T showed no significant difference between the two groups. The frequency of Tregs was significantly higher in patients with HBV DNA titer C10 8 than that of HBV DNA titer\\10 8 . Circulating CD4 + CD25 high Treg frequency and PD-1 expression on CD4 + T cells correlated positively with serum HBV DNA load in CHB patients. Coclusion: Our findings suggested that the increased frequency of CD4 + CD25 high Tregs and PD-1 expression on CD4 + T lymphocytes may inhibit cellular immune response against HBV and affect viral clearance, leading to the persistence of chronic HBV infection.",

HBV DNA-positive was detected in four blood donors (3 from high-titiered anti-HBc group) and the load of HBV DNA of four donors was 1.2 9 10 5 , 4 9 10 3 , 1.6 9 10 3 and 4 9 10 4 copies/ml, respectively. The sequence analysis showed that two new HBsAg variants were found. Conclusions: The risk of transfusion-transmitted HBV was high in blood donors with high-titered anti-HBc. HBsAg-negative HBV infection carriers was major low-level infection of HBV and it was possible association with HBsAg antigentic variations PP115 Background: Chronic HBV infection is an important risk factor for the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In chronic HBV infection cellular immune responses are weak or undetectable, which lead to a state of relative collapse of HBV-specific adaptive immunity. Recent years, a new T helper cell lineage, called Th17 cells, producing interleukin (IL)-17 family cytokines and IL-22, has been identified. To clarify whether Th17 cells are involved in HBV infection we determined the frequency of IL-17-producing Th17 cells and expression of Th17-related cytokines in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis B. Methods: Flow cytometry was performed to assess frequency of peripheral Th17 cells (CD3 + CD8 -IL-17A + T cells) and CD3 + CD8 + IL-17A + T cells in 16 patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB), 41 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 20 of asymptomatic HBV carriers (AsC), and 16 normal controls (NC). Serum levels of IL-17, IL-22, TNF-a, and IFN-c were measured simultaneously by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Results: We found that the percentage of Th17 cells in peripheral blood of AHB patients was significantly elevated than that in NCs. The frequency of Th17 cells showed a positive correlation with serum ALT and AST in AHBs. IL-17 and IFN-c levels in serum showed no significant difference among the four groups. However, IL-22 concentration in AHB patients was notably increased as compared with levels in NCs, CHB patients, and AsCs. This marked elevation of serum IL-22 positively correlated with serum TNF-a concentration in patients with AHB. Conclusions: Th17 cells secret IL-22 as a major cytokine to take part in the immunopathogenesis of AHB disease process and they play an important role in limitation and counteraction of severe injury of liver function in acute HBV infection via TNF-a signal transduction.",

All infected infants and their respective mothers had the same HBeAg status and HBV genotypes. DNA analysis in a pair of HBeAg-negative infant and mother revealed that both were infected with an HBV precore mutant (G1896A). Escape mutants in the 'a' determinant region were detected in 2 out of 14 (14%) infected infants. Conclusion: Instead of HBeAg status, high HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in mothers are the major contributing factors to vertical transmission of HBV. The precore mutant with high viral load could be transmitted from mothers to their offspring. Escape mutants seem to be uncommon, and might not be associated with vaccine failure among Thai populations. Background/Aims: The biphasic clearance of HBV serum viral loads by the nucleos(t)ide analogues has been reported. In this study, we used a novel mathematic model to analyze the early viral kinetics in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, and compared the viral dynamic profiles of different treatments. Methods: Thirty CHB patients (HBeAg/HBsAg positive) from Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, were enrolled in this study. 18 patients had received 48 weeks lamivudine treatment and 12 patients had received 48 weeks clevudine treatment. Serum samples were collected at baseline, days 4, 7, 10, 14, and weeks 3, 4, 8, 12 . HBV DNA was quantified by Abbott Realtime HBV assay. Viral kinetics were analyzed by the two first order independent secay (TFOID) model: y = a exp(-bx) + c exp(-dx) (y: percentage of viral load compared with baseline; x: duration of treatment). The time needed to achieve 50% (T 50 ), 95% (T 95 ) and 99% (T 99 ) of HBV DNA reduction were calculated by Table Curve2D . Results: All viral kinetics data of the thirty patients fitted the TFOID model well (r 2 [ 0.98). T 50 of these patients [1.76 (1.38-5.07 ) day] were significantly shorter than the terms of achieving the latter 49% viral load reduction (T 99 -T 50 ) [13.14 (3.38-34.15 ) day, P \\ 0.0001]. T 95 of these patients [6.30 (3.43-19.37 ) day] had no difference with terms of achieving the latter 4% viral load reduction (T 99 -T 95 ) [7.60 (1.36-28.96 ) day, P = 0.994]. There was no significant difference between T 99 of lamivudine and clevudine therapy [19.01 (4.97-35.94 ) day vs. 9.62 (5.10-27.24 ) day, P = 0.087]. Conclusion: TFOID model is suitable to analyze early viral kinetics of HBV DNA under nucleos(t)ide analogues therapy. Efficacies of these antiviral therapies in the early phase of treatment were higher than the late phase. Viral dynamic profiles of lamivudine and clevudine therapy had no significant difference.",

It effects the response to sequence therapy, moreover it results in the failure of sequence therapy. Once the resistance mutation was presented, it would effect sequence therapy consecutively. So for na\u00efve antivirus treatment of HBV infected patient, it is necessary to choose antiviral agents with low risk of resistance. Background and Aims: Binding of beta 2-glycoprotein I (b2-GPI) to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has an effect on HBV infection. The aim is to identify the affinity of b2-GPI to HBsAg, the influence of glycosylation of b2-GPI and binding rates among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Methods: HBsAg and b2-GPI were radiolabeled with Na 125 I by chloramine-t. The affinity constant (Ka) was checked by radioimmunoassay. Nonglycosylated rb2-GPI was expressed in M15/pQE30/hb2-GPI. The precipitates of b2-GPI-125 I-HBsAg and rb2-GPI-125 I-HBsAg were by competitive conjugation method. The Ka 1 and Ka 2 were calculated by Adrion method. A total of 23 samples were collected from 9 HBeAg positive, 9 HBeAg negative patients and 5 normal controls. Serum HBsAg quantification, HBV-DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were monitored. The binding rates of 125 I-b2-GPI with the serum of CHB patients were calculated. Results: The specific activity of 125 I-HBsAg and 125 I-b2-GPI was (2.6-2.8) 9 10 6 and (5.8-6.0) 9 10 6 Bq/lg. The affinity of b2-GPI to HBsAg was (2.795 \u00b1 1.846) 9 10 8 L/mol. There was no statistically significant difference between Ka 1 and Ka 2 of b2-GPI from two separate sources (P [ 0.05) ( Table  1 ). The binding rates between HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative had a significant difference and the same difference was observed between active hepatitis B and carriers among the HBeAg positive patients (P \\ 0.05). (Lim et al. in Gastroenterology, 2007) , but this is unknown in lamivudine treated chronic hepatitis B patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the evolution pattern of HBV quasispecies in lamivudine induced seroconverters. Methods: Ten seroconverters and 10 non-seroconverters during lamivudine treatment were selected. Nested PCR of the precore/core gene were performed followed by cloning and sequencing for four time-point samples per patient. Twenty clones per sample were sequenced. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX and sUPGMA pylogenetic trees were constructed using Pebble 1.0 following maximum likelihood estimates of pairwise distances under a GTR + I + G model testing the viral diversity and evolution. Results: Lamivudine induced HBeAg seroconverters had a viral diversity of 1.38 9 10 -2 (substitutions/site, median) and evolutionary rate 5.97 9 10 -4 (substitutions/site/month, median) which were 3.2-and 5.2-fold higher respectively than those of non-seroconverters. The viral diversity increased significantly after starting lamivudine treatment (from baseline 7.25 9 10 -3 to 1.93 9 10 -2 substitutions/site, p = 0.01) and reached a plateau just before and after HBeAg seroconversion (2.06 9 10 -2 and 2.07 9 10 -2 substitutions/site) in seroconverters. Non-seroconverters showed no alteration in viral diversity over time.",

Conclusion: Telbivudine has strong suppression of hepatitis B virus activity, and effect soon, which will significantly improve the liver function, improve the survival percentage and avoid repeatedly abnormal liver function. patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis who underwent nucleoside analogues treatment in our hospital were enrolled in this study. Decompensated liver cirrhosis was defined as prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) for more than three seconds or serum total bilirubin level higher than 3 mg/dl. Among them, 27 cases received lamivudine (LAM) 100 mg/day, and 10 cases received entecavir (ETV) 0.5 mg/day treatment, respectively. The survival of the two groups was compared. Results: The mean baseline Child-Pugh scores of patients underwent LAM and ETV treatment were 9.1 \u00b1 1.6 and 8.7 \u00b1 1.9, respectively. Thirteen (48%) cases in LAM group and three (30%) cases in ETV group were classified in Child-Pugh C stage. The mean treatment duration for LAM was 13 \u00b1 5.4 months, and for ETV was 7.3 \u00b1 5 months. During the follow-up period, three (11.1%) cases in LAM group and one (10%) case in ETV group died. None case developed biochemical breakthrough. The causes of death were liver failure (n = 2), hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1), and variceal bleeding (n = 1). The 6-, 12-and 18-month survival rates were 100, 91 and 85% in LAM group, and 90, 90 and 90% in ETV group (p = 0.48). Conclusions: By analysis the short-term survival, LAM could provide equal survival benefit to ETV in patients with decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B. Further study is needed to determine the long-term response of LAM treatment. Methods: We examined virologic response (HBV DNA drop drop below the level of 4 log 10 copies/ml) and viral breakthrough (HBV DNA surge more than 1 log 10 copies/ml from nadir at least two occasions after on an initial virologic response) in 77 patients who had been taking adefovir mono therapy because of LAM-resistant CHB, retrospectively. Result: The rates of virologic response at month 6 and 12 were 51.9% (40/77) and 62.3% (48/77), respectively. At base line, there was no difference in age (50.1 \u00b1 10.9 vs. 49.8 \u00b1 8.1), male to female ratio (66.7 vs. 82.8%), HBV DNA levels (6.8 \u00b1 1.0 vs. 6.9 \u00b1 1.0 log 10 copies/ml), and proportion of patients with HBeAg positive (75.0 vs. 82.8%) between the patients with and without viral response at month 12. However, the proportion of patients with acute flare prior to adefovir mono therapy was higher in responders than in non-responders (54.2 vs. 27.6%, p = 0.03). Mean duration of therapy in patients with virologic response was 31.6 \u00b1 13.4 months. After virologic response (5-38 months) , viral breakthrough occurred in 10 patients (20.8%). Of these 10 patients, genotypic resistance to adefovir (rtN236T, rtA181V) and acute flare (ALT [120 IU/ml or bilirubin [3.0 mg/ml) were noticed in 7 (70.0%) and 3 (30.0%), respectively. Conclusion: In patients with LAM-resistant resistant CHB, adefovir mono therapy showed not only low virologic response rate but also high viral breakthrough rate. Acute flare prior to adefovir mono therapy was a factor in achieving virologic response. Among patients who showed virologic response to adefovir mono therapy, viral breakthrough without genotypic resistance to adefovir and acute flare after viral breakthrough were frequent. However, until recently there have been few commercially available assays for HBsAg quantification other than the Abbott Laboratories ARCHITECT \u00d2 assay, which has been used in most studies. Roche Diagnostics have recently developed a prototype HBsAg quantification assay which can be run on the Elecsys instrument. Using a range of samples encompassing HBV genotypes A-D for which we had previously determined HBsAg titres using the ARCHITECT assay, we compared results to those obtained using the Elecsys system. Methods: We evaluated serum samples (n = 90) from subjects with chronic HBV infection which had previously been assayed for HBsAg and genotyped. The genotype distribution was as follows: genotype A (n = 22), B (n = 24), C (n = 24) and D (n = 20). Samples were diluted when required to fall within the dynamic range of the respective assays. Serial dilutions ranging from undiluted to 10 -6 were evaluated on the Elecsys platform. Samples in the appropriate reference range of 0-250 IU/ml, as determined using the Elecsys instrument, were re-assayed in parallel using the ARCHITECT system. Results: Data obtained using the two systems were compared using diluted serum samples with litres in the range of approximately 1-500 IU/ml. Results showed a strong correlation. Conclusions: The ARCHITECT platform has been used frequently for quantification of the HBsAg. Our results show that the prototype HBsAg quantification assay using the Elecsys platform provides a satisfactory alternative, giving comparable results. Backgroud: Here are the efficacy result in a cohort of patients who were confirmed advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and received maximum of 9 years of monotherapy with Lamivudine. Methods: 49 Nucleoside-na\u00efve HBeAg(+)/(-) patients who had histologically confirmed advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (the Ishak fibrosis score or 4-6) were treated with Lamivudine for 8-9 years. The objects of this observation were to evaluation the histological improvement and the virological, ALT responses, and resistance outcomes. The progression of the diseases was also observed. Results: 1.16 (32.65%) patients had evaluable repeat biopsies. Among the total, the results of Scheuer inflammation score are as below: 6 (37.50%) patients with G0, 6 (37.50%) G1, 4 (25%) G2, and no G3 and G4 in patients were found. The Scheuer fibrosis score are as below: 4 (25%) patients with S0, 3 (18.75%) S1, 2 (12.50%) S2, 5 (31.25%) S3, 2 (12.50%) S4. It is considered that the Scheuer fibrosis score 4 is roughly equal to the Ishak fibrosis score 5-6. Background: Safety and therapeutic efficacy of a combination therapy of antiviral drug and immune modulator was assessed in IDHAS in Bangladesh. Methods: HBV infection was detected in 25 apparently healthy subjects, who visited our hospital with different motives. These patients were given lamivudine (100 mg) orally, once daily for 12 months. Hepatitis B vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (10 lg) was administered intra-muscularly along with lamivudine for five times (at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 months). Patients were regularly followed up to assess whether the combination was safe or not. The therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy was evaluated 13 months after commencement of the clinical trial. Result: Combination therapy was safe for all patients and local or systemic adverse effects were not recorded in any patient. At the end of the trial, the levels of HBV DNA were decreased in all patients, and become undetectable in 16 patients (64%). Flare of alanine aminotransferase was not detected in any patient. Conclusion: Combination therapy with antiviral agent and immune modulator represents one of the therapeutic options for containment of the virus in asymptomatic HBV carriers. Background and Aims: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health issue, and the prognosis of patients with HBV-associated acuteon-chronic hepatic failure (ACLF) is extremely poor. In this study, the efficacy of lamivudine was investigated in patients with ACLF. The effects of HBV DNA load and its related factors on the prognosis were also further explored. Methods: A matched retrospective cohort study using data on ACLF patients derived from our hospital database was conducted. 130 patients receiving lamivudine were selected into the lamivudine treatment group with another 130 without lamivudine treatment studied as control. They were matched for sex, age and imaging finding with lamivudine treatment group. All the patients were followed up for 3 months and the survival rates were compared. The influential factors on the mortality were studied by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The cumulative survival rates of patients in lamivudine group were higher than those of the control group (v 2 = 9.50, P = 0.0021). The mortality of patients with high virus load group (71/95, 74.7%) was higher than that of those with low virus load group (15/29, 51.7%) (v 2 = 5.536, P = 0.019). For patients with MELD score 20-30, by week 4, the mortality of those with HBV DNA undetectable or declined for more than 2 log 10 (2/12, 16.7%; 18/40, 45.0%) was lower than that of those with a less than 2 log 10 decline (18/23, 78.3%) (v 2 = 10.106, P = 0.001). In Cox proportional hazards model, for patients with MELD score 20-30, treatment method (P = 0.002), pretreatment HBV DNA load (P = 0.007) and decline of HBV DNA load during therapy (P = 0.003) were independent predictors; for those with MELD score above 30, MELD score (P = 0.008) was the only independent predictor. Conclusions: Lamivudine can significantly decrease the 3-month mortality of patients with MELD score 20-30, and a low pre-treatment viral load and rapid decline of HBV DNA load are good predictors for the outcome of the treatment.",

However, serum HBVDNA levels below 500 copies/ml was significantly higher in HBeAg negative patients (59%) Background: In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, upregulation of the expression of the programmed death molecule (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) on T cells is associated with impaired T-cell activation and function. We examined the relationship between telbivudine-induced viremia reduction and HBeAg seroconversion with regard to PD-1/PD-L1 levels and Tcell reactivity in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: Ten (8 male, 2 female) patients seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen and HBeAg, with HBV DNA levels [10 5 copies/mL and alanine aminotransferase levels [29 the upper limit of normal, received telbivudine 600 mg/day. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were extracted from heparinized blood samples obtained from patients at baseline and weeks 12 and 24 of telbivudine treatment. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression were assessed by flow cytometry. HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were quantitated by pentamer staining. T-cell reactivity to HBV antigens was determined by interferon-c (IFN-c) assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: During treatment, two patients experienced HBeAg loss, two patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion, and six patients remained HBeAg positive. Reduction in PD-1 and PD-L1 expression correlated closely with levels of viremia at treatment weeks 12 and 24. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression decreased markedly on total CD8+ T cells and HBV-specific CD8+ T cells; this decrease was associated with an increase in IFN-c production. HBeAg seroconversion resulted in a further reduction in PD-1 and PD-L1 expression, an increased frequency of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells, and increased IFN-c production. Conclusions: The telbivudine-induced suppression of HBV replication reduces PD-1 expression, which partially restores the function of HBV-specific CD8+T cells.",

HBeAg loss occurred in two of the subjects. In multivariate analysis, female gender (P = 0.014) and HBeAg negativity (P = 0.024) were independent predictive factors for virological response. YMDD mutants test was followed at 16 months (ranged 9-27) in selected eight of the patients with HBeAg-positive among 25 patients of partial viral responder. However, all eight of the patients persistently showed YMDD mutants.",

Viral-induced ALT flares were more common than host-induced ALT flares (15.9 vs.6.5%, P \\ 0.05), characterized by rapid increased ALT and HBV DNA usually after two-years treatment. The median of ALT increased fold was 5.2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), most of these patients had detected HBV mutations. Host-induced ALT flares had moderate elevated ALT (median 2.5-fold ULN) with a slow decreased HBV DNA procedure, occurred mainly in the first year (63.6%) with favorable long-term treatment outcomes. Besides the 3-years HBV DNA undetectable rate in the viral-induced and hostinduced ALT flare at 8 vs. 85%, HBeAg seroconversion and histological improvement was 10 vs. 85%, and 2 vs. 40%, respectively.

            "text": "Both patients had compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A) caused by CHB and were initially treated with lamivudine. ADV was added at the emergence of lamivudine resistance. The patients were Cambodian Chinese (female aged 53 yr and male 40 yr). Relevant background include partial gastrectomy in the female, hyperthyroidism and possible prior NSAID use in the male. Symptomatic osteomalacia manifested after 4 years and 2 years of ADV. Osteomalacia was diagnosed on clinical, biochemical and imaging grounds. -Serum ALP peaked at 610 U/L and 255U/L (NR 30-115). Both biochemical abnormalities predated clinical manifestation of osteomalacia by more than a year. Hypophosphatemic renal impairment was evident with phosphate 0.57 mmol/L (NR 0.8-1.5), e-GFR 46 (N[ 59 mL/min/1.73m2) and 0.49 and 56, respectively. Renal tubular dysfunction was manifested by phosphaturia, glycosuria and proteinuria. ADV was withdrawn and supplements of calcium, phosphate and vitamin D given. There was good clinical recovery in both cases. Review of 67 consecutive patients on ADV in one single clinic revealed 6 cases with mild decrease in eGFR (50-58 mL/min/1.73m2) and 1 patient with minor hypophosphataemia (0.76 mmol/L). Discussion: These cases represent a rare adverse reaction to ADV with severe osteomalacia associated with Fanconi's type renal tubular dysfunction. Patients with cirrhosis and other co-morbidity such as partial gastrectomy may be most vulnerable and should therefore be monitored closely when ADV is prescribed. Measurement of ALP and phosphate should be part of routine follow up. Background/Aims: A large proportion of patients fail lamivudine treatment and guidelines recommend switching to nucleotides or add-on therapy. The aim of this report is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the switch to adefovir (ADV) monotherapy versus telbivudine (LDT) plus adefovir in CHB patients with confirmed YMDD mutation with prior lamivudine treatment. Methods: 150 HBeAg positive patients were planned to be included into an open label randomized 96-week trial evaluating ADV versus ADV + LDT. The study was terminated early due to difficulties enrolling patients into the ADV monotherapy arm. However, 42 patients were randomized 1:1 (91% Korean). Results: Median treatment duration was 48 weeks and 20 patients per arm completed 48 weeks of treatment. HBV DNA decline at week 24 was higher in the combination arm versus ADV monotherapy arm: -6.7 versus -5.0 log 10 copies/ml (baseline ADV + LDT:10.3; ADV:10.1 log 10 copies/ml). At week 48, HBV DNA decline by -7.4 (ADV + LDT) and -4.9 (ADV) log 10 copies/ml, with 38.5% (5/13) and 0% (0/9) of patients, respectively, achieving undetectable HBV DNA (\\300 copies/ml). Virologic breakthrough occurred in 0% (0/21) of ADV + LDT and 9.6% (2/21) of ADV patients. HBeAg loss was achieved in one patient per arm at week 24 and in 23.1% (3/13) and 0% (0/9) at week 48 in the ADV+LDT versus ADV groups. The safety profile was similar in both treatment arms with 16 AEs reported per group. ALT flares (AASLD criteria) occurred in one patient per arm, increased creatine phosphokinase was reported in 3/21 patients ADV + LDT and 1/21 ADV arm, but all were grade 1/2. One case of musculoskeletal pain and parasthesia each occurred in the combination arm. Conclusion: In these 42 patients with established YMDD resistance on lamivudine treatment, the switch to the combination of telbivudine and adefovir showed better outcomes compared with adefovir alone, and both had a similar safety profile. levels (28% \\300 copies/ml and 28% \\4 log 10 copies/ml). Of the remaining 11 patients who did not sustain HBeAg seroconversion two maintained HBeAg loss and remained HBV DNA negative. Seroreversion (HBeAgpositive and HBeAb-negative) occurred in nine patients during the first 36 weeks follow-up. No seroreversion was observed after 36 weeks. Durability of HBeAg seroconversion was higher in Genotype B (100%, 19/19) than in Genotype C (74%, 28/38) patients. All nine patients who experienced seroreversion were Genotype C. Conclusion: HBeAg seroconversion induced by telbivudine is durable after stopping treatment for 2 years. The majority of patients have HBV DNA levels \\4 log 10 copies/ml and do not require treatment as recommended by international guidelines. These data indicate, that treatment with telbivudine can be discontinued in patients with HBeAg seroconversion and low levels of HBV DNA. Results: At week 48, mean reduction in serum HBV DNA levels from baseline was -5.3 log 10 IU/mL in entecavir group and -4.9 log 10 IU/mL in clevudine group (P = 0.089). The proportions of patients with undetectable serum HBV DNA levels (\\13 IU/mL by real-time PCR) at week 48 was 81.2% in entecavir group and 67.2% in clevudine group (P = 0.062). In addition, the rates of ALT normalization and HBeAg loss or seroconversion were not significantly different between two groups (75.4 vs. 77.6%, 23.3 vs. 12.8%; P = 0.757, 0.194, respectively). However, the incidence of virologic breakthrough in the entecavir group was significantly lower than in the clevudine group (0 vs. 7.5%; P = 0.021). Multivariate analysis showed that serum HBV DNA levels at week 24 C2,000 IU/mL was an only independent factor that affected virologic breakthrough (P = 0.005). Conclusions: Entecavir therapy showed a non-significantly higher virologic response and significantly lower resistance at week 48 than clevudine therapy. and improve outcomes. Treatment options are limited, with tenofovir associated with risk of further renal dysfunction and increased risk of lactic acidosis recently reported in cirrhotic patients with entecavir. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of telbivudine (LDT) and lamivudine (LAM) in decompensated CHB patients using a non-inferiority statistical analysis. Aims: To assess initial virological response (IVR) to lamivudine (3TC) and entecavir (ETV) treatment for na\u00efve chronic hepatitis B patients, to identify patients with suboptimal response and to assess IVR to ETV and combination of 3TC and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) for 3TC-resistants. Methods: One hundred seventy-four patients who received nucleos(t)ide analogues were retrospectively investigated. Initially 155 treatment-na\u00efve patients were enrolled. Seventy-one were administered 100 mg 3TC for 51 \u00b1 28 months; 84 were 0.5 mg ETV for 18 \u00b1 16 months. Thereafter, efficacy of ETV and that of combination 10 mg ADV with 3TC were examined in 28 patients resistant to 3TC for 39 \u00b1 15 and for 27 \u00b1 18 months, respectively. Antiviral failure was evaluated based on the definition reported by A. Gallego (J Viral Hepat, 2008) . Results: Primary antiviral treatment failure for na\u00efve cases in ETV is similar to that in 3TC, however, IVR is superior in ETV to in 3TC (91.9 vs. 78.4%, p = 0.0458, Fisher's test). Na\u00efve patients treated with 3TC, in which 71.4% were e antigen positive, showed a higher risk of secondary antiviral treatment failure (SATF) than those treated with ETV (P = 0.007, Logrank test). SATF for these treated with 3TC was significantly higher in e antigen-positive cases (P = 0.033, Fisher's test). 3TC-resistant patients treated with ADV and 3TC showed a lower risk of SATF than those treated with ETV (P = 0.0143, Logrank test). These patients were e antigen-positive, and their nucleotide sequences had ETV-resistant mutations including 3TC-resistances. Conclusions: ETV is superior to LAM for e antigen-positive na\u00efve Japanese patients. However, combination therapy of 3TC and ADV is recommended for those resistant to 3TC. Background: Chronic immunosuppression is a mainstay of treatment for rheumatologic diseases. However, it has been associated with hepatitis B reactivation. This review focused on the effectiveness of lamivudine as prophylaxis or treatment of hepatitis B reactivation among patients with rheumatologic diseases on chronic immunosuppression.",

Search yielded 18 studies including 4 observational cohort studies (1 prospective, 3 retrospective). Case reports and review articles were excluded. Authors were contacted to get fulltext articles. Results: Forty-four rheumatologic patients on prednisolone alone or in combination with DMARDS or biologics, received Lamivudine 100 mg/day as treatment (n = 22) for reactivation or as prophylaxis (n = 22). One studyincluded five Lupus Nephritis patients while the other three studies included patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (n = 14), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (n = 6), Ankylosing Spondylitis (n = 4), Polymyalgia Rheumatica (n = 5), Psoriatic Arthritis (n = 3) and one patient each with Systemic Sclerosis, Sjogren's Syndrome, Dermatomyositis/Polymyositis, Takayasu Arteritis, Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and Behcet's syndrome. Elevated levels of alanine transferase (ALT) at baseline (n = 22) normalized shortly after lamivudine therapy. HBV-DNA levels were significantly suppressed in 17 patients after treatment. Two patients developed treatment-resistant YMDD mutation of HBV and had to be shifted to adefovir. There were no major adverse events reported and lamivudine treatment appeared safe and well-tolerated. Conclusion: Lamivudine as treatment and prophylaxis for hepatitis B reactivation seems to be a promising strategy in rheumatologic patients on chronic immunosuppression. However, the studies are limited by small sample sizes and heterogeneity, in terms of the type of rheumatologic disease, type and dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, as well as the duration of lamivudine treatment. There is a need for further prospective, preferably randomized controlled trials including a larger set of patients. Background: Adefovir mono-switch has been accepted as an effective rescue therapy in patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B. Recently, adefovir add-on therapy is recommended in aspect of the antiviral potency and resistance. We aimed to compare the clinical efficacy between adefovir monoswitch and adefovir add-on therapy in lamivudine-resistant patients. Methods: Sixty-one patients with chronic hepatitis B, who underwent a rescue therapy due to lamivudine resistance, were retrospectively investigated. After confirmation of genotypic resistance for lamivudine, twenty-nine patients were shown to receive adefovir monotherapy and 32 patients were treated with adefovir add-on therapy. We compared the biochemical, virological, and serological responses during 48 months of the investigation. Results: Baseline clinical, biochemical, virological characteristics presented no significant difference in two groups prior to rescue therapy. ALT normalization rate at 48 months was 89.7% in monotherapy and 87.5% in add-on therapy.",

The rates of HBeAg loss with seroconversion were 26.5 and 29.4% in monotherapy and add-on therapy, respectively. Time to seroconversion was shorter in combination therapy (11.8 months) than monotherapy (7.2 months), but not significance. There were no factors that showed significant difference in treatment efficacy. Following 48 months of treatment, greater HBV DNA breakthrough was observed in monotherapy than add-on therapy (24.1 vs. 9.7%, p \\ 0.05).

Conclusions: The biochemical, virological and serological responses in both rescue regimens showed not much difference in patients with lamivudineresistant chronic hepatitis B, except viral breakthrough being more often in adefovir mono-switch. Background: Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) is a natural products that inhibits the replication of a number of virus, our recent study indicated PAP exibited potent anti-HBV activity, the major obstacle in applying PAP as an anti-HBV weapon is the challenge to deliver it to the liver specifically and efficiently without cytotoxicity. Aims: To develop a new strategy that ensue specfic and effective down regulated HBV gene expression and replication by PAP. Method: The full-length, N-terminal and C-terminal truncated PAP expression vector were co-tansfected with 1.3-fold replication competent HBV construct (pHBV1.3) to HepG2 cell respectively, HBsAg and HBeAg in supernatants were determined by using ELISA, Viral DNA intermediates were detected by Southernblot and cytotoxicity were evaluated by MTT assays. Recombinant HBV vector was constructed by modifying the wild type HBV (genotype A), a 405-nt fragment within core gene was replaced by a in frame C-terminal 25 amino acid truncated PAP (PAPc), with polymerase ORF intact.Expression of PAP was identified by way of Western blot assay, rescue of rHBV replication and its anti-HBV activity were evaluated by co-transfected with HBV core expression plasmid and wt-pHBV1.3, or transfected to HepG2.2.15 cell. Results: The full-length and PAPc could effectively down regulate extracellular production of HBsAg and HBeAg and the levels of intracellular coreassociated viral DNA. More interestingly, PAPc almost has no cytotoxicity than that of full-length by MTT assay. A recombinant HBV (rHBV) containing a modified viral core gene that specifically delivers PAPc to the liver. This recombinant virus could be self-maintained in hepatocytes through capsid complementation by wild type HBV or core expression plasmid, and exhibit anti-viral activity in pHBV1.3 co-transfected HepG2 or HepG2.2.15 cell . Conclusion: The N-terminal 69 amino acid of PAP is necessary for its anti-HBV acvity, and C-terminal 25 amino acid is related to its cytotoxicity. HBV as gene delivery vector, that specifically targets the liver and mediated liver specific anti-HBV activity of PAPc. It might represent a promising strategy capable of knocking-down and eradicating the resident HBV in chronically infected patients",

In co-transfected human hepatoma cells and HBV based mouse model, A3B, A3DE and A3F also have inhibitory effect on HBV production. Conclusions: A3G, containing double cytosine deaminase domain could inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo, however, A3G-mediated editing dose not seem to represent the mechanism against HBV replication.Like A3G, the editing enzymes (A3B, A3F, A3DE) which contains double cytosine deaminase domain could also inhibit HBV replication in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to the innate immunity against HBV.

            "text": "Background and Aims: De novo HBV-related hepatitis has been reported in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. We conducted a retrospective study with aim of identifying clinical characteristics associated with de novo HBV-related hepatitis. Methods: Fifty seven patients with hepatitis B surface antigen negative who underwent allogeneic HSCT in our hospital, from January 2005 to September 2007, and were followed at least 1 year after the transplantation were enrolled in this study. Seventeen of these patients were positive for anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and 40 patients were negative. Results: Five of 17 anti-HBc positive patients had de novo HBV-related hepatitis after the transplantation and none of 40 anti-HBc negative did. Median time from transplantation to the event was 14 months (range 7-18 months) and the median peak elevation of AST, ALT and bilirubin were 291 U/l (range 79-1,103 U/l), 243 U/l (range 130-1,340 U/l), and 1.4 mg/ml (range 0.3-8.6 mg/ml), respectively. All five patients were treated with nucleotide analog and resolved after treatment. There was no significant clinical difference between the patients with de novo HBV-related hepatitis (n = 5) and those without hepatitis (n = 10) in age, sex, titer of anti-HBc, with or without HBs-antibody, however the patients with de novo HBV-related hepatitis tended to have more severe chronic GVHD (extended type) than the patients without hepatits (p = 0.08). Conclusion: Among 57 patients with HBs antigen negative who underwent allogeneic HSCT, 5 patients (8.6%) had de novo HBV-related hepatitis. The patients with extended type of chronic GVHD will need more careful attention to de novo HBV-related hepatitis. Aim: To evaluate the efficence of Adefovir alone or combined with Adefovir or Entecavir in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients following Lamivudine initial no response. Methods: fifty nine chronic hepatitis B patients with lamivudine initial no response were enrolled,and divided into group A (n = 40) who received the therapy of Lamivudine combined with Adefovir, group B (n = 10) who switched to Adefovir alone and groups C (n = 15) who switched to Entecavir alone or Entecavir combined with Adefovir for 15 months. Liver function tests and serum virologic responses were evaluated at regular interval in all patients. Results: Normalization rate of liver function in the three groups were similar, but HBV DNA seroconversion rate and HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion rate in the treatment group A were significantly higher than in group B and C (p \\ 0.05), HBV DNA negative rate was up to 100% and HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion rate was up to 17.5% at 15 month in group A and group C, which was significantly higher than group B (p \\ 0.05). Conclusions: The results of different regimen for CHB suggest that the combined therapy with Adefovir as subsequent antiviral therapy following lamivudine initial no response may be beneficial for the chronic hepatitis B. It needed further clinical trail in multicenter to verify the results. Methods: Patients treated with PEGASYS according to local label recommendations are eligible for inclusion and will be followed for up to 3 years post-treatment to assess parameters of response including quantitative HBsAg and HBeAg levels. Baseline data from the first 100 patients enrolled in the study are presented. Results: A total of 380 patients from nine countries have been recruited. Analysis of the first 100 patients enrolled shows: the majority are male (73%) and of Asian/ Oriental origin (75%). Mean age is 34.8 (range 18-67) years. In patients with available data, 55.3% have HBeAg-positive disease, the most common infecting genotypes are HBV genotype C and D, and the mean assumed duration of infection is 15.9 \u00b1 12.0 years.

Rates of response 1 and 5 years post-treatment were significantly associated with on-treatment HBsAg decline (Table) . Rate of HBsAg clearance 5 years post-treatment was highest in patients with a C10% decline in HBsAg at week 12 or 24 and sustained immune control 1 year post-treatment, 40% (10/25) and 45% (13/29), respectively. Conclusion: A C10% on-treatment HBsAg decline with PEGASYS in HBeAgnegative patients is associated with high rates of sustained immune control 1 year post-treatment-an important step towards subsequent HBsAg clearance. Results: Overall rates of HBeAg seroconversion 6 months post-treatment (sustained immune control) and HBsAg clearance were 31% (122/399) and 4% (17/399), respectively. Patients were categorized according to HBsAg level at weeks 12 and 24; the proportion of patients achieving HBsAg B1,500 IU/mL increased from 23% at week 12 to 34% at week 24. On-treatment HBsAg level was significantly associated with sustained immune control 6 months posttreatment ( Figure) . The rates of HBsAg clearance 6 months post-treatment among those who achieved HBsAg B1,500 IU/mL at week 12 or 24 and sustained immune control 6 months post-treatment were 18% (9/51) and 20% (15/74), respectively. Conclusion: On-treatment quantification of HBsAg levels during treatment with PEGASYS can identify patients with a high chance of achieving sustained immune control and HBsAg clearance as well as those less likely to achieve sustained response. This may help guide patient management in the future. As compared with retreatment patients, initial treatment patients had no significant differences in undetectable serum HBV DNA levels, HBeAg loss and seroconversion,and normalization of ALT at week 48, in the entecavir group and the adefovir group respectively. Conclusion and discussion: The entecavir group had significantly higher rate in HBeAg scroconvcrsion and superior reduction in HBV DNA than that in the adefovir group at weeks 24 and 48. As for retreatment patients, entecavir should be given priority to treatment. Background/Aim: Current guidelines recommend antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with elevated ALT. Little clinical treatment data exists for CHB patients with persistently normal ALT levels (PNAL). The aim of the study is to find virologicll effect of peginerferon a-2a treatment in CHB patients with PNAL and significant histological findings (significant necroinflammation with a score of HAI 4 or greater and/or significant fibrosis Ishak's staged at 3 or greater). Methods: The study of all patients with CHB who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy and who had detectable viral load (Taqman Real Time PCR, lower limit of detection is 10 3 copies/ml) was performed. 14 patients who had PNAL (defined as normal ALT measured on at least 3 occasions in the intervals of more than two months over a period of 12 or more months apart prior to biopsy) were identified. These patients were compared with 13 patients with abnormal ALT (C2ULN) during the same period and who had no prior antiviral treatment. Background: Currently available anti-virals are either contraindicated or ineffective in children, specially of Asian origin. The two drugs recommended for children, namely lamivudine and interferon yield frustrating results. The aim of this study was to see the outcome of sequential, combination therapy with lamivudin plus interferon in immunotolerant Bangladeshi children. Methods: We recruited 12 children in this prospective study. They were between 4 and 14 years. Of them, six were boys and six girls. Written informed consent was taken from their parents. They received lamivudine (3 mg/kg body weight) for 2 months, followed by lamivudine (3 mg/kg) plus interferon (3 MIU/sq.m) for another 10 months. They were under follow up during treatment to assess response and manage complications if any. Result: 33% had positive family history of HBV infection, while in rest immediate family contacts tested negative. At baseline, HBV DNA was between 3.9 9 10 4 -4.7 9 10 11 copies/ml by PCR. HBeAg was positive in all at baseline ALT was between 31 and 123 U/L at baseline. At 6 months on treatment, significant reduction of HBV DNA (i.e.[2 log 10 ) was noted in 100% patients, with DNA becoming undetectable (i.e. \\200 copies/ml) by PCR in 25%. HBeAg seroconversion was also noted in similar percentage. At 12 months on treatment, 50% had undetectable HBV DNA as well as HBeAg seroconversion. Significant reduction of HBV DNA was seen in rest 50% with 100% patients achieving ALT normalization.",

Methods: HBV infection was detected in 25 apparently healthy subjects, who visited our hospital with different motives. These patients were given lamivudine (100 mg) orally, once daily for 12 months. Hepatitis B vaccine containing hepatitis B surface antigen (10 lg) was administered intra-muscularly along with lamivudine for 5 times (at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 12 months). Patients were regularly followed up to assess whether the combination was safe or not. The therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy was evaluated 13 months after commencement of the clinical trial. Result: Combination therapy was safe for all patients and local or systemic adverse effects were not recorded in any patient. At the end of the trial, the levels of HBV DNA were decreased in all patients, and become undetectable in 16 patients (64%). Flare of alanine aminotransferase was not detected in any patient. Conclusion: Combination therapy with antiviral agent and immune modulator represents one of the therapeutic options for containment of the virus in asymptomatic HBV carriers.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effect of initial lamivudine (LAM) plus adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) combination therapy and entecavir (ETV) monotherapy on na\u00efve HBeAg-negative CHB patients. Methods: Seventy one CHB patients with HBeAg negative, ALT levels between 2 and 10 times up normal limit (UNL) and HBV DNA levels higher than 10 4 copies/mL were enrolled in this study. Among them, 31 patients were given LAM 100 mg and ADV 10 mg per day and other 40 were given ETV 0.5 mg per day for 48 weeks. In two groups 30% and 32.26% patients were diagnosed cirrhosis respectively. The bark from three Enantia chlorantha was used as therapeutic alkaloid raw material. Bark was dried, milled and dissolved in methanol overnight, and then filtered. The residue had concentrated, and the proteins were precipitated with a small amount of water. The residue was evaporated to dryness. The method was used for isolation of flavonoid, quersetin in pharmacognosy. The yield consisted of five very similar bis-benzyl-isoquinoline alkaloids, maintaining functional control in aqua solution, so that the palmatine structure is the most sensitive to compensate for the others. The proportion of alkaloids remains constant when isolated from natural sources. In this schematic picture the electrons associated with nitrogen, are orphan and the easiest to transform. A capillary zone electropherogram of this five-alkaloid mixture, (the UV-200 nm scan), was used to monitor the changes in electrons. The movement used was slight when alkaloid extract was treated with a strong excess of water by evaporating the alkaloid slurry to dryness at 135\u00b0C. However, a distinct change in electropherograms was obtained. Polarisations taking place simultaneously were recognized in pherograms, which had an opposite function: The tissue degradative and regenerative function. The anastomosis is verified with liver-injured laboratory rodents. Three different lesions were selected as proof: D-GalN., ThAA and Allyl-alcohol. The curative influence on the liver was observed in all cases under study. The special observations were concentrated on sinusoids, which regulate the blood flow and give impact to anastomoses (the capability to provide alternative blood flow to portal veins despite obstructions There is an increased need of transport for the waste of cell apoptosis and other degradation product like fibrotic tissues, collagens and procollagens.

This study was to investigate the efficacy of nucleot(s)ide analogues therapy in patients with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis in China. Methods: 111 patiens with HBeAg-negative cirrhosis were divided into antiviral group (58 cases, 25 entecavir, 19 adefovir dipivoxil, 13 lamivudine, 1 telbivudine) and control group (53 cases, supportive and symptomatic treatment). These two groups were matched for demography, liver function and Child-Pugh score. But the baseline HBV DNA level of antiviral group was higher than that of control group (v 2 = 3.51, P = 0.001). Results: At the 96th week, the rate of ALT normalization and HBV DNA drop (lg copies/ml) in antiviral group were higher than that in control group (v 2 = 4.292, P = 0.038; t = -9.001, P = 0.001, respectively). The rates of HBV DNA negative (\\500 copies/ml) were 88.7% (47/53) and 32.5% (13/40), respectively (v 2 = 31.427, P = 0.001). 3.4% (2/58) patients in antiviral group and 7.5% (4/53) patients in control group developed HCC (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.423). 15.5% (9/58) and 20.8% (11/53) underwent variceal bleeding, respectively (v 2 = 0.514, P = 0.473). 15.4% (2/13) patients with lamivudine treatment emerged YMDD mutations, who were received an ''add-on'' antiviral therapy with adefovir dipivoxil. 10.5% (2/19) Background: Guangdong province is a highly endemic area for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in South of China where HBV vertical transmission from mother was common. HBV vaccine is the main means to prevent HBV vertical transmission. It is not long for the use of recombinant yeast HBV vaccine made in China. This study aimed to find out the seroconversion and immunity duration following recombinant yeast hepatitis B vaccination in newborns from Guangdong province. Methods: Immune response and side effects of recombinant yeast HBV vaccine in neonates were investigated. 166 neonates were divided into two groups according to HBsAg positive state of mothers (31 in HBsAg positive group and 135 in HBsAg negative group) and followed up for 3 years. The response rates were compared between two groups. Result: The total response rate was 90.4% at 12th months and 92.2% at 36th months. There is no significant difference of response rate between HBsAg positive group (80.6%) and HBsAg negative group (92.6%) (P = 0.090) at 12th months. The same result is also seen in the response rate (83.9 vs. 94.1%, P = 0.124) at 36th months. 150 subjects of responders at months 12 remained anti-HBs positive at 36th months. Among 6 infants identified as non-responders in HBsAg positive group, 2 infants were found HBsAg positive and the other 4 subjects received re-immunization. No HBsAg positive infants were found in 10 non-responders in HBsAg negative group. One subject of 4 re-immunization subjects in HBsAg positive group and 2 of 10 re-immunization subjects in HBsAg negative group turn anti-HBs positive. Background: To determine whether there is an inhibitory efficacy of C-specific siRNAs on HBV expression and replication in BHK-21 cells. Methods: The PCR products of HBV C genes were cloned to generate the expression vector pEGFP-C for sequencing. Two siRNA-expressing vectors of C-specific siRNA-S1 and S2 with the length of 23 nt homologous in sequence to the AY517488 C gene were designed and synthesized, according to the HBV genome (genotype B, ayw1 subtype) of CHB patients (GenBank Accession Numbers AY517488). Also, a expressing vector of nonspecific siRNA-S3 was also designed randomly for negative control. They were cloned into vector pU6 and then cotransfected into BHK-21 cells with target gene expression vector of pEGFP-C.",

Currently, no ideal immunological parameter is available to evaluate host antiviral immunity. This study was to investigate whether TCR spectratype can be used as an immunological predictor for antiviral treatment. Methods: Twenty CHB patients were involved in a telbivudine versus laminvudine, double-blind, multicenter trial. Patients were divided into either virological responders (VR) or a combination group including both partial virological responders and patients with virological breakthrough (NVR) according to the 2009 EASL Guidelines. CD8 T cells were sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells at week 12 and 24 by magnetic beads. Twenty-four TCR b chain variable region gene (BV) families transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR and genescaned on ABI sequencer. Results: At week 48, 13 patients were VR (65%) and 7 patients were NVR (35%). Both at week 12 and 24, all 20 patients' scanograms showed various perturbations in some TCR BV families including monoclonicity, oligoclonicity and skewed peaks. The number of perturbation families of CD8 T cells in VR at week 24 was significantly larger than that at week 12 (10.15 \u00b1 3.53 vs. 8.62 \u00b1 3.18, P = 0.024), while the number of perturbation families in NVR at week 24 was significantly less than that at week 12 (7.14 \u00b1 3.67 vs. 8.71 \u00b1 4.42, P = 0.01).

Background: A clinic cohort of chronic hepatitis B cirrhotic patients that were treated with lamivudine/adefovir were monitored for clinical outcomes. Method: Patients were enrolled in a treatment program of lamivudine switching to adefovir upon resistance. Patients were analysed for clinical outcomes and predictors of these outcomes were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Clinical outcomes of ascites, encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), progression in Child-Pugh score, MELD score and mortality were assessed. Data were analysed by Kaplan Meier graphs, log rank test and Cox regression. Results: There were 143 chronic hepatitis B cirrhotics of which 19.6% had decompensated cirrhosis. At 5 years, the mean survival was 83.6%, development of ascites, HCC, encephalopathy and progression in Child-Pugh score was 7, 15.9, 10.8 and 16.9% respectively. Overall progression of liver-related complications was 32.8% at 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that ascites, albumin B28 g/L, Child-Pugh score C7.9, MELD score C10.9 were significantly associated with liver-related complications. Low albumin and low HBV DNA were independent factors for liver associated mortality. Lamivudine resistance did not affect mortality or liver disease progression. When stratified by Child-Pugh status, the mean survival of those with Child-Pugh C was significantly worse than those with Child-Pugh A or B (p \\ 0.001). Early deaths (within 12 months) were due to liver failure or sepsis while those after 12 months were due mainly to HCC. Conclusion: Patients with decompensated chronic hepatitis B cirrhosis may suffer early mortality despite antiviral therapy and should be considered for early liver transplantation.",

CK elevation frequency in telbivudine treatment groups was higher. Majority were Grade 1-2 CK level elevation (1-7 9 ULN). The cause of CK elevation was not induced by myocardial injury. All the paitents had no symptoms. CK elevations in patients were transient and resolved without treatment. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a new member of the IL-1 family, signals through its receptor ST2 and induces T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine synthesis and mediates inflammatory response. This study investigated the role of IL-33 to inhibit HBV replication in vitro. Methods: HBV transgenic mice, Styela plicata, were divided into two as IL-33 treatment group and control group. Serum hepatitis B surface antigen was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method and serum HBV DNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Spleen cytokine IL-4, IL-5, IL-17 and IFN-c, and NK cells, CD4 and CD8 were detected by flow cytometry and a three-color flow cytometry, respectively. The histology of liver tissue was evaluated before and after treatment. Results: Two weeks after starting the therapy, serum hepatitis B surface antigen was significantly lowered in IL-33-treated mice compared to the control group (F = 88.81, P \\ 0.01). Serum HBV DNA was significantly lowered in IL-33-treated mice (F = 20.71, P \\ 0.01). However, the effect of IL-33 could not inhibit the replication of HBV completely. A rebound phenomenon of serum hepatitis B surface antigen and HBV DNA was found 4 weeks after withdrawal of medication. Eight weeks after the beginning of IL-33 therapy the level of IL-4, IFN-c and IL-17 was measured to be 13.56 \u00b1 0.78, 15.62 \u00b1 0.98 and 17.8 \u00b1 0.93%, respectively, compared to the normal control group which was measured to be 3.41 \u00b1 0.38, 3.05 \u00b1 0.89 and 4.84 \u00b1 0.48%, respectively. Histological analysis of liver of IL-33 treated HBV-transgenic mice showed significantly reduced inflammation. Conclusions: IL-33 may be an effective antiviral therapy in treating chronic hepatitis B. IL-33 also inhibits HBV replication in the liver of transgenic mice mediated by IFN-c produced by hepatic cells. Background: Natural Killer (NK) cells, controlled by multiple activating and inhibitory receptors, are an important element of the innate immune response to viral infection including hepatitis B virus (HBV). Recent data indicate that the expression of 2B4(CD244), a member of the CD2 subset of the Ig superfamily, regulate NK functions. In this study we addressed the role of the NK cells marker 2B4 and compared the frequency of peripheral blood CD3 -CD56 + NK cells in CHB patients. Methods: A total of 53 patients of chronic HBV (CHB) patients were selected, treated with Telbivudine (LDT) for 36 weeks, and examined at every 12 weeks treatment for serum HBV DNA loads, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels. Phenotypes of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (T cells, CD3 -CD56 + NK cells, CD3 + CD56 + NKT cells, CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells and 2B4 + CD56 + cells) were analysed using flow cytometry. Results: The results showed significantly reduced numbers of CD3 -CD56 + NK cells with CHB patients (p = 0.013), while the proportion of CD3 + CD4 + T cells, Treg cells and the ratio of CD4/CD8 were significantly higher than that of healthy controls (p = 0.025, p = 0.006 and p = 0.046). The expression of receptor 2B4 + on CD3 -CD56 + NK cells were lower in CHB patients compared to that in healthy controls (p = 0.021). The CD3 -CD56 + NK and 2B4+ expression on natural killer cells in post-treatment group were increased than that in pre-treatment group (p = 0.001). A significant inverse correlation was obtained between 2B4 + CD56 + NK cells and HBV DNA levels (R = 0.278, p = 0.035). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the concentration of 2B4 + CD56 + NK cells normalizes with LDT treatment in CHB patients. The finding that HBV was associated negatively with the concentration of 2B4 + CD56 + NK cells suggests that immune activation in CHB patients receiving LDT influences the target cell recognition by NK cells. Background: To observe the clinical treatment effects of the HBsAg pulsed autologous dendritic cells (anti-HBV-DC) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) combine lamivudine and Thymosin-a1 for the chronic HBV carriers. Methods: Thirteen HBeAg positive and two HBeAg negative chronic HBV carriers included in the study. Taking peripheral venous blood 50 ml and obtain PBMC, GM-CSF and IL-4 induced expansion of DC. At the sixth days, a 30 lg HBsAg was give to pulse the DCs. At the seventh days, the anti-HBV-DCs were harvested and were injected into body by subcutaneous and intravenous. Every 2 weeks one time, a total of six times. 100 mg Lamivudine every day, and 1.6 mg thymosin-a1 every one week 2 times. Results: The serum HBsAg, HBeAg and HBVDNA were significantly decreased at 4, 12 weeks. One patient's HBcAb was from negative converted to positive after treatment. One patient's HBsAb turn positive at 4 weeks. The HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion occurred in one patient at 4 weeks, the conversion rate was 7.69% (1/13). The HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion occurred in another patient at 12 weeks. The total HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion rate was 15.39% (2/13). The serum HBVDNA negative conversion occurred in four patients at 4 weeks, the negative conversion rate was 26.67% (4/15). The serum HBVDNA negative conversion occurred in other four patients at 12 weeks. The total serum HBVDNA negative conversion rate was 53.33% (8/ 15). Three patient's ALT increased to 1-2 times normal value at 4 weeks, but returned to normal in two patients at 12 weeks. Another case's ALT have a mild increase at 12 weeks. Conclusions: The anti-HBV-DC combine lamivudine and Thymosin-a1 can effectively inhibit HBVDNA replication, decrease rapidly the serum HBsAg, HBeAg and HBVDNA levels, and enhance the HBeAg/HBeAb seroconversion rate, which were a safe and effective treatment method for the chronic HBV carriers.",

Case Description: A 43-year-old man with no history of alcohol abuse was diagnosed with active hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B during occupational screening. He had a history of icterus during adolescence though no diagnosis had been made. Laboratory findings showed that he was hepatitis B surface antigen-positive with a serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level of 6.1 x 10 7 IU/mL. His alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 89 IU/mL and he had a slightly enlarged liver with normal vessels and bile ducts and no ascites. Liver histology was grade 10, stage 6 on Ishak scoring. He was started on tenofovir 300 mg/day and monitored every 3 months. His HBV DNA level declined to 5.8 9 10 2 IU/mL at 3 months and 1.4 9 10 3 IU/mL at 6 months.",

            "text": "Corresponding ALT values were 42 and 36 IU/mL, respectively. In light of the persistent detection of HBV DNA, the presence of cirrhosis, and the high likelihood of indefinite therapy, telbivudine 600 mg/day was initiated as addon therapy. When the patient was evaluated 6 months later, his HBV DNA had become undetectable and his ALT level had declined even further to 23 IU/ mL. HBV DNA remained undetectable 3 months after that and his ALT level was 21 IU/mL. Conclusions: The addition of telbivudine to tenofovir resulted in a sustained suppression of HBV DNA within 6 months. These finding show the benefit of telbivudine therapy in patients with liver cirrhosis. Background: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-based vaccines have been used as immune therapeutic approaches in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Unfortunately, the clinical outcome is inconclusive. We postulated that both HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg)-specific immune responses are essential for containment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in CHB. Methods: A nasal vaccine containing both HBsAg and HBcAg were prepared (Center for Genetic and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba); safety and efficacy of this vaccine was confirmed in normal human volunteers. After receiving permission from institutional review board and written consents, 17 treatmentna\u00efve patients with CHB were immunized 5 times with a vaccine that contained human-consumable HBsAg (50 lg) and HBcAg (50 lg) through nasal route using a special device. All patients were followed up regularly, once in every 2 weeks, for 6 consecutive months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from these patients one month after end of the 5 vaccinations and we assessed if they harbor HBsAg and HBcAg-specific immunocytes. Results: Nasal vaccinations were safe for all patients. Flare of alanine aminotransferase was not seen in any patient due to vaccinations. Although all Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 159 patients were expressing HBV DNA in the sera before vaccination, HBV DNA became undetectable (HBV DNA \\200 copies/ml) in the sera in 6 patients and reduced significantly in 5 patients due to nasal vaccination. The serum levels of interleukin (IL)-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were significantly increased after 5 nasal vaccinations compared to their pre-vaccinated levels (p \\ 0.05). Vaccination also induced both HBsAg and HBcAg-specific lymphocytes in CHB patients. Background: Restoration of host immunity has been reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) after treatment with lamivudine; however, the underlying mechanisms of this treatment have not been determined. This study examined the role antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC) in restoration of host immunity in the context of lamivudine therapy. Methods: Circulating DC were isolated from peripheral blood of 23 CHB patients before and 1, 3, and 12 months after starting lamivudine therapy. The non-antigen-specific proliferation of DC was assessed in allogenic mixed leukocyte reaction. DC were cultured with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) to prepare HBsAg-pulsed DC. Proliferative capacity and production of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon (IFN)-c of HBsAg-pulsed DC were evaluated in culture.",

            "text": "Results: T cell stimulatory capacity of DC were increased significantly 1, 3 and 12 months after lamivudine therapy compared to their pre-treatment levels (p \\ 0.05). However, the levels of activation of DC at 3 and 12 months were not significantly higher compared to their levels 1 month after therapy commencement (p [ 0.05). HBsAg-pulsed DC also produced significantly higher levels of IL-12 and IFN-c due to lamivudine therapy compared to their levels before therapy (P \\ 0.05). HBsAg-pulsed DC from lamivudine-treated patients induced proliferation of HBsAg-specific T cells of CHB patients in an antigenspecific manner (p \\ 0.05). Conclusion: Immune restoration due to lamivudine therapy is regulated at least in part by activation of DC. This indicates that lamivudine is not merely an antiviral agent, but, possess direct or indirect immune modulation capacities in CHB patients. However, progressive activation of DC and immune modulation did not persisted 1 month after start of lamivudine therapy indicating that an immune therapeutic agent may increase therapeutic efficacy of lamivudine in CHB patients. Background/Aims: Clevudine (CLV) and entecavir (ETV) were recently approved in Korea as antiviral drugs against chronic hepatitis B (CHB). This study was aimed to compare treatment efficacy, resistance rate and reduction of HBsAg between CLV and ETV therapy. Methods: A total of 114 treatment-naive patients with CHB who visited Samsung Medical Center and received CLV 30 mg or ETV 0.5 mg a day for more than 12 months were analyzed retrospectively. Virological response (VR; HBV DNA \\300 copies/ml), biochemical response (BR; ALT \\40 IU/ml), HBeAg seroconversion, and HBsAg reduction (Abbott ARCHITECT HBsAg assay) were assessed. Results: Initial mean HBV DNA levels were 7.4 log 10 (N = 58) in CLV and 7.7 log 10 copies/ml (N = 56) in ETV groups. VR and BR were achieved in 31/38 (82%) and 31/38 (82 %) patients in CLV group and 49/56 (88%) and 44/56 (79%) patients in ETV group, respectively at month 12. For 54 patients who were followed up to month 24, VR and BR were achieved in 25/31 (81%) and 24/31 (77%) patients in CLV group and 21/23 (91%) and 18/23 (78%) patients in ETV group, respectively. HBeAg seroconversion at 24-month occurred in 5/12 (42%) patients in CLV group and 2/10 (20%) patients in ETV group. During 1-year treatment, no resistance was observed in both groups, while at year 2, viral breakthrough with YIDD mutation occurred in 4/56 (7%) patients in CLV group and no viral breakthrough in ETV group. At month 24, the patients with VR at month 12 in CLV group showed -0.2 log IU/mL of HBsAg reduction, while in ETV group, HBsAg titer was not reduced (+0.05 log IU/ml). Conclusions: Both of CLV and ETV showed potent antiviral activity against CHB. ETV was superior to CLV in resistance profile. However, serum HBsAg reduction known to correlate with hepatic cccDNA was observed only with CLV treatment. Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) inoculation is the best way to prevent HBV infection; however, there are 4-10% of immunized people have no specific protective antibodies. Additionally, there are lots of chronic HBV infectors including healthy HBsAg carriers, whose health are risk because of the susceptibility to hepatocyte injury. It is impending to promote the HBV vaccination effects and improve the anti-viral function in the body. Methods: Mice were vaccinated with HBV vaccine (1 mg/mouse for adult and 0.5 mg/mouse for newborn) i.m. and re-vaccinated after 2 weeks. Mouse IL-12 was studied for its adjuvant effects on HBV vaccination in several mouse models including adult and newborn wild type mice, chronic HBV carriers induced by hydrodynamic vein injection of HBV DNA plasmids, HBs-Tg mice and HBV transgenic mice. Serum anti-HBs antibody was measured to show the vaccination effect. Results: It was observed that used as adjuvant 500 ng mIL-12 could obviously increase the antibody levels in BALB/c mice and 50 ng mIL-12 could obviously increase the antibody levels in C57BL/6 mice. The antibody has been increased for 10 weeks and is still observed for its persistent time. The different injection combination of mIL-12 with HBV vaccine would cause different effects on the vaccination. In the newborn C57BL/6 mice, 25 ng mIL-12 could obviously increase the antibody levels and even a low dose of 5 ng mIL-12 could do. Chronic HBV plasmid carriers, HBs-Tg mice and HBV-Tg mice were immune-tolerance to HBV vaccine. For these mice, mIL-12 as used in wild type mice could not induce the antibody production. mIL-12 was injected to mice for more than three times and then HBV vaccine was administrated. A long time observation has been performed on these mice. Conclusions: These studies would be a great benefit to the people with failure HBV vaccination at present and chronic HBV carriers. Aims: To examine changes in the magnitude, frequency and specificity of HBV-specific T-cells following nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment of CHB in a prospective longitudinal cohort study. Methods: Whole blood from treatment na\u00efve patients with CHB (n = 11; HBeAg-positive = 3) initiating lamivudine (n = 9) or tenofovir (n = 2) therapy was incubated with overlapping HBV peptides to the full HBV proteome. Production of TNF-a, IFN-c and IL-2 in CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells was quantified using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) at weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48. Results: Prior to NRTI treatment, HBV DNA (median (IQR)) and ALT were 5.9 (4.9-6.8) log IU/ml and 59 (50-194) IU/ml respectively and both significantly declined over 48 weeks (p = 0.008 and p = 0.01 respectively). 89% of patients had undetectable HBV DNA by week 48. The magnitude of CD4 + IFN-c and dual TNF-a and IFN-c responses significantly declined (p = 0.006 and p = 0.036 respectively) following NRTI treatment. Consistent with these findings, there was also a significant decline in the frequency of CD4 + dual TNF-a and IFN-c responses (p = 0.0009). There were no significant changes in the frequency or magnitude of HBV-specific CD8 + Tcell responses following treatment. The majority of cytokine + responses were towards [1 peptide pool. At baseline the mean magnitude of CD4 + TNF-a and IFN-c responses to precore peptides was significantly greater than to X, surface or polymerase (p = 0.004), however, at subsequent time points following treatment there was no preferential response to any specific peptide pool.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Using multi-parameter ICS we found a significant decline in HBV-specific CD4 + T-cell responses and no change in HBV-specific CD8 + T-cell responses following effective NRTI treatment. Despite significant declines in HBV DNA with treatment there is no recovery of HBV-specific immunity. Background: Entacavir (ETV) is a nucleoside analogue that effectively inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase, resulting in rapid viral suppression. However, the efficacy of ETV rescue therapy in patients who had previously experienced antiviral treatment with lamivudine (LVD) and adefovir disoproxil (ADV) is unclear. We analyzed the clinical outcomes of ETV monotherapy in patients who were resistant to LVD and ADV sequential therapy. Methods: A total of 33 CHB patients who had shown viral breakthrough or suboptimal response with LVD and ADV sequential therapy were treated with 1.0 mg of ETV for at least 48 weeks. Virologic response was defined as a serum HBV DNA reduction to undetectable levels (\\300 copies/mL). The mean reduction in the serum HBV DNA and the rates of virologic response, HBeAg seroconversion, and alanine transaminase (ALT) normalization were monitored until 48 weeks. Result: In the 33 CHB patients, the rates of virologic response and ALT normalization were 18.2% (6/33) and 66.7% (14/21) at 48 weeks, respectively. Viral breakthrough occurred in 21.2% (7/33) during ETV rescue therapy. In 27 HBeAg-positive CHB patients, the rate of virologic response and ALT normalization were 18.5% (5/27) and 58.8% (10/17), respectively. The mean reduction in serum HBV DNA from baseline to the end-point was 2.60 log copies/mL. Serum HBeAg seroconversion in the patient who received ETV occurred in 6.6% (2/30) at 48 weeks. In six HBeAg-negative CHB patients, the rate of virologic response and ALT normalization were 16.7% (1/6) and 100% (4/4), respectively. The mean reduction in the serum HBV DNA from baseline to the end-point was 1.31 log copies/mL. Conclusion: The 48 weeks ETV monotherapy resulted in low antiviral response and early ETV resistance in patients with LVD and ADV resistant-HBV. Background and aims: Adefovir (ADV) has been reported to be effective against both to the lamivudine (LMV) resistant HBV and wild-type HBV with similar degree of viral suppression. But, in patients carrying LMV resistant, it has been reported that viral breakthrough and the emergence of ADV resistant mutation occurred more often in ADV monotherapy group compared to ADV/ LMV combination. Most of the previous studies were confined to HBeAg negative patients. Aims of or study was to compare the antiviral efficacy and ADV resistance in lamivudine resistant HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients treated with ADV mono-vs. ADV/LMV combination under the circumstances with tenofovir (TDF) was not available. Methods: 128 LMV resistant HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients treated with ADV mono-(n = 92) or ADV/LMV combination (n = 36) were selected and analyzed retrospectively. Liver function test, HBV DNA, HBeAg and anti-HBe antibody were measured every 3 months. Results: In ADV or ADV/LMV patients, treatment baseline ALT (mean, IU/L, 246 vs. 196, p = ns), HBV DNA (mean, log 10 copies/mL, 7.9 vs. 7.8, p = ns) were not different. Mean duration of ADV mono-or ADV/LMV combination was 37.9 months and 28.8 months in each group. During the 36 months of treatment, ALT normalization occurred in 90% of ADV momo-and 88.8% of ADV/LMV combination groups, respectively (p = ns). DNA reduction from baseline at treatment months 12, 24 and 36 was 3.1 versus 3.3 (p = ns), 3.6 vs. 4.2 (p = ns) and 3.8 vs. 5.2 (p = 0.057) in each group, respectively. Viral breakthrough were observed in 30 of 92 (32%) patient with ADV monotherapy and 1 of 36 (2%) patient with ADV/LMV combination group and it was statistically significant (p = 0.001 Background and Aims: According to Chinese National Guidelines concerning the treatment and prevention of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, treatment with interferon (IFN)-based therapy is contraindicated in patients with ALT more than 10 times upper limit of normal (10 9 ULN), although no such contraindication is given in recent European and American guidelines. There is currently a lack of published data on the efficacy and safety of IFN-based therapy in this population of patients. We therefore aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS) in HBeAg-positive CHB patients with ALT [10 9 ULN. Methods: A total of 25 patients (13 with ALT 2-10 9 ULN and 12 with ALT [10 9 ULN at baseline) received peginterferon alfa-2a 180 lg s.c. once weekly for 48 weeks, with a follow-up period of 12 weeks post-treatment. Liver function, HBV DNA levels, HBeAg and HBsAg were measured at baseline, at weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 of treatment and at 12 weeks post-treatment (week 60). Results: In patients with baseline ALT [10 9 ULN, after 48 weeks of treatment 11 (91.7%) were HBV DNA negative, 10 (83.3%) achieved HBeAg seroconversion, 9 (75.0%) had normal liver function, and 4 (33.3%) achieved HBsAg clearance. This compares with 10 (76.9%), 8 (61.5%), 7(53.8%) and 1 (7.7%) patients with ALT 2-3 9 ULN, respectively. The difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P \\ 0.05). Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a was well tolerated by all patients and there were no severe adverse events or other safety issues. Conclusions: Treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a was significantly more effective in terms of sustained HBV DNA suppression, HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg clearance and normalization of liver function in patients with baseline ALT [10 9 ULN compared with patients with baseline ALT 2-10 9 ULN. Treatment was well tolerated in all patients.",

At basal evaluation, average ALT level was 102 IU/ml, average AST level was 77 IU/ml. Delta antibody was negative in all of the patients. Average HBV DNA level of these patients was 10 6 copy/ml. At evaluation at 12 months of these patients, ALT and AST normalization (biochemical response) rate was 50%, the negativization of HBV DNA (virologic response) rate was 45% and HBs Ag-Anti HBs seroconversion rate was 3.6%. At 18 months evaluation, 76 patients were evaluated. Average AST level was 41 IU/ml, average ALT level was 49 IU/ml. At 24 month evaluation, biochemical response rate was 43%, virologic response rate was 37%. At the end of second year evaluation, adefovir treatment had been added on 29 patients (38.15%) because of lamuvidine resistance.

Background: There is discrepancy between the EASL and APASL guidelines for lamivudine-resistant patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lamivudine and adefovir (LAM + ADV) rescue therapy and compare it to entecavir (ETV) monotherapy in LAM-resistant CHB patients. Methods: From October 2007 to September 2008, 92 LAM-resistant patients with CHB were consecutively enrolled (47 LAM 100 mg + ADV 10 mg once daily and 45 ETV 1 mg once daily). All patients were followed for at least 12 months. The parameters assessed included normalization of ALT, HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable HBV DNA by PCR (lower detection limit \\300 copies/ml), reduction of HBV DNA, and predictors of virologic response. Results: The median follow-up time was 15 months (range 12-24 months).

            "text": "Conclusions: LAM + ADV combination therapy was more effective for reducing viral load than ETV monotherapy in patients with LAM-resistant CHB. Baseline HBV DNA level was an independent predictor of virologic response. Thus, a combination of more potent drugs such as ETV + TDV may be more beneficial in the management of LAM-resistant CHB patients with a higher baseline HBV DNA level. Background/Aims: In patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), HBsAg titer was reported to reflect cccDNA level. Clevudine is a potent antiviral agent that was proven to be able to reduce cccDNA level and, consequently, HBsAg titer in in vivo animal studies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clevudine for reducing HBsAg titer and to find an independent predictor. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive CHB patients treated with clevudine HCC between January 2007 and December 2008 at a single tertiary medical center in Korea. The reduction of HBsAg titer was defined as the decrease of HBsAg titer below 250 IU/mL. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were applied in statistical analysis. Results: A total of 131 patients were included (mean age 50.9 \u00b1 11.1 years; male 66.4%). Sixty-two patients (47.3%) had liver cirrhosis (LC) and 29 (22.1%) had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

We evaluated and compared the efficacy of LAM + ADV versus ETV in these patients. Methods: A total of 72 patients (HBeAg(+) 66/72, 93%) who had resistance (n = 30) or a partial virologic response (n = 41) to ADV with primary failure of LAM therapy and who were confirmed YMDD(+) were enrolled. They either received LAM (100 mg) in addition to ADV (10 mg) once daily (n = 31) or were switched to ETV (1 mg once daily) (n = 41). All patients were followed for at least 12 months. The parameters assessed included ALT normalization, HBeAg seroconversion, undetectable HBV DNA by PCR (lower detection limit \\300 copies/ml), primary non-response (HBV DNA reduction \\1 log 10 copies/ml at month 3), and reduction of HBV DNA. Results: The median follow-up time was 15 months (range 12-30 months). A primary non-response was more frequently observed in the LAM + ADV group (54.8%) than in the ETV group (29.3%; P = 0.021). At month 12, in the LAM + ADV and ETV groups, the mean reduction in the baseline HBV DNA level was 1.44 \u00b1 1.19 and 1.92 \u00b1 1.24 log 10 copies/ml (P = 0.101), and a virologic response was observed in 7/31 (22.6%) and 8/41 (19.5%; P = 0.777) patients, respectively. In the LAM + ADV and ETV groups, ALT normalization occurred in 11/13 (84.6%) and 16/18 (88.9%; P = 0.566), HBeAg seroconversion in 1/26(3.8%) and 4/41 (9.8%; P = 0.641) and a virologic breakthrough in 2/31 (6.5%) and 6/41 (14.6%; P = 0.452), respectively. Conclusions: Both LAM + ADV combination therapy and ETV monotherapy were not satisfactorily effective in patients with sequential LAM/ADV-resistant CHB. Therefore, sequential monotherapy with ADV should be avoided during the initial management of LAM-resistant patients with CHB.",

            "text": "Long- Background and aims: The best time and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA level during an early adefovir dipivoxil treatment period for predicting the longterm outcome are unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the optimal time and HBV DNA load decline for the prediction of the sustained response in na\u00efve patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil of 2 years long-term follow. Methods: 40 hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic HBV patients treated with adefovir dipivoxil were studied. The HBV DNA levels at the baseline, at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 76 and 104. Results: 17 patients obtained sustained response (HBV DNA level \\1,000 copies/mL, and normal alanine aminotransferase levels) at year 2. When we considered the viral load reduction from baseline to each week of treatment, receiver operating characteristic curves showed good predictions as early as week 24. At the end of week 24, viral load decreased more than 4.0 log in 16 out of the 17 patients with sustained response and in 1 out of the 23 other patients. Week 24 appeared to be the optimal point time for predicting response, with a sensitivity of 88.9%, a specificity of 95.5%, a positive predictive value of 94.1% and a negative predictive value of 91.3%. Conclusion: During treatment with adefovir dipivoxil in na\u00efve patients, viral kinetics showed that week 24 appeared to be the best time point for predicting the long-term outcome. Background/Aims: The definition of partial virological response (PVR) to nucleos(t)ide analogues(NUC) proposed by EASL guideline is based on the lower level of evidence in terms of cut-off level of HBV DNA and time-point to judge it. Therefore, we investigated the optimal PVR criteria for the prediction of virologic response during entecavir (ETV) therapy in treatmentnaive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Methods: Among 161 CHB patients who were consecutively treated with ETV as a first line therapy, 69 patients have completed 2-year ETV treatment. 64 patients were finally enrolled for analysis after excluding 5 non-responders at week 48 (\\1 log reduction of HBV DNA). Four different PVR criteria [cut-off level of HBV DNA (1) undetectable (2) \\3 log 10 copies/mL; time-point to define (1) at week 24, (2) at week 48] were compared for the prediction of 2year virologic response (undetectable HBV DNA by real-time PCR) Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as \\12 IU/mL by real-time PCR using COBAS TaqMan 48 analyzer. Results: In 43(67.2%) HBeAg-positive patients, 9(33.3%) out of 27 patients who showed HBV DNA [3 log 10 copies/mL at week 24 and 10(30.3%) out of 33 patients who showed detectable HBV DNA at week 24, failed to achieve undetectable HBV DNA at week 96. However, 8(72.8%) out of 11 patients who showed HBV DNA [3 log 10 copies/mL at week 48 and 10(52.6%) out of 19 patients who showed detectable HBV DNA at week 48, failed to achieve undetectable HBV DNA at week 96. There was no PVR in HBeAg-negative CHB up to week 48. Conclusions: HBV DNA [3 log 10 copies/mL at week 48 was the best PVR criteria to predict the forthcoming treatment failure to remained detectable HBV DNA at week 96 in HBeAg-positive CHB patients on ETV as a first line therapy. Background: Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is overall recognised in 10% of HIV positive persons, with large differences according to geographical region. Since the widespread use of highly active antiviral therapy (HAART), studies have documented an association between immune reconstitution and alterations in the course of hepatitis B infection. We evaluated the long term evolution of liver disease among patients receiving HAART. Methods: We followed-up 71 HIV/HBV coinfected patients treated with HAART containing, during a period of 5 years. Clinical and biological data were collected every 3 months, immunological and virological data every 6 months, ultrasound every year. Due to availability, in the last year we performed transient elastography (Fibroscan) in every patient. Determination of HBV drug resistance was performed in cases with detectable serum HBV-DNA level. Results: No patients had signs of liver disease in the begining of the study period. After 5 years of follow-up, advanced liver disease was diagnosed in 7/ 71 patients during follow-up: 4 cirrhosis, 2 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 1 fulminant hepatitis. All these patients had high level of serum HBV-DNA, lamivudine resistance and undetectable serum level of HIV. Five of these patients died. The rest of 64 patients had no signs of active liver diseases (normal or less than 2 9 ULN level of ALT, and F0-F1 according to Fibroscan). Lamivudine resistance in these patients was founded in 10 cases. Conclusions: In HIV/HBV coinfected patients treated with HAART, lamivudine resistance is less frequent (23.9%) than in immunocompetent patients (higher than 60%), but when occurred, was associated with an accelerated course of liver disease, with faster progression to cirrhosis, liver insufficiency and HCC. Appropriate monitoring of chronic viral hepatitis B in HIV positive patients include the recognition of lamivudine resistance in every case of detectable HBV-DNA level. Background: Currently, HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is increasing. But there are still controversial on the treatment of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) with ALT\\2 9 ULN. We have investigated the clinical efficacy of nucleotide analogues (NAs) in the treatment of HBeAgnegative CHB with ALT \\2 9 ULN. Methods: The data of patients who were treated by NAs for more than 2 years and with ALT 1-2 9 ULN (n = 102), ALT B1 9 ULN (n = 59) and ALT C2 9 ULN (n = 125) were collected. Virologic response (undetectable HBV DNA) at 12, 24, 48 and 96 W, virologic breakthrough and clinical resistance were analyzed. Results: Compared with the base line, HBV DNA level in all three groups were significantly decreased (P \\ 0.01), and there was no significant difference between ALT 1-2 9 ULN group and ALT C2 9 ULN group. The change of HBV DNA level was significant decreased in ALT B1 9 ULN group at 12, 24 and 36 W (P \\ 0.05). The rat of HBV DNA undetectable at 12, 24, 48 and 96 W was 63.5, 78.5, 79.5 and 86.7% respectively in ALT 1-2 9 ULN group and was 46.5, 53.7, 70.7 and 76.6% respectively in ALTB19ULN group. There was no significant difference between ALT 1-2 9 ULN group and ALT C2 9 ULN group. Compared with the previous two groups, the rat of HBV DNA undetectable 12 and 24 W were significant decreased (v 2 = 7.65, 0.05; v 2 = 20.83, P \\ 0.01) in ALT B1 9 ULN group. There was no significant difference among the three groups in virologic breakthrough and clinical resistance. Conclusion: HBV replication can be satisfactory inhibited by NAs in HBeAgnegative CHB patients with ALT \\2 9 ULN, which suggests that in these patients the indication of ALT is different from HBeAg-positive patients.",

When patients use these drugs like ADV, ETV, Ldt and LAM, the regularity of patients using drugs is a significant factor of therapeutic effect. But we found parts of patients did not complied to the guidance of doctors and induced some bad consequences like bounce of HBV DNA and so on. So we study the reasons of the bad dependence and drug withdrawal when is not to get to the best time to stop drug. Methods: The total 208 CHC patients were investigated. The number of male were 152 and female were 56. Results: The reasons include (1) the number of drugs which patients used were not enough (most in these patients who were came from other cities) (72.6%); (2) economy (4.6%); (3) the patients regarded the condition was improved and it was already not need to have drugs by themselves (9.6%); (4) using drugs irregular (4.5%); (5) listening to the views of other people (include specialist, general practitioner and so on) (4.6%); (6) other (4%). Conclusions: The rate of male is bigger than female in these patients who have bad dependence. It is necessary to enhance the guidance for the patients who is stopping to have drug by themselves and believing the opinions of general practitioner, other patients and so on. The work to help the patients who stop to have drug because they cannot buy enough drug in their cities or have no time to buy the drug and so on is an important thing of our hospitals.",

            "text": "Background and Aim: Treatment of chronic hepatitis B therapy with lamivudine is limited by the emergence of drug resistant mutants. In a minority of LAM-treated patients HBV remains suppressed. Whether a sustained suppression of HBV replication may lead over time to cccDNA elimination (eradication) is still debated. Aim of this work was to study intrahepatic HBV status (cccDNA levels, pgRNA transcription and cccDNA sequence) in chronic HBV patients with a sustained complete virological response to LAM. Methods: Liver biopsies were obtained four patients after 9-11 years of sustained viral suppression under lamivudine treatment (100 mg/day). Patients baseline characteristics were: age 24-57; 2 histological and 1 clinical decompensated cirrhosis; ALT 47-1304 IU/L; platelets 100,000-120,000/ mmc), HBV-DNA from 10 5 to [10 6 cp/m; one patient was HBeAg positive. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from liver biospy samples were used to quantitate both cccDNA levels (real-time PCR with specific primers) and HBV pgRNA (RT real-time PCR). Results: At the last follow-up visit all patients were HBV-DNA negative (\\15 IU/mL), had normal ALT and were anti-HBe positive (patient #3 seroconverted to anti-HBe). HBsAg serum levels ranged from 9.4 to [250 IU/ml and patient #2 was HBsAg negative. cccDNA was present at very low levels in 2/4 patients and was positive in one. pgRNA was detectable in 3 out of 4 patients. Patient #2 was negative for both pgRNA and cccDNA and had very low HBsAg titer. Sequencing, performed both on nuclear DNA and cytoplasmic cDNA, could not detect any of the known LAM resistance mutations in the HBV cccDNA Pol region. Conclusions: No LAM-selected mutations were archived in the cccDNA; cccDNA persists in the majority of patients even after several years of complete suppression of viral replication; combining cccDNA, pgRNA and HBsAg quantification may help selecting candidate patients to suspend ativiral therapy. Background: This prospective study evaluated the clinical outcomes of entecavir treatment in Chinese cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. Methods: Nucleos(t)ide-naive patients with HBV-related compensated (n = 31) or decompensated (n = 73) cirrhosis received entecavir 0.5 mg once daily for 96 weeks. Efficacy assessments included mean change from baseline in serum HBV DNA and the proportions of patients achieving HBV DNA \\1,000 copies/mL and ALT normalization. Changes in Child-Pugh score and liver function improvement (serum albumin, total bilirubin and prothrombin time) were also evaluated. Liver histology was evaluated in 37 patients with paired biopsies. Results: At week 96, 98 and 81% of patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA and ALT normalization, respectively. Mean reduction from baseline HBV DNA was 5.1 log 10 copies/mL. No cases of virologic breakthrough or genotypic resistance to entecavir occurred through 96 weeks. The proportion of patients with Child-Pugh class A disease increased significantly at Week 96 (51%) versus baseline (30%; P \\ 0.003). Liver function improved significantly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Mean serum albumin increased from 27.6 \u00b1 4.4 g/L at baseline to 37.5 \u00b1 6.7 g/L at week 96 (P \\ 0.0001), mean total bilirubin decreased from 49.6 \u00b1 38.3 lmol/L at baseline to 25.3 \u00b1 10.4 lmol/L at week 96 (P \\ 0.0001) and prothrombin time decreased from 15.1 \u00b12.3 s at baseline to 13.8 \u00b1 2.5 s at week 96 (P = 0.0013). Among the 37 patients with paired biopsies, mean decreases in Knodell necroinflammatory score were 2.6, 2.0 and 0.9 points in Child-Pugh class A, B and C patients, respectively. Histologic improvement was strongly correlated with reductions in viral load at week 96 (r = 0.93). Conclusions: Entecavir is an effective treatment option for patients with HBVrelated compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, resulting in sustained virologic suppression, histologic improvement and stabilization or improvement of liver function. Background: Certain pretreatment characteristics and early response to nucleoside analogs (NAs) predict optimal outcomes in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). If hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion and profound and sustained viral suppression is achieved with NA therapy, drug resistance may become less of a concern. In patients with HBeAg-positive CHB, baseline hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels \\9 log 10 copies/mL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels C2 9 upper limit of normal (ULN), and week 24 on-treatment polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-negative viral load predict better HBeAg seroconversion rates and less viral resistance. Similarly, in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB, baseline HBV DNA levels \\7 log 10 copies/mL and week 24 on-treatment PCR negativity predict better outcomes. However, many patients with CHB do not possess these characteristics. This survey was conducted to determine how the pretreatment predictors of response based on the GLOBE study relate to CHB patients considered appropriate for therapy by Filipino clinicians. Methods: Results of a survey of 6 experienced physicians were compiled in a database that included baseline patient demographic characteristics, HBeAg/ anti-HBe status, ALT levels, and HBV DNA levels. Patients with pretreatment ALT and HBV DNA levels predictive of favorable treatment response to NAs were determined. Results: Fifty men (78%) and 14 women (22%) were included. Mean ages were 38 \u00b1 13 and 28 \u00b1 8 years, respectively. Thirty (63%) of the 48 patients with HBeAg-positive CHB had HBV DNA levels B9 log 10 copies/mL and ALT levels C2 9 ULN. Of 16 patients with HBeAg-negative/anti-HBe-positive CHB, 6 (38%) had HBV DNA levels B7 log 10 copies/mL and ALT levels C2 9 ULN. Conclusions: The proportion of Filipino CHB patients with characteristics predictive of favorable outcomes to NA therapy is similar to that of patients in global phase III trials, particularly among HBeAg-positive patients.",

            "text": "Week 24 Conclusions: In the ETV-treated group, significantly more subjects achieved an undetectable HBV DNA level and normalized ALT than patients treated with LVD, supporting earlier data that ETV has greater antiviral activity than LVD through 48 weeks. The safety profile of ETV is comparable to LVD, and similar to previous reports in HBeAg-negative patients. Objectives: To investigate the epidemiology characteristic of HCV infection and the related risk factors for HCV infection and possible transmission route in a prevail community of Fujian province. Methods: A community based epidemiology survey was taken and serum sample was collected to detect of HCV-Ab at the same time. Then amplified part of HCV NS5B gene of seropositive serum by RT-PCR. Phylogeny tree was constructed base on the sequenced result to genetyped the HCV gene and described the gene sequence homology between varied seropositive serum. Results: We investigated and collected 1009 serum sample from 1,351 people of the community. The seropositivity rate of HCV-Ab is 28.15%. There is no significance in seropositivity rate between sex (25.22 vs. 30.56%). It grew with age increased, it was the lowest in age of younger than 10-year-old group (2.14%) and highest in 50-60-year-group (56.70%), there is a significance difference between them. The rate was 3.35% in unmarried versus 43.64% in married (P \\ 0.001). Living with a seropositive family member get a higher positive rate of HCV-Ab than no identified seropositive family member (34.36 vs. 20.70%, P \\ 0.001, OR = 2.01). Farther more living with a seropositive spouse get a positive rate of 69.18% (110/159). Multiple factor logistic regression analysis revealed that age, living with seropositive family member and tooth extraction are independent risk factors of infection HCV. All of the genetype is 1b 88.89% (96/108) and 2a 11.11% (12/108), no any other subtype was found. It is high gene homology between the varied sequenced positive sample and also compared with sequence from mainland of China, Taiwan and Japan. Conclusions: The seropositivity rate of HCV-Ab in the community is 28.15%. All subgenotype of the HCV is 1b and 2a and there are highly gene homology between them. Age and living with seropositive family member are independent risk factors of infected with HCV. Invasive therapy before 1992 may play a key role in the diffusion of HCV when the absence of sterile hypodermic needles for single use. But the route of HCV transmission could not been certainty and farther research are needed. 1. During the 5-year follow-up, only 1.64% (3/183) HCV mono-infected subjects died on the cohort study, which was significantly lower than 21.21% (7/33) for HIV-1 group and 18.05% (26/144) for HCV/HIV-1 group. 2. The cause of death was mainly PCP (14, 38.89%),end-stage liver disease (8, 22.22%), cerebrum-related diseases (7, 19.44%), heart-related diseases (3, 8.33%), cryptococcal meningitis (2, 5.56%) and accident death (2, 5.56%) in this cohort survey (P = 0.0422). HCV co-infected patients are more prone to die with liver associated diseases compared with HIV mono-infected group (1 vs.7, RR = 11.23, 95%CI: 1.34-94.63). 3. AST, ALP and GGT which were indicators of liver function were highest in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected group (P \\ 0.05, P \\ 0.0001 and P \\ 0.0001). Total protein (TP) was also highest in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected group ( P = 0.0088). ALT, ALB, TBIL, DBIL and A/G ratio were no significant differences among the three groups ( P [ 0.05). 4. Periphery CD4+ T cell count were lower in HCV/HIV-1 group (446.33 cells/ll) than in HCV group (864.78 cells/ll, P \\ 0.0001) and HIV-1 group (518.89 cells/ll, P \\ 0.0001).",

Conclusion: Our study draws a conclusion that majority of patients (74 or 41% of total), based on their own opinion, have been infected during medical procedures-surgical operation, visiting dentist or through blood transfusion. Background: Mongolia is known for its high endemicity for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infections among apparently healthy individuals. However, there are little or no data on the prevalence and genotype distribution of HBV, HCV, and HDV among patients with chronic liver disease in Mongolia. Therefore, serum samples obtained in 2004 from 207 patients including those with chronic hepatitis (n = 90), liver cirrhosis (n = 41), and hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 76) were tested for serological and molecular markers of HBV, HCV, and HDV infections.",

Conclusion: The present study revealed that ongoing dual or triple infection of HBV, HCV, and HDV is highly prevalent among patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in Mongolia. Background/Aims: Genotyping of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important for designing therapeutic strategies and region specific diagnostic assays. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of HCV genotypes among patients with chronic hepatitis C in China. Methods: Serum samples from 329 patients with chronic HCV infection from 12 areas in China were analyzed in this study. Viral genotypes were determined by a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of HCV 5' non-coding region (5'UTR). Results: The distribution of HCV genotypes in China was shown in Table 1 . Genotype 1b was common among the chronic hepatitis C group and was observed in 212 (64.4%) of these 329 patients. The subtypes following 1b were 2a (11.8%), 1b/1a (6.1%), 1b/2a (4.3%), 1a (4.0%), 3b (3.3%), 1c (2.1%), 2b (1.8%), 6a (1.2%) and 3a (0.9%). However, in Yanbian, 1a/1b was the dominant subtype (17/43, 40%) followed by 1b, 2a, 1a and 1b/2a. Moreover, subtypes 1b, 2a, 1b/2a, 3b and 1a were detected in more than 6 areas, while 1c was isolated only in Lanzhou and 6a was identified in merely southern areas (Guangzhou and Chongqing). Conclusions: Genotype 1b is the most frequently encountered subtype in China and genotypes 4 and 5 are not observed. However, some differences are noticed between diverse areas. The relationship between HCV genotypes and antiviral therapies or HCV vaccine remains further investigation in the near future. Introduction & Aim: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) in western world, where there is a steady increase in HCVrelated cirrhosis and related complications. In contrast, Hepatitis B is a major cause of CLD in Asia. In India, anti-HCV testing is available since 1993, but is made mandatory in blood banks since 2000. This study was planned to see impact of mandatory testing on clinical practice. Conclusion: After introduction of mandatory testing, awareness for HCV has gone up. This resulted in detection of more patients in asymptomatic rather than decompensated stage; thus increasing chances of treatment eligibility. In recent years, history of specific event leading to transmission of HCV was less commonly seen.",

The HCV genome is extremely heterogeneous, so the current available commercial detection kits that employ singleplex primer/probe hardly detect all the isolates of HCV and the missing detection will arise when the viral was mutated. Methods: By aligning HCV sequences recorded in the Los Alamos National Laboratory HCV sequence database, we developed a real time multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using 2 sets of primer/probes and a specific armored RNA as internal controls. The 2 detection probes were labeled with the same fluorophore (FAM) in the 5' position and the same quencher in the 3' position, which could combined mutually creating greatly improved power of test. The sensitivity and specificity were compared between the singleplex primer/probe assay and multiplex primer/probe assay. Results: The sensitivity of the multiplex primer/probe assay improved significantly, with no effect on its specificity. The limit of detection of the multiplex primer/probe assay was 38.99 IU/ml. All HCV genotypes in the HCV RNA Genotype Panel (NIBSC, code 02/202, UK) could be detected. In the detection of 109 serum samples, the performance of the real time multiplex RT-PCR assay was identical to the COBAS Ampliprep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM) HCV assay and was superior to KeHua HCV RNA detecting kits (Shanghai KeHua Bio-engineering Co., Ltd.) and BIOER HCV fluorescence detection kits (Hangzhou BIOER Techonology Co., Ltd). Conclusions: The real time multiplex RT-PCR assay is a more efficient and effective viral assay as Compared to the singleplex primer/probe assay. Its assay is comparable to the CAP-CTM assay in the power of test and is appropriate for blood donor screening and laboratory diagnosis of HCV infection. Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been identified as the major cause of chronic liver disease among patients on chronic haemodialysis (HD). Information about the genotypes of HCV infected patients in Iran is limited. The aim of this study was to identify the HCV genotypes in group of HCV infected patients on HD in Guilan, North province of Iran. Materials and Methods: Patients on HD in all of 11 Guilan HD centers were enrolled; all sera were screened for anti HCV antibodies by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping was performed in positive anti HCV cases. SPSS 14 was used for analysis and P \\ 0.05 were statistically considered significant. Results: Of 514 patients, 61 had positive anti HCV, (prevalence 11.9%) and among them 32 had positive HCV RNA (52.5%). The most frequent genotypes were 1a and 3a with 59.38 and 40.62% prevalence respectively. There were no significant relations between the type of genotypes and gender or age. Of note was the high prevalence of genotype 3a in Rasht, the capital city of province. Conclusion: HCV genotype pattern in our province, like other parts of Iran, is characteristic of the non-Arab countries of Middle East, where genotype 1 predominates. ",

Conclusion: In our population most of the patients with chronic hepatitis c have mild disease with early histopathological changes. Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a hepacivirus, is a member of the Flaviviridae family. Approximately 2% of the population worldwide is chronically infected with HCV and many of these infections will lead to recurring hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel technique for nucleic acid amplification. This simple and rapid technique relies on strand-displacing synthesis performed using the Bst DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions in the temperature range of 60-65\u00b0C. The method has also been rendered applicable to RNA genomes by combining it with reverse transcription reactions (RT-LAMP). Method: RT-LAMP is characterized by the use of 6 different primers. Amplification and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature of 65\u00b0C. Sensitivity and specificity of primers was tested by RT-LAMP and Nested RT-PCR with RNAs extracted from HCV-infected as template. Results: We performed RT-LAMP reactions using genomic RNA s extracted from 150 HCVRNA-positive serum samples. Results showed RT-LAMP is more sensitive (2000 times) than Nested RT-PCR. Conclusion: RT-LAMP is rapid, sensitive, and specific test and also it could be a convenient tool for detecting HCV infection because it requires minimal laboratory facilities and is relatively simple and inexpensive to perform.",

The rate of HBV and HCV coinfection are high (36% and 50% in all patients and the patients who are in broken compensation stage, respectively). Results: Genotype 1 was found in 50 patients, with 1b in 42 (36%) and 1a in six cases (5%). Two patients were infected with mixed subtype of genotype 1: 1a/1b, 1b/3a. In 43 cases were enrolled 3a (37%), 3c in one patient. Nonclarified subtype of genotype 2, include 2a/2c, was revealed in 68% of cases. Prevalence of genotype 1b was approximately same in patients less than 30 years old (34%), from 30 to 40 (38%) and more than 40 (36%). Percentage of patients with genotype 3 was following in the same groups: 28, 44 and 41%.

As such, SREBP-1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of steatosis. Steatosis is an important clinical manifestation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The molecular mechanisms of HCV-associated steatosis are not well understood. Non-structural protein-5A (NS5A) of HCV is a multi-functional protein which is required for HCV genome replication and plays an important role in HCV-host interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of HCV NS5A protein in modulating SREBP-1 activity. Methods: The NS5A coding sequence of HCV genotype-3a (HCV-3a) was cloned and expressed after transfection into human hepatoma Huh-7 cells. The effect of HCV-3a NS5A on SREBP-1 transcription and maturation was determined by measuring SREBP-1c promoter activity and the level of mature SREBP-1 protein by luciferase reporter assay and immunoblotting analysis, respectively. The impact of NS5A on the activity of FAS promoter was also studied.",

Further analysis showed that transcriptional factor Sp1 is necessary because inhibition of Sp1 activity by mithramycin A or a dominant-negative Sp1 construct abrogated SREBP-1c promoter activation by HCV-3a NS5A. We further showed that HCV-3a NS5A could increase the level of mature SREBP-1 protein. Finally, we showed that HCV-3a NS5A could activate FAS promoter activity in an SREBP-1-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our results indicate that HCV-3a NS5A is likely a contributing factor for steatosis caused by HCV-3a infection. Recently several studies reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b core amino acid (AA) substitutions at positions 70 and 91 are related with the treatment response of peg-interferon (IFN) and ribavirin. HCV core protein is also known to interact with interferon signaling pathways. We examined whether the HCV core substitutions affect IFN and cytokine-related signaling pathways in human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Materials and Methods: We made stably core-expressing cells having 4 kinds of AA substitutions at 70 and 91 and named as follows: WW (70R/91L), WM (70R/91 M), MW (70Q/91L), and MM (70Q/91M). Using these cellular RNAs, we screened IFN and cytokine signaling-related gene by real-time RT-PCR assay using the ddCt methods. We also performed reporter assay of IFN-beta promoter, interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and NFkB response. Results: HCV core proteins were expressed in all cell lysates. With regard to endogenous IFN-related gene, IFN-alfa and -beta mRNAs in cells with WM, MW, or MM (non-WW) were upregulated compared to those with WW (3.3 \u00b1 1.8 and 2.1 \u00b1 1.0 fold). As for cytokine related gene, IL1-beta and IL10 mRNAs in cells with WW were expressed higher than those with WW (3.7 \u00b1 1.3 and 16.5 \u00b1 10.3 fold).

Conclusion: PD-1 was high expression on the surface of CD4 + T lymphocytes and CD8 + T lymphocytes and inhibited the ability of clean HCV in immunocytes result in chronicity of infection. Background: More than 170 million people worldwide are persistently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is yet unclear how this RNA virus establishes a persistent infection. However, it has been suggested that persistent infection appears to be due to virus heterogeneity and weak immune responses during acute infection. Recently, there is increasing evidence that innate immune defense is critical for the control of virus infection. The mechanism of HCV involvement in host innate immune responses, however, has not been fully understood yet. In the present study, we evaluated the expression profile of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway genes in human hepatocytes following HCV infection in vitro. Methods: The HCV replicon system (kindly provided by Dr. CM Rice) was used to generate infectious HCV virons. Viral infection experiments were performed using human hepatic cell line Huh7.5.1 (kindly provided by Dr. FV Chisari). The expression patterns of 84 genes related to TLR-mediated signal transduction were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction in both the na\u00efve and the HCV-infected Huh7.5.1 cells. Gene silencing by siRNA was carried out for functional analysis. Result: All TLR genes expressed at relatively low level in Huh7.5.1 cells regardless of HCV infection. Although only one TLR gene had an altered expression after HCV infection, statistically significant differences were detected in expression of some proinflammation cytokines between the HCVinfected hepatocytes and control. Functional analysis revealed that some proinflammation cytokines had opposing proviral and antiviral effects. Aim: To develop a cell culture system capable of producing high titer hepatitis C virus (HCV) stocks with recombinant vaccinia viruses as helpers. Methods: Two plasmids were used for the generation of recombinant HCV: one containing the full-length HCV cDNA cloned between T7 promoter and T7 terminator of pOCUS-T7 vector, and the other containing the HCV polyprotein open reading frame (ORF) directly linked to a vaccinia late promoter in PSC59. These two plasmids were co-transfected into BHK21 cells, which were then infected with vTF7-3 recombinant vaccinia helper viruses. Results: After 5 days of incubation, approximately 3.6 9 107 copies of HCV RNA were present per milliliter of cell culture supernatant, as detected by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR (FQ-PCR). The yield of recombinant HCV using this cell system increased 100-to 1,000-fold compared to in vitrotranscribed HCV genomic RNA or selective subgenomic HCV RNA molecule method.",

Background & Aims: The development of subgenomic and genomic replicons provided a major breakthrough to the understanding of HCV replication and viral-cell interactions. Huh-7.5.1 cells transfected with in vitro transcribed JFH-1 genomic RNA will successfully secrete virions. Therefore, transfection of JFH-1 RNA into the Huh-7.5.1-derived cells allows for the recovery of a viable JFH-1 virus that can then be serially passaged and used for infection-based experimentation. To determine the virus-host relationship, we also established this replication system and used this system for further study. Methods: Genotype 2a HCV full-length replication system was established using plasmid pJFH1 containing the full-length JFH1 cDNA. We used Tran-Singnal Protein/DNA Array to examine the effect of HCV replication on 345 transcription factors. We also performed luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay to confirm TranSingnal Protein/DNA Array results. We further examined NF kappa B associated factors such as I kappa Balpha and IL-8. Results: As results, 12 kinds of transcription factor were increased by HCV replication, such as c-Rel (NF kappa B p75 kDa protein), and ISRE (interferon stimulated response element). On the contrary, 11 kinds of transcription factor were decreased by HCV replication, such as Stat4 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 4), and GAS/ISRE (interferon activated factors). Activation of NF kappa B and ISRE has been confirmed using luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We have also confirmed c-Rel increased in the nuclear extracts from HCV replication cells. We have found phospho-I kappa B-alpha; was increased in the HCV replication cells, and IL-8 was also increased in the HCV replication cells culture. Conclusions: HCV replication affected NF kappa B system that triggers immunity system and inflammation response. Full-Length HCV replication system enables systemic analysis of intracellular response in human hepatocytes. Background & Aims: We and others have observed that levels of hepatic SOCS3 are significantly higher in chronic hepatitis C (CHC), particularly among persons who are nonresponders to subsequent IFN treatment. However, the relationship between SOCS3 and HCV replication remains unclear. We therefore sought to dissect the relationship between SOCS3 and HCV using HCV replication models. Methods: We used the genotype 1b full-length HCV replicon OR6 cell line, and the genotype 2a HCV full-length JFH1 infection system. We compared SOCS3 levels between cured and uncured OR6 cells, and between JFH1infected and uninfected Huh7.5.1 cells. In addition, we analyzed the effect on HCV replication by (1) transient overexpression of SOCS3 in OR6 and JFH1infected cells, and by (2) stably knocking down SOCS3 using shRNAs in Huh7.5.1 cells. We further analyzed the role of mTOR by treating cells with rapamycin. Results: OR6 cells and JFH1 infected Huh7.5.1 cells expressed significantly less SOCS3 than cured or uninfected cells, respectively. Inhibition of HCV replication with the HCV protease inhibitor BILN2061 restored SOCS3 protein levels. SOCS3 overexpression in OR6 cells and JFH1 infected Huh7.5.1 cells resulted in significantly lower HCV replication than in the control cells. JFH1infected, stable SOCS3 knockdown cells expressed more HCV than did control cells. The shSOCS3 also knocked down mTOR and phospho-mTOR. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reversed SOCS3's inhibitory effects on HCV RNA and core protein levels.",

Introduction: This is a seroprevalence study of HCV genotypes amongst infected haemodialysis patients in Pahang, Malaysia and the development of genotyping method using real-time PCR. Methods: Patients were screened using ELISA by detecting the anti-HCV in the sera. All negative first-round PCR products were re-tested by nested PCR. The base sequence of the PCR products was determined using the same primers as for the RT-PCR. By comparing the obtained nucleotide sequence data with sequences of known genotypes from the NCBI homepage, we deduced that our local isolates could be assigned to genotypes 1, 3, 4 and 6. Based on the data, TaqMan \u00d2 probes were designed for the simultaneous identification and quantitation of these genotypes. A new batch of blood samples were recollected from patients and real-time PCR (Applied Biosystem) assay was conducted for genotyping. Results: Out of 472 patients, 43 (26 males) were diagnosed positive for anti-HCV by ELISA. Two seropositive patients were excluded as they refused to give consent. HCV RNA was detected by RT-PCR technique targeting 5'UTR region. Excluding those who were seroconverted to HCV negative and patients with low titer, 66.6% (26/39) were of genotype 3, 23.1% (9/39) of genotype 1, 5.1% (2/39) of genotype 6, followed by 2.6% (1/39) of genotype 4 and one patient gave a discordant result with the sequencing analysis. Conclusion: Genotype 3 was the most prevalent genotype followed by genotype 1, 6 and 4. TaqMan real-time PCR has the potential as an alternative method for rapid HCV genotyping.",

Subject with S/CO value B10 were more likely to be a pass infection or non-specific reaction. However, the titer might be more heterogenous in patients with hemodialysis (HD) because of poor immune response. In this study, we aim to evaluate the validation of third generation anti-HCV EIA test in patients with HD. Methodology: We retrospectively reviewed 199 HD patients with anti-HCVpositive (S/CO[1) for at least 6 months. The serum HCV viral load, genotype, ALT levels were analyzed for anti-HCV titer correlation. Total 157 cases with obtained serum were enrolled for analysis. Results: The S/CO distribution was biphasic, with two S/CO peaks in the range 1-10 (24.6%) and[90 (41.7%). Among the 157 patients, detectable HCV RNA was found in 113 (56.8%). Of these with anti-HCV positive, the optimal cut-off for the prediction of HCV viremia, as derived from the ROC curve, was 36.5, with sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 25%. Of the 43 patients with S/CO values210, 22 (51.2%) was HCV RNA detectable. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of S/CO values210 were 31.9, 81.4, 81.8, 31.3 and 45.5%, respectively.

All patients had CD4+ cell count of \\200 cell/lL. Mean of CD4+ cell was 44.5 cell/lL. Mean age was 30.6 \u00b1 3.1 years old with median duration of HCV infection (defined from the time of the first time usage of IDU) was 9.8 \u00b1 2.3 years. Liver biopsy scored with METAVIR showed necroinflammation of mild (score 0 and 1), moderate and severe were 41.6, 47.9 and 10.4%, respectively while fibrosis appeared to be mild (score F0 and F1), F2, and F3 in 50, 47.9, and 2.1%, respectively. No patients had F4 fibrosis although few of them had already more than 10 years infected with HCV. Conclusion: Severe immune deficiency state in patient with HCV-HIV coinfection prevent the immune mediated liver damage.",

            "text": "The Introduction: Liver biopsy (LB) has an integral role in management of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) particularly in assessing stage of fibrosis (SoF) and grade of inflammation (GoF). We evaluated the effect of size and number of portal tracts (NoP) on the grading and staging of biopsy. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted at AKUH to compare size of liver biopsy core (LBC) and NoP with GoI and SoF on liver biopsy sample. The Batts and Ludwig scoring system was used to grade and stage CHC. Results: We examined 150 (98; male) consecutive patients with CHC undergoing LB. Mean length of LBC was 1.34 \u00b1 0.57 cm. Mean number of portal tracts (NoP) was 11 \u00b1 4.6. We found that mean length of LBC was 1.22 \u00b1 .37.cm in grade 1(n = 17 i-e 11.3%), 1.46 \u00b1 .5 in grade 2(n = 64 i-e 42.6%) and 1.5 \u00b1 .45 in grade 3 (n = 69 i-e 46%); (p = 0.102). Mean length of LBC was 1.28 \u00b1 0.39 cm, 1.47 \u00b1 0.56, 1.34 \u00b1 0.30 and 1.60 \u00b1 0.45 in SoF 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Mean length of LBC was greater (1.60 \u00b1 0.45) in stage 4 (n = 41 i-e 27.3%) and lesser (1.28 \u00b1 0.39) in stage 1(n = 23 i-e 15%); (p value = 0.04). The mean NoP were 8.53, 10.61 and 13.16 in GoI 1, 2 and 3 respectively (p \\ 0.0001). The mean NoP were 7.61, 11.12, 11.31 and 14.54 in SoF 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively (p \\ 0.000). Significant correlation was found between the length of LBC and NoP. There is a good correlation between number of portal tracts and length of biopsy core (r 2 0.56). Conclusion: We concluded that number of portal tracts is better predictor than size of liver biopsy core in accurately establishing both GoI and SoF in a liver biopsy. Background: In human Toll-like receptor 3(TLR3) and Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) involved in innate immunity has been identified to respond to dsRNA a molecular signature of viruses like hepatitis C virus (HCV). Aim: To study the expression of TLR3 and MAVS gene in na\u00efve and after antiviral therapy patients with chronic HCV infection (N = 30) who receive peg-IFNa-2a 180 mg/weekly and ribavirin 100 mg/daily. Method: Expression of TLR3 and MAVS was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative RT-PCR using housekeeping b-actin gene as the internal control and then validating the copy number of TLR3 by real time PCR. The patients were then further subdivided into two group based on sustained virological response (SVR) and Nonresponder (NR). Results: The expression of TLR3 is upregulated in patients who are NR compared to baseline whereas in SVR it is upregulated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of MAVS is upregulated in patients who achieve SVR compared to baseline whereas in NR it is upregulated by immunohistochemistry. The baseline expression level is similar in both the group by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The expression of TLR3 is upregulated in patients who are NR compared to baseline whereas in SVR it is upregulated. MAVS Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 181 expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR is upregulated after therapy whereas it could not be detected at baseline Expression analysis of TLR3 and MAVS by real time PCR also validates the finding of semi-quantitative rt-PCR. The copy number of TLR3 is highly significant between SVR (DDC T = 2.18) and NR (DDC T = 3.74). In SVR (DDC T = 6.23) the copy number of MAVS is slightly upregulated compared to NR (DDC T = 6.89). Conclusion: Expression levels of TLR3 and MAVS by immunohistochemistry may be helpful in better patient's management for antiviral therapy. This need to be confirmed in more number of patients based on HCV genotypes which determine antiviral therapy. No statistically significant differences in the baseline HCV RNA and ALT activity were observed between responders and non-responders. The factor of good treatment response appeared presumed infection period: 3.5 \u00b1 3.4 vs. 6.5 \u00b1 3.4 (p \\ 0.04) for R and NR, respectively. Adverse reactions were observed, with leucopenia predominant one, however without discontinuation of the treatment. Conclusions: Pegylated interferon with ribavirin appears to be an effective and safe therapeutic alternative in children with CHC. Shorter HCV infection period seems to be indicative of a higher treatment efficacy. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of treatment in children converted from recombinant interferon to pegylated interferon. Purpose: Double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) is newly developed in Japan that filter HCV and lipids from circulating blood. DFPP is reported to achieve ealy viral response (EVR) with interferon therapy. Twice daily administration of interferon-beta (IFN-b) is known as the most effective therapy to achieve EVR in Japan. We evaluated the boosting effect of HCV reduction by the combination of interferon-beta (IFN-b) and DFPP for the patients to achieve partial EVR but not viral response, who had been treated with pegylatedinterferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV). Methods: We evaluated 10 chronic hepatitis C patients with genotype1b and high viral load who had been received more than 20 weeks of combination therapy with PEG-IFNa2b and RBV, whose HCV-RNA had reduced more than 2Log but had not achieved viral response. We have compared the boosting effect between Group A (3MU of IFN-b, administered twice daily) and Group B (3MU IFN-b, administered twice daily with DFPP performed 5 sessions). Results: 7 patients were Group A. F/M were 5/2, average age was 61.7 years old. All 3 patients of Group B were male, average age was 59.7 years old. The period of IFN-b administration; Group A: 14-22 days, Group B: 9 days. The number of patients who achieved viral response after the end of IFN-b administration; Group A: 3 of 6, Group B: 3 out of 3. Conclusion: For patients who were refractory to conventional therapy with PEG-IFN and RBV, DFPP combined with IFN-b twice daily showed a rapid booster effect of HCV reduction and all patients had achieved viral eradication. Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a public health problem and a course of chronic liver disease. The goal of therapy is to prevent complications and death from in chronic hepatitis C. Treatment responses are defined by several virological parameter such as early virological response (EVR), end-of-treatment response (ETR) and sustained virological response (SVR). Virological relapse is the reappearance of HCV RNA in serum after treatment is discontinued and an ETR was documented. Virologic relapse occurs within the first 12 weeks and late relapse, beyond 24 weeks, is extremely uncommon. We studied to know the relapse rate after pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Conclusion: Relapse rate of chronic hepatitis C after combination therapy with pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin was 9.8%. All relapse occurred before SVR. We do not know the factor affecting relapse in this study. We need more long-term follow up after SVR and multi-center data to analyze the factor affecting the relapse.",

Primary investigation on immunogenicity of this gene. This work will contribute vastly to the application of specific immunotherapy on the basis of HCV CTL epitope for Chinese. Methods: According to knowledge of molecular immunology that CTL epitopes presented antigen by MHC-I molecules, HCV CTL epitopes were predicted by genomics and bioinformatics analysis tools. Candidate epitopes would be in series in accordance with the genetic algorithm. A synthetic multiple epitope antigen gene was cloned into vector pcDNA3.1 (+), then they were used to immunize mice. Specific cellular immunity of mice was detected by MTS, ELISA and CTL. Meanwhile, T lymphocyte epitopes and frequencies of epitope specific T cells were determined by ELISPOT using PBMCs from HCV patients stimulated by mixture of peptides. Results: 12 predicted HCV CTL epitopes were combined according to their superiority. Gene sequence of HCV multi-epitope antigen was obtained, which include different HCV genes areas and a number of CTL epitopes. The specific lymphocyte proliferation level, IFN-c and CTL activity of mice immunized (Part 2), or who were na\u00efve to treatment for HCV (Part 3). Doses of PEG-IFN-k were body weight-based and ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 lg/kg. Assessments include adverse events (AEs), laboratory values, and changes in HCV RNA. Results: 56 patients (mean age 51 years, 69% male, mean baseline HCV RNA 6.43 log 10 IU/mL) were randomized to treatment. Dose-dependent reductions in antiviral activity at 4 weeks were observed, with 83 and 86% achieving [2log decrease in HCV RNA at the PEG-IFN-k 1.5 lg/kg + RBV dose in IFN-a relapse and treatment-na\u00efve patients, respectively. Treatment was generally well-tolerated with minimal flu-like symptoms and no clinically meaningful changes observed in neutrophils, platelet counts or hemoglobin levels (apart from RBV associated reductions). 6/56 (11%) of patients experienced reversible increases in ALT/AST with or without increases in bilirubin (majority at the 3.0 lg/kg single agent dose, Part 1). Conclusions: PEG-IFN-k was associated with robust antiviral activity at all dose levels tested in both IFN-a relapse and treatment-na\u00efve patients. Treatment was generally safe with minimal flu-like symptoms or heamatologic effects observed. These favorable results support the initiation of Phase 2 studies in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Background: BMS-790052 is a first in class and highly selective HCV NS5A inhibitor with picomolar in vitro potency against genotypes 1a and 1b. In a single ascending dose study with healthy subjects, BMS-790052 was shown to be safe, well-tolerated, and had a pharmacokinetic profile suggestive of once-daily dosing. Methods: The objectives of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending-dose study were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antiviral effect and pharmacokinetics of BMS-790052 in genotype 1 HCV + patients. Treatment na\u00efve or experienced patients (18-49 years of age, HCV RNA C10 5 , with non-cirrhotic compensated liver disease) were randomized to receive 1, 10, or 100 mg of BMS-790052 or placebo (6 patients per dose; active: placebo = 5:1). Results: All BMS-790052 single doses were well tolerated and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. BMS-790052 exposure increased in a doserelated manner similar to that observed in healthy subjects. The mean terminal half-life of BMS-790052 was approximately 12 hours. Mean decline in HCV RNA 24 hours after a single 1, 10 and 100 mg dose of BMS790052 was 1.8 log 10 (range 0.18-3.0 log 10 ), 3.2 log 10 (range 2.9-4.0 log 10 ) and 3.3 log 10 (range 2.7-3.6 log 10 ), respectively. Furthermore, the 100 mg dose resulted in a mean decline of 3.6 log 10 (range 3.0-4.1 log 10 -observed at 48 h after dosing, which was maintained at 144 h. Conclusions: BMS-790052 is a potent NS5A inhibitor that produces a robust decline in HCV RNA following a single dose in patients chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. BMS-790052 was safe and well tolerated in single doses of up to 100 mg and has a pharmacokinetic profile that potentially supports once-daily dosing. Phase 2 trials of BMS-790052 in combination with peg-IFN/ RBV, as well as a study in combination with an NS3 inhibitor are ongoing. Objective: To study the virological features of patients coinfected with HBV and HCV and the efficacy of combination therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in these patients. Methods: The virological response rates of patients treated with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin between the HBV and HCV coinfection group and the HCV monoinfection group were compared. Results: HCV-dominant virus strains accounted for 92.0% of the 50 coinfected individuals. The HBV DNA level of coinfected patients was 4.6 \u00b1 0.9 log(10) copies/ml, which was significantly lower than that in HBV monoinfection group (5.9 \u00b1 1.2 log(10) copies/ml) (t = 5.964, P \\ 0.01). The HBeAg-positive rate (12.0%, 6/50) of coinfection group was significantly lower than (45.3%, 19/42) that of the HBV monoinfection group (chi (2) (2) = 0.090, P = 0.765). The incidence of side effects (30%, 15/50) of patients in the coinfection group was significantly higher than that (13%, 6/46) in the HCV monoinfection group (chi(2) = 4.031, P = 0.045). The reactivation rate of HBV DNA (33.3%, 9/27) with HCV SVR was significantly higher than that of patients without SVR (8.7%, 2/23) (chi(2) = 4.393, P = 0.036).",

            "text": "Conclusions: The replication of HBV was suppressed, and HCV was the dominant virus strain. Compared with HCV-monoinfected patients, pEVR, ETVR and relapse rates of patients with genotype 1 in the coinfection group were high, while they shared similar SVR rates. Background: Pharmacogenomic study of patient's single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and viral genotypes of hepatitis C virus can be used to understand the relationship between genetic inheritance and anti-HCV therapeutic response. The aim of the study was to establish a predictive model using artificial neural network (ANN) model based on genetic and clinical factors. Methods: We prospectively collected 150 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). 50 patients were excluded due to previous other causes of hepatitis. Nine patients dropped out of treatment due to Intolerance to drugs. 91 remaining patients (male 43, female 48; mean age 56.5 \u00b1 9.0 years/old) were enrolled into the study. We extracted DNAs from blood samples before initiating treatment. They had completed pegylated interferonaand ribavirin combination therapy for 24 weeks (genotypes 2 & 3) and for 48 weeks (genotype 1). Sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was obtained after six months' follow-up. After genotyping analysis, the probability of responsiveness to therapy based on the individual genotype could be obtained. Furthermore, an ANN approach was used to predict therapeutic response combining above host genetic factors and other clinical factors. Results: There were seven SNPs selected from six candidate genes. A genetic prediction model was built for initial testing. The above data associated with other clinical factors, such as sex, age, genotype, viral load, stage of liver fibrosis, body mass index, liver function tests (ASL, ALT) were analyzed using ANN algorithms. The data of ANN approach were validated based on fivefold crossvalidation methods with results of sensitivity = 98.7%, specificity = 41.7%, positive predictive value = 91.7%, negative predictive value = 83.3%, accuracy = 91.1%, and area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.702. Conclusions: This prospective study suggests that the ANN model is useful to predict therapeutic response accurately before starting anti-HCV treatment.",

            "text": "Hepatol Int (2010) Background: Accumulating data propose that active injecting drug users (IDU) might not differ from the general population in terms of sustained virological response (SVR) when adherent to therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, current guidelines contain restrictive recommendations for therapy in this group of patients. Therefore, we evaluated a cohort of CHC patients regarding the potent influence of active drug using on initial informed consent, compliance and SVR to treatment. Methods: One hundred and sixty-two consecutive patients (of which 62 active IDUs), who had been evaluated during the last 6 years in our center for CHC and proposed to receive treatment with pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, were enrolled. Initial informed consent, compliance, and SVR as well as data regarding age, gender, BMI, genotype, viral load, coinfection with HBV/ HDV/HIV, administered interferon alpha (2a or 2b), liver function tests, liver histology, urban residence, ethnicity, and concomitant use of alcohol were collected and analyzed in respect with injecting drug using. Result: Injecting drug using was positively correlated with male gender (P \\ 0.001), young age (P \\ 0.001), native origin (P = 0.043), and concomitant use of alcohol (P \\ 0.001). Comparable initial informed consent (P = 0.836), compliance (P = 0.879), and SVR (P = 0.132) were observed between IDUs and non-IDUs. The results were confirmed using a multiple regression model. Conclusion: Our data further support that active IDUs do not constitute a distinct CHC patient group in terms of initial informed consent, compliance, or SVR. Therefore, injecting drug using should not be a major determinant influencing the decision for treatment of CHC in eligible patients. Background: The pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is associated to severe oxidative stress and non-selective immunological disturbance that leads to necro-inflammation and fibrosis progression. Previous trials suggested that antioxidant and immunostimulant therapies may have a beneficial effect. Methods: Sixty patients with CHC and non-responder to standard antiviral treatment were randomly assigned to receive Viusid \u00d2 (3 sachets daily, n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 24 weeks. End points were improvement in oxidative stress and immunological parameters. Results: Interleukin-1 levels decreased from 3.26 to 2.61 pg/ml (P = 0.04) in patients who received viusid, as compared with a significant increase from 3.09 to 6.62 pg/ml (P = 0.04) in placebo group. Similarly, TNF-a levels significantly increased from 6.9 to 16.2 pg/ml (P \\ 0.01) in the patients who received placebo in comparison with almost unchanged levels (6.6-7.1 pg/ml, P = 0.26) in the patients treated with Viusid (P = 0.001). In addition, interleukin-10 levels were markedly increased in patients treated with Viusid (from 2.6 to 8.3 pg/ml, P = 0.04), in contrast with those patients assigned to placebo (from 2.8 to 4.1 pg/ml, P = 0.09) (P = 0.01). Similarly, the administration of viusid markedly increased the mean of IFN-c levels from 1.92 to 2.89 pg/ml (P \\ 0.001) in comparison with reduced mean levels from 1.80 to 1.68 pg/ml (P = 0.70) in the placebo group (P \\ 0.0001). Statistically significant reductions in serum HNE and MDA levels were observed in both groups of treatment in comparison with pretreatment values, however, those patients who received viusid showed marked reduction as compared with control group (P = 0.001). Viusid administration was well tolerated. Conclusions: Our results indicate that treatment with Viusid leads to a notable improvement in the oxidative stress and immunological parameters in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Introduction: Non-organ-specific autoantibodies (NOSAs) are commonly detected in HCV. The aim was to determine the prevalence of anti-nuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle (ASMA) and anti-liver kidney microsomes type 1 (anti-LKM1) antibodies in HCV and assess their impact on the response to antiviral therapy. Methods: One thousand and sixty-two HCV patients were reviewed retrospectively for autoantibodies and response to treatment. All patients received combined antiviral therapy in the form of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2 (a or b) plus Ribavirin (1,000-1,200 mg l day) for 48 weeks.",

Hepatic repair after injury requires fragmentation of scar, resolving vascular derangements and parenchymal regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) plays a potent role in hepatic repair after injury. Objectives: To investigate tissue expression of HGFA from patients with HCV-related chronic hepatitis and to correlate its expression with the grade of activity, stage of fibrosis and tissue transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-b1). Methods: Paraffin embedded sections prepared from 31 liver biopsies of patients with HCV infection (41 \u00b1 8 years) and 20 normal subjects, donors for liver transplantation (29 \u00b1 7.5 years) were evaluated for grading and staging of chronic hepatitis and applied for immunostaining with HGFA and TGF-b1 antibodies. Semiquantitative analysis of immunoreactive cells' intensity and percentage for HGFA and TGFb1 were interpreted to calculate the H-score. Results: Liver tissues from patients with HCV infection revealed HGFA around sites of injury and regeneration. HGFA H-score correlated significantly with the grade of activity, stage of fibrosis (p \\ 0.01 each) and demonstrated a highly statistical significant direct correlation between TGF-b1 H-score. There was a high statistically significant difference between normal control group and HCV-related chronic hepatitis regarding the HGFA H-score and TGF-b1 H-score. Conclusions: Parallel expression of HGFA and TGF-b1 with the grade of activity and stage of fibrosis in HCV-related chronic hepatitis could make HGFA as an activity and regenerative marker, achieving its role in hepatic repair after injury.",

There are two PEG-IFNs, PEG-IFNa-2a and PEG-IFNa-2b. Superiority of either PEG-IFN has not been established. To assess the efficacy and safety of the two PEG-IFNs in combination with RBV in Japanese patients, we have started a randomized, controlled trial. Methods: We have recruited patients from 14 hospitals in Japan. To be eligible for enrollment, patients must be HCV RNA positive for genotype 1b, and C5 logIU/ml (TaqMan PCR method). Patients who had previously received PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy were excluded. The target sample size was 320. We randomly assigned patients to receive either PEG-IFNa-2a or PEG-IFNa-2b, each in combination with RBV. Patients were treated for 48 weeks (or 72 weeks if HCV RNA was positive at week 12 and negative at week 24) and then followed for an additional 24 weeks for the assessment of sustained virologic response, the primary endpoint of the study. The safety, including effects on QOL using SF-36, was also compared. This study was started in February 2008 and is now in progress.",

Thrombocytopenia is one of the limiting factors for combination therapy. There are several measures can raise the platelet counts, such as thrombopoitein receptor agonist (Eltrombopag), splenic embolization and splenectomy. AIM: To assess the benefit of splenectomy with subsequent combination treatment for hepatitis C cirrhotics. Method: Splenectomy was suggested to those with hepatitis C compensated cirrhotics, platelet counts \\100 9 10 3 /ml and had strong intention for combination treatment. The treatment was pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 24-48 weeks. HCV genotyping and quantification of HCV-RNA were checked. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as non-detectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks after completion of treatment. The response were compared with other non-splenectomy cirrhotics who had combination therapy (186 of genotype 1 and 129 of genotype 2). Results: There were 16 patients (8 males, 8 females) with a median age of 55.2 years, received splenectomy and combination treatment subsequently. Their post-operative courses were uneventful. Eight were genotype 1b and 8 were genotype 2. The median counts of platelet and WBC were 49.1 x 10 3 /ml and 3.42 x 10 3 /ml before splenectomy, 26.3 x 10 3 /ml and 6.87 x 10 3 /ml after splenectomy. The SVR was 62.5% (5 of 8) and 87.5% (7/8) of genotype 1 and 2. The SVR rate of non-splenectomy cirrhotics was 35.5 and 75.9% in genotype 1 and 2. Conclusion: Splenectomy is safe in selected patients of hepatitis C compensated cirrhotics. Subsequent combination treatment can achieve a good SVR. Background: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C with interferon is known to be associated with thyroid dysfunction (TD) in 5-14%. We studied the incidence, types, outcome and risk factors predictive of TD. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on patients in centers in Emirates and Egypt who were treated with pegylated interferon a-2a or a-2b + ribavirin, and developed abnormal thyroid function tests. These were compared with treatment-matched controls to identify factors predictive of TD. All patients were followed up for 12 months after completion of antiviral therapy. Results: From a total of 233 patients, 21 cases with TD were identified (9%). Mean age was 42.76 \u00b1 9.71 years; 18 (86%) were females. Hypothyroidism developed in 18 cases (86%): 16 (89%) were females. Hyperthyroidism was observed in 3 (14%) patients; 2 (67%) were females. Mean time for development of hypothyroidism was 24.8 \u00b1 11.76 weeks. In hypothyroid cases, 15 (83%) patients were symptomatic and required L-thyroxin. Hormone replacement therapy was continued in 11 patients (73.3%) beyond follow up period. All hyperthyroid patients were symptomatic and required therapy; two (67%) subsequently developed hypothyroidism and required hormone replacement. Isolated elevation of serum antithyroglobulin antibodies and/or thyroid peroxidase antibodies was noticed in 12 (5%) patients and returned to normal in 10 (83%) patients during follow up. Female gender was found to be the only significant predisposing factor for TD. Family history of thyroid disease, autoimmune diseases or autoantibodies, ALT level, viral load, HCV-genotype, stage of fibrosis, type of interferon, duration of treatment, and treatment outcome were not significantly different between patients with euthyroidism and dysthyroidism.",

There have been more than 20 studies examining the effect of treatment of CHC patients with peginterferon and ribavirin since 2005 in Korea. However, there is no consensus which data is best for representing the treatment of CHC with peginterferon and ribavirin. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of peginterferon plus ribavirin for treatment of the Korean CHC patients under real life condition. Methods: We retrospectively analyze the data of 758 CHC patients which gathered from 14 large hospitals in Gyeonggi-Incheon area, Korea. Results: A total of 758 patients treated with peginterferon alfa plus ribavirin were documented between 2005 and 2008. The mean age of the enrolled patient was 50.2 years (\u00b112.0) and male was 60.8% (446/733). The genotype 1 group was 61.5% (449/733) and genotype 2 was 35.2% (257/733). The high baseline viral load (HVL) rate was 56% (378/672). The overall SVR was 59.6% (per protocol, 78%) regardless of genotype. The SVR was 53.6% in genotype 1 and 71.4% in genotype 2/3. In the multivariate analysis, male gender (P \\ 0.01), age \\40 (P \\ 0.01), EVR (P \\ 0.01), genotype 2/3 (P \\ 0.01), lower viral load (\\600,000 IU/mL, P \\ 0.01), drug dose (C80%, P \\ 0.01), but not diabetes, obesity (BMI C25) and elevated ALT were significantly associated with SVR. The rate of withdrawal was 35.7% (271/758) during the treatment. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the efficacy and tolerability of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy in Koreans is superior to those of whites in treatment of hepatitis C. It supports the previous studies showing the superiority of therapeutic efficacy in Asian.",

The sample size provided 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority (margin of 12%). Results: ACHIEVE-2/3 demonstrated the SVR noninferiority of albIFN 900 lg (P = 0.009) and 1,200 lg (P = 0.006) q2wk versus PEG-IFNa-2a 180 lg qwk. By intention-to-treat analysis, SVR rates were 84.8, 79.82, and 80.0% with PEG-IFNa-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1,200 lg, respectively.

In the Asian region (n = 271), SVR rates were 95. 5, 79.8, and albIFN 900 and 1, 200 lg, respectively, versus 80.5, 79.8, and 79 .3% in all other regions (n = 662). The incidence of serious (7-8%) or severe (13-16%) AEs, or death (0.3-0.6%) was similar across groups. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were 3.6, 4.8, and 5.5% with PEG-IFNa-2a, and albIFN 900 and 1,200 lg, respectively. Severe/serious pulmonary infections and interstitial lung disease were rare, with similar rates across groups. Conclusions: ACHIEVE-2/3 demonstrated that albIFN 900 lg q2wk was comparable in efficacy to PEG-IFNa-2a 180 lg qwk in patients with genotype 2/3 CHC, with a similar safety profile. Objectives: Interferon (IFN) monothreapy for 8-24 weeks lead to higher sustained virological response (SVR; defined as undetectable HCV RNA level in serum at 24 week after the end of IFN treatment) in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) serotype 2 and low viral load (serum HCV RNA level was less than 10 5 IU/ml by Amplicor HCV monitor assay). However, duration of treatment is still in dispute. This study evaluated the efficacy of short term treatment with IFN-beta (Feron, Daiichi-Sankyou, Japan) in patients with HCV serotype 2 and low viral load. Methods: A total of 18 patients with HCV serotype 2 and low viral load were treated with 600 million units IFN-beta by intravenously administration every day for 8 weeks. Result: Seventeen of 18 patients were negative for HCV RNA at 2 week of treatment. All patients were negative for HCV RNA at 4 week of treatment and at the end of treatment. The overall SVR rate was 83.3% (15/18). Serum ALT levels were declined by IFN-beta treatment. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that disappearance of HCV RNA at 2 week of treatment, mild fibrosis staging and no complications such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension were important factors for SVR by IFN-beta treatment (each P \\ 0.05). Treatment discontinuation for adverse events was not observed. Conclusion: This study shows that short term treatment with IFN-beta is effective and tolerable treatment in patients with HCV serotype 2 and low viral load. Patients and Methods: Study medication was administered for 72 weeks (48 wks. in association with PegIFN-ribavirin plus 24 wks in follow-up) in all patients, irrespective their lipid profile. Statin use 1 year prior study admission, significant concomitant medication, as well as any other metabolic, renal and myopathic disease were among exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned either to placebo (group P, n = 105) or to fluvastatin (F) group (n = 104). Viral load (VL) was assessed at inclusion, 12 and 72 weeks and the percentage decrease of VL (PDVL) between inclusion and the 12-weeks determination was calculated in each case. We also evaluated metabolic syndrome (MS) using the NCEP-ATP III criteria whilst BMI and ALT variation was monitored every 3 months. Results: EVR was 68.9% (144/209) and SVR 59.5% (118/209) while mean VL at inclusion was 3.81 \u00b1 0.22 9 10 6 IU/mL, decreasing at 0.27 \u00b1 0.02 9 10 6 IU/mL at 12 weeks in overall patients (p \\ 0.05). No statistically significant differences regarding ALT variation were noticed among the two groups. Background: Although cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses are thought to be important components of the immune system in the control of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the key contributions of CTL cell response in chronic HCV infection and the correlation between HCV specific CTLs and viral clearance in antiviral treated patients remain elusive. To evaluate this question, we examined the CTL responses in 54 patients with chronic HCV infection on baseline and monitored their rapid virological response (RVR) after undergoing 4-week interferon therapy. Methods: PBMCs were used in ex vivo IFN-c ELISpot assays with 171 overlapping peptides spanning the proteome of HCV-NS3, NS4 and NS5 to detect antigen-specific T cell responses. Plasmas were collected before and after undergoing 4-week interferon therapy to detect HCV viral loads and evaluate RVR in these patients. Result: In 54 patients, 18 (33.33%) of patients could mount a HCV-specific immune response with recognising at least one gene product at a magnitude above 50 SFU/10^6PBMC after background subtraction. Amongst the patients with HCV-specific immune response, the most frequently recognised peptides were in the NS3 region of the proteome (72.22%, 13/18), followed by NS5 (50%, 9/18) and NS4 (27.78%, 5/18) . NS3 was also the gene product eliciting the highest mean magnitude of ELISpot responses (380 SFU/10^6PBMCs), followed by NS4 (282 SFU/10^6PBMCs), and NS5 (273 SFU/10^6PBMCs). In addition, it was apparent the HCV viral load on baseline in patients with HCVspecific immune response were lower than that in patients without immune response, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.083). There was no correlation between the magnitude of response and RVR in patients with antiviral therapy. Conclusion: Antigen-specific T cell responses can be identified in chronic hepatitis C patients and HCV-NS3 seems contribute more than NS4 and NS5 in the control of disease progression. The effect of T cell responses to RVR is not clear and further study is necessary to clarify the correlation between the HCV specific CTLs and viral clearance.

Methods: Patients was randomized to receive interferon alpha 2b 3MU t.i.w, ribavirin 800-1,200 mg per day with either interferon gamma 2 MU t.i.w or amantadine 100 mg twice daily. Treatment was continued for 48 weeks in patients showing complete or partial (2 log reduction) early virological response (EVR) at 12 weeks and negative PCR at 24 weeks. Results: Total enrollments were 44. Mean age 44.1 years (28-60); 25 were previously non-responders out of them 12 were in the gamma arm. Nineteen were relapsers, out of them 10 received Gamma interferon. F3 or F4 fibrosis was seen in 14 (34%) and 9 (23%) were diabetic. By intention-to-treat analysis, the EVR for interferon gamma arm was 50% (11 out of 22) and for amantadine arm 36.36% (8 out of 22) (p = 0.272). The end of treatment responses were 45% (10/22) & 27% (6/22) for interferon gamma and amantadine arms respectively (p = 0.174). Overall sustained virological response (SVR) with triple regimens was seen in 34% (15/44), SVR was 45% (10/22) in the gamma arm and 23% (5/22) in the amantadine arm. In the subgroup analysis, this figure was 60% (6/10) and 44% (4/9) for relapsers, and 33% (4/12) and 8% (1/13) for non-responders in both arms respectively. Treatment was well tolerated in both arms. Conclusions: About one third of genotype 3 patients who had not previously responded well to the interferon and ribavirin responded to the triple regimens. However addition of interferon gamma was a better option with an acceptable safety profile. Its combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin needs further evaluation in a larger clinical trial. Background/Aims: Recently the liver-specific miR-122 was reported to stimulate HCV replication and translation in cell culture. It has still remained unclear whether IFN can change microRNA expression as a new anti-HCV mechanism. In addition, the mechanism how the addition of the broad-spectrum antiviral agent ribavirin greatly improved IFN responses to anti-HCV therapy clinically is unknown. Here, we report the relationship between IFN-b treatment in combination with ribavirin and microRNA expression in vitro. ",

Antiviral therapy was commenced on 133 ( Taiwan Background: To evaluate the prognostic value of Fibrotest for predicting liver fibrosis and the efficacy of peginterferon treatment on fibrosis formation in patients with CHB. Methods: This study was an open-label, multi-center, non-interventional, post-marketing observational study. All patients were followed-up for 72 weeks. Fibrotest is a non-invasive blood test that combines the quantitative results of five serum biochemical markers (alpha-2macroglobulin, apolioprotein A1, haptoglobulin, gamma-glutamyltransferase and total bilirubin) with the patient's age and gender in a patented artificial intelligence algorithm. Results: The mean age of the patients (55 male, 24 female, 18 missing data) were 35 \u00b1 12 (17-69) years and the mean mean duration of hepatitis B disease was 4.4 \u00b1 3.4(1-13) years. Most of the patients were under peginterferon alfa2a therapy (65 of 97 patients, 32 missing data) and peginterferon alfa2a dosage was 180 mcg. At 72nd week of the study (24 weeks after the end of therapy), the ratio of HbsAg and HbeAg positivity decreased to 34.0 and 8.2% from the baseline values of 77.1 and 34.0% respectively. Anti-Hbe positivity increased from 53.2% at baseline to 72.7% at 72nd week of the stud. Mean HBV DNA level was 254.6 x 10 6 \u00b1 999.5 x 10 6 (median 5.5 x 10 6 ) copies at baseline and 34.5 x 10 6 \u00b1 142.8 x 10 6 (median 2,800) copies at 72nd week and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.008). Among patients whose HBV DNA level at 72nd week were recorded, 48% of patients were negative for HBV DNA (\\10 4 copies/ml). Mean ALT level of 829 \u00b1 6,141 U/L at baseline decreased to 63 \u00b1 60 U/L at 72nd week (P = 0.001). The percentage of patients without fibrosis (F0), regarding Metavir scoring system, increased from 20.8% at baseline to 57.1% at 72nd week (P = 0.036). The median histological activity index (HAI) scores were 8 at baseline and 7 at 72nd week, respectively (P = 0.893). The percentage of patients without fibrosis (F0), according to Fibrotest scoring, increased from 21.8% at baseline to 25.7% at 72nd week. The median HAI scores were8at baseline and 7 at 72nd week, respectively (P = 0.893). Conclusions: Peginterferon treatment had a positive effect on serological and biochemical parameters and decreased fibrosis in patients with chronic HBV infection. Purpose: Sustained virologic response (SVR) in Hepatitis C is *50% globally in all genotypes. Alinia (nitazoxanide [NTZ] ) is an interferon inducer that may increase SVR in combination with PegIFN and RBV. Very rapid virologic response (VRVR) (undetectable HCV RNA 14 days after initiation of combination therapy) may predict higher SVR rates. We assessed NTZ with highdose RBV and PegIFN alfa-2a in achieving VRVR, RVR, early virologic response (EVR), end treatment response(ETR) and sustained viral response(SVR) in na\u00efve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 (GT1). Methods: A prospective, open-label, pilot study of na\u00efve chronic hepatitis C GT1 patients. All received NTZ 500 mg bid -first 2 weeks; RBV 800 mg(AM) + 600 mg(night) added to NTZ for next 2 weeks; subcutaneous PegIFN alfa-2a 180 mcg weekly added to RBV and NTZ at the same dose for next 12 weeks. Those with EVR continued PegIFN alfa-2a and RBV for the next 36 weeks at the same dose. VRVR, RVR, EVR, ETR, and SVR were assessed. Results: 23 Patients: Caucasian (n = 9, 39%), Hispanic (n = 4, 17%), African-American (n = 5, 21%) and Asian (n = 5, 21%). Mean BMI of 27.9; mean HCV RNA-600,000 IU/ml; fibrosis score-F2 (57%). Growth factors were used to minimize dose reductions. Adverse effects (AE): skin rash (39%); neutropenia (47.8%); thrombocytopenia (43.4%); anemia (52%); Alopecia Background/aim: Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) are at higher risk of developing abnormal glycometabolism, and this risk may increase among hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients not responding to an antiviral therapy. Our study was designed to investigate the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the association between insulin resistance and rapid virologic response (RVR) in CHC patients. Methods: One hundred and twenty-five CHC and 63 chronic hepatitis B(CHB) patients were evaluated. IR (Homeostasis Model for Assessment of Insulin Resistance) was assessed by using the following equation: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (lU/mL) x fasting glucose (mmo/L)/22.5 and was defined as HOMA-IR [ 3. RVR was defined as testing negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA after 4 weeks of antiviral therapy. HCV genotyping was performed (restriction fragment method) and serum HCV RNA quantified (PCR) for all patients before antiviral treatment. Hepatitis C virus-RNA was measured after 4 weeks of treatment. Fasting levels of insulin and glucose in the serum were measured in all patients on the first day of treatment. Results: IR was present in 17.8% of the 90 nondiabetic and noncirrhotic CHC patients type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosised in 12.6% of 130 CHC patients without liver cirrhosis. Forty-one CHC patients took peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin, and 26 of them reached RVR. In the multivariate analysis the independent predictors of RVR was: HOMA-IR more than 3.00 [P = 0.014, odds ratio 8.8 (95%CI:1.5-50.5)]. IR was less frequent in CHB than in matched CHC (3.2 vs. 15.9% respectively, P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: The incidence of abnormalities in glucose metabolism in CHC was significantly higher than that in CHB patients. Insulin resistance is an independent predictor of RVR, the homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance in the baseline serum should be evaluated to predict the rapid virologic response in CHC subjects. Background & Aim: Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a poor prognostic factor for antiviral therapy response in chronic hepatitis C patients. The aim was to study the diabetic factors which can influence treatment response in patients with chronic hepatitis C and DM. Methods: We studied 100 patients with DM who underwent antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C in Institute of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Iasi, between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2008. In our country almost all patients (more than 98%) are infected with type 1b virus C genotype. We analyzed the following parameters: type of DM, glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c)-determined at the beginning of antiviral therapy, lasting of DM, macro and microangiopathic complications. The ''cut off'' value of Hb A1c was considered 7%. A sustained response was defined as the absence of detectable hepatitis C virus RNA 6 months after treatment was stopped. Results: There were 58 female and 42 men, aged between 21 and 60 years (mean age 38.7 years). 40 patients had Type 1 DM and 60 Type 2 DM. The global rate of response was 42%. In Type 1 DM were 45% responders, and in Type 2-40%. Abnormal Hb A1c was found in 21.42% responders (R) and in 70.68% non-responders (NR). Macroangiopathic complications were found in 33.33% R and 44.82% NR. Microangiopathic complications were found in 28.57% R and 31.03% NR. There were 13 patients (30.95%) with more than 10 years of DM in R and 24 patients (41.37%) in NR. HbA1c was the only statistical significant factor (p \\ 0.05) between the R vs. NR.",

            "text": "Conclusion: HbA1c is an important predictive factor to antiviral therapy response in diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis C. There are more nonresponders patients with Type 2 DM comparative with Type 1, probably due to insulin-resistance. All patients with DM and chronic hepatitis C need a good glycemic control before starting antiviral therapy. Over the recent years, hepatitis C has emerged as a dreadful health challenge at national level in Pakistan and is spreading at alarming pace. Based on a year long open study on patients with hepatitis C, the results of real-time quantitative PCR assays indicate an herbal formulation to be highly effective in containing and cure of HCV infection. The formulation, HC-786, comprises of 11 traditional herbs soaked overnight and administered orally twice a day as boiled aqueous extract. Though the response ranged from mild to marked, almost all patients observing certain dietary precautions responded positively. Interestingly, the decline in HCV RNA counts was equally good in HCV patients already suffering from diabetes who normal respond poorly to the interferon therapy. No side-effect was reported unlike interferon based therapies. The effect of medication was more pronounced in HBV infected patients with comparatively low viral loads compared with HCV infected patients. The treatment ameliorate the general health indicators such as skin color, increased appetite, better digestion and weight gain etc in some non-HCV patients with acute cirrhosis, fibrosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma, indicating hepatoprotective nature of this medication. Currently studies on antioxidant activity, hepatoprotective nature, cytotoxicity and chemical composition of the extract are underway. Background: To investigate the effect of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) as the treatment chronic genotype 1b hepatitis C with high viral load, DFPP was performed followed by combined Peg-interferon and ribavirin therapy. Methods: In 7 patients with chronic hepatitis C, DFPP was performed 5 times on days 1, 2, 8, 9 and 15 . The drug administration of Peg-interferon and Result: The HCV RNA level was undetectable in 5 patients after 24 weeks, and this decrease was continued to a sustained virological response (SVR). Conclusion: DFPP that performed with interferon and ribavirin therapy together in chronic hepatitis C patients may contribute to a sustained virological response. A long-term observation is expected whether this treatment decreases the cancer incidence in patients with chronic hepatitis C With genotype 1b.",

            "text": "Material and Method: Patients with CHC treated by interferon and/or ribavirin between 1995 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 196 patients with a SVR defined as negative HCVRNA (by PCR-lower limit of sensitivity 50 iu/mL) at sixth month post-treatment. Patients with SVR were followed-up at every 6 months with liver transaminases and HCVRNA. Results: There were 89 male (45%) and 107 female (55%) patients with SVR. Pre-treatment mean age was 46.1 \u00b1 11.1 (17-73) years. Eight of the patients were cirrhotic. Mean fibrosis stage and histological activity index (HAI) were 1.55 \u00b1 0.94 and 7.22 \u00b1 2.41, respectively. There were 16 patients with chronic renal failure and 17 patients with diabetes mellitus. The number of patients treated by pegylated interferon + ribavirin, standard interferon + ribavirin and standard interferon monotherapy were 139, 21 and 36, respectively. In 138 patients HCV genotype results were available. The distribution of genotypes in these patients was as follows: 77.5% genotype 1b, 5.1% genotype 1a, 9.4% genotype 2, 7.2% genotype 3 and 0.7% genotype 4a. Median follow-up duration after SVR was 33.5 months (6-112). Only 2 patients (1.02%) developed a relapse at 18th and 48th months. HCVRNA titers of the patients with relapse were as low as 6,361 iu/mL and 438 iu/mL, and repeated HCVRNA tests in both patients resulted negative. Aminotransferase levels were normal during the follow-up in 96.4% of the total patients. None of the patients develop any complication related to liver disease during the follow-up. Conclusion: Almost all patients with SVR (98.98%) did not develop virological relapse during median 3 years of long term follow-up. According to our data, SVR is durable actually and patients with relapse demonstrates only a low grade and intermittent viremia. Background: BMS-650032 is a potent and selective HCV NS3 protease inhibitor with in vitro pico-molar potency against the NS3/4A protease. BMS-650032 was safe and well tolerated at single doses up to 1,200 mg and up to 600 mg Q12 h for 14 days in healthy subjects. Methods: Two randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluated single and multiple ascending doses of BMS-650032 in subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. In study 002 (SAD), BMS-650032 was administered to treatment-na\u00efve and experienced subjects at doses of 10, 50, 200 and 600 mg (6 subjects per dose; active placebo). Study 004 (MAD) included na\u00efve subjects only and evaluated 3 days of BMS-650032 at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg Q12 h (5 subjects per dose; active placebo). Results: There were no deaths or discontinuations due to AEs and all AEs were mild to moderate. SAD: BMS-650032 exposures increased in a dose-related manner and were similar or higher to that observed in healthy subjects. Tmax was *2 to 4 h, mean terminal half-life was *15 to 20 h, and mean oral clearance ranged from 302 to 491 L/h. Actively treated subjects experienced a mean decline in HCV RNA of *0. Background: PEG-IFN-lambda (PEG-IFN-k) is a unique interferon that has fewer flu-like symptoms and hematologic adverse effects than are typically observed with alpha IFNs, likely due to more focused expression of the IFN-k receptor. Here we report the 4-week antiviral activity, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from the Phase 1b open-label dose-ranging study in IFN-a relapse and treatment-na\u00efve genotype-1 HCV patients. Methods: Part 1 of the study evaluated escalating doses of single-agent PEG-IFN-k administered either Q2 W or QW for 4 weeks to HCV + IFN-a relapse patients. Parts 2 and 3 of the study evaluated different dose levels of PEG-IFNk administered weekly in combination with daily oral ribavirin (RBV) for 4 weeks to IFN-a relapse patients (Part 2), or who were na\u00efve to treatment for HCV (Part 3). Doses of PEG-IFN-k were body weight-based and ranged from 0.5 to 3.0 lg/kg. Assessments include adverse events (AEs), laboratory values, and changes in HCV RNA. Results: 56 patients (mean age 51 years, 69% male, mean baseline HCV RNA 6.43 log 10 IU/mL) were randomized to treatment. Dose-dependent reductions in antiviral activity at 4 weeks were observed, with 83 and 86% achieving [2-log decrease in HCV RNA at the Peg-IFN-k 1.5 mg/kg + RBV dose in IFN-a relapse and treatment-na\u00efve patients, respectively. Treatment was generally well-tolerated with minimal flu-like symptoms and no clinically meaningful changes observed in neutrophils, platelet counts or hemoglobin levels (apart from RBV associated reductions). 6/56 (11%) of patients experienced reversible increased in ALT/AST with or without increases in bilirubin (majority at the 3.0 mg/kg single agent dose, Part 1). Conclusions: PEG-IFN-k was associated with robust antiviral activity at all dose levels tested in both IFN-a relapse and treatment-na\u00efve patients. Treatment was generally safe with minimal flu-like symptoms or heamatologic effects observed. These favorable results support the initiation of Phase 2 studies in treatment-na\u00efve patients. Background & Aim: HAV is spread via the fecal-oral route, and is more prevalent in low socioeconomic areas in which a lack of adequate sanitation and poor hygienic practices facilitate spread of the infection. Korean epidemiology of HAV hepatitis is changing, due to the improvement of living conditions. As a result, fewer children are infected, leading to a larger population of adults who lack protective antibodies against HAV. We observe the epidemic changes of HAV and assess the need for HAV vaccination. Background: Hepatitis E is a worldwide and important public health problem, especially in areas with poor sanitation. The evidences of zoonotic transmission of HEV have been mostly reported in HEV non-endemic areas. However, the issue regarding existence of animal reservoirs in HEV-endemic regions remains unresolved. In this study, we try to learn the potential HEV animal reservoirs and the current status of HEV infection among animals and human in disease-endemic areas of Xinjiang China. Methods: 12 different animal species and 296 human sera were detected for anti-HEV with in-house enzyme immunoassay, and partial HEV RNA was amplified with reverse transcription-nest polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Results: All these distinct animal species except jerboa and hoptoad were positive for anti-HEV, and the prevalence of anti-HEV among human from Southern Xinjiang and Northern Xinjiang is 46.42 and 18.33%, respectively. HEV RNA was only amplified from pigs and a sporadic hepatitis E case in human of Han nationality, and swine HEV subtypes from Southern Xinjiang and Northern Xinjiang belonged to 4a and 4n, respectively. The human HEV strain (CHN-XJ-HE29) belonged to subtype 4a, sharing 100% nucleotide identity with swine HEV strain (CHN-XJ-SW50), both of which were collected from the same district. Conclusion: HEV genotypes among swine in Xinjiang belonged to genotype 4 and there were at least 3 prevailing HEV subtypes (4a, 4d and 4n). The potential animal reservoirs responsible for HEV outbreaks or epidemics have not been found. Evidences of swine to human transmission of sporadic hepatitis E in HEV-endemic regions were provided.",

Results: 15 cases after 6 months there are different degrees of symptoms; 9 cases of splenomegaly occurred, 5 patients with different degrees of hepatomegaly; 17cases in 6 months after different degrees of liver function abnormalities; after six months the anti-HEV IgM was still positive in 5 cases, the anti-HEV IgG was positive in 25 cases; after 6 months, the HEV RNA was positive in 5 cases; of liver biopsy for 12 cases; other viruses were detected in 4 cases;1 case suffering from hypertension; one case from coronary heart disease; one case from pulmonary emphysema, 1 case from asthma; 1 case of lung cancer; one case of renal transplant recipients. Discussion: male of chronic hepatitis E cases is more common, not a high degree of inflammatory activity, fibrosis was not evident. Follow-up observation of 6-10 years does not appear to cirrhosis, liver cancer cases. It is significantly different with the hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus. Most of 28 patients is the older, more than 18 cases of patients aged 50 years and over. With older patients the ability to remove the virus may decline, which may also contribute to more than six months duration or more important reasons. In addition, the observation also found a few cases, because of the merger of other viruses cause illness or chronic persistent unhealed. Besides, one of the reasons hepatitis E to chronic trend is associated with chronic disease or long-term using of immune agents. Background: Previous studies reported that high prevalence of antibodies to HEV have been detected in many rodents. However, only few studies reported the experimental infection of mice with HEV and the results were quite different. To confirm whether or not rats are susceptible to HEV infection, in this study SD rats were infected with swine HEV. Methods: 22 healthy SD rats, weight 180-200 g were involved in this study, including 2 rats as control. The viral suspension of subtype 4a and 4d of swine HEV were prepared from pigs with HEV infection. Nine rats were administrated with 600 ll 10% suspension of swine stool containing infectious HEV, the other rats were inoculated 1,200 ll of the same suspension, via caudal vein and gastric perfusion respectively. Two control rats were inoculated intravenously with 1,200 ll of PBS. The stool and sera specimens, which were collected pre-administration and post-administration respectively, were detected for HEV RNA by the method of RT-nPCR, and anti-HEV antibody by ELISA. The infected rat liver was examined by both light microscopy and electron microscopy for detection of pathological changes. Results: Three rats with caudal vein inoculation of subtype 4a and 1 rat with subtype 4d were observed slight elevation of serum ALT 2 weeks after administration. The liver tissues of the 4 rats were found mild inflammatory Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 207 changes. The transient positive of serum anti-HEV antibody was occurred to only one rat, which was inoculated with 1200ul stool suspension via caudal vein. HEV RNA was not detected in all stool and serum samples. Conclusions: Only 3 SD rats in this study showed slight inflammatory changes after infected with swine HEV 4a and 4b but no HEV RNA and anti-HEV antibody were detected. These results suggested that the SD rats in this study were not susceptible to the genotype 4a and 4d of swine HEV.",

Mean interval to IgM anti-HAV positive was 3.8 days, and titer of following positive IgM anti-HAV was not different from that of initially diagnosed patients. Conclusions: Our data suggest that not a few symptomatic AVH-A patients demonstrated IgM anti-HAV negative initially, probably due to earlier visit with more severe prodromal symptom than those of initial diagnosis group. Methods: Male C57BL6 N mice (n = 30) were randomly divided into three experimental groups and three control groups (5 mice for each group), and given MCD diet and the control methionine choline sufficient diet for 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, then were killed to obtain liver tissue specimens.

            "text": "Conclusions: MCD diet induced liver injury stimulated the proliferation of liver progenitor cells, which may be related to activation of Hedgehog pathway. Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive disease that reflects metabolic syndrome. The Chinese herbal medicine red yeast rice is a fermented product of rice with Monascus purpureus. It contains several constituents including monacolin K, which is a inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Its consumption has been found to decrease cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. However, the efficacy of constituents other than monacolin K has not been examined. We examined the efficacy of red yeast rice using a newly developed mouse model of NAFLD associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Two types of red yeast rice grown under different culture conditions were used. 1P-DU contained only 2 mg/100 g of monacolin K, whereas 3P-D1 contained 131 mg/100 g. Twenty-seven neonatal male MSG mice were divided into three groups. Group C (control) was fed standard food; Group red yeast rice-control (RYR-C) was fed standard food with 1% 1P-DU; and Group red yeast rice-monacolin K (RYR-M) was fed standard food with 1% 3P-D1. Mice were examined when they were 12-24 weeks old. Results: Groups fed red yeast rice showed significantly low serum insulin and leptin levels and pathological liver damage. They also exhibited lower body weight, as well as lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels compared with the control group. Group RYR-C showed significantly higher serum adiponectin level than Group RYR-M and the control group. Conclusion: Red yeast rice was found to be efficacious against obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and NAFLD in MSG mice irrespective of the dose of monacolin K. GABA and various peptides produced by fermentation were candidates for active constituents in this rice. We conclude that red yeast rice could be a useful supplementary food for metabolic patients including those with NAFLD. Background: Spirulina is a cyanobacterium characterized by high protein content (60-70%). It also contains carotenoids, vitamin E, phycocyanin, and chlorophyll. Many reports have recently suggested antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of Spirulina because of carotenoids and vitamin E, but the role of phycocyanin has not been well examined. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease in the West, is closely associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD and involves oxidative stress. We examined the efficacy of Spirulina and phycocyanin using a newly developed mouse model of NAFLD associated with obesity, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Twenty-five neonatal male MSG mice were pretreated with a subcutaneous injection of monosodium glutamate. They were divided into three groups (N = 7-9). Group C (control) was fed standard food; Group P was fed standard food with 0.35% phycocyanin; and Group S was fed standard food with 5% Spirulina. Mice were examined when they were 12-24 weeks old. Results: Groups P and S showed significantly lower visceral fat macrophage aggregation level than Group C. Group S showed significant increase in serum leptin, insulin, and ALT, as well as total cholesterol levels in addition to improvement in liver disease, and body weight compared with Group C. As expected, Group P showed intermediate improvements compared with Groups C and S. A twofold increase in the serum adiponectin level was found only in Group P compared with that in Groups C and S. Conclusion: Spirulina was found to be efficacious against obesity, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and NAFLD in MSG mice. Phycocyanin increased serum adiponectin levels. We conclude that Spirulina could be a useful supplementary food for metabolic patients including those with NAFLD. Methods: Six-to eight-week-old male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups and were treated with 0.2% diethylnitrosamine (DEN 10 mg/kg) interruptedly by intragastric administration and fed either normal diet or high fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks.

Methods: Thirty-six SD rats were randomized into basic diet-control group and high-fat diet group. Each of the two groups was subdivided into 3 subgroups (4, 8, 12 weeks) . Changes in animal weight, liver exponent and the level of TG and TC in serum and in liver were observed dynamically. Meanwhile, the expression of hepatocyte LXR-aand SREBP-1c was assayed by Reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction at 4, 8, 12 weeks. The level of steatosis was observed under light microscope after haematoxylon-eosin (HE) staening. Result: Compared with control group, body weight, liver exponent, TG and Tc in serum and in liver were increased dynamically in fat-rich diet. Rosiglitazone of low dose and high dose was given in different time to group L 1 , group high-fat diet group (P \\ 0.05); Compared with control group, the mRNA of LXR-a and SREBP-1c were obviously increased dynamically in model group (P \\ 0.05). Conclusion: The increase of LXR-a and SREBP-1c in liver may be concerned with energy disorder and the increase of LXR-a and SREBP-1c in liver may be concerned with energy disorder and closely associated with the activity of inflammation and the severity of the liver damage in NAFLD rats. Result: Feeding rats with HF diet established a model of NASH, with varying degrees of hepatic steatosis and hepatic inflammation. SP600125 treatment substantially decreased the incidence of insulin resistance, reduced lipotoxicity, inhibited oxidative stress and alleviated hepatocelluar injury. Conclusion: SP600125 has the potential to remarkably attenuate steatosis and inflammation and may be the novel therapeutic drug against NASH. Aims: Serum contains a complex of proteolytically derived peptides which may provide a diagnostic clue for diseases. The aim of the study was to compare the different serum peptidome patterns between twins with and without non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: Peptides between 800 Da and 3,500 Da were captured and concentrated using C18 reversed-phase column, and followed by a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric readout. The peptidomics patterns of 63 cases with NAFLD were compared with their twin healthy controls in Qingdao. The sequences of peptides associated with NAFLD were further identified by MALDI-TOF-TOF. Results: Compared with healthy controls, eleven peaks (861. 1, 877.07, 904.5, 1206.57, 1350.64, 1518.7, 1690.9, 1777.94, 2931.29, 3190.4, 3261.4) were identified to be up-regulated in NAFLD group, and 7 peaks ( Background: Obese hepatic steatosis is commonly associated with central fat accumulation and hyperleptinemia; however, the connection between nonobese hepatic steatosis and leptin is unclear.We sought to uncover the connection using an animal model. Methods: Double transgenic mice, in which hepatic over-expression of HCV core is regulated by tetracycline transactivator (tTA), were given permissive chow following 1 month of a doxycycline-rich diet since their births. Nonobese hepatic steatosis was exhibited in the 2-month-old double transgenic mice but diminished with time. The levels of leptin and adiponectin, and various metabolic features, were subsequently assessed in 2-, 3-, and 4-month-old double transgenic mice (i.e., HCV core-tTA) and single transgenic mice (i.e., tTA). The total fat mass and body fat distribution of the mice were evaluated by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging. Microarray analyses and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted using RNA from the visceral fat of paired double transgenic mice and single transgenic mice. Leptin was administered intraperitoneally to the 2-month-old double transgenic mice. Results: After adjusting for fat mass, the protein and RNA expression of leptin was lower in the 2-month-old double transgenic mice than in the single transgenic mice, and the DTM had hypoadiponectinemia; nevertheless, these differences diminished with time. Leptin treatment significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis in the 2-month-old double transgenic mice. Conclusions: HCV core-induced nonobese hepatic steatosis is associated with down-regulation of the leptin gene in visceral fat and subsequent hypoadipocytokinemia; however, these effects may be ameliorated by leptin treatment.",

TJs served as the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity and the rate-limiting barrier to passive movement of hydrophilic solutes across intestinal epithelia. It is known that intestinal epithelial TJ protein is decreased in hepatic cirrhosis, acute liver failure and so on. Yet, there is no research on the changes of intestinal epithelial TJ protein expression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: Thirty male SD rats were divided into two groups. The control group were fed with normal diets while the model group with high fat diets. All the animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks HE staining of hepatic tissue in model group showed that the NAFLD was established. Small intestinal epithelial tight junctions were observed by electron microscope in all groups, and the distribution and expression of tight junction protein occludin were detected by immunohistochemistry Aims: To investigate the effects of Rosiglitazone or combined with Reduced Glutathione on insulin resistance related indicators in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: NAFLD rats were produced. Rats were divided into four groups: rosiglitazone group, group of rosiglitazone combined with reduced glutathione, model group and normal group. Insulin levels in serum and pancreas were detected by immunohistochemisty and ELISA, and the biochemical indicators were detected at the same time. Then, all indicators above were compared. Results: The levels of albumin, ALT, total cholesterol in model group increased obviously compared with normal group (P \\ 0.01), but the concentrations of triglyceride and fasting blood glucose in model group decreased markedly (P \\ 0.01). Rosiglitazone could relatively reverse the levels of biochemical indicators compared with that of model group, but there were no significant differences. The levels of insulin in serum and pancreatic tissue in model group were obviously higher than normal group (P \\ 0.01). Rosiglitazone could reduce the insulin expression in serum and pancreatic tissue compared with model group. The trends of insulin resistance index in above four groups were similar. Conclusion: NAFLD rats occurs significant abnormality with liver function and obvious insulin resistance. Rosiglitazone or combined with Reduced Glutathione can reverse the levels of biochemical indicators, decrease the insulin resistance index, but there is no difference between the two treatment groups. Background/Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a progressive intractable disease that reflects metabolic syndrome. It is a growing health concern because of its rapidly increasing prevalence. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a critical type of NAFLD that progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However it's not easy to taking over the disease process of NASH. Furthermore, a mouse model of NASH is required for the same. Therefore, to examine the pathogenesis of NASH and initiate an effective treatment, we examined the detailed disease process in the TSOD mice, which has been established as an inbred strain with spontaneous development of diabetes mellitus, in the present study. Methods: The TSOD mice show spontaneous obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia only in males without special treatments. We followed up the histopathological characteristics of various organs from 56 male TSOD mice aged 4-17 months. Results: TSOD mice frequently suffered from NAFLD or NASH in these 4 months, as well as from crown-like macrophage aggregation and perivascular and pericapsular lymphoid aggregation in visceral fat. At 6 months, all TSOD mice suffered from NASH, showing zone-3 steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, Mallory bodies, and mild lobular inflammation. At this time, aggregated macrophages in visceral fat expressed various cytokines. The lipid peroxidation molecule 4-HNE was aberrantly expressed in some visceral adipocytes.",

This study aimed to explore if Fas mutation ameliorates or accelerates hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatic steatosis and inflammatory infiltration in nutritional steatohepatitis in mice. Methods: Mice homozygous for the lymphoproliferation spontaneous mutation (C57BL/6 J-Fas lpr ) and C57BL/6 J mice were fed a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet for three weeks to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The role of Fas gene mutation on NASH was assessed by comparing severity of hepatic steatosis and inflammation in the liver sections, the mRNA and protein expression of hepatic inflammatory and fibrogenetic related factors, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL-6), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transforming growth factor-b1 (TGFb1) and matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2). Results: At weeks 3, MCD-diet induced hepatic steatosis, inflammatory infiltratory in both of wide type and Fas lpr mice. Especially, severe hepatic injury was observed in Fas lpr mice compared with wild type mice, which was associated with suppressed anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin, up-regulated pro-inflammation cytokines TNF-a and IL-6, enhanced cell proliferation factor PCNA and fibrogenetic growth factors TGFb1 and MMP2. Conclusions: Fas lpr mice developed more severe hepatic injury including hepatic steatosis and inflammatory infiltration induced by MCD-diet compared with wild type mice, which were related to excessive release of cell proliferation, inflammatory and fibrogenetic factors.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the degree of bright liver, indicating an increase in the discrepancy in echo amplitude between the liver and kidney parenchyma on ultrasonography, was associated with elements of metabolic syndrome in a healthy Japanese population. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study based on abdominal ultrasound examinations of 198 men and 247 women recruited from participants in a health screening program. We measured the ratio of the average optical density of the liver to that of the right kidney (L-K index) on echographic images with commercial image analysis software. We also performed biochemical tests of liver and metabolic functioning. We then assessed the association between the L-K index and factors related to metabolic syndrome with a multivariate regression model. Results: The mean L-K index was 1.21 \u00b1 0.33 in men and 1.26 \u00b1 0.31 in women (P \\ 0.05). The mean index was 1.15 \u00b1 0.20 in the 138 subjects whose liver function was inferred to be normal because they had a normal body mass index (BMI), normal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, normal blood pressure, and no hepatitis C or B virus infection, and who did not report excess alcohol consumption. An increase in the number of risk factors was strongly associated with an increase in the L-K index (P \\ 0.01 for trend). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that the factors independently related to an increase in the L-K index were female gender, serum adiponectin and alanine aminotransferase levels, the homeostasis assessment model ratio, and BMI. Conclusions: These results suggest that obesity and insulin resistance are fundamentally associated with an increase in liver steatosis, as determined by a liver-kidney contrast on ultrasonography.",

Methods: The subjects were selected from an epidemiologic survey in Guangdong province of southern China. In each polymorphism study, 50-117 subjects who met the diagnostic criteria of NAFLD and had typical clinical and ultrasonographic findings were placed into the case group. Using a nested case-control design, the same numbers of matched people without NAFLD were included as controls. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at nine positions in seven candidate genes were tested. These SNPs were found to be associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Genetic analyses were performed using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. PCR-RFLP was applied to detect SNPs. Background/aims: Serum uric acid (SUA) is significantly elevated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. However, whether this elevation is a causer, a bystander, or a consequence of NAFLD remains under debate. This study aimed to investigate the association between SUA and development of NAFLD. Methods: A total of 6,974 initially NAFLD-free subjects were followed up for 2 years, to study the association between SUA level and risk of incident NAFLD. Animal experiments were also performed to study the potential benefit of hypouricemic therapy on NAFLD. Results: Overall, 625 (8.96%) subjects developed NAFLD over 2 years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of NAFLD increased with progressively higher baseline SUA levels. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses showed that elevated SUA levels were associated with increased risk of incident NAFLD; the age-and gender-adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) for the subjects in quintile 2, 3, 4 and 5 versus quintile 1 was 1.

Serum ferritin (SF) level has been suggested to be associated with NAFLD. SF is a sensitive indicator of body iron stores, iron is regarded as a putative element that interacts with oxygen radicals. The aim of our meta-analysis was to summarize the association between SF level and risk of NAFLD derived from previously published control studies and to examine the effect of study characteristics on this association. Methods: Searches through large literature databases, including PubMed, CNKI, among others, the quality of case studies was evaluated independently by two reviewers. RevMan4.2.8 and Stata10.0 software was used. And metaregression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of these characteristics on the association between SF level and NASH. Results: Thirteen quality control studies were identified. In the comparison between individuals of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and those of normal control, the pooled standardized mean difference of ferrion concentrations was 0. Background/Aims: To investigate the prevalence of fatty liver disease (FL) and its relevant factors in an adult physical examination population of Qingdao, China, and to provide a data for early intervention and improvement in prognosis of fatty liver disease in Qingdao. Method: The adult physical examination people in our hospital were invited to participate in the survey. Questionnaire and ultrasonographic survey was used. The body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), blood lipids (TC, TG, LDL-C and HDL-C), blood glucose (FBG) and liver function (ALT), hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus serum markers were detected. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS program 13.0. Results: The study included 5,760 subjects (3,677 men) with a mean age of 39 years. Fatty liver was found in 1,867 (32.41%) subjects. The incidence of fatty liver disease in man was 39.38% (1,448/3,677), and it was higher than that of women (16.37%, 341/2,083), P \\ 0.001. The prevalence rate in the 50-60 age group peaked at 43.95%. After gender stratification, the incidence of fatty liver disease in male who were in the 50-60 age group was 36.10% and female who were in the 60-70 age group was 42.29%. The prevalences of alcoholic, suspected alcoholic and nonalcoholic FL were determined to be 10.12, 0.59, 20.38%, respectively. Multiple regression analyses showed that only eight factors (triglycerides, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, age, vegetarian) were closely related to FL. Conclusion: FL in Qingdao is highly prevalent and mainly related to multiple metabolic disorders. The prevalence rate of fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease which related to age, sex, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high blood sugar and bad eating habits is high in Qingdao city. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and hypertension may be independent risk factors of fatty liver. To reduce weight and maintain normal blood glucose, lipid and blood pressure are important ways to preventing the fatty liver disease. Background and Purpose: The degree of hepatic fibrosis in cases of NASH is an important factor. Therefore, clarifying the risk factors or serological characteristics of the development of fibrosis in cases of NASH is therefore considered to provide clinically useful information. In this study, we focused on fibrosis in cases of NASH in order to clarify the risk factors through a clinical and pathological investigation. Methods: The subjects comprised 87 cases diagnosed to have NASH after performing a liver biopsy at our department or at a related institution between January 1997 and November 2008. We categorized the cases by pathology. We differentiated the cases into 4 groups comprising stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, and stage 4 of fibrosis and investigated the characteristics of those groups. Results: (1) The degree of hepatic fibrosis was stage 1 in 33 cases, stage 2 in 32 cases, stage 3 in 16 cases, and stage 4 in 6 cases.

All of the cases of NASH involved at least one of the following complications, and NASH should therefore be suspected in cases presenting with more than one of these complications. Background: It has been reported that patients with hypopituitarism are at risk of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features and liver histology of pediatric NAFLD associated with hypopituitarism. Methods: We reviewed the clinical data and liver histology of eleven children diagnosed as having hypopituitarism and NAFLD. Results: The mean age at the time of diagnosis of hypopituitarism was 10.4 \u00b1 3.2 years and the mean age at the time of diagnosis of NAFLD was 13.1 \u00b1 2.7 years. Craniopharyngioma was the most common cause of pituitary dysfunction. At the time of diagnosis of NAFLD, nine patients (82%) had a body mass index greater than the 85th percentile, four patients (36%) had elevated fasting blood glucose levels and seven (64%) had hypertriglyceridemia. The mean height SD score was significantly lower at the time of diagnosis of NAFLD than at the time of diagnosis of hypopituitarism. Of the six patients biopsied, one was cirrhotic, two had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with bridging fibrosis, two had NASH with mild portal fibrosis and one had simple steatosis. Conclusion: Children with hypopituitarism are at risk of short stature, obesity, hyperlipidemia and NAFLD. Early diagnosis of NAFLD is important in children with hypopituitarism because advanced fibrosis is common. Background and Aim: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is present in up to one-third of the general population and in the majority of patients with metabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes. We aimed to determine the prevalence of NAFLD among elderly population in Chang Chun city of China, and to characterize the clinical risk factors for NAFLD. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was performed with data obtained from 424 subjects who participated physical examination in our hospital, whose averge age was older than 60 years of age (399 men and 25 women). Each participant underwent an abdominal ultrasound, biochemical tests, an anthropometric evaluation and a standard questionnaire. NAFLD was diagnosed with the criteria from fatty liver and alcoholic liver disease study group of Chinese liver disease association. We evaluated the clinical and biochemical characteristics of NAFLD, and particularly its association with diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease and anthropometric parameters. Results: Of the 424 subjects, 94 were diagnosed NAFLD. Overall, the prevalences of NAFLD were 22.17%. In NAFLD group, prevalence of diseases related to the cardiometabolic risk factors were higher than control group (P \\ 0.05), obesity was 80.2%, coronary heart disease 52.0%, diabetes 30.85%, hypertension 56.38%, hyperlipidemia 70.21%, physical exercise ([2 h/day) 51.2%. In normal group, obesity 36.59%, coronary heart disease 36.6%, diabetes 45.6%, hypertension 52.53%, hyperlipidemia 46.7%, physical exercise 72.12%. There was no further comparison between gender because of female cases was little. Risk factors associated with NAFLD included obesity, hypertension, diabetes, BMI and hyperlipidemia, physical exercise, but there was no significant difference in age status. Conclusions: NAFLD is prevalent in the elderly and higher than other general population, and the prevalence of some diseases related to the cardio-metabolic factors also significant higher than the general population. The high prevalence rates noted in the study may herald increased risk factors of metabolic abnormal disease in this population. Objective: To determine the incidence and risk factors of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in apparently healthy Chinese employees. Methods: Subjects free of previous liver injury, alcohol consumption of more than 140 g/week, and hepatitis B infection were identified from employees of Shanghai BaoSteel Group who underwent voluntary medical checkups at a 2-year interval. Results: The analyzed population consisted of 5,402 non-drinking subjects (4,633 men) of age 36.5 \u00b1 9.3 years (range, 18-65 years), who had normal livers at baseline. Among them 327 subjects (6.05%) developed fatty liver 2 years later. Those who developed NAFLD showed advanced age (especially in females), elevated body mass index (BMI), higher levels of serum triglyceride and total cholesterol, higher prevalence rates of obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, hyperglyceridemia at baseline, and more weight gain and increase of serum triglycerides during the 2-year period. The incidence of NAFLD increased significantly with the changes of BMI at baseline, from 1.4% in subjects with normal weight, 6.4% in overweight, 16.8% in obese patients to 24.5% in severe obesity (v 2 = 389.01,P = 0.000 in trend analysis). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a significant interaction occurred between age, BMI and serum triglyceride at baseline, and subtle gain of BMI and triglyceride during follow-up. Conclusions: There is a high incidence of NAFLD in a Chinese workplace. Obesity and related metabolic disorders at baseline, and more weight gain and increased serum triglyceride during follow-up are risk factors of development of NAFLD.",

Oats Supplementation can ameliorates Alcohol-Induced Liver Damage in Rats by Preventing Gut Leakiness. Chronic oxidative stress and endotoxinemia are thought to be important in the genesis of alcohol-related liver damage. Similarities in the histologic features and natural histories of alcoholic liver disease and NAFLD suggest that common mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of these two disorders. Thus it is possible that oats Supplementation can decreases gut leakiness and therefore decreases endotoxinemia and oxidative stress to liver in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) also. Aims and Methods: The mean of aminotransferases before trial had no significant deference in two groups (65 and 67.4 for AST and 83.5 and 84.7 for ALT in Vitamin E and Vitamin E + oat groups respectively).

Background/Aim: Alcoholic hepatitis has been long recognized as a potentially life-threatening complication of alcohol use, whereas natural history of this disease is not clarified so far. The aim of this study was to investigate early mortality of placebo-treated alcoholic hepatitis patients. Methods: The databases PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials in alcoholic hepatitis. The mortality data of placebo-treated patients were extracted and analyzed. Results: Nineteen trials with a total of 661 placebo-treated patients were included. The overall mortality rate was 34.19% with median observation time of 160 days (range, 21-720 days). Hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and infection were the top three causes of death, which accounted for 55.47, 21.17 and 7.30% of overall deaths, respectively. One-month mortality data was reported in 10 trials with a total of 324 placebo-treated patients, and the pooled mortality rate was 20.37%. With regard to one-month mortality rate, moderate to severe patients tended to have higher rate than general patients (22.69 vs. 10.93%, P \\ 0.05), whereas no significant difference was observed between the patients from North America or Europe (22.43 vs. 18.45%), neither any difference was found between the studies published before or after 1990 (18.18 vs. 21.88%). Conclusions: Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious liver disease with high early mortality rate, which especially holds true among moderate to severe patients. Medications should be taken to prevent hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and infections, in order to prevent early death of alcoholic hepatitis patients.",

Conclusions: Thus, our experimental data provide evidence above the potential protective effect of leptin on ethanol elicited damage in the mouse HCC cell lines, warranting population based and mechanistic studies.",

            "text": "Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Hemidesmus.indicus (HI) and its active principle 2-hydroxy 4-methoxy benzoic acid (HMBA) on lipid profile and fatty acid compositions in the liver of ethanol fed rats. Methods: Male albino Wistar rats were given with 20% ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) for 8 weeks and/or naive rats fed with glucose only. Four weeks later, ethanol fed rats were either coadministered with 500 mg/kg HI extract (orally) or with 200 lg/kg HMBA for the next 4 weeks and/or HI extract/HMBA alone (naive groups). On the eighth weeks all the rats in different groups were sacrificed, and plasma and liver tissue were collected for analysis. Results: The level of hepatic marker enzymes such as Alanine transaminase (ALT) and peroxidation marker, hydroperoxide (LOOH) were significantly elevated (P \\ 0.05) in ethanol administered rats when compared to naive animal fed glucose only. Following treatment with both HI and HMBA significantly lowered (P \\ 0.05) ALT and LOOH as compared with lone ethanol fed rats. Moreover the observed lipid profile such as cholesterol, free fatty acids and triglycerides were significantly increased (P \\ 0.05) in ethanol treated animals when compared to control. Coadministration of HI and HMBA significantly reverts (P \\ 0.05) these values towards control rats. In addition, fatty acid composition which includes palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids were significantly increased (P \\ 0.05) whilst polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid was significantly decreased (P \\ 0.05) in ethanol treated animals when compared to control, while coadministration of HI and HMBA significantly reverts (P \\ 0.05) these values when compared to naive rats. Conclusion: These results suggest that treatment with HI and HMBA improved alcohol induced hepatic steatosis. Background/Aims: Quercetin, a common flavonoids rich in plant kingdom, has been showed to exert substantially protective effect against ethanolinduced liver damage. The protection is involved in its induction on hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and then the enhancement of adaptive protective response against excessive reactive oxygen species during ethanol metabolism mainly in liver. Ethanol also induces HO-1, however, the difference of signaling pathway to induce HO-1 by ethanol and quercetin are still remained fully unknown. Methods: Human hepatocytes were incubated with ethanol (100 mM) and/or quercetin (10-100 lM) for 24 h, following the incubation with various MAPK inhibitor(s). HO-1 expression and activity, together with oxidative cellular damage were assayed by spectrophotography and Western blot. Results: Compared with untreated human hepatocytes, ethanol exposure (100 mM, 24 h) resulted in a dramatic leakage of cellular AST and LDH, a sustained GSH depletion, and a parallel increase of cellular MDA. Ethanol itself induced HO-1 expression and activity, meanwhile, HO-1 inhibition by zinc protoporphyrin 9 further exacerbated ethanol-induced oxidative damage. Quercetin dose-dependently induced HO-1 expression and activity, and protected human hepatocytes from ethanol-induced damage, which was abrogated by zinc protoporphyrin 9. Querctin itself did not show any cytotoxicity, which was different from ethanol.

Methods: Chronic alcoholic liver injury and gut-leakage was induced with Lieber-Decarli diet for 8 weeks. Forty-four SD male rats were divided into control diet (C, n = 10), ethanol diet (E, n = 12), puerarin high-dosage (Ph, n = 11) and low-dosage (Pl, n = 11) group. At the beginning of the third week, rats in puerarin high and low-dosage groups were administrated with puerarin 179.4 mg or 89.7 mg/kg.body weight per day by gastric perfusion. Serum ALT, AST and hepatic GGT activity, pathologic changes in liver and intestine (HE staining and scanning transmission electron microscopy), hepatic TG, endotoxin in plasma and hepatic TNF-alpha were observed. Results: The serious steatotic hepatocytes (Fig. 1) , increased activity of serum ALT, AST and hepatic GGT, enhanced hepatic TG were observed in ethanol diet group (Table 1) . Further more, the microvillus on the surfaces of intestinal columnar epithelial cells were observed to be disconnected and thin, as well as the tight junction between the epithelial cells was broken (Fig. 2) . Similarly, increased endotoxin in plasma and TNF-alpha in liver tissue were also detected in ethanol diet group (Table 1) . However, puerarin administration ameliorated these pathological changes, significantly, especially, in high-dosage group ( Table 1 ; Fig. 2 ). Aims: To observe the effect of Pueraria Flavonid on chronic alcoholic liver injury in rats. Methods: Lieber-Decarli liquid diet induced-chronic alcoholic liver injury model (8 weeks) in rats was introduced. Forty-four SD male rats were divided into Lieber-Decarli control diet group (C, n = 10), Lieber-Decarli ethanol diet group (E, n = 12), pueraria flavonid high-dosage group (PFh, n = 11) and pueraria flavonid low-dosage group (PFl, n = 11). The Lieber-Decarli control and ethanol diet were drank freely and respectively by the rats in control group and the other three groups for 8 weeks. At the beginning of the third week, rats in pueraria flavonid high and low-dosage groups were administrated with pueraris flavonid 240 mg or 120 mg/ kg body weight per day by gastric perfusion. At the end of the eighth week, serum and liver tissue were collected for assy. The liver function, including serum ALT, AST, AKP and GGT activity in liver tissue, pathologic changes in liver tissue and hepatic lipid aggradation, TG in liver tissue, were observed. Results: The serious fatty degeneration in liver tissue, significant increased activity of serum ALT, AST, AKP and GGT in liver, enhanced TG concentration in liver were observed in Lieber-Decarli ethanol diet group. And the pueraris flavonid administration ameliorated these pathological changes, significantly, especially, in high-dosage group. Conclusions: Pueraris flavonid inhibit Lieber-Decarli liquid diet induced chronic liver injury in rats significantly.",

Background and Aim: Alcohol dependency is one of the world's major health and socio-economic problem and is the third biggest cause of early death and illness, behind tobacco and high blood pressure. Similarly, intake of excessive energy from an energy-condensed-diet with high percentage of fat is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance and certain cancers. Alcohol together with high fat-containing-diet affects the extent of hepatotoxicity. Natural products or their active components may serve the best approaches to minimize these disease conditions. Therefore, a natural phytoalexin, Resveratrol, was selected to reduce the toxic effects induced by combined consumption of alcohol and high-fat-diet (HFD).",

Subchronic HFD (30%) + Alcohol (10% v/v) intoxication was induced for 4 weeks. Resveratrol was administered (5, 10 15 and 20 mg/ml, orally) daily for 4 weeks. Condition of fatty liver was measured by cholesterol, triglyceride, biliruin, HDL and LDL content in liver and serum. Activities of transaminases, alcohol-dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde-dehydrogenase were studied. DNA damage, level of TNF-a, Interleukin-6, caspase-3, IGF-1 and CYP2E1 activity were measured in liver to understand molecular mechanism. Results: All biochemical variables were significantly altered by HFD + Alcohol intoxication. DNA damage was significant reduced and level of TNF-a, Interleukin-6, caspase-3, IGF-1 and CYP2E1 activity were found towards control with resveratrol treatment. Activities of transaminases, alcohol-dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde-dehydrogenase and bilirubin concentration were significantly maintained towards control with resveratrol at 15 and 20 mg/kg doses. Transmission and scanning electron microscopic evaluation confirmed a great extant of protection by resveratrol therapy. Conclusion: Resveratrol helps in mitigating hepatic abnormalities induced by combined consumption of alcohol and high fat diet, and as such, may be considered seriously for clinical use.

            "text": "Methods: This study included 201 cases with clinically proven ALD and 108 controls with alcohol abuse but clinically free of any liver disease, from Ethnic Bengali population of West Bengal, India. RFLP and DNA resequencing were done for genotyping several marker loci in the following candidate genes: genes influencing alcohol metabolism (ADH1C, ADH1B), detoxification (MnSOD, GSTM1, GSTT1), immune response (CD14, CTLA-4, IL-1b) and fibrosis (TGFb-1). Results: Polymorphic markers (rs1789920, rs1693425, rs698) of ADH1C gene were significantly associated with ALD. Again, markers like rs2066701 in gene ADH1B, rs4880 in exon2 of MnSOD, rs2569190, rs3087258 and C-159T in 5'promoter region of CD14, IL-1b and TGFb-1 respectively were also significantly associated with ALD. However, no association was found between rs231775 in exon1 of gene CTLA-4 and insertion/deletion polymorphism of GSTM1, GSTT1 with ALD. The table below provides pertinent details. Conclusion: In this study we have identified SNPs in six relevant genes that may confer increased susceptibility to ALD. Polymorphic markers of ADH genes on chromosome-4 show significant association with ALD even at haplotypic level. Susceptibility to development of ALD is increased when more than one marker is considered, as evident from gene-gene interaction effect. Background: Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is the most potent profibrogenic cytokine in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. Several functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites have been identified within the TGF-beta gene; however, their associations with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) were inconsistent in previously published studies. This metaanalysis was undertaken to summarize the effect size of TGF-beta SNPs associated with susceptibility of ALD hepatic disorders. Aim of the study was to evaluate the hepatoprotective activity of MD against alcohol induced liver toxicity in rats. Methods: Swiss albino mice (30 \u00b1 5 g) were divided into various groups of six animals each and received alcohol ad libitum in different concentration (10, 20, 30, 40% in I, II, III and IV week). MD was given at the dose 1,000 mg/kg, po, for 7 days after IV week. AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, urea, uric acid and creatinine in serum; ADH, LPO, GSH, triglyceride, cholesterol, SOD, CAT, GPx and GR in liver; genotoxicity (comet assay) and histological studies were performed. Results: Alcohol induced liver damage significantly increased AST, ALT, ALP, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL, urea, uric acid and creatinine in serum and decreased hepatic GSH whereas increased LPO. MD significantly protected these parameters. MD also reversed the altered hepatic GSH, SOD, CAT, GPx, GR and ADH and suppressed LPO. Comet assay and histopathological examination also showed marked improvement after MD treatment. Conclusion: Thus, the study proposed the hepatoprotective potential of Majoon-e-dabeed-ul-ward against alcohol-induced liver damages due to its excellent antioxidant activity. Background: Diabetes is one of the stress related disorder. Diabetes damages all the organs in body like liver, kidney, heart and brain. Present investigation was undertaken to evaluate antioxidant and antihyperglycemic properties of ginger in streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg iv single dose) induced diabetic rats. Methods: For this purpose Wistar strain male albino rats were divided in to five groups and treatment was gives as schedule in experimental protocol. The antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione s transferase (GST) activities and lipid paroxidation (MDA) levels were assayed in the liver tissue. Results: STZ produced a significant increases in blood glucose, hepatic antioxidant enzymes GST, MDA levels and decreases SOD, GSH in diabetic rats. Treatment with ginger ethanolic extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 30 days produced decrease in STZ induced blood glucose, GST, MDA levels and increased SOD, GSH as compared to control. Administration of ginger to diabetic rats significantly reduced the levels of lipid paroxidation and increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Conclusion: These results suggested that ginger possessed anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant activity and these activities may be interrelated. Furthermore, the histopathological studies also proved that ginger protected the liver tissue form diabetic oxidative stress. The results were compared with antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. Laparoscopic fenestration is a standard procedure for the treatment of nonparasitic liver cysts. After the fenestration of giant cysts, remarkable regeneration of the remnant liver is sometimes observed, while the mechanism accounting for the regeneration has been unclear so far. In the present study, pattern of liver regeneration after the laparoscopic fenestration of liver cysts was analyzed. Methods: Seven patients with giant non-parasitic liver cysts and four patients with polycystic liver disease (PCLD) underwent laparoscopic fenestration between June 2002 and February 2009. All patients possessed abdominal symptoms such as upper abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, and appetite loss. For the fenestration of liver cysts and the resection of the cyst wall, laparoscopic coagulating shears (LCS) and the LigaSure Atlas vessel sealing system were used. Liver regeneration in each lobe or segment was analyzed after the fenestration using CT or MRI images. Results: Liver regeneration after the fenestration was dependent on the size and position of the cysts, and not uniform throughout the remnant liver. Liver regeneration in segments which had been compressed by giant cysts was significantly greater than those in other regions after the fenestration, accompanied by the increased diameter of portal branches in the segments. This phenomenon implies that normalization of liver circulation, such as portal blood flow, in the compressed hepatic area may possibly regulate the liver regeneration after the fenestration. Fenestration of liver cysts in patients with PCLD also stimulated regeneration of the remnant liver. Discussion: Laparoscopic fenestration of liver cysts stimulates regeneration of the remnant liver while removing various abdominal symptoms with minimal surgical invasion. Normalized liver circulation, such as portal blood flow, possibly regulates the regeneration implying that surgical procedure considering subsequent liver regeneration would be important. In the present report we describe moderate hyperbilirubinemia in a man with combined disorders of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) and Gilbert's syndrome (GS). It was difficult to diagnose HS in absence of signs of anemia. Therefore, we needed to evaluate both the genetic mutation in the UGT1A1 gene and erythrocyte membrane protein abnormalities; the former was heterozygous for a UGT1A1 allele with three mutations [T-3279G (UGT1A1 * 60), A(TA) 7 TAA (UGT1A1 * 28), and G211A(UGT1A1 * 6)] and the latter was partial deficiency in ankyrin expression determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This is the first report of the concomitance of HS and 3 heterozygous mutations (T-3279G, A (TA) 7 TAA, and G211A) in the UGT1A1 gene. Background/Aims: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by tissue copper accumulation due to mutations in copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B) gene. We investigate a large cohort with 62 WD patients from Chinese HAN population to expand the repertoire of ATP7B mutations and find any potential new genotype-phenotype correlation in Chinese patients with WD. Methods: The entire ATP7b coding region and promoter region were analyzed by direct sequencing in 62 Chinese patients with WD from 2 to 61 years old, including 37 male and 25 female. Results: We identified 40 different mutations (14 novel) in Chinese patients. Two mutations, Arg778Leu and p.Pro992 Leu, were relatively frequent, representing 31.9 and 11.2% of patients, respectively. By Systematic document review, about 74% of mutations locate in exon8, exon13, exon12 and exon16 in Chinese patients. Patients with R778L homozygotes and nonsense mutation/frameshift mutations had more often a primary hepatic manifestation (85.7 and 100%, P = 0.0286 and P = 0.0381, respectively) and higher ALT levels at diagnosis (P = 0.0361 and P = 0.005, respectively) than other patients. Patients with nonsense mutation/ frameshift mutations showed lower serum ceruloplasmin (P = 0.0318). Conclusions: In this study, we identified 14 novel mutations and found that the spectrum of mutations of ATP7B in Chinese patients are quite distinct from Western ethnic populations. To some extent, the type of mutation plays a role in predicting the clinical manifestation. Our data provide us valuable information to understand the heterogeneity of Wilson's diseases and formulate an economical and effective strategy of molecular diagnose.",

DNA samples were amplified by PCR using primers corresponding to all 21 exons and they were subsequently sequenced. Results: Thirteen out of 17 patients had two disease-causing mutations; another three had only one mutation found, one patient had no mutation identified, and two siblings of WD patients were diagnosed with WD. Also, we have identified three new mutations and two new polymorphisms. Conclusions: Our results suggest that heterogeneity of the mutation exists in our small patient population in northeast China. At the same time, we have noticed there might be a correlation between the p.R778L mutation and liver impairment, and p.R778L homozygotes are associated with an early onset of hepatic symptoms. Another interesting finding is the fact that affected patients within the same family even twins who have the same mutation can have very different phenotypes. This suggests that there are other factors impacting the presentation of the autosomal recessive disorder. Also, the directly sequencing the exons of patients' family members which had found mutation was a strict method for family member screening. Backgrounds and Aims: According to many researches and studies, the increase of r-GT has not only been considered as risk factor of cancer, type-2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease but also as prognostic factor of all death. r-GT significantly increases through alcohol consumption but its relationship with obesity and smoking are not well-known. Hence, the authors have determined to identify the interactions between serum r-GT and alcohol, smoking and obesity. The average r-GT value significantly increased as the alcohol, current smoking, smoking history, and BMI increased (P \\ 0.01). In the case of women, smoking and r-GT value did not show significant correlation. We analyzed the odds ratio of abnormal r-GT according to three factors. The odds ratio between smoking and BMI was 11.4, that of smoking and alcohol was 20.9, that of alcohol and BMI was 23.8. Conclusions: The effects of smoking, alcohol and obesity to serum r-GT value were observed and the positive synergic effect of alcohol and obesity were shown as the greatest. Understanding and education about this synergic effect is in need.",

We investigated celiac autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: Sera from 84 patients with Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) type 1 and 88 patients with Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) were tested for Immunoglobulin A and G antibodies to Gliadin, Immunoglobulin A antibodies to tissue transglutaminase using enzyme immunoassay, and Immunoglobulin A antiendomysial antibodies by both indirect immunofluorescence, and enzyme immunoassay. The patients positive for anti-endomysial antibodies and/or anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies were considered for deuodenal biopsy. Results: Immunoglobulin A anti-endomysial and Immunoglobulin A anti-gliadin antibodies were positive in two of 84 patients with AIH. Moreover, Immunoglobulin A anti-gliadin antibodies were positive in another patient who was also positive for anti tissue transglutaminase antibodies. Tissue transglutaminase antibodies were positive in eight (9.1%) of 88 patients with CHB, two of which were also positive for anti-endomysial antibodies. One of the patients with CHB was only positive for anti-endomysial antibodies. Discussion: Compared with the normal population, the prevalence of celiac autoantibodies in CHB and AIH patients is relatively high, and it is noteworthy that most positive patients are asymptomatic for celiac disease. We suggest screening for celiac disease before and during treatment in patients with viral and autoimmune hepatitis. Background: Genetical B cell deprivation exacerbated liver inflammation in dnTGF-bRII mice, a mouse model of autoimmune cholangitis, raised a concept of regulatory B cells in liver inflammation. However, effect of therapeutic B cell depletion using anti-CD20 still remains to be clarified in PBC. Methods: To examine the effect of B cell depletion, we treated dnTGF-bRII mice from 4-6 and 20-22 weeks of age by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD20 antibody (Ab) every 2 weeks, and compared the resulting disease phenotype with control Ab-treatment. Results: The anti-CD20 treatment initiated from 4-6 weeks of age demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of liver inflammation and a fewer number of activated hepatic CD8 + T cells in dnTGF-bRII mice. Also, B cell depletion increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in sera, liver, and colon. Moreover, serum reactivity of anti-PDC-E2 was fully depleted after the anti-CD20 treatment. However, colon inflammation was significantly exacerbated. In aged mice, treated from 20 to 22 weeks of age, anti-CD20 was less effective either on liver or colon inflammation. Conclusion: Anti-CD20 treatment demonstrated therapeutic efficacy to regulate liver inflammation in young dnTGF-bRII mice, suggesting autodestructive B cell function in early human PBC. ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopanceratography showed chronic parenchymal liver disease without bile duct changes. Liver histology demonstrated granulomatous destructive cholangitis with piecemeal necrosis and moderate lobular activity. The clinical data of high titer of ANA, elevated ALT to ALP ratio, positivity of AMA and histology were compatible with PBC dominant overlap syndrome. UDCA of 15 mg/kg/day was given and the levels of liver enzymes improved markedly after 2 months. She withdrew UDCA treatment by herself for 4 months and liver enzymes raised again (Fig. 1) . Background: Emodin, 1, 3, 8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone, is an anthraquinone derivative from the roots of Rheum officinale Baill that plays an important role in hepatoprotective treatment. This study is to investigate the effect and mechanism of emodin on acute intrahepatic cholestasis induced by alpha-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) in rats. Methods: Normal control group, emodin group without ANIT treatment, model group and emodin group with ANIT treatment were set up. Liver function, pathological changes of hepatic tissue, the mRNA levels expression of the hepatic transport protein genes mdr1a (multidrug resistance protein 1a), mdr1b (multidrug resistance protein 1b) and mdr2 (multidrug resistance protein 2) and the expression of P-gp (P-glycoprotein) were detected. Results: Compared to the model group, Emodin treatment resulted in significant reductions in serum total bilirubin (TBiL), direct bilirubin (DBiL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bile acid (TBA) (P \\ 0.01 or P \\ 0.05). By examining the liver pathology, it was found that hepatic cellular change and necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and bile duct proliferation were notably alleviated in emodin model with ANIT treatment. Analysis of gene expression in livers from emodin-treated cholestatic rats revealed that mdr1a, mdr1b and mdr2 could be up-regulated (P \\ 0.01 or P \\ 0.05), expression of P-gp was increased in accordance with its mRNA (P \\ 0.05).",

Aim: T helper cells that produce IL-17 (Th17 cells) have recently been identified as the third distinct subset of effector T cells, which differentiation depends on specific transcription nuclear factor ROR-ct. We showed the Th17 cells in livers immunohistochemically and in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry. The levels of related cytokines such as Il-17, IL-6 and IL-23 were shown by RT-PCR and ELISA. Results: Our study showed that serum levels of IL-17 and IL-23 were upregulated in AIH patients than CHB patients and normal controls. In the peripheral blood, the ratio of Th17 cells in AIH patients was also significantly higher than that of CHB patients and normal controls (n = 20) (P \\ 0.05). The frequencies of IL-17 + cells in AIH patients (n = 36) were significantly higher than that of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients (n = 15) in liver tissues (P \\ 0.05). The mRNA expression of IL-17, IL-23, ROR-ct and IL-6 and IL-1b in the livers of AIH was significantly increased when compared to CHB and health. The frequency of IL-17 + cells is associated with hepatic inflammatory degree and fibrosis grade in AIH patients. IL-17 induced IL-6 expression of HepG2 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. In a-Galactosylceramide (a-Galcer)-induced liver injury mice, which could be consider as an AIH model, anti-IL-17 antibody pretreatment attenuated significantly the inflammatory cell infiltration in the livers and hepatocyte injury. Conclusion: IL-17 induced a positive-feedback loop of IL-6 expression in hepatocyts. Anti-IL-17 treatment is worth to be explored as a new therapeutic method for immune-related liver diseases. Background: The characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody positive. Some patients with AIH have anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), but AMA, especially AMA-M2-type positive is found more in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). This study will evaluate the existence and clinical significance of AMA in autoimmune liver disease. Methods: Patients were chosen from our hospital from April 2004 to September 2008 and were diagnosed autoimmune liver disease after liver biopsy or related examinations, 39 patients (including 7 cases of male and 32 cases female, with an average age of 54.5 \u00b1 10.8 years) were studied, AMA and other autoantibodies in their serum were detected. Results: Among 39 patients, 31 patients were diagnosed as AIH, and 8 patients were diagnosed as PBC; in the AIH patients, 28 patients with anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positive (90.3%, 28/31); 6 patients with AMA positive (19.4%, 6/31), which 6 cases of AMA positive patients, their AMA-M2-type were all negative; there are 9 cases of anti-parietal cell antibody positive (29.0%, 9/31); there are 2 cases of AMA-M2-type positive (6.5%, 2/31); in 8 patients which were diagnosed as PBC, 6 patients with ANA positive (75.0%, 6/8); 5 cases of AMA positive (62.5%, 5/8); 5 cases of AMA-M2-type positive (62.5%, 5/8); there are 2 cases of anti-parietal cell antibody positive (25.0%, 2/ 8). The positive rate of ANA was no significant difference between AIH and PBC (P [ 0.05), AMA positive rate was significant difference between AIH and PBC (P \\ 0.05), AMA-M2-type positive rates was also significant difference between AIH and PBC (P \\ 0.01). Conclusion: ANA have a higher positive rate in both AIH and PBC, AMA and AMA-M2-type have a high positive rate in PBC, but there also have a certain positive rate in AIH, whether the patients with AMA-M2-type positive AIH will develop to PBC or overlap syndrome need to be further observed. Background: In the Asia Pacific region, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is uncommon compared to chronic viral hepatitis. AIH in the paediatric population is even less common. We describe our experience with AIH in the paediatric population that we have encountered. Methods: All patients with AIH were identified from our prospective database and reviewed. Results: There were 21 patients with AIH, two of which were in the paediatric population giving a prevalence of 9.5%.The first patient (12-year old girl) was referred with a year history of intermittent jaundice which became persistent over the last month. She had hepatosplenomegaly and other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Investigations showed deranged liver functions test (LFT), coagulopathy, positive SMA (1:40) and ultrasound scan confirmed liver cirrhosis. HLA typing was positive for DRB1*04 (DR4) and DRB1*16 (DR2). She was started on prednisolone but unfortunately died from complications of the novel influenza A H1N1 infection. The second patient (15-year old girl) was referred with three months history of jaundice and lethargy. Investigations showed deranged LFT, coagulopathy, positive SMA (1:640) and a liver biopsy showed grade III and stage III (METAVIR score) AIH. HLA typing was positive for DRB1*03 (DR3) and DRB1*10. She responded well to steroid therapy. Both patients were negative for anti-LKM, viral and metabolic markers.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Our AIH in the paediatric population although uncommon presented at advanced stages despite a short history of symptoms. Similar to adult patients, paediatric patients also respond to steroid therapy. Background: Adipokines which relate to metabolic circumstance become clear to have pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties and participate in the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the serum levels of adipokins in the autoimmune liver diseases remain unknown. We measured the serum level of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory adipokines in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) to evaluate their role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver diseases. Methods: Forty AIH patients, 40 PBC patients and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory adipokines (Leptin, TNF-a, Visfatin, and Resistin) and anti-inflammatory adipokines (Adiponectin, Vaspin, and Chemerin) were measured by ELISA. The relation between the levels of adipokines and BMI, HOMA-IR index, biochemical variables (CRP, ALT, ALP, IgG, IgM) were evaluated. Results: Serum levels of Leptin, TNF-a, Visfatin, Resistin, Adiponectin and Vaspin were significantly higher in AIH and PBC compared with control (P \\ 0.01). Only Leptin had a positive correlation to BMI. In AIH, Visfatin had a positive correlation to ALT (P \\ 0.01) and IgG (P \\ 0.001). The level of Adiponectin of predonisolon treated group was significantly higher compared with UDCA treated group (P \\ 0.01). The level of Chemerin was significantly lower compared with PBC (P \\ 0.05) and control (P \\ 0.05). In PBC, Visfatin had a positive correlation to ALP (P \\ 0.05) and IgM (P \\ 0.05). Conclusion: Serum levels of adipokines except for Chemerin were significantly higher in autoimmune liver diseases compared to control. The level of proinflammatory adipokine Visfatin had a positive correlation to disease activities in autoimmune liver diseases. These results indicated that Visfatin might be involved in the course of autoimmune liver diseases. Results: Acute onset AIH showed heterogeneous hypoattenuating areas (P \\ 0.001) and acute viral hepatitis diffuse ones (P \\ 0.001). The diffuse hypoattenuating areas were present in none of group 1, 9 (60%) of group 2, and 5 (31%) of group 3 (P \\ 0.001 between groups 1 and 2, P = 0.009 between groups 1 and 3). The heterogeneous hypoattenuating areas were present in 15 (68%) of group 1, none of group 2 and 1 (6%) of group 3 (P \\ 0.001 between groups 1 and 2, P \\ 0.001 between groups 1 and 3). Conclusions: Heterogeneous hypoattenuation on unenhanced CT was a characteristic CT imaging feature of acute onset AIH compared with viral acute hepatitis. This finding could be one of the tools for diagnosing acute onset AIH in combination with the international AIH scoring system. Background and Aims: In chronic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), it is vital to improve and maintain the quality of life (QOL). The available self-report questionnaire for the assessment of QOL in patients with PBC, PBC-40 (Jacoby, 2005), consists of 40 items concerning several aspects of QOL and is currently validated only in the British population. The aims of the study were to validate the Italian and Japanese versions of PBC-40 and to assess the validity of the original six domains structure of PBC-40 by a confirmatory factor analysis. Methods: PBC-40 was translated to Italian and Japanese using the forwardbackward method and then reviewed in focus groups in the framework of a large multicentric study. A sample of 290 Italian and Japanese patients with PBC was administered two questionnaires, PBC-40 and SF-36, previously validated for assessment of general QOL both in Italian and Japanese. Results: The internal consistency of the original six domains turned out to be acceptable whereas the confirmatory model failed to fit adequately. A principal component analysis led to a seven factors structure, and suggested the exclusion of 13 items characterized by lower load; PBC-27 questionnaire was the final instrument. Pearson correlation between PBC-27 and SF-36 scores for both Italian and Japanese samples showed that the PBC-27 factors correlated significantly with the SF-36 domains. Conclusion: We here propose an alternative structure of the quality of life questionnaire for PBC, namely PBC-27, which appears to be valid and effective in detecting the impact of PBC on quality of life in Italian and Japanese patients. Background and Aims: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by a progressive destruction of the hepatic parenchyma, the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of AIH are still unclear.This study aims to characterize functional variations of immune status in AIH and its immunologic features. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from patients with AIH (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 21). Phenotypes of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (T cells, NK cells, NKT cells and regulatory T cells) were analysed using flow cytometry. Results: Both CD4 + CD25 + CD127 low/-Treg cells (mean 1.09%, range 0.94% to 1.96%) and CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells (mean 1.27%, range 1.02-2.08%) were significantly lower in AIH patients as compared to normal individuals(mean 3.65%, range 1.52-7.14%, P \\ 0.01),while the proportion of CD3 -CD56 + NK cells and CD3+CD8+ T cells were significantly higher than that of healthy controls (P \\ 0.01). The expression of 2B4 + (CD244) on CD3 -CD56 + NK cells were lower in AIH patients compared to that in healthy controls (P = 0.001).",

Liver disease is one of the most dangerous threats to humans, and the progress in innate immunology and liver immunology made it possible to re-explain the cellular and molecular immune mechanisms of liver disease. Methods and Results: In the past ten years, we have found that innate recognition of hepatic NK and NKT subsets were involved in murine liver injury. We established a novel NK cell-dependent acute murine hepatitis model by activating Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) with an injection of poly I:C, which may mimic mild viral hepatitis (such as Chronic Hepatitis B). We observed that a network of innate immune cells including NK, NKT and Kupffer cells is involved in liver immune injury in our established NK cell-dependent murine model. We noted that TLR-3 on Kupffer cells activated by pretreatment with poly I:C might protect against bacterial toxin (LPS)-induced fulminant hepatitis by down-regulating TLR-4 function, while TLR-3 pre-activation of NK cells might reduce Con A-induced NKT cell-mediated fulminant hepatitis by blocking NKT cell recruitment to the liver. We also found that the oversensitivity to injury by immune stimulation in HBV transgenic mice (full HBV gene-tg or HBs-tg) correlated to the over-expression of Rea1, an NKG2D ligand of NK cells or CD1d, a ligand of TCR-V14 of NKT cells, on HBV + hepatocytes, which leads to an innate immune response against hepatocytes and is critical in liver immune injury and regeneration.",

This deficiency has not been previously described in China, our aim was to identify mutations in the HSD3B7 gene in a patient who was cholestatic jaundice and normal serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bile acid (TBA). Methods: We studied a male infant with neonatal onset cholestatic liver disease and normal GGT and TBA who accepted bile acid replacement therapy resulted in clinical and biochemical improvement. Genomic DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes was extracted routinely. The entire six coding exons together with at least 100bp of adjacent intronic sequences of the HSD3B7 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced. Results: The patient was homozygous for a missense mutation (1031A [ G) in exon 6, which leads to amino acid transition from tyrosine to cysteine at amino acid position 344.

Now it is frequently used as adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients, and proved to effectively improve their survivals. But it causes hepatic steatosis in 43% of recipients. Further more, steatohepatitis, hepatic fibrosis and cirhrrosis can develop. However, the mechanism for tamoxifen-induced steatosis is essentially unknown. Insulin resistance (IR) was considered to be the most important mechanism of nonalcoholic fatty liver, but whether TAM can induce IR was unknown. This research was to observe the effects of tamoxifen on insulin sensitivity in L02 hepatic cells, and explore the role of oxidative stress in it. Methods: Cultured L02 cell was divided into four groups according to the different dose of TAM (balnk, 1, 3 and 5 lM) in the media, and each group was incubated for 24 h in presence or absence of NAC.Then insulin was added in culture media. Residue glucose concentration was measured by the method of glucose oxidizes peroxides (GOD-POD), and the level of SOD and GSH was determined. Results: 1.Glucose absorption in L02 cell was reduced by TAM (P \\ 0.05), and the effect was dose-dependent.2.The levels of GSH (P \\ 0.01) and SOD (P \\ 0.05) were significantly decreased by TAM compared to control group 3. Introduction: Six Chinese patients with the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis due to taking the medicine for hemorrhoids, ranged in age from 30 to 58, were hospitalized in Shenzhen Shekou people's Hospital in 2008. These cases were investigated further in order to diagnose and treat these special cases more effectively. Taking medicine history, clinical presentation, clinical laboratory findings, treatments and effects were summarized, and followed-up for 3-6 months. Case description: The medicine for hemorrhoids is a Chinese patent medicine containing plenty of Snphora angustifolia. It has been reported that some Hepatitis B patients had suffered from more serious liver function damage after taking Snphora angustifolia. Four of these 6 patients were admitted with jaundice 2 months following taking medicine. One patient was admitted with jaundice 1 month earlier. The other one took the medicine 3 weeks after haemorrhoidectomy then appeared hypodynamia, nausea symptoms. Laboratory and ultrasound examinations showed that they were cholestatic hepatitis. Treatment of protecting liver function and promoting bile excreting (such as UDCA) was helpful to the recovery of liver function. Two patients who appeared persistent jaundice and progressive increase in bilirubin were administered with glucocorticoid. The liver function of all these patients' returned to normal after various durations of therapy. Glucocorticoid administration was proved to be effective in the recovery of the drug-induced cholestatic hepatitis. The liver function and bilirubin returned to normal completely after 6-month therapy for three patients, 4-month therapy for two patients and more than 2-month therapy for one patient, without recurrence till now. Non-surgical therapy including oral administration and external application were commonly used in treating hemorrhoids. The compositions of some medicines are complex with involvement of hepatic function in drug metabolism. These cases remind the wariness of taking Chinese patent medicine for treating hemorrhoids or medicine containing large amount of snphora angustifolia Backgrounds: Lots of chemical drugs, herbal medicines and heath care products have potential toxicity on human health. Liver is the biggest organ for the biochemical metabolism, thus also the main target for the attack of druginduced injury. The categories, mechanisms, diagnosis and research methods of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is still confused to a great extent, and should be paid more attention to. Methods: Review the related articles systemically. Result: Various mechanisms contribute to DILI. Though DILI is very common, clinicians and general public have not paid enough attention to its importance. In European and American countries, approximately 30-40% of patients with acute liver failure were caused by DILI, and 36% of DILI cases were caused by non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in the US, especially acetaminophen. DILI could be divided into predictable and unpredictable types, and the former is usually caused by the direct toxicity of drugs. The unpredictable type of DILI is mediated by hypersensitive or allergic idiosyncrasy; though this is rarely seen in the clinical trials, it can lead to the abolishment of new drugs from the market. The mechanisms of DILI could be summarized as injuries from: (1) direct toxicity of the drugs;",

Conclusion: There exist great puzzles in the diagnosis of DILI until now, though the diagnostic methods and criteria of DILI have got some modification, evolution and development. In China, special attention should be paid to the liver injury caused by herbal medicines. Many related questions and challenges have to be faced with, and the current urgent task is to systematically establish and improve the database of toxic and drug-induced liver diseases in China. Introduction: Hepatic drug metabolism, often with an imbalance between the generation of toxic metabolites and detoxification processes, can influence the degree of hepatotoxicity. This drug toxin causes sudden onset of portal hypertension, with very prominent hepatomegaly and ascites in a previously healthy infant or child. The majority of toxicities depend upon the bioactivation of the drug in the liver catalyzed by the cytochromes P450 (CYP). Methods: Many drugs cause mild elevations in blood levels of liver enzymes in children without symptoms or signs of hepatitis. Liver histology is the ideal tool to date for defining the pattern of hepatotoxicity. There are very few reports of hepatic injury in children caused by environmental toxins in Bosnia and Herzegovina.",

Drug-induced liver injury can mimic any pattern of primary liver disease. Girls are more susceptible than boys are to most forms of druginduced liver disease. Discussion: Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting worse prognosis. Conclusions: The diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a challenging problem in children. Acute drug-induced hepatitis is defined as hepatitis that lasts less than 3 months, while chronic hepatitis lasts longer than 3 months. There is no specific treatment for most cases of drug-induced hepatitis other than stopping the drug that is causing the problem.",

Aqueous extract of Butea monosperma flowers was evaluated for its hepatoprotective efficacy against acetaminophen induced hepatotocellular damage in rats. Method: Hepatotocellular damage was induced by acetaminophen for acute (2 g/kg, po, once only) and subchronic (20 mg/kg, po, for 21 days) exposure. Butea monosperma flowers extract at different doses (200, 400 and 800 mg/ kg, po, once only) was given in acute study and selected dose was administered in subchronic study (800 mg/kg, po, for 5 days). AST, ALT, albumin and bilirubin in serum; hepatic antioxidant status (GSH, SOD, CAT, GPx and GR), CYP450 activity and genotoxicity were estimated. Histopathology and ultrastructural changes were studied along with various biological activities (free radical scavenging activity, total phenolic contents and antipyretic activity). Result: Acute and subchronic exposure to acetaminophen showed toxic effects on various blood and tissue biochemical variables. Acetaminophen significantly increased AST, ALT, albumin and bilirubin in serum. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was increased significantly, whereas reduced glutathione was decreased after acetaminophen exposure. Butea monosperma extract significantly improved hepatic antioxidant status (GSH, SOD, CAT, GPx and GR) and inhibited lipid peroxidation in liver at higher dose (800 mg/kg). CYP450 activity was increased and also protected DNA damage induced by acetaminophen with reversed histopathological alterations. Conclusion: Thus, it may be concluded that the extract of Butea monosperma flowers can be used to reduce hepatic damage and may serve as complimentary or alternative herbal drug against acetaminophen induced liver damage.",

We find some patients diagnosed as DILI with the abnormal autoimmune antibody raising. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is often tested as positive and we try to investigate the difference between ANA positive and negative in DILI. Methods: 152 patients clinical diagnosed as DILI and divided to two groups by ANA positive and negative are analyzed retrospectively and compared by age sexual gender level of biochemical indicators. Result: There are 23 cases with ANA tested positive and the percentage is 15.13%. Age sexual gender DILI types are not different in two groups (T test). The level of alanine transaminase is higher and the level of total bilirubin is lower in ANA positive group. The level of alkaline phosphatase seems same between two groups (Mann-Whitney test). Conclusions: We can find ANA positive cases appear usually in drug induced liver injury. Age and gender are not different between two groups. In the early clinical stage of DILI without medical treatment, we can find different change in biochemical indicators. We may suppose that DILI with ANA positive may reflect more serious hepatic cell injury. Background: Hepatic fibrosis is a major complication of various chronic liver diseases. Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) play a critical role in the development of liver fibrosis, and the axis of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), a member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is closely associated with the activation of HSC. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor (IGF-1R), which also belongs to RTKs, interacts with the PDGF/PDGFR axis, thereby cooperatively promoting hepatic fibrosis. EGCG, the major constituent of green tea, assumes RTK such as EGFR or IGF-1R a target and restrains the increase of tumor cells. Aims: We herein examined the effects of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which inhibits the activation of several types of RTKs, on the development rat liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCL 4 ). Methods: Jcl Male Wistar rats were given subcutaneous injections of CCL4 (0.5 mg/kg/BW) twice a week for 8 weeks. And during the same period, they received water containing 0.1% EGCG. We did a sacrifice at 14 weeks old. Results: At sacrifice, drinking water with 0.1% EGCG significantly decreased the serum levels of both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase raised by CCl 4 , thus indicating an improvement of liver injury. In CCl 4 -injected rats, EGCG markedly attenuated hepatic fibrosis and decreased the amount of hydroxyproline in the experimental liver. The expression of PDGFR-beta and IGF-1R mRNAs in the liver was significantly reduced by the treatment with EGCG. EGCG also decreased the expression of PDGFR-beta and alfa-smooth muscle actin proteins, thus indicating the inhibition of HSC activation. These findings suggest that EGCG can exert, at least in part, an antifibrotic effect on the liver by targeting PDGFR-beta and IGF-1R. Conclusion: EGCG might therefore be useful in the prevention of hepatic fibrosis. Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which is regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways, is the key event in liver fibrosis. Moreover, members of these pathways are important targets for microRNAs (miRNAs).",

Methods: Rat HSC-T6 and BRL-3A were cultivated as normal or in medium containing different concentrations of HCPT (0.008, 0.016, 0.031, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 , and 32 mg/L) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cellular proliferation was detected by MTT assay; morphology was observed by microscopy; apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry; apoptotic cell morphology was observed under transmission electron microscopy, and DNA fragmentation was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: The inhibition rate of HCPT on HSC-T6 and BRL-3A proliferation gradually increased with increasing drug concentration and prolonged medication time. When HCPT concentration was [0.5 mg/L, its toxic effects on BRL-3A cells were significantly increased. Following 24-h treatment with 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/L HCPT, the cellular apoptosis rate was 13.46 \u00b1 2.42, 26.25 \u00b1 5.65 and 47.05 \u00b1 8.76%, respectively. A significant difference existed between the test and control group of 4.89 \u00b1 1.80% (F = 34.24, P \\ 0.01). Following 24-h treatment with 0.5 mg/L HCPT, apoptotic cells were observed by transmission electron microscopy. They displayed a decreased cell body, absent nucleoli and chromatin aggregation along the nuclear membrane. DNA analysis on agarose gels showed gradient bands. Conclusion: 0.5 mg/L HCPT can produce maximal inhibitory effects on HSC-T6 proliferation. HCPT can markedly inhibit HSC-T6 proliferation and induce apoptosis in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Objective: To establish bone mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) culture and amplification system and investigate the effects of MSCs transplantation on liver of rats. The role of TGF-b1 in mechanisms of bone MSCs transplantation and hepatoma was also studied. Methods: Combined with stationary culture MSCs of male SD rat were isolated and purified. The MSCs ( Background and Aims: Sustained inflammation-induced hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation and transformation into fibrogenic and proliferative myofibroblast-like cells is the major cause of hepatic fibrosis. Our recent studies demonstrated that endogenous connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a downstream mediator of basal or TGF-b1-induced collagen I production in human HSC and regulates entry of the cells into S phage. Here, we assessed the role of CCN2 in fibrogenesis in HBV-induced chronic liver diseases (CLD). Methods: ELISA was used to measure CCN2 in sera from patients with CLD (89 with chronic hepatitis B and 66 with hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis) and 30 healthy individuals. Liver samples from patients (26 with chronic hepatitis B, 5 with hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis) and 6 healthy individuals were examined for CCN2 and TGF-b1 mRNA levels by in situ hybridization, CCN2 protein expression by immunohistochemisty, and collagen fibers by Van Gieson's method. Results: TGF-b1 mRNA was mainly detected in macrophages and activated HSCs within inflammatory and fibronous areas in the liver. However, CCN2 mRNA expression in activated HSC and fibroblasts was seen in both the fibronous septa and sinusoidal lining. The levels of CCN2 in liver samples and sera from patients with HBV-induced CLD were significantly higher than those in healthy controls, and the levels of CCN2 were positively correlated with liver collagen expression and the degree of fibrosis (both P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: Our data indicate that CCN2 plays an important role in HBVinduced hepatic fibrosis, and may serve as a serological biomarker for ongoing fibrogenesis. Background and Aim: Hepatocytes (PC) are a major cellular source of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF), a downstream amplifier of TGF-b actions that has thus been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Earlier reports showed that the prototypical rat acute phase reactant a2-macrofetoprotein acts as an inhibitor of experimental hepatitis and fibrosis, however, the impact of the acute phase reaction initiating interleukins such as IL-6 on CCN2/CTGF synthesis in PC is yet unknown. We therefore investigated the mechanisms involved in a possible modulator role of IL-6 signalling on CCN2/CTGF expression in PC and looked for a relation between serum concentrations of these two parameters in patients with acute inflammation. Methods: Expression of CCN2/CTGF, p-STAT3, p-Smad3/1 and p-Smad2 was examined in primary fresh-isolated rat or cryo-preserved human PC exposed to various stimuli by Western blotting, reporter-gene-assays and RT-PCR. Results: IL-6 strongly down-regulated CCN2/CTGF protein and mRNA expression in PC, an effect enhanced by the extracellular presence of the soluble IL-6 receptor gp80. These data were confirmed by an inverse relation between IL-6 and CCN2/CTGF concentrations in patients' sera. The inhibition of TGF-b driven CCN2/CTGF expression by IL-6 did not involve a modulation of Smad2 (and Smad1/3) signalling. However, the STAT3 SH2 domain binding peptide, a selective inhibitor of STAT3 DNA binding activity, counteracted the inhibitory effect of IL-6 on CCN2/CTGF expression much more pronounced than pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor primarily of STAT3 phosphorylation. Conclusion: CCN2/CTGF is identified as a hepatocellular negative acute phase protein which is down-regulated by IL-6 via the STAT3 pathway through interaction on the DNA binding level.",

            "text": "Background: Activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is a major participant in hepatic fibrosis, and thus, the suppression of HSC activation and/or survival has been implicated as anti-fibrotic therapies. Exisulind, a metabolite of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac, is one of recently developed apoptosis-inducing agents, which is being evaluated in cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess efficacy of exisulind in modulating activation and survival of HSCs. Methods: LX-2 cells, an immortalized human HSC line, were used in this study. Cellular apoptosis was evaluated by DAPI staining and immunoblot analyses. Collagen a1 and a-smooth muscle actin expression were examined with real time RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively. Result: Exisulind induced HSC apoptosis in an activation-independent manner. This apoptosis was mediated by activation of JNK, Bim (BH3 domainonly protein) and later mitochondrial apoptotic signaling. Exisulind treatment also attenuated NFkB-dependent cFLIP expression in HSCs. In addition to inducing apoptosis, exisulind attenuated collagen a1 synthesis and a-smooth muscle actin expression in HSCs. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that exisulind suppresses activation and survival of HSCs through JNK and NFkB-dependent mechanism. Therefore, this agent is therapeutically implicated as an anti-fibrotic strategy in hepatic fibrosis. Background: Huangqi Tang (HQT) is a well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine. We previously reported HQT exerting significant therapeutic effects on DMN-induced cirrhosis/fibrosis in rats. In this study, Proteomics approaches were performed to identify proteins that may be involved in DMN-induced cirrhosis/fibrosis and the effects of HQT intervention were observed in rats. Methods: Differential protein spots that exhibited changes in DMN-induced cirrhosis/fibrosis were selected by Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by Matrix-assisted laser Desorption/ionization Time-of-flight and Peptide Mass Fingerprinting Analysis. After that, these protein spots were recognized by Bioinformatics Information Retrieval. Lastly, the results of this proteomic analysis were confirmed by immunoblotting and detection of enzyme activity. Results: 20 protein spots were found to be differentially expressed, including 7 spots involved in disorder of lipid metabolism and oxidative damage, 4 spots involved in protein metabolism, 3 spots involved in biotransformation and 3 spots involved in material synthesis and energy metabolism in liver. Among them, 4 spots for confirmation (L-FABP14, Prdx6, Hsp70, CAT) were consistent with the results of Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Introduction: The mechanisms whereby overweight and obesity renders the liver more susceptible to alcohol-associated damage are unclear. In overweight persons, serum leptin levels are increased and we have shown that leptin promotes liver fibrosis. Acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol, activates hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Aims: To clarify the mechanisms by which overweight might contribute to alcohol-associated liver injury, we examined whether leptin promotes the profibrogenic effects of acetaldehyde in cultured HSCs and sought to identify factors that might contribute to any observed effects. In addition, we determined the signalling pathways that mediate HSC activation during combined treatment with leptin and acetaldehyde. Methods: Rat HSCs in various stages of activation (2 days to third passage) were isolated from wt rats. Recombinant rat leptin (100 nM), acetaldehyde (175 lM), and acetaldehyde + leptin were added to cultured HSCs. Gene expression of type I collagen, TIMP1, TGFb1, CTGF and IL-6 were assessed by real time PCR. IL-6 protein was detected by ELISA. HSC a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and MAPK (pERK1/2 and pp38) was analyzed by immunoblot. H 2 O 2 concentration in medium was assessed by H2DCF-DA. Results: Acetaldehyde enhanced collagen I, TIMP1 and TGFb1 mRNA expression in passaged HSCs, but not in primary cells. Leptin did not augment acetaldehydeinduced gene expression of the above proteins. In contrast, leptin plus acetaldehyde dramatically increased the gene and protein expression of IL-6 and a SMA (5 and 1.8-fold, respectively vs. controls, P \\ 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Furthermore, combination treatment activated HSC phosphorylation of MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38). Finally, IL-6 antibody neutralization attenuated the treatment-induced increase of a SMA and MAPK (ERK1/2 and p38). Conclusion: Leptin potentiates acetaldehyde-induced HSC activation, in part, due to increased IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated downstream p38 and pERK1/2 activation. Objective: To study the protective effect of Blueberry against rat hepatic fibrosis and the effect of Blueberry on HO-1 expression pattern. Methods: SD rats were randomly divided into five groups namely control group, model group, blueberry group, Dan-shao-hua-xian (DSHX) capsule group and blueberry + Dan-shao-hua-xian group. Fibrous liver models in rats were induced by subcutaneous injection of CCl 4 and high-lipid/low-protein diet for 8 weeks except control group. Then, measuring the activity of the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) of liver homogenate were determined. Observing the pathologic change of liver tissue. The expression of HO-1 was examined by real-time RT-PCR technique, Immunohistochemical staining and Western Blot.",

Background/Aim: Bupleurum scorzonerifolium (BS), a traditional Chinese herb, has been widely used to treat liver diseases. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the key cell type that regulates liver fibrosis, become activated and profibrogenic through phagocytosis of hepatocytic apoptotic bodies (ABs). Using an activity-guided fractionation, a lignan, kaerophyllin was isolated from BS. The aim of this study is to determine the anti-fibrotic potential of kaerophyllin and its possible mechanisms of action. Methods: Liver fibrosis in SD rats was induced by thioacetamide (TAA; 200 mg/kg, i.p.) injection twice weekly for 6 weeks. Two groups of rats received either high or low doses (15 and 30 mg/kg, twice daily) of kaerophyllin by gavage. LX-2, a human hepatic stellate cell line, incubated in the presence of UV-induced HepG2 ABs was used to investigate the engulfment of ABs by HSCs and the role of kaerophyllin in the inhibition of HSCs activation. Results: Phagocytosis of ABs by LX-2 induced activation, with production of collagen I and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), increased motility and NF-jB activity. Kaerophyllin inhibited LX-2 phagocytosis of ABs and activation. TAA administration induced liver fibrosis, which was attenuated by kaerophyllin treatment, with reduction of GOT and GPT levels and a-SMA protein expression. Conclusions: Kaerophyllin reduced TAA-induced liver fibrosis and inhibited HSC activation and engulfment of ABs.

Colocalized positive cells of Hep Par/CK 7 were founded increased gradually and colocalized positive cells of Hep Par/ TGF-b1 were observed (a majority of these cells were colocalized of TGF-b1 and Hep Par). Conclusions: Hepatocytes transdifferentiation maybe mediated by TGF-b 1 autocrined in hepatocytes after BDL rats. Background and Aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients are at risk of progressing to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. HCV core protein, which is secreted by infected hepatocytes, may interact with and thereby activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of HCV core protein on HSCs and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: LX-2, a human hepatic stellate cell line, was incubated with recombinant core protein with or without inhibitors. Phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK) 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), subunits of NADPH oxidase including gp91 and p47 were determined by Western blotting. The mRNA expressions of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. ROS formation was assayed by fluorometer. Mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by flow cytometry and fluoromicroscope. Results: HCV core protein stimulated ROS formation, mitochondrial membrane potential, mRNA expression of MMP-1, and protein expressions of a-SMA, gp91 and p47 in LX-2. Phosphorylations of JAK2 and STAT3 were also significantly enhanced by HCV core protein, which were, reversed by JAK and NADPH oxidase inhibitors. NADPH oxidase inhibitor, but not JAK inhibitor, decreased the expressions of a-SMA and gp91. Conclusion: HCV core protein induced oxidative stress and JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, contributing to HSC activation. Background and Aim: Xiaozhang Cataplasm had adjuvant effect to reduce ascites as umbilicus plaster in cirrhotic patients. To investigate the change of ascites and gastrointestinal motility induced by Xiaozhang Cataplasm plastered on the navel of rats with dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced cirrhosis and obvious ascites. Methods: Seventy wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups. Groups 4 to 6 (n = 12/group), the animals were given intraperitoneal injection of DMN with a dosage of 10 lg/kg of body weight per day for three consecutive days per week for 4 weeks. Groups 1 to 3 (n = 8/group) served as normal control groups, in which the rats were given no DMN.

Background/Aims: Elevated tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 expression contributes to excess production of extracellular matrix in liver fibrosis. The present study constructed a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying siRNAs of TIMP-1 and investigated the effects of administration of this recombinant AAV in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced rat liver fibrosis model. Methods: Five siRNA oligomers targeting rat TIMP-1 were designed and transfected into rat hepatic stellate cells (HSC)-T6. A U6 promoter followed by the siRNA which had the strongest suppression effect was cloned into the AAV vector and packed into 293 cells to construct the recombinant AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1. Olive oil CCl4 solution 40% (2 mL/kg), or olive oil control, was administered hypodermically to Wistar rats twice each week for 6 weeks. Rats were randomly divided into CCl 4 control group and recombinant AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1 administration group, which were administered the recombinant AAV at the end of first week and second week. At the sixth weekend, the rats were sacrificed for detection of histological changes of liver tissue, liver tissue hydroxyproline content and expression of TIMP-1. Moreover, the expression level of the TIMP-1 was detected at 12 weeks after the infection of the recombinant AAV in HSC-T6. Results: Three of the five designed siRNA oligomers had a suppressing effect on TIMP-1 expression in rat HSCs within 72 h. AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1 administration attenuated fibrosis severity, as determined by fibrosis scores (3.5 \u00b1 0.9) compared with the CCl 4 -treated group (2.6 \u00b1 0.5) (P = 0.02). Compared to controls, the hydroxyproline content and TIMP-1 expression of liver tissue in AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1 administration group was decreased by 22 and 45%, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro inhibition of TIMP-1 could last 12 weeks and decreased 90%. Conclusions: RNA interference exerts suppressive effect on the TIMP-1 gene in cultured HSCs for a longer time when a recombinant AAV is utilized as the gene delivery vector. Administration of AAV/siRNA-TIMP-1 attenuated CCl4induced rat liver fibrosis and decreased TIMP-1 expression. Background: No specific therapy is currently available to treat liver fibrosis, a common complication associated with chronic liver disease. Although rapamycin has been shown to inhibit liver fibrosis in rats, the exact mechanisms of this treatment remain unclear. Methods: Hepatic liver fibrosis was induced in rats by CCL 4 administration for 8 weeks. 39 Rats were divided into three groups: CCL 4 -induced fibrotic rats then treated for 2 weeks with 2 mg/kg/day rapamycin (Rapa) or 2 ml/kg/day 0.9% NaCl (Control), and left untreated (Normal). Primary hepatocytes and liver slices were isolated and their protein expression of p70S6K and TGF-b1pathway proteins was examined using immunohistochemistry and ELISA. Statistical significance of the expression levels between groups was defined using analysis of variance as P \\ 0.05. Results: Rapamycin successfully inhibited rat liver fibrosis, as evidenced by a reduced volume of connective tissue and decreased AST (ASpartate amino-Transferase) levels in Rapa rats compared to Control or Normal animals. Fibrosis increased the expression of the EMT marker vimentin, and this effect was reversed in Rapa animals. The expression levels of several Smads (p-smad2, p-smad3, smad 2/3, and smad 4) and p-p70S6K were higher in Control than in Normal rats. Rapamycin treatment eliminated these upregulations.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to show that rapamycin inhibits liver fibrosis by blocking the EMT, potentially through a pathway involving Smads and p70S6K. Background/aims: Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are pericytes of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Activation of HSCs into a myofibroblast-like phenotype is involved in several hepatic disease processes. The alpha-smooth muscle actin is a well known marker of hepatic stellate cell activation. It has been known that activated HSCs are the main matrix-producing cells and play an important role in the progress of liver cirrhosis. The aim of the present study was to immunolocalize muscarinic receptors in the activated HSCs of thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic rat liver. Methods: Antibodies against M1-M5 muscarinic receptors was used for immunohistochemical study in the cirrhotic liver sections. Results: In the present study, we could demonstrate immunochemically that the activated HSCs in thioacetamide-induced cirrhotic liver, which are immunopositive for alpha smooth muscle actin, express M3 muscarinic receptor but not M1, M2, M4 and M5. Conclusion: These finding suggest that M3 muscarinic receptor might be involved in triggering the intracellular signaling pathways in activated HSCs leading to the production of collagen fibers. If this assumption appears to be true this mechanism may be of future interest in therapy of hepatic fibrosis. Background: The relationship between HBV carrier state and liver fibrosis are incompletely understood, and lack a mouse model. We now develop HBVassociated liver fibrosis in HBV transgenic (HBV-tg) mice which resembles human inactive HBV carriers, and investigate the immune response contributing to liver fibrosis. Methods: We performed comparative investigations between C57BL/6 and HBV-tg mice. For acute liver injury, C57BL/6 and HBV-tg mice were injected with a single hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ). For chronic liver injury and liver fibrosis, mice were injected with biweekly CCl 4 as long as 10 and 14 weeks. The histological changes of liver injury and fibrosis were visualized in sections stained by hematoxylin-eosin and sirius red. Liver samples from both mice were evaluated for mRNA expression of fibrosis related markers. Results: Liver fibrosis spontaneously occurred in old HBV-tg mice. After CCl 4 injections, there were much more liver injury and liver fibrosis in HBV-tg mice compared with C57BL/6 mice. We found the collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) remarkably over-activated in HBV-tg mice after chronic CCl 4 administration. The immune dysfunction correlated with progressive liver fibrosis in HBV-tg mice. Over-activation of liver HSCs in CCl 4 treated HBV-tg mice was largely ameliorated by natural killer T (NKT) cells depletion, but not by natural killer (NK) cells depletion. More importantly, adoptive transfer of purified liver NKT cells from HBV-tg mice into Rag1 -/mice led to accelerated HSCs activation, emphasizing a prominent role for NKT cell-mediated liver fibrosis.",

Background: Resveratrol, a representative antioxidant derived from grape, has been reported to show widespread pharmacological properties. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of resveratrol on dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Methods: Rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of DMN (40 mg/ kg) and treated with resveratrol daily by oral gavage for 7 days. Results: Resveratrol remarkably recovered the body weight loss and liver weight in DMN-induced liver fibrosis. Liver histology showed that resveratrol alleviated the infiltration of inflammatory cells and fibrosis of liver tissue. Also, resveratrol decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Resveratrol significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of transforming growth factor b 1 (TGF-b 1 ), collagen type I and a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA). In addition, there was significant decrease of hydroxyproline by resveratrol in DMN-induced liver fibrosis. Conclusions: Our results suggest that resveratrol could improve DMN-induced liver injury and fibrosis and may be useful in preventing the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis from liver damage. Background and Objective: The herbal ingredients formula (CGA) composed of Cordyceps sinensis polysaccharide (C), Gypenosides (G) and Amygdaloside (A) was found to inhibit liver fibrosis significantly at the proportion of 6:8:5 by uniform design in our previous research. To illuminate the mechanism and Compatibility significance of CGA, the present study compared CGA to each ingredient on the anti-liver fibrosis effects Methods: DMN solution (0.5%) was injected to rats for three consecutive days per week for 3 weeks. Rats were randomly divided into vehicle groups, DMN control group, C, G, A, and CGA groups. Each group was orally administered with specific decoctions daily for 3 weeks. Rats in the vehicle group were orally administered with only water for 3 weeks. Results: The Hyp content in vehicle groups, DMN control group, C, G, A, and CGA groups were 165 \u00b1 35, 435 \u00b1 91, 338 \u00b1 70, 318 \u00b1 54, 323 \u00b1 79,254 \u00b1 39 lg/g of liver tissue, suggesting that each ingredient had a anti-liver fibrosis effect,however, CGA was more effective (compared with each Ingredients P \\ 0.05). Compared with control rats, the protein expressions of a-SMA, TIMP-1,TIMP-2, MMP13 in DMN rats were all significantly increased. The protein expressions of a-SMA and MMP13 were reduced by C and A treatment. The protein expressions of TIMP-1 were reduced by C treatment. Compared with DMN rats, The protein expressions of a-SMA, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP13 were all significantly reduced in CGA rats. Conclusion: Our results show that CGA treatment exerted antifibrotic effects,which was related to inhibition of HSC activation, regulation of collagen metabolism. There was synergetic effect among each ingredient. Background and aim: Therapeutic options for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis are limited. Picrorhiza kurrooa (Pk), an herb found in the north western parts of Himalaya, has proven hepatoprotective efficacy, however its anti fibrotic potential is not yet evaluated. The study is designed to evaluate the therapeutic potentials of Pk extract against liver fibrosis in vitro using Human hepatic stellate cell (HSC) LX2, which is responsible for increased synthesis and deposition of collagen in the liver. Methods: Crude root extracts of Pk was prepared. LX2 cell line was maintained in DMEM medium with 2% FBS in vitro. The cells were activated in-vitro by environmental toxin arsenic (2.5 lmol) for in vitro. After activation, the LX2 cells were treated with Pk extracts (200 lg) for 1-5 days. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay and cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining, annexin-V/propidium labelled flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was done using BCl2, Bax, AKT and beta actin. Results: Arsenic enhanced the proliferation of LX2 cells in vitro. Addition of root extracts of Pk hindered the arsenic induced proliferation of LX2 cell line. The absolute enhancement of growth inhibition rates was significant compared to the control group and arsenic treated group. The apoptosis rates in Pk and Pk plus arsenic groups were significantly increased compared with control and arsenic groups. These effects were associated with complete down regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of the apoptotic protein Bax. Further Pk significantly inhibited Akt activation in LX2 cells. Conclusion: Root extracts of Pk can inhibit proliferation of activated LX2 cells in vitro and shows a proapoptototic effect on HSCs Bcl2/ Bax pathway as well as Akt inactivation. This study suggests root extracts of Pk as a novel anti fibrotic agent. Background and Aims: N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is potential antioxidant and provides significant protection against a broad array of modern toxins. It well recognized that NAC would benefit liver damage and fibrosis. Hypoxia is very closely associated with hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis. We found that NAC had a good action against liver fibrosis in our previous study, here we investigate NAC effect on hypoxia HSC cell line-T6 induced by CoCl 2 . Methods: HSC-T6 was cultured and incubated with 10-200lM of CoCl 2 for 4-24 h, and cell growth was assayed with MTT. Then CoCl 2 intoxicated HSC-T6 with or without serum supplementation, was incubated with 1 mM NAC, and cell growth was observed as the above too. Results: Compared to the normally cultured HSC-T6 cells, CoCl 2 inhibits HSC-T6 growth in the dosage and time dependent manner, the maximum effect CoCl 2 on HSC-T6 is almost at 150 lM for 16 h incubation. NAC could counteract CoCl 2 induced HSC-T6 suppressing growth. Conclusion: CoCl 2 suppressed HSC-T6 growth in vitro, and NAC counteracted this suppression. Background and Aim: Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSC) transdifferentiate into myofibroblastic cells, which are the main producers of extracellular matrix components in hepatic fibrogenesis. Myofibroblastic transition is associated with an altered profile of growth factors and mediators of inter-and intracellular cell communication. Therefore, HSC express a wide spectrum of neuronal signal transducers after myofibroblastic transition. Since microRNAs, which are endogenous small single-stranded non-coding RNAs, inhibit gene expression by interaction with the untranslated region (UTR) of many transcripts, we studied the role of miRNAs known to be involved in neuronal development, during HSC transdifferentiation. Methods: Primary HSCs were isolated from male Wistar rats and cultured for up to 10 days. The RNA extraction was done by the Trizol method and a polyadenylation combined reverse transcription was performed. The neuronal miRNAs miR-9, miR-125b and miR-128 were quantified by Real-Time PCR using the miScript system of Qiagen. Putative miRNA targets were validated in reporter assays by cloning the binding site of the 3 0 -UTR in fusion to the coding sequence of a luciferase reporter gene. Results: All three neuronal miRNAs miR-9, miR-125b and miR-128 were upregulated during myofibroblastic HSC differentiation. Screening of databases like Pictar, miRanda and TargetScan, revealed putative binding sites of the miRNAs in transcripts encoding for several pluripotency factors such as Lin-28 and Klf4. For validation of the target, reporter assays were performed of the cloned wildtype in comparison to corresponding mutated sequences carrying two point mutations in the binding consensus. We identified LIN28, which triggers pluripotency in embryonic stem cells, as target for miR-9, miR-125b and miR-128. Conclusion: In conclusion, the neuronal miRNAs miR-9, miR-125b and miR-128 are indicated to take part in myofibroblastic transition as well as expression and neuronal features of HSC by targeting Lin28 transcripts.

Because respiration affects intrathoracic pressure and hepatic venous return, LSMs could be affected by respiration. This study was performed to evaluate the influence of respiration on the LSMs. Methods: Patients were requested to breathe freely during examination. LSMs were performed at the end of inspiration and then, at the end of expiration. The median values obtained during inspiration and those obtained during expiration were defined as iLSM and eLSM, respectively. Significant difference in LSMs was defined as higher LSM -IQR [ lower LSM + IQR. Results: A total of 93 patients with chronic liver disease were enrolled. Mean age was 38 years and 66 patients (71%) were men. Liver cirrhosis was combined in 14 patients (15%). eLSM (11.0 \u00b1 8.8 kPa) was significantly higher than iLSM (10.6 \u00b1 9.2 kPa) (P \\ 0.001), while there was no significant difference between iLSM/iIQR (0.1 \u00b1 0.1) and eLSM/eIQR (0.1 \u00b1 0.1) (P = 0.441). eLSM was higher than iLSM in 58 patients (62.4%), lower in 31 (33.3%), and same in 4 (4.3%). eLSM was significantly higher than iLSM in 22 patients (23.7%), while iLSM was not significantly higher in any patient. When baseline characteristics and laboratory data were compared between patients with significant differences in LSMs and patients without significant differences in LSMs, only the proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis showed significant difference between two groups (P = 0.024). Conclusions: LSMs were significantly elevated during expiration in some patients. These results might suggest that fibrosis stage could be overestimated if LSMs were performed during expiration.",

            "text": "Background and Aim of the Work: The accurate diagnosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related fibrosis is crucial for prognosis and treatment decisions. Due to the limitations of liver biopsy, noninvasive alternatives including Fibroscan have been developed. This study was assigned to compare Liver Stiffness Measurement (Fibroscan) with hepatic fibrosis assessed by histologic examination in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4. Patients and Methods: The study included 120 chronic HCV patients with genotype 4. They were subjected to liver biopsy and FibroScan examination. Liver fibrosis was staged on a 0-4 scale according to the METAVIR system. The diagnostic performance of FibroScan was assessed by analysis of the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve. Results: The area under ROC curve of FibroScan for significant fibrosis was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.801-0.940). The diagnostic accuracy of Fi-broScan was found to be 75.8 with 84.6% sensitivity and 76.5% specificity. The positive predictive value was 63.5% and the negative predictive value was 91.2%. The identical matching, overestimation and underestimation of Fibro-Scan to liver biopsy were 35, 36.7 and 28.3% in overall patients; 32. 1, 35.8 and 32 .1% in patients with early fibrosis (F0-F2); and 41, 38.5 and 20.5% in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F3,F4). Conclusion: This study suggests that, FibroScan is a promising method for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 4. Seoul, Korea, Backgrounds/Aims: While liver stiffness measurement (LSM) predicts histological cirrhosis accurately, complementary methods are needed for the better performance. Furthermore, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) influences LSM, making it necessary to modify its use in patients with high ALT levels. We developed a new LSM-based prediction model for cirrhosis and estimated cutoffs for different ALT levels. Methods: From 2008 to 2009, we prospectively enrolled 330 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B and underwent liver biopsy and LSM on the same day. For detection of cirrhosis, we performed univariate and multivariate analysis, using v 2 test/t test and logistic regression, respectively. Thereafter, a prediction model was derived from multivariate predictors. Results: In multivariate analyses of patients with and without cirrhosis, we found significant differences in LSM, spleen diameter and platelet count. Then, we developed a LSM-Spleen diameter to Platelet ratio Index (LSPI): (LSM 9 Spleen diameter/Platelet count) 9 100. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.956, significantly higher than LSM alone (0.919, P = 0.032). We suggested different cut-offs in patients with ALTBupper limit of normal (ULN) (NALT group, 164 patients) and ALT [ ULN (HALT group, 166 patients). In NALT group, LSPI cut-offs of 38/62 provided 95.7% negative predictive value (NPV)/95.5% PPV (positive predictive value), while in HALT group, cut-offs of 42/94 yielded 95.1% NPV/96.4% PPV, respectively. Therefore, liver biopsy could be avoided in 76.7% of subjects. Conclusions: LSPI is a reasonable, noninvasive tool that can replace liver biopsy in assessment of liver fibrosis among the lowest and highest-risk patients. Background: Assessment of liver fibrosis is important for deciding the treatment and predicting the prognosis of patients. Liver biopsy is a gold standard for assessing hepatic fibrosis. However, this method frequently has a risk of severe complications. We evaluated the clinical accuracy of fibroscan, serum hyaluronic acid, serum retinol-binding protein 4, and serum transferrin as a simple, non-invasive marker for predicting hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver disease.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a new devise using ARFI technology and to compare with other markers such as the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) and aspartate to alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) ratio. Methods: We enrolled consecutive 38 patients (M/F = 28/10) who performed the liver biopsy for evaluating cause and severity of chronic liver diseases. The fibrosis stage was determined by two independent pathologists according to the METAVIR classification. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) was performed five times at the same site on the day of liver biopsy procedure. Results: The LSM could be obtained in all patients without measurement failure. The etiology of liver diseases included HBV infection (n = 8), HCV infection (n = 4), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 12), PBC (n = 2), NASH (n = 2), Wilson's disease (n = 1), and unknown origin (n = 9). According to the fibrosis stage, the median values of LSM were 1.63 \u00b10.47 for F0 (n = 4), 1.83 \u00b1 0.30 for F1 (n = 8), 1.65 \u00b1 0.42 for F2 (n = 15), 2.11 \u00b1 0.60 for F3 (n = 10), and 2.93 for F4 (n = 1), respectively. Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.402 (P = 0.012). According to the Area under the curve of receiver operation characteristic (AUROC) analysis for different fibrosis thresholds, ARFI, APRI and AST/ALT ratio showed 0.697, 0.768, and 0.522 for CF2, 0.714, 0.524, and 0.616 for CF3, and 0.919, 0.054, and 0.811 for CF4, respectively. Conclusions: ARFI is a reliable, rapid non-invasive method to diagnosis the severity of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. Background: To evaluate the clinical significance of serum Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) in predicting prognosis of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (DLC). Methods: Serum VEGF, TBI, PT and CR were detected in 84 patients with DLC. The correlations between serum VEGF and MELD and the prognosis of them were analyzed. Results: The concentrations of Serum VEGF were (255.52 \u00b1 92.27) pg/ml, (130.33 \u00b1 100.28) pg/ml in died patients or the survivals with DLC respectively. The score of MELD were (25.84 \u00b1 7.32), (15.00 \u00b1 4.91) in died patients or the survivals with DLC respectively. Serum VEGF and MELD were both higher in the died DLC patients than those in the survivals (P \\ 0.005).There was a positive correlation between serum VEGF and MELD (r = 0.444, P \\ 0.0001 Introduction: Non-invasive, i.e. serum-based assessment of liver fibrosis is still an important challenge although multiple single and multiparametric panels of biomarkers have been proposed. Aim and Methods: (a) Haptoglobin, ALT, gammaGT, alpha 2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1 and bilirubin in sera of 4 patients with histological proven fibrosis (F1-F4, A1-A3) were determined in 6 different quality-controlled laboratories. Inter-laboratory variations of the calculated Fibrotest Score for staging and Actitest Score for grading (both BioPredictive TM ), and their error ratios compared to the results obtained by biopsy were calculated. (b) The variability of obtained Fibrotest/Actitest Scores depending on 64 differential combinations of the allowed analyt-specific maximum/minimum permissible values as determined by the external quality control of the German Association of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (DGKL) was determined and the frequency distribution of the results calculated. Results: (a) Fibrotest and Actitest Scores were largely reproducible among the different laboratories. However, the error ratio was 77% for all results calculated by both, Fibrotest and Actitest when compared to the histological findings. (b) Calculated scores varied among F2 (9%), F3 (31%), F3-F4 (6%), and F4 (54%) (Fibrotest), as well as A1/A2 (48%), A2 (9%), A2-A3 (5%), and A3 (38%) (Actitest). Conclusion: Despite reproducibility of Fibro-and Actitest results among the six laboratories, large scale investigation (n = 64) displayed increasing variability of the results depending on interlaboratory differences that were still in a quality controlled, analytically acceptable range. Furthermore, calculated scores coincided with histological findings only in less than 25% of all cases. Thus, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests must be considered as low, if histology is accepted as gold standard. Background/aims: It has not been explicitly addressed whether new biomarkers, in addition to readily available clinical data, make a contribution to the prediction of liver fibrosis. Methods: A total of 209 patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent liver biopsy were recruited. The Clinical Score (CS) model using only routine clinical data and the Biomarker Score (BS) model using seven putative biomarkers (a2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, hyaluronic acid, Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 249 matrix metalloproteinase-2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, procollagen III N-terminal peptide) were derived from the derivation set (n = 105), and these models were applied to a separate patients group (n = 104) to investigate whether the addition of BS improved the diagnostic accuracy in predicting significant fibrosis beyond an assessment based solely on CS. Results: The most informative biomarkers for predicting significant fibrosis were hyaluronic acid and matrix metalloproteinase-2. The BS was an independent predictive factor for significant fibrosis even after accounting for CS in both sets. Among the derivation set, the incorporation of the BS into the CS model did not significantly increase the ROC area, with only a small improvement of about 2% (P = 0.11 Objective: Currently, the application of metabolomics to liver disease was focused on the analysis of urine or serum. The feces offer a unique opportunity to reflect the cooperation between microbiome-mammalian metabolisms which is an essential element in the study of the human metabolon. Here, a global metabolomics approach was firstly used to find and identify metabolites differentially regulated in the feces of liver cirrhosis patients caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Methods: Seventeen HBV-induced liver cirrhosis patients and 24 healthy individuals were recruited. Fecal metabolite was detected through a nontargeted reversed-phase ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometric metabolomics approach.",

Using unequal variance t tests, 2,393 peaks with P B 0.05, approximately 71.5% of which were the results of decreased fecal metabolite concentrations in liver cirrhosis versus healthy control, were observed. Integrating multivariate data analysis, we identified six major groups of metabolites: a dramatically decrease of bile acids and bile pigments were found in the patients, a strong increase of lysophosphatidylcholines, aromatic amino acids, fatty acids and acylcarnitines were found in the patients. Conclusions: The results suggested that a severe hepatic injury and malabsorption of nutrient substance and disorders of fatty acid occurred in the patients with liver cirrhosis. And the imbalance of gut microflora may play a role in metabolomic alterations in liver cirrhosis. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of clinical problems in liver cirrhosis. Background: As chronic liver disease progresses, an imbalance occurs between synthesis and breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in degrading ECM while tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) prevent their fibrolytic action. We determined if serum levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are related to liver histology in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods: Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were used to study circulating values of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB; n = 159) and 20 healthy controls. Hepatic histology was evaluated using the Hepatitis-Activity-Index (HAI) according to Ishak et al. (J. Hepatol, 22:696-699, 1995) , quantifying separately inflammatory activity and fibrosis. Results: Serum levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were higher in the patients than those in the healthy controls, and had significant difference (P \\ 0.05). Serum levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 increased significantly with the development of fibrosis and had a positive correlations with HAI(r = 0.51, P \\ 0.01; r = 0.42, P \\ 0.01), whereas serum ALT was not related to fibrosis or to HAI.

Methods: Five patients with chronic hepatitis B in the last 6 months who had a liver biopsy were enrolled into the study. Demographics, clinical history, relevant pathology and imaging results were collected. Valid Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM) obtained from Fibroscan \u00d2 required ten successful measurements in the mid axillary line. The plasma caffeine clearance using orally administered 13C-caffeine was obtained as per protocol. The reference ranges for LSM cut-offs correlating to stage of fibrosis were determined from local data. Conclusion: Fibroscan \u00d2 was able to detect cirrhosis in 2/2 patients, whereas CBT and AAR detected 1/2 patients and APRI 0/2. CBT most frequently correlated to biopsy in 3/5 patients. AAR was able to correctly rule out cirrhosis in 3/5 patients but is not able to distinguish lesser degrees of fibrosis. APRI was correct in 2/5 patients. The results of this pilot study suggests that further research extended to a larger population is worthwhile, with analysis of whether non-invasive markers used in combination may improve assessment of liver fibrosis.

Background: Transient elastography (Fibroscan) is now a well recognized noninvasive method to evaluate fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis. Real time elastography has not yet an established role in this field. Aim: to evaluate the usefulness of real time elastography (RTE) in the assessment of the staging of liver fibrosis in chronic B and C hepatitis. Methods: Our study included 90 patients (52 females and 38 males, mean age 43.6 \u00b1 12, 7 years), 60 with chronic hepatitis C and 30 with chronic hepatitis B. All the patients underwent liver biopsy (fibrosis stage was quantified according Metavir scoring system) and RTE Hitachi. In evaluation of the liver stiffness we calculated elastic ratio of the liver for the subcutaneous tissue; 10 RTE measurements were made in each patient and a mean value was calculated. Results: Stiffness of the liver was significantly lower as histological stages advanced. Median elastic ratio in each stage were: in chronic hepatitis C-F0: 1.40 \u00b1 0.09 SD (N = 7); F1: 1.12 \u00b1 0.07 SD (N = 13); F2:1.07 \u00b1 0.09 SD (N = 21); F3: 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 SD (N = 11); F4: 0.31\u00b10.04 SD (N = 8); in chronic hepatitis B-F0: 1.27 \u00b1 0.09 SD (N = 6); F1:1.18 \u00b1 0.08 SD (N = 13); F2:1.02 \u00b1 0.09 SD (N = 7); F3: 0.98 \u00b1 0.08 SD (N = 2); F4: 0.51 \u00b1 0.06 SD (N = 2). Conclusions: The elastic ratio correlated well to the advanced histological fibrosis staging (F4) in chronic hepatitis C but not so well in chronic hepatitis B. In both B and C chronic viral hepatitis the performance of method was low for discriminating mild fibrosis from significant liver fibrosis, which might limit the applicability of this technique in clinical practice. Background/Aims: Early detection of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases is crucial to prevent cirrhotic complications. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) has been proposed as an inexpensive noninvasive marker to assess liver fibrosis. The aim of the present observational, cross-sectional study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of APRI for fibrosis prediction in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods: This study included 207 patients with CHB, 108 patients with CHC, and 140 patients with NAFLD. The APRI index was calculated according to the following formula: APRI = [(AST level/upper limit of normal)/platelet counts (109/L)] 9 100. Stage of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis was graded with the METAVIR scale. The Kleiner system for grading fibrosis was used in patients with NAFLD. Results: Simple correlational analysis revealed that the APRI correlated significantly with fibrosis scores in patients with CHC (r = 0.2634, P = 0.0059) and NAFLD (r = 0.2273, P = 0.0069) but not in those with CHB (r = 0.1005, P = 0.1495). To assess the usefulness of APRI as a predictor of the absence or presence of liver fibrosis (fibrosis score of 0 versus fibrosis scores of 1-4), receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were determined in each patient group. In patients with CHC, APRI showed a 72.7% sensitivity and 62.4% specificity for a fibrosis score of 1-4. In the NAFLD group, APRI showed a 60.0% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity for a fibrosis score of 1-4. In patients with CHB, APRI showed a 55.0% sensitivity and 75.4% specificity for a fibrosis score of 1-4. Conclusions: APRI index shows an acceptable accuracy for the assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with CHC and NAFLD but not in those of CHB.",

Here, we conducted a prospective study on the efficacy and safety of eplerenone in these patients. Methods: Fifteen consecutive patients with cirrhosis (8 alcohol abusers and 7 suffering from chronic hepatitis B of mean age 64.4 \u00b1 13.3 years), who had been administered spironolactone and suffered from painful gynaecomastia, have been included in the study.

Age, gender, Child-Pugh score, pain (in a 1-5 scale), FSH, LH, 17 (OH) progesterone, DHEA-S, testosterone and prolactine, along with standard haematological and biochemical parameters were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. Result: All 15 patients exhibited withdrawal of both pain and gynaecomastia (P \\ 0.0001). Furthermore, five patients ameliorated as far as Child-Pugh score is concerned. With the exception of LH and 17 (OH) progesterone, which were found lower at the end of the study (P = 0.011 and 0.019, respectively), all other biochemical and hormone parameters remained unchanged. In a multiple regression model including the amelioration of pain as independent variable and age, cause of cirrhosis and Child-Pugh score as dependent ones, age (P = 0.012) and cause of cirrhosis (P = 0.013) were found to be independently correlated with the amelioration of pain; this was not true for Child-Pugh score (P = 0.318). Conclusion: The use of eplerenone instead of spironolactone in cirrhotic patients with painful gynaecomastia might reverse pain and presents a safe alternative treatment.",

Methods: Twenty-two patients (19 male, 3 female) with large fundal varices (spurting or active oozing, 12; red spot or blood clot adherence, 10) who were treated with EBC from April 2005 to April 2009 were included in our study. Median (range) volume of 2.75 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) cc of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate mixed with lipiodol (0.5:0.8 ratio) were injected into the fundal variceal lesion until all the lesions became hard. Results: The number of Child-Pugh A, B, and C cases was 5 (22.7%), 12 (54.5%), and 3 (22.7%), respectively. The classification of GV included in our study was as follows: GOV2, 17 (77.3%); GOV1 + GOV2, 2 (9.1%); IGV1, 3 (13.6%). Initial hemostasis was achieved in all 22 patients (100%) and significant rebleeding occurred in 10 patients (45.5%) after median (range) follow-up of 10.5 (1-29) months. Among these 10 patients with significant rebleeding, 2 patients and 6 patients were successfully treated by 2nd session of EBC and rescue balloon occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (BRTO), respectively. However, remaining two patients had no chance of rescue treatment and died due to massive rebleeding. During the median (range) follow-up of 14.5 (1-56) months, complete eradication of GV and the aggravation of preexisting esophageal varices were observed in 13 (59.1%) and 5 (22.7%) patients, respectively. The significant predictors of rebleeding after initial EBC treatment were active bleeding (spurting or active oozing) on initial endoscopy and multiple sessions of EBC. Conclusions: This study showed that EBC might be effective treatment modality for patients with fundal GVH in terms of initial hemostasis. However, a significant proportion of patients with fundal GVH treated by EBC might experience rebleeding and were in need of rescue treatment. Egypt has one of the highest incidences of liver diseases in the world with prevalence of schistosomiasis. NO diffuses into cytosol of adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells play a role in the pathogenesis of vasodilation. Endothelial cells also produce the most potent vasoconstrictor agent endothelin (ET-1). Aim: Evaluation of nitric oxide and endothelin-1 and procollagen III peptide in patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension in both systemic and portal blood samples together with the histopathological scoring of liver biopsies. Subjects: The control group 15 subjects free from any liver disease. The patient group 30 patients with chronic liver disease and schistosomal portal hypertension. Methods: Clinical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, measurement of portal venous pressure and histopathological examination of liver biopsy. Laboratory investigations included evaluation of total nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (Et-1) and type III procollagen (PIIINP) in both portal and systemic blood. In addition prothrombin, serum alanine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST, ALT), c glutamyl aminotransferase (cGT) activities, serum bilirubin, albumin, serodetection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody and (anti-HCVAb).

Background/Aims: Bacterial infections have been documented into 35-66% of cirrhotic patients who have variceal bleeding, and were identified to be associated with early rebleeding. Patients with cirrhosis revealed significant increase in serum nitrites/nitrates, an index of nitric oxide (NO) generation. Endotoxemia secondary to bacterial infection may increase plasma NO and trigger variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on reduction of serum NO and prevention of early rebleeding after endoscopic therapy in esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB), and investigate the risk factors for early rebleeding within 6 weeks after endoscopic treatment in EVB. Methods: From May 2007 to April 2009, cirrhotic patients who had received endoscopic therapy in acute EVB were enrolled in the study. Patients with EVB were randomized into the two groups (antibiotic prophylaxis group and control group) after endoscopic treatment. Patients in the prophylactic group received antibiotic treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Results: A total of 44 patients (18 patients in prophylactic group and 26 patients in control group) were included for analysis. There were no differences between the two groups in parameters. Antibiotic prophylaxis did not decrease plasma renin, aldosterone, and serum NO concentrations. The early rebleeding rate within 6 weeks in the prophylactic group was not significantly lower than in control group. The presence of hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatitis B virus-related liver cirrhosis were significantly associated with early rebleeding (P = 0.022, 0.021, respectively). Conclusions: Antibiotic prophylaxis did not reduce serum NO and did not prevent early rebleeding within 6 weeks after endoscopic therapy in acute EVB. In the future, larger clinical studies about effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on reduction of serum NO and prevention of early rebleeding after endoscopic therapy in EVB will be needed. Results: Causes of cirrhosis were 55.7% (98 patients) in HBV, 5.7% (10 patients) in HCV, 35.2% (62 subjects) in alcohol, 0.6% (one subject) in autoimmune, and 2.8% (5 subjects) in cryptogenic. On univariate analysis, SBP was associated with Child-Pugh class C (P \\ 0.001), high MELD score (P \\ 0.001), PPI use (P = 0.018) and previous history of variceal bleeding (P = 0.038). On multivariate analysis, SBP was associated with Child-Pugh class (Class C, OR = 2.965, 95% CI 1.489-5.904, P = 0.002), MELD score (C20, OR = 3.272, CI 1.078-9.938, P = 0.036), and PPI use (yes, OR = 2.948, 95% CI 1.015-8.559, P = 0.047).",

However, NSBB has some limitation to apply clinically because of poor response rate and compliance. Angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) inhibits activated hepatic stellate cell contraction and it is supposed to reduce dynamic portion of intrahepatic resistance. This study aimed at comparing the effects of a combined treatment using candesartan plus propranolol with propranolol monotherapy on portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis, prospectively. Methods: The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), mean blood pressure (BP), Child-Pugh score, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score were assessed at baseline and were followed at 3 month later in both combination (28 patients) and monotherapy group (31 patients) from January 2008 to July 2009. The initial dose of propranolol (20 mg) was subsequently adjusted until the target HR was reached. Patients in whom HVPG reduced by[20% or to less than 12 mmHg were defined as responders. The mean dose of candesartan and propranolol were 7.3 \u00b1 1.6 and 155 \u00b1 62.1 mg respectively. In propranolol monotherapy group, the mean dose was 157 \u00b1 60.3 Results: Portal pressure declined significantly in both groups (combination group 16.3 \u00b1 3.6-14.0 \u00b1 3.8 mmHg, P \\ 0.05, propranolol monotherapy group 16 \u00b1 4.9-12.9 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg, P \\ 0.05).

There is limited data on the different clinical and biochemical features of chronic hepatitis B liver cirrhosis (CHBLC) and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC). Aim: To compare the epidemiology and clinical characteristics between CHBLC and ALC. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of patients enrolled into the liver cirrhosis registry of Singapore General Hospital from September 2006 to January 2009. Clinical and biochemical data were obtained from computerized hospital records. Cirrhotics due to CHB and alcohol were selected. Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of these two groups were analyzed. Results: The study included 210 patients, 169 (80.5%) with CHBLC and 41 (19.5%) with ALC for a median follow-up period of 51 months. There were more males (85.4 vs. 64.5%), more Indians ( More ALC patients presented with hepatic decompensation at diagnosis compared to CHBLC (39 vs. 21.3%, P \\ 0.05). More CHBLC patients were diagnosed on screening compared to ALC patients (59.2 vs. 31.7%, P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: ALC patients had more advanced liver disease, greater degree of portal hypertension and tend to present with decompensation at diagnosis. In contrast, CHBLC patients were diagnosed at an earlier stage of cirrhosis due to earlier detection on screening. ascites, splenomegaly. The relation between gastric varices and the portal hemodynamic alterations has been studied using doppler ultrasonography. Aims and Methods: To assess portal hemodynamics in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension and examine the various hemodynamic values to affect gastric varices, we performed doppler US in total 624 patients with cirrhosis. 438 patients underwent esophagogastroscopy. The longitudinal, transverse diameter and thickness at the hilum of spleen were measured to get the splenic volume. Hepatic vein diameter at intercostal scan was also measured. Main portal vein (MPV) and umbilical portion of left portal vein (UPV) were scanned and maximal portal flow velocity was calculated. We defined delta portal flow velocity (delta PFV) as subtracting UPV velocity from MPV velocity. Resistive index (RI) and pulsatile index (PI) of renal arcuate artery were also measured. Hepatic vein doppler waveform was classified as triphasic, biphasic or monophasic. Using it's waveform damping index was obtained. 19) or without (n = 61) PVT were analyzed.

SAAG is correlated with portal hypertension and presence of EV so we aimed to determine value of SAAG that predict presence of high risk EV. Method: Prospective study included 35 newly diagnosed cirrhotic patients with ascites, who never had bleeding or hepatocellular carcinoma and never received beta-blocker or esophageal variceal ligation. Child-Pugh score (CPS) and SAAG were calculated and EGD were performed. Results: Twenty-one patients (60%) were male. One was CPS class B and the remaining were class C. AUROC for SAAG to predict EV was 0.855. In 19 patients with SAAG[20 g/L, large EV ([5 mm) were found in 7 (36.8%), and small in 11 (57.9%). Whilst in 16 patients with SAAG \\20 g/L, large EV were found in only 1 (6.3%), and small EV in 9 (56.2%). Since presence of either large or small EV in patients with CPS class C was indication for EVH prophylaxis, hence presence of EV that needs prophylaxis was significantly higher in patients with SAAG [20 g/L (94.7 vs. 62.5%, P = 0.032). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of SAAG [20 g/L in predicting high risk EV were 64.3, 85.7, 94.7 and 37.5% respectively; and positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 4.5 and 0.41. Conclusions: SAAG [ 20 g/L can predict presence of high risk EV that needs prophylaxis therapy with PPV of 94.7%. Therefore it could be used as cheap and convenient non-invasive indication for starting primary EVH prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients. The aim of our study is to analyse predictive factors of mortality at admission using the current ICU and specific liver scores in cirrhotic patients admitted to the liver ICU secondary to an acute decompensation. Patients and Methods: we studied prospectively 377 consecutive patients admitted to our liver ICU for decompensated cirrhosis from May 2005 to May 2009. Mean age was 55.5 \u00b1 11.4 years (73.5% of male). The etiology of liver cirrhosis was mainly alcoholic (68.4%). At admission, mean prognostic values were 45 \u00b1 21 for SAPS II score, 24 \u00b1 10 for the MELD, 29 \u00b1 13 for the MELD-Na, 48 \u00b1 13 for iMELD, 1.9 \u00b1 0.8 for MESO index, 10 \u00b1 2 for Child-Pugh and 9 \u00b1 5 for SOFA score. Results: ICU and hospital mortality were respectively 34.7 and 42.9%. The statistical analysis comparing cirrhotic patients who died to those who survived showed that all above mentioned prognostic scores at admission were very strong predictors of mortality (P \\ 0.0001). The area under the curve (ROC) predictive mortality was 0.82 for the MELD, 0.79 for MELD-Na, 0.81 for iMELD, 0.82 for MESO index, 0.79 for Child Pugh classification, 0.89 for SAPS II score and 0.92 for SOFA score. A cutoff predicting mortality of 47.5, 10.5 and 28.5 for SAPS II, SOFA and MELD score was found, respectively. The need for respiratory support (44.8%), inotropic support (40.3%) and continuous hemodialysis for renal failure (18.6%) predictive mortality was analysed. The need for one, two or three of these organ support yielded respectively to 5.8, 77.1 and 96% mortality.",

            "text": "Conclusion: SAPS II and SOFA scores at admission better predict ICU mortality compared to specific liver scores. The need of two or more organ support during hospital stay would highly influence the mortality. Aim: To describe the admission and mortality pattern pertaining to liver disease (CLD) in our hospital to highlight burden of this disease and future planning for prevention, control and management. Methodology: It was a descriptive type of study. Data was collected from yearly audit reports of department for last 10 year (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . Data of year 2003 and first 6 months of 2004 was not available due to some technical reasons. Share of liver related diseases to total number of admissions per year was calculated. Similarly all cases pertaining to medical mortality were reviewed. Out of these cases, patients of liver disease were identified. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Admission and mortality rate due to liver diseases was calculated for each year. Results: According to collected data, number of admissions for liver diseases gradually increased from 1998. In 1998 total number of admission was 1,267, out of which 279 (22%) patients were with liver related diseases. Maximum admissions due to liver diseases were in 2006 i.e 1,263 (35%) out of 3,595, total number of admissions. The share of Liver diseases to total admissions in last ten years continued to progress almost at a constant ratio till 2006. In last two years (2007 and 2008) this share has decreased to 27 and 28%, respectively. In second part of study total mortalities and percentage of liver related mortalities for last 10 year was calculated. Data shows that in 1998 share of liver related mortalities to total mortalities was 37% (115 cases). Then form 1999-2007 it remained between 21 to 31%. Finally in 2008 it dropped to 15% (88 cases) which is the lowest in last 10 years. Conclusion: Liver diseases due to chronic viral hepatitis are still a burden on our health resources. Current trend of decreased number of admissions and falling mortality due to this disease may be due to better understanding of disease, programs for prevention like vaccination for HBV and effective treatment for HCV with IFN. Background: Hepatic encephalopathy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease. L-Ornithine-L-aspartate (LOLA) activates the periportal urea cycle in the liver and lowers plasma ammonia. Previous placebo-controlled, double blind trials has shown the efficacy of LOLA infusions in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy. To date, limited data is available to confirm the efficacy of the oral formulation. Aim: Retrospective audit of the use of LOLA to assess patient outcome and change in encephalopathy related admissions. Methods: Fourteen patients with end-stage liver disease and intractable hepatic encephalopathy, unresponsive to lactulose and enemas, received LOLA. Clinical and laboratory data were collated to assess response to treatment. Results: Twelve out of 14 patient records were completely examined. The median duration of LOLA was 7 months (range 1-17). Median age was 54 years (range 48-67). 69.2% were males. Ten patients had end-stage chronic hepatitis C, three had alcoholic liver disease and one had autoimmune hepatitis. Median baseline MELD score was 12 (range 6-24) which did not change during treatment. To date, six patients have been transplanted, two have died and five remain on treatment, two of whom are awaiting transplant. The median number of admissions per month for hepatic encephalopathy fell from 0.5 episodes pre treatment (IQR 0.37-0.94) to nil (IQR 0-0.33) whilst on LOLA; P = 0.004. The median hours per admission per month pre-and posttreatment were 23.9 (IQR 11.1-97.5) and 0 (IQR 0 -20.8), respectively (P = 0.004).",

Background: A deterioration of renal function in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a predictor for in-hospital mortality; however, the clinical significance of renal failure during a bacterial infection other than SBP is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of renal failure due to bacterial infections other than SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods: Retrospective data from inpatients with bacterial infections other than SBP were analyzed. Results: Eighty patients were enrolled. The types of infections were urinary tract (37.5%), pneumonia (23.8%), biliary tract (20%), cellulitis (12.5%), and bacteremia of unknown origin (6.3%). Renal failure developed in 29 patients (36.3%), and 11 patients had irreversible renal failure.

We conducted a study to find out the factors associated with high mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis (portal hypertension) during hospital stay. Methods: A retrospective, experimental study was conducted in Bahawal Victoria Hosptial/Quaid-e-Azam Medical College, Bahawalpur, Pakistan (1st July 2007 to 15th August 2009). In 540 cirrhotic patients (either HBS positive, anti-HCV positive or both), frequency of mortality was noted and patients were divided into two groups. Group-A, patients who died during the hospital stay and Group-B, patients who survived. Variables studied were: sex, age, body mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB), total leukocyte count (TLC), prothrombin time (PT) difference, serum bilirubin, albumin and creatinine. Chi square test was applied for statistical significance. Results: Mortality was 24.4%.

However, serum/uninary creatinine (Cr) and Cr-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may not be a reliable marker of renal function in cirrhotic patients with lower body muscle. In this study, we investigated which parameters or formulae are appropriate for estimation of GFR in patients with liver cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: Seven patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in this study. All Japanese, M/F ratio 4/3, age 76.9 \u00b1 9.9, and the etiology included 6 HCV and 1 alcoholic. The body mass index in 7 patients was 21.7 \u00b1 1.9. All patients had neither detectable ascites nor encephalopathy at baseline, and were graded as Child-Pugh A. After an overnight fasting period, inulin clearance was determined by standard technique, and used as 'true' GFR. At the same day, serum Cr and cystatin C (Cys C) were measured from the same blood samples, and urinary Cr was measured by collecting urine for a whole day. Then we calculated GFR using Cr-based GFR estimating formulae (MDRD, Cockcroft-Gault) as well as Cys C-based formulae (Hoek, Larsson), which were statistically compared with GFR. Results: GFR determined by inulin clearance were 60.3 \u00b1 21.1 (35.6-97.1) ml/min, suggesting the presence of renal impairment in some cirrhotic patients, even in Child-Pugh A. Cr clearance (Ccr) calculated using serum Cr was 70.7 \u00b1 25.6, statistically unassociated with GFR by inulin (r = 0.148, P = 0.752). In addition, Cr-based GFR estimating formulae, MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault, demonstrated 95.7 \u00b1 17.3 (r = 0.689, P = 0.087) and 59.7 \u00b1 21.7 (r = 0.673, P = 0.098) as calculated GFR, respectively. By contrast, serum Cys C were 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 (r = -0.742, P = 0.056), well correlated with GFR as a single parameter. As a result, Cys C-based GFR estimating formulae, Hoek and Larsson, demonstrated 68.0 \u00b1 6.2 (r = 0.743, P = 0.055) and 67.6 \u00b1 7.4 (r = 0.744, P = 0.055) as calculated GFR, and thus shown a better correlation with GFR. Conclusion: For the assessment of renal function in patients with liver cirrhosis, Cys C itself or Cys C-based formulae are more appropriate parameters than those using serum Cr.",

All patients underwent detailed clinical examination, Doppler study, viral markers and liver biopsy (wherever feasible). Results: 62 patients were enrolloed in the study. Mean age of the patients were 8.2 years with male to female ratio of 3.5:1. Forty five patients presented with GI Bleed, 22 patients with distention of abdomen, 10 with jaundice and 8 with lump in Lt hypochondrium. Forty two (67%) were diagnosed as Extra hepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO), 6 (9%) patients were diagnosed as Non cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF) and 14 (22%) patients had chronic liver disease.

The key point in approaching these patients is to determine patients with major risk for bleeding. In this study we evaluated liver stiffness measured by Fibroscan as a possible predictive factor for variceal hemorrhage. Background: Portal hypertension and its complications are the primary cause of mortality in cirrhotic patients. Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is an indirect measure of portal venous pressure. The aim of the study was to measure HVPG in cirrhotic patients and correlate it with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score, Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, size of varices, variceal bleeding, ascites and etiology of cirrhosis in order to identify the predictors of HVPG. Methods: 30 consecutive patients with cirrhosis were studied. HVPG was measured using a Swan-Ganz catheter placed in the hepatic vein through percutaneous transjugular route. The mean HVPG in patients with different CTP classes, different grades of varices (small and large), bleeders and non bleeders, with and without ascites and cirrhosis of various etiologies was calculated. Correlation of various variables with HVPG was assessed using Spearman correlation test. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis of variables predicting HVPG was done using Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the HVPG measurement predicting variceal bleeding. Results: The mean HVPG was significantly higher in CTP C as compared to CTP B and CTP A (P B 0.001). The mean HVPG was significantly higher in bleeders, patients with varices and ascites (P \\ 0.05). The mean HVPG was higher in alcoholic as compared to non-alcoholic cirrhosis but was not statistically significant. Variceal bleeding, CTP and MELD scores were found to be independent predictors of HVPG in multivariate models. HVPG above 14.5 mmHg had a sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 100% in predicting variceal bleeding. Conclusion: Variceal Bleeding, CTP and MELD scores were found to be independent predictors of HVPG. A higher HVPG signifies more severe liver disease. So HVPG can predict the major complications of cirrhosis thereby helping in prevention and early treatment of complications.",

Methods: One hundred and twenty four in-patients with ascites due to cirrhosis were enrolled and randomly divided into placebo (61) and trial (63) groups. Xiaozhang Cataplasm was composed of Radix Rhizoma Rhei, Folium Raphani, and Moschus etc., and was made into transdermal plaster-cataplasma. Besides routine treatment with limited usage of diuretics, the trail group received Xiaozhang Cataplasm on navel, while the placebo group received cataplasm without medicine. The patients' symptoms, body weight, abdomen circumference, urinary amount were observed, and ultrasound examinations were taken before and after treatment, and efficacy was evaluated according to comprehensive grading criteria. The side effects were also observed. Results: 107 cases finished the full course, while 12 withdraw and 5 were removed. The age and gender ratio etc between placebo and trial groups had no differences. Compared to placebo group, patients in trial group had decreased body weight, abdomen circumference and ascites amount, but increase urinary amount and flatus. The comprehensive efficacy at the trial groups were obvious better than placebo, efficient rates of I and II grades at placebo and trial were 39.3, 68.2%. Three cases had local and slight skin rashes, which disappeared after 2 days of temporal stopping plaster and using iodine oil. Conclusions: Umbilical sticking with Xiaozhang Cataplasm may be therapeutically useful in treating patients with ascites due to liver cirrhosis. The action mechanisms may be associated with improving urination and flatus. The skin reactions happened rarely and slightly, and the cataplasma was safe for clinical use.",

Results: The prevalence rate of EV was 67%. The diameter of portal vein, spleen diameter, the diameter of splenic vein were different in different degrees of esophageal varices. Platelet count, spleen diameter, platelet count/spleen diameter radio, and Child-Pugh class were significantly different among patients with or without EV. By a multivariate analysis, the platelet count/ spleen diameter radio was one independently parameter associated with the presence of EV. The AUC value generated by the ROC curves for platelet count/ spleen diameter ratio was 0.89, higher than the others. Conclusions: Noninvasive prediction of EV maybe not accurate. But combining with simple laboratory variables has a high sensitivity to predict the varices. It suggested that platelet count/spleen diameter ratio is an ideal noninvasive predictive indexes of the presence of the varices. Background: Esophageal varices bleeding (EVB) is a common and usually lethal complication of liver cirrhosis. Here we made a survey for factors related to EVB onset and try to establish a simple model to predict EVB onset. Methods: Hepatic cirrhosis patients with EVB were as case group, and the cirrhosis patients without EVB were as control group. About 200 factors were surveyed by special trained physicians, including the features of present and past history, personal hobby, food habit, occupational condition, exercise habit, sleeping and rest, habitus features, psychological features, medical service condition, socio-economic condition, physical examination findings, laboratory results, medical image results, endoscopical results. Univariate Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) of each factor, and multivariate Logistic regression was used to establish the predictive model. Results: A total of 206 patients with hepatic cirrhosis were enrolled into this study, in which there were 125 patients with EVB and 81 patients without EVB. Univariate analyses showed that ORs of 20 factors were significant, including 7 laboratory items, 5 endoscopical items and 8 other items. Three independent factors [bleeding history (BH), serum direct bilirubin (DBIL) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP)] were screened out by stepwise multivariate Logistic analysis, and the Logistic function was Logit (P) = -3.458 + 4.799BH + 0.018DBIL -0.31AKP. This model was valuable for predicting EVB onset in cirrhosis patients, with sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 87.5%, accuracy 88.4%, positive predictive value 93.3%, negative predictive value 80.0%, positive likelihood ratio 7.11 and negative likelihood ratio 0.13. Conclusions: Many factors are related with EVB onset in cirrhosis patients, especially bleeding history, serum direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. A valuable model could be established based on these factors.",

Diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on radiology and/or Background/Aims: Liver stiffness is estimated to be consisted not only by static factor like fibrosis, but also dynamic factors like inflammation, cholestasis, and portal blood flow. Although the relation of the liver stiffness and liver fibrosis is well investigated, the relation of the portal vein pressure is not investigated sufficiently. In this study, we measured the liver stiffness and portal vein pressure simultaneously before and after the procedure that fluctuates portal hemodynamics by BRTO (Balloon occluded retrograde obliteration) and PSE (partial splenic embolization), and estimated the degree of the importance of the portal vein pressure as the participation factor of liver stiffness. Methods: BRTO was performed in three patients with liver cirrhosis for the treatment of gastric varices for the purpose of occlusion of gastro-renal shunt. PSE was performed in seven cirrhotic patients for the treatment of hypersplenism. The value of liver stiffness and WHVP (wedged hepatic vein pressure) were measured before and after the procedure.

Background and Aim: Ascites becomes refractory to medical treatment in 5-10% of patients with cirrhosis showing ascitic decompensation. Refractory ascites (RA) is closely related to a high morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the predictors of the development of RA in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis experiencing the first episode of ascitic decompensation and determined the prognostic factors of patients with RA. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 199 consecutive patients with HBV-related cirrhosis experiencing the first episode of ascitic decompensation who was admitted to our institute between January 1996 and December 2008. The end of follow-up was March 30, 2009. The median follow-up period was 55.0 (range 0.2-331.9) months. Results: The mean age of the patients experiencing the first episode of ascitic decompensation was 52.9 \u00b1 10.3 years and males predominated (n = 130, 68.1%). Patients with Child-Pugh C liver function were the most common (n = 119, 62.3%). The overall median survival was 43.1 (range 0.8-331.9) months. Univariate and subsequent multivariate analyses showed that platelet count (P = 0.016), sodium (P = 0.045), and serum potassium (P = 0.037) at admission independently predicted the development of RA. Sixteen patients (8.0%) experienced RA in 8.9 (range 4.6-62.6) months after the first episode of ascitic decompensation.

However, we could find no prognostic factor affecting the survival of patients with RA. Conclusions: In patients with HBV-related cirrhosis experiencing the first episode of ascetic decompensation, platelet count, serum sodium, and serum potassium were independent predictors of the development of RA.

Of amplified and differentiated adult stem cells (CD34+) infused into the hepatic artery, portal vein in patients with chronic liver insufficiency to find out their clinical benefits. We included 258 patients with chronic liver diseases: 15 children with metabolic liver diseases, 241 adults with end-stage liver diseases (218 post-viral, 23 non-viral), 2 patients with post-HCV liver cirrhosis and HCC. For all of them, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered (5 lm/kg SC) daily for 5 days. On day 6, the blood cells will be collected by leukapheresis. CD34+ stem cells were isolated, cultured for 1 week and injected into hepatic artery or portal vein under CT or ultrasound guidance. Follow-up using clinical and biochemical responses was done weekly for 1 month, then monthly for 18 months. Results: There was normalization of Liver enzymes and improvement in synthetic function in 50% in patients with post-viral liver failure., 94% in nonviral liver failure, 89% children with Metabolic Liver Diseases, no changes in patients with HCC (0%). Conclusion: From this study, stem cell therapy could be a promising therapeutic modality that may supplement patients with end-stage liver disease. Dose standardization and comparing different routes of injection need further assessment. Aim: Patients with advanced liver disease have a complex pattern of defects in haemostatic functions but also a profound deficit of natural anticoagulants such protein C and Antithrombin which may counterbalance the deficiency in procoagulant factors. Patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) have therefore in some cases an increase tendency to develop portal vein thrombosis (PVT). The aim of our study it is to assess the efficacy and safety of low dosage of enoxaparin in patients affected by advanced LC and with PVT. Methods: From august 2008 to august 2009 we studied by ultrasound doppler 155 cirrhotic patients as screening for hepatocellular carcinona. We found fifteen patients with PVT and without hepatocellular carcinoma (prevalence of 9.6%). Six patients with portal cavernoma were excluded from the study. The other nine patients with recent PVT were included in the study. An endoscopic examination and Computed Tomography (CT) was performed in all the patients. After informed consent, nine patients received 100 U/kg/day of enoxaparin subcutaneously for at least 4 months. Follow up by ultrasound with Doppler examination was done every month. CT was done at fourth month. Results: Etiology of cirrhosis was HCV infection in five patients, alcoholic in two, HBV+HDV in one and HBV in one. Six patients were in class A Child Pugh and three patients in class B. Seven patients presented class F1/F2 esophageal varices, while two patients presented F3 class with the evidence of red cherry spot and were previous submitted to band ligation. PVT was occludent in two patients and incomplete in seven patients. Extension to portal branches was noted in three patients while extension to splenic and superior mesenteric vein was disclosed respectively in two and one patients. Complete recanalization of PVT occurred in three patients (33%) of whom one presented a previous total PVT, partial recanalization in six patients (67% Inclusion criteria's: liver cirrhosis, and non cirrhosis dyspepsia.

            "text": "Background: Chronic liver disease leading to cirrhosis is the most common cause of portal hypertension which may end in serious bleeding from gastrooesophageal varices. Recent studies have demonstrated a daily pattern of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis evidenced by one or two peaks throughout the day. We aimed at the assessment of the circadian rhythm of acute variceal bleeding with the possible participation of circadian changes of the fibrinolytic parameters. Methods: The study included 264 patients with liver cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in addition to 20 healthy subjects as a control group. The assessment of fibrinolytic parameters was completed in 60 of the patient group in addition to the control group. The fibrinolytic activity was assessed by estimation of Tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA: Ag) and Plasminogen activator inhibitor antigen (PAI-1: Ag), the latter is considered the fast acting inhibitor of plasminogen activators. Result: We observed statistically significant 2 time peaks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding at hour 0400 and hour 1700 with overlapping peak of the fibrinolytic parameter, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, with the night peak of bleeding. Conclusion: There are two time peaks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding with a temporal association between the night peak and a relative hyperfibrinolytic state. Background/Aims: Protective immune response plays an important role in eliminating HBV and HCV infection. A weak immune response to HBV and HCV can lead to chronic liver disease. This study aims to characterize functional variations of immune status in cirrhosis and determine correlations between HBV-and HCV-cirrhosis and their immunologic features. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from patients with HBV-cirrhosis (n = 41), HCV-cirrhosis (n = 23) and healthy individuals (n = 21). Phenotypes of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (T cells, NK cells, B cells, regulatory T cells) were analysed using flow cytometry and Th cytokine secretion was assessed by cytometric bead array (CBA).",

Cirrhotic patients had a lower proportion of CD3+CD8+T cells, CD27+ B cells and NK cells, while the proportion of CD3+CD4+T cells, CD27-B cells, Treg cells and the ratio of CD4/CD8 were significantly higher than that of healthy controls. The levels of Th2 cytokines (IL-6,IL-10) in cirrhotic patients were increased dramatically, while only the Th1 cytokine (IFN-c) increased in HBV-cirrhotic patients (P = 0.037). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that there is no significant difference in immunological characteristics between the cirrhotic groups except in IFN-c levels. In post-hepatitic cirrhosis, diffuse defects in innate, adaptive, cellular and humoral immune cells are likely to be maintained regardless of which virus is involved. A cytokine imbalance oriented toward Th2-type responses may play a role in the development of post-hepatitic cirrhosis. ",

Recently, we have reported that the imbalance in plasma amino acids of patients with advanced cirrhosis suppresses the maturation of dendritic cells via mTOR/S6K signaling pathway. The aim of this study is to clarify the immunological efficiency of BCAAs ex vivo. Methods: We made two media: a serum free culture medium consistent with the average concentration of the plasma amino acids from a healthy volunteer (HC: n = 25) was defined as the healthy control medium (HCM); whereas that from patients with advanced cirrhosis (LC: n = 43) was defined as the advanced cirrhotic medium (ACM). PBMCs or DCs (BDCA1 + DCs and MoDCs) were stimulated by LPS or poly I:C under HCM and ACM. For examination of the DCs function, the phenotypes were determined by flow cytometry. As in the ex vivo study, we stimulated PBMCs from LC (n = 5) by LPS or poly I:C under autologous plasma, which was collected both before and after oral administration of BCAA granules (a mixture of valine: 1.144 g, leucine: 1.904 g and isoleucine: 0.952 g). We recovered the plasma and measured cytokines by ELISA. Results: After adding the stimulants, the CD83 and CD86 expression of DCs from LC were lower than those from HC in both HCM and ACM. In both HC and LC, the CD83 and CD86 expression of DCs stimulated under HCM was higher than that under ACM. As in the ex vivo study, the plasma concentration of BCAAs in LC was maximum 60 min after oral administration. Fischer's ratio was increased from 1.37 \u00b1 0.98 (SD) to 4.94 \u00b1 0.99 (SD). We stimulated PBMCs from LC using autologous plasma before and after 60 min oral administration. In all cases, PBMCs stimulated by LPS in the latter had more interferon gamma production than in the former. Conclusion: Oral administration of BCAA granules enhanced the maturation and function of myeloid dendritic cells in patients with advanced cirrhosis ex vivo.",

Methods: Forty-five liver cirrhosis patients were investigated. According to childpugh score, they were divided into child-pugh A group (n = 12), child-pugh B group (n = 17) and child-pugh C group (n = 16). Noninvasive cardiac hemodynamics detection appearance was applied to determine hemodynamic parameters. Results: With the aggravation of liver function, mean arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), stroke index (SI), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), left cardiac work (LCW) and left cardiac work index (LCWI) take on degrading, which in child-pugh C group are significantly lower than that in child-pugh A group (P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: Cardiac hemodyanic parameters could be effective to determine the development degree of liver cirrhosis. Systolic function of cardiac muscle degrades with the aggravation of liver function. Objective: Activated Hepatic stellate Cells (HSCs) plays very important role during the progression of the hepatic fibrosis. HSCs have biological characters of smooth muscle cells and help to adjust intrahepatic resistance and portal venous pressure. The contraction and relaxation of HSCs can be affected by vasoactive substance such as angiotonin, endothelin-1, nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO). Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) is a new kind of endogenous gas signaling molecule except for NO and CO. We aimed to study the production of H 2 S and its significance. Methods: Activated rat hepatic stellate cells line (HSC-T6) was used. They were divided into three groups and were repeated six times in every group. After conventional culture, cystathionine-c-lyase (CSE) mRNA expression of different cell groups was detected by RT-PCR and H 2 S production rate was detected by methylene blue spectrophotometry. Results: HSCs can express CSEmRNA and can secrete H 2 S. DL-PPG (CSE inhibitor) can suppress H 2 S production rate significantly (P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: HSC can express H 2 S synthetase/ CSE and substrates can form H 2 S with effect of this enzyme in the suitable reaction conditions.",

The aims of the present study were to analyze the correlations of IL-1A and IL-1B gene polymorphisms with the susceptibility of HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis. Methods: One hundred and forty eight patients with HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis (case group) and 127 asymptomatic HBsAg carriers with negative HBeAg and persistent normal serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (control group) were enrolled into this study. The genotypes of IL-1A-889C/T, L-1B-551C/T and IL-B1 +3953C/T loci were determined by PCR-RFLP. The correlations of genotypes, alleles and haplotypes of the three loci with the susceptibility of HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis were analyzed. Results: Univariate analyses indicated that genotype CC and allele T of IL-1A -889C/T locus were correlated with susceptibility of HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis (OR = 0.489, P = 0.047; OR = 2.046, P = 0.047), although the significances of their ORs were weakened when controlling age and gender (OR = 0.506, P = 0.065; OR = 1.796, P = 0.065).The other polymorphisms were insignificant. Multivariate analyses also showed that genotype CC and allele T of IL-1A -889C/T were independently correlated with HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis (OR = 0.430, P = 0.024; OR = 2.328, P = 0.024) and remained significant when controlling age and gender. Genotype CC and allele T of IL-1B +3953C/T were also independent factors associated with HBVrelated hepatic cirrhosis, but just nearly significant. Haplotype C-C-T only existed in HBsAg carrier group (P = 0.001), and haplotype T-C-T almost only existed in hepatic cirrhosis group (P = 0.033), but both were rare haplotypes (\\4%). Conclusion: The susceptibility of HBV-related hepatic cirrhosis was closely associated with IL-1A -889C/T locus, weakly associated with IL-1B +3953C/T locus but not associated with IL-1B -551C/T.",

            "text": "Results Background: Bacterial infections are frequently documented in cirrhotic patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Bacterial infection is independently associated with failure to control bleeding in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Bacterial infection may trigger the production of endotoxin, which in turn stimulates production proinflamatory citokin (IL-6) and in the next step stimulates endothelin and expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Subsequently, endothelin may stimulate stellate cells to contract and results in elevation of variceal pressure. Production of nitric oxide reduces platelet aggregation and primary hemostasis. As a result, the chain reaction induces variceal bleeding. This study aim to know the association between IL-6 and upper gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis patients. Methods: We performed A cross-sectional analytic study in liver cirrhosis patients, in sanglah general hospital Bali. We used a student t test to know the mean different of IL-6 between patient with or without upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Result: We collected 55 liver cirrhosis patients. Fourty one (74.5%) out of this was male and the rest was female. With range of age between 30 to 78 years old. Base on Child-pugh classification 56.4% with class C, only 5.5% with class A and the rest was class B. We found 12.7 and 65.4% out of patients with hepatic encephalopathy and ascites, consecutively. Thirty (54.5%) out of 55 patients with acute bleeding. We found significant higher mean level of IL-6 in liver cirrhosis patient with upper gastrointestinal bleeding compared with those without upper gastrointestinal bleeding (39.3 vs. 17.8 pg/mL; P = 0.02). Conclusions: Higher IL-6 level was associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Background: Gall bladder stones are considered a public health problem allover the world. Many factors have been proposed to explain the increased incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis as alcoholism, changes in total bile acid pool, decreased cholesterol secretion, hemolysis secondary to hypersplenism, increased oestrogen levels and changes in gall bladder and sphincter of odd motility, but the exact mechanism has not been yet elicited. Our objective was to study gall bladder contractility and prevalence of gallstones in patients with liver cirrhosis in addition to analysis of the effect of portal hypertension on these two parameters.",

At the same time, the risk of bleeding did not differ significantly between the groups (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.10-2.44; P = 0.38). Also, there was no difference between the groups with regard to in-hospital mortality (RR 2.00; 95% CI 0. 19-21.56 ; P = 0.57). In the EUS-guided ERCP group, EUS failed to detect common bile duct stones in 2 of 213 (0.9%) patients and a total of 143 ERCPs were avoided when EUS did not detect choledocholithiasis (67%). Conclusion: ERCP may be safely avoided in two-thirds of patients with common bile duct stones if EUS is performed first. Application of EUS in selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP significantly reduces a number of complications. Background/Aims: The size of the diverticula and location of the papilla in relation to periampullary duodenal diverticula (PADD) are variable. We aimed to determine if PADD subtypes are correlated with clinical severity in choledocholithiasis patients undergoing ERCP. Methods: Data of 120 patients who underwent CBD stone(s) extraction by ERCP and also presented PADD from January 2005 to December 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Analyses of variables including PADD types by location and size, CBD stone size, and incidence of SIRS or sepsis were performed. Results: Type 1 PADD patient group was associated with larger PADD (P \\ 0.001) and CBD stone size (P = 0.001), with greater WBC level (P = 0.015) and more frequent Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) (P = 0.009) incidence compared with type 2 or 3 PADD group. Large PADD group presented larger CBD stone size (P \\ 0.01); and showed tendency for increased SIRS incidence (P = 0.091). On multivariate analysis type 1 (OR: 18.70, CI: 1.43-243.43, P = 0.025) and larger PADD (OR: 7.15, CI: 2.179-23.46, P = 0.001) were significant contributors for CBD stones larger than 10 mm of diameter. Conclusion: Type 1 and large PADD patients are associated with larger CBD stones and showed a tendency for increased SIRS incidence. Therefore clinician must be aware about the possibility of a more complicated evolution in patients with these risk factors.",

Evalution for each subject included a complete history and physical examination and abdominal ultrasound. Gallstones were identified by the presence of strong intraluminal, gravity dependent echoes producing posterior acoustic shadowing. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 15.0 for Windows and E views 3.1 programme. A two tailed P value of \\0.05 was considered statistically significant between groups. Results: 5,895 patients with chronic hepatitis consisting of 3,033 (51.4%) males and 2,862 (48.6%). The prevalence of GS in the chronic hepatitis was 4.3% (5.9% for females, 2.7% for males). Patients were divided into four groups: group I: chronic hepatitis B (n = 1,122), group II: chronic hepatitis C (n = 1,336), group III: chronic hepatitis D (n = 24), and group IV: chronic hepatitis B + C (n = 174).

Methods: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) carried out during pregnancy (May 2003 to Sep 2009) were identified from our database. All procedures were carried out using conscious sedation and lead shielding. Results: During this period, 7 patients had 8 ERCP (8/586, 1.4%). The median gestation was 22.5 week (\\2-36); 2, 4 and 2 patients were in their first, second and third trimester, respectively. Indications included cholangitis (n = 2), obstructive jaundice (n = 5) and acute pancreatitis/obstructive jaundice (n = 1). Two patients had endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) before ERCP, which provided additional information. Fluoroscopy was used in four procedures (median 7 s, 2-20) and overall procedure time ranged from 5-15 min. Treatment consisted of endoscopic sphincterotomy (n = 4), stenting (n = 5) and balloon clearance (n = 3). One procedure related complication occurredinduction of labor. During the course of pregnancies, there were four nonprocedures related complications (1-acute cholecystitis, 1-HELLP syndrome resulting in spontaneous abortion and 2-stent migrations secondary to followup default). Five pregnancies had uncomplicated term deliveries while two required urgent caesarian sections (1-fetal distress and 1-cholangitis secondary to stent migration). All seven babies were well at birth with median APGAR scores of 9 and 10 at 5 and 10 min, respectively. One baby died of sudden infant death syndrome at 40 days old. Conclusion: ERCP is safe during pregnancies. Different strategies can be applied depending on situations and expertise of endoscopist. Most can be managed with biliary stenting and subsequent clearance can be made after deliveries. EUS has a complementary role. However caution should be taken to minimize radiation exposure and procedure time. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for cholelithiasis among adult residents in Shanghai. Methods: A cross-sectional survey with multiple-stage stratified cluster and random sampling was performed. All residents aged 15 and above were invited to participate in the survey, they came from four communities of Yangpu District and Pudong New District. Questionnaire, physical examination,serum lipid-profile,and 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test and ultrasonographic examination of liver and biliary system were undertaken.

However, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were risk factors for gallstone disease only in women. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the prevalence of cholelithiasis was only positively correlated to three risk factors,including advanced age, systolic blood pressure and fatty liver. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of cholelithiasis among adult residents in Shanghai. Advanced age, hypertension and fatty liver are closely associated with cholelithiasis.",

While mortality rate is certainly high, clinical characteristics, etiology, and precipitating factors may differ. Patients and Method: This was a cross-sectional study of patients with AoCLF (based on APASL Consensus Definition 2008) in one centre in Jakarta between 2004 and 2007. Clinical data were collected from the patients' medical record. Clinical endpoint was either the patient's death or survival. Data were analyzed descriptively using SPSS version 12. Results: There were 20 patients included in the study with a mean age of 50.3 \u00b1 15.45 years (27-83 years). Thirteen (65%) patients were men. The mean serum bilirubin level was 25.6 \u00b1 10.86 mg/dL and the mean MELD Score was 32.8 \u00b1 6.5. The etiology was hepatitis B virus infection in 14 (70%) patients, followed by hepatitis C virus in 5 (25%) patients and fatty liver in 1 (5%) patient. The most common precipitating factor was Chinese herbal or traditional medicines (25%), followed by hepatotoxic drugs (15%), infection (15%), and bleeding (10%). Other clinical manifestations were hepatorenal syndrome (70%). 18 patients (90%) were died. Conclusion: Cases of acute on chronic liver failure have recently been identified in Jakarta, Indonesia. Hepatitis B was the most common cause of chronic liver disease, while herbal or traditional medicine was the most common precipitating factor. Background: To report the clinical experience, biochemical findings, complications and maternal outcome in patients with acute liver failure in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Patients and Methods: Retrospective study over a period of 8 years (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) . The diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) was confirmed by liver biopsy and/or by clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings. Results: Twelve women were included in this study with a mean age of 28 \u00b1 3.2 years. 33.3% of cases were primigravid and all cases are singleton pregnancy. The mean gestational age was 36 \u00b1 1.3 weeks (range 34-38 weeks). The fetus was a male infant in 66% of cases. Nausea and vomiting were the most common symptoms (75%). The complications observed were mainly: acute liver failure in 100% cases, coagulation disorders in 100%, acute renal function damage in 100%, hypoglycemia in 83.3%, postpartum hemorrhage in 50%, coma in 33.3%, anuria in 25% and acute pancreatitis in 8.3%. During the hospital, three patients (25%) presented psychiatric symptom, manifested as visual hallucination, auditory hallucination, and delusion of persecution. There was one maternal death (8.3%) and 2 fetal deaths (16.7%). Discussion and Conclusion: Intensive care facilities and an early diagnosis are essential for the management of mothers with acute liver failure of AFLP. Reversible peripartum liver failure may be diagnosed and managed on the basis of clinical and laboratory criteria. With adequate support, the most patients may have full recovery of hepatic function.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of lamivudine in patients with severe acute hepatitis B. Methods: Eighty patients with severe acute hepatitis B were randomly divided into the lamivudine and control group. HBsAg, HBeAg seroconversion rates, serum HBV DNA negative rate, biochemical indicators, the incidence of liver failure and mortality of patients in two groups were compared. The influential factors on the mortality were studied by Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The improvement in serum TBiL, INR and HBV DNA levels of lamivudine group was significantly greater than that of control group. The mortality (7.5%, 3/40) of lamivudine group was significantly lower than that (25.0%, 10/40) of control group (P = 0.034).

Conclusion: Our results suggested that plasma from patients with ALF inhibit the growth and proliferation of HepG 2 cells in vitro. One of possible mechanisms by which plasma from patients with ALF inhibited the growth and proliferation of HepG 2 cells is by down-regulating the expressing of cyclinD1 and CDK4. Background: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to have multiple biological properties on liver, including mitogenic, antifibrotic, and cytoprotective activities. However, the absence of HGF receptor (c-met) in the rats with D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide (D-GalN/LPS) treatment leads to the fact that the high expression of HGF cannot activate signal transduction from cmet on survivor hepatocytes. Whether exogenous administration of c-met by gene transfer can promote liver regeneration and protects the rats from liver failure is not clear. Methods: We established the rat model with liver failure induced by D-GalN/ LPS, and constructed c-met expression plasmid with albumin promoter (p-albc-met), and then transfer it into the rat liver by hydrodynamic injection. c-met and PCNA was detected by immunohistochemical staining, and then apoptosis in hepatocytes were measured by flow cytometry. Results: Hydrodynamic delivery of p-alb-c-met induced the targeted expression of c-met in liver cells; markedly reduced hepatocytes apoptosis; promoted the proliferation of survivor hepatocytes; and elevated the survival rate among the rats with liver failure. Conclusions: These results qualify c-met as part of a physiologic, protective response of hepatocytes to injury and a promising gene therapy candidate for clinical applications aimed at preventing and treating viral and toxic liver failure. Acknowledgements: This work was supported by NSFC (No.30800973). Background: Our studies and those of many others have implicated fibrinogenlike protein 2 (fgl2) prothrombinase and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) mediated hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis in the development of fulminant viral hepatitis, a disease with a mortality rate of greater than 80% in cases lacking immediate organ transplantation. Methods: This study was designed to explore the efficacy of dual short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interferenceof fgl2 and TNFR1 in the treatment of murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) induced fulminant hepatitis in mice. Plasmids p-mfgl2shRNA and p-mTNFR1shRNA complimentary to the sequences for mfgl2 and mTNFR1 were constructed. Plasmids pEGFP-mfgl2 and pEGFP-mTNFR1 expressing mfgl2-EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) and mTNFR1-EGFP fusion proteins were also constructed for screening of the inhibitory effect of p-mfgl2shRNA and p-mTNFR1shRNA on mfgl2 and mTNFR1 expression. Results: Cotransfection of individual shRNA plasmids and pcDNA3.0-mfgl2 and pcDNA3.0-mTNFR1 expression constructs into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells significantly inhibited mfgl2 and mTNFR1 gene expression, as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and Western blot. In vivo hydrodynamic delivery of dual interference shRNA plasmids for mfgl2 and mTNFR1 significantly decreased mfgl2 and mTNFR1 expression and markedly ameliorated fibrin deposition, hepatocyte necrosis, and apoptosis and prolonged survival against fulminant viral hepatitis induced by MHV-3 in Balb/cJ mice compared to mfgl2 or TNFR1 single-gene interference. Conclusion: These results indicate that in vivo gene interference of more than one key target provides superior treatment efficacy compared to that with single-gene interference. Objective: miRNA are small noncoding RNA that negatively regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Malfunction of miRNA regulation is associated with a wide variety of human liver diseases, but the role in acute liver failure is unknown. In this study, the expression of miR-122 was studied in acute liver failure mice. Methods: D-galactosamine (D-GalN, 900 mg/kg) plus lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 lg/kg) were used to construct the acute liver failure model,total RNA was isolated from liver tissue and the expression of miR-122 was analyzed using quantitative Real-time RT-PCR and locked nucleic acid (LNA) -based DIGlabeled Northern -blot. Results: Twenty-four hours after induced, the mortality of mice reached over 80%. At the early stage liver tissue showed punctate bleeding, at the mediumterm showed hepatocyte apoptosis and late (7 h later) a large number of liver cell necrosis. miR-122 is highly expressed in normal mice liver (ct & 14), after administration it was up-regulated significantly at first hour (P = 0.013) and down-regulation after 3 h, the changes were sigificant at 7 h (ct & 15,P = 0.002) and it was verified by Northern-blot; ALT/AST levels increased obviously at 3 h and reached peak at 7 h, after 7 h due to a large number of liver cells injury showed a sharp decline; pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-a and IL-6 all were increased in serum and liver tissue (P \\ 0.05), the correlation analysis between miR-122 and TNF-a, ALT and AST found that there has good correlation (correlation coefficients were 0.674, 0.493, -0.505 and -0.399, respectively). Conclusion: Liver specific miR-122 can reflect liver injury and there were good correlation between miR-122 and TNF-a, IL-6, ALT and AST respectively. Our results suggest that miR-122 might be a novel biomarker for early evaluation of hepatocyte injury in liver failure in the future. Methods: Seven indicators: hepatic encephalopathy, creatinine, prothrombin activity, serum total bilirubin, infection, the dimension of liver, the maximum depth of ascites, were scored from 0 to 4 points according to their severity. We divided the 409 patients with ACLF in hepatitis B into two groups randomly. The first group was to establish the severity scoring system and define the cut-off-point, the second group was to test the severity scoring system. Results: For the first group (n = 309), there were significant differences (P \\ 0.000) of the total score between the living (n = 144) and the dead patients (n = 165). The area under ROC curve was 0.953. The cut-off-point was 9.5. The sensitivity was 0.97, the specificity was 0.82. The second group (n = 100) was divided: the one was C10 score, the other was B9 score. The mortality rate of the first group was 87.5%; the second was 2.3%. There were significant differences between the two groups (P \\ 0.000 Background: Glycyrrhizin, a biological active compound isolated from the licorice root, has been used for the treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis.",

We examined the effect of glycyrrhizin on acute hepatitis using an animal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Dgalactosamine (GalN)-induced mouse liver injury. Methods: Liver injury was induced by intravenously injecting a mixture of 25 ng LPS and 20 mg GalN to 6 week old male Balb/c mice. Hepatocelluar damage was evaluated by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and histological observation. Serum cytokines, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levels were measured by ELISA kits. Intraperitoneal administration of glycyrrhizin was performed 30 min before LPS/GalN treatment. Effects of glycyrrhizin on liver damage were examined 8 h after LPS /GalN treatment. Results: Glycyrrhizin dose-dependently inhibited serum ALT levels in response to LPS/GalN treatment. In addition, this compound significantly suppressed serum interleukin (IL)-18, HMGB1 levels and hepatic MMP-9 levels. Immunoreactivities for IL-18 and MMP-9 were predominantly detected in the pericentral inflammatory area containing many macrophages and neutrophils at 8 h after LPS/GalN treatment. Glycyrrhizin remarkably reduced the IL-18 and MMP-9-immunoreaction in liver tissues. Conclusion: The present results suggests that IL-18, HMGB1 and MMP-9 are involved in the development of LPS/GalN-induced mouse liver injury, and that a mechanism by which glycyrrhizin reduced ALT levels and hepatocelluar damage in response to LPS/GalN may be due to a down-regulation of these factors.",

Methods: Thirty-four patients with CHB and 54 patients with liver failure were enrolled.The latter composed of 31 chronic liver failure (CLF) and 23 acute liver failure (ACLF). Calculate the percent of the CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + T cell in the CD4 + T cells. Detect the number and position of NK cell in the liver tissue using immunohistochemistry. Results: The percentage of Treg cell in the CLF group was significantly lower than that in the ACLF group. Dynamic observation results showed that the amount of Treg cells inceased significantly at first, then decreased slowly during the development of the disease in the ACLF group. The amount of Treg cells kept on the lower lever in the CLF group. In the liver failure group, the percentage of Tregs declined with the development of the disease. The number of NK cells in the necrotic liver tissue of patients with liver failure was found more than that in the peri-necrotic tissue. Conclusion: The changed amount of Treg cells in peripheral blood was in connection with the development and prognosis of HBV infected disease. The position that NK cells infiltrated and number of cells related to the degree of liver tissue inflammation. Background/Aims: It is frequently important to identify the prognosis of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) patients as this will influence patient management and candidacy for liver transplantation. Therefore, a novel scoring system based on metabonomics combining with multivariate logistic regression was developed to predict the prognosis of FHF mouse model. Methods: BALB/c mice were used to construct FHF model. Parts of plasma were collected at 4, 5, and 6-h time points after treatment, respectively, and detected using gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC/ TOFMS). The acquired data were processed using partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The metabolic markers identified were used to construct a scoring system by multivariate regression analysis. Results: 28 mice of survival group and 28 of dead group were randomly selected and analyzed. PLS regression analysis showed that both the PLS models of 5 and 6 h after d-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide treatment demonstrated good performances. Loadings plot suggested that phosphate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (HB), urea, glucose and lactate concentrations in plasma had the highest weightings on the clustering differences at the three time points. By the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the death/survival index (DSI) was constructed based on relative concentrations of HB, urea and phosphate. It provided general accurate rate of prediction of 93.3% in the independent samples. Conclusions: The novel scoring system based on metabonomics combining with multivariate logistic regression is accurate in predicting the prognosis of FHF mouse model and may be referred in clinical practice as a more useful prognostic tool with other available information. The imaging studies included ultrasound, CECT, MRI were done whenever required. UGI endoscopy, ascitic fluid examination, blood and urine culture, arterial blood gas analysis and liver biopsy were done whenever indicated. ACLF was diagnosed by the Asia pacific Study of Liver Diseases (APASL) criteria. Result(s): One hundred and fifty patients were studied (median age 9 (2-16) years). Male to female ratio was 2.1:1.The distribution of diseases were ACLF 31 (20.7%), ALF 41 (27.3%), CLD 45(30%), acute viral hepatitis 30 (20%) AND Budd Chiari syndrome 3 (2%).The underlying CLD were AIH 13 (41.9%), WD 13 (41.9), HBV 2 (6.5%), ICC 1 (3.2%), and secondary biliary cirrhosis 2 (6.5%).The etiology of acute events were superadded HAV 13 (41.9%), HEV infection 3 (9.7%), HBV reactivation 1 (3.2%), AIH flare 3 (9.7%), cholangitis 1 (3.2%), UGI bleed 1 (3.2%) and undetermined 7 (22.6%). The manifestation of acute liver failure were ascites 31 (100%), encephalopathy 18 (58.1%), UGIB 8 (25.8%) and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis 9 (29%). The mortality was in 6 (19.4%) patients. The predictors of mortality were INR and SOFA score. The 6.5 was the best cut-off in predicting mortality with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 80%. Underlying CLD and acute events made no difference in mortality. Results: In non-severe hepatitis, liver histology showed severe acute hepatitis in 7 and chronic hepatitis in 9. In severe/fulminant patients, histology showed massive necrosis in 6, submassive necrosis in 1, severe acute hepatitis in 4, and chronic hepatitis in 3. Centrizonal necrosis with or without plasma cell accumulation was characteristic for acute onset AIH. On immunohistochemical staining for CK7, periportal PC and intralobular IM was less commonly present in severe/fulminant patients than in non-severe ones (P = 0.02).

However, its role in HBV related acute-on-chronic liver failure (AoCLF), a condition with severe liver damage and [70% fatality rate, remains unknown. We want to define whether Th17 cells contribute to worse prognosis of AoCLF and high incidence of bacteria and fungus infection. Subjects and Method: Fifty-nine patients with HBV related AoCLF (median age 45 years, 49 male) were recruited. Frequency of Th17 cells amongst peripheral blood was defined by CD4 and IL-17 (intracellular, eBioscience) staining (BD FACs Calibur) and Flow Jo software (Tristar, USA). The dynamics of Th17 cells was defined through measurement at admission, every two weeks in-hospital and 3-month after discharge amongst those without bacteria or fungus infection, and at time points of before, peak and infection controlled amongst those with infection. Results: Patients were divided into two groups: survival and non-survival (died, required OLT and gave up treatment). At admission, the frequency of Th17 in survivals (4.82 \u00b1 1.19%) was significantly lower than in non-survivals (6.21 \u00b1 2.15%, P = 0.003) and continuously decreased (2.61 \u00b1 1.16% 3-month after discharge). In contrast, it increased or remained unchanged in non-survivals. The differences in Th17 frequency between admission and week-2 correlated with the prognosis of AoCLF (R = 0.537, P = 0.002). The Th17 frequency at admission was correlated with the mortality ratio (R = 0.36, P = 0.005). Thirteen patients developed bacteria or fungus infection during the admission period, whose Th17 frequency at admission tended to be higher than those without infection (5.81 \u00b1 2.04 vs. 4.96 \u00b1 1.27%, P = 0.163). Conclusion: Overall, the frequency of Th17 cells is associated with the prognosis of AoCLF: the higher of the Th17 frequency, the worse of the outcome, indicating that depletion of Th17 cells may be of therapeutic value in management of AoCLF patients.

We assessed the prognostic indicators at predicting adverse outcome in our cohort of ALF patients over 16 years period. Methods: All cases of adult patients with ALF referred to national liver transplant program in Singapore from January 1992 to December 2008 were included in the study. Their baseline and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Adverse outcome was defined as mortality without transplant or undergone liver transplantation. Results: There were 101 patients with ALF between study periods, 71 (70.3%) Chinese, 51 (50.5%) male, age 43. 5 (13.4) years. Major aetiologies were hepatitis B, 45 (44.5%) and drug induced liver injury (DILI), 37 (36.6%). Traditional Chinese Medicine accounts for larger portion of DILI, (42%). 13 patients underwent liver transplantation and only 3 (23%) of them died post liver transplant. Among 88 patients without liver transplant, 74 (84%) died. Age and PT were the independent factors significantly related to adverse outcome (P = 0.009 and 0.012). AUROC (sensitivity, specificity) for age C37 years, PT C30 s, age and PT combined, MELD C33 and KCH criteria are 0.641 (78, 50%), 0.759 (77, 64%), 0.727 (60, 86%), 0.722 (59, 86%), 0.616 (52, 71%) respectively. Conclusion: Age and PT were significantly related to adverse outcome and higher AUROC. Aetiology of ALF in Singapore is different from the west and some part of Asia because of endemic of chronic hepatitis B and widely use of TCM in community. New prognostic model is needed for this group of patients. Background: Acute on chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF) is main reason of liver failure in China, and has a poor prognosis. We speculate Entecavir would play more great role in improving prognosis of ACHBLF, because of its potent inhabiting HBV replication and more lower drug resistant. The study's aim is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of entecavir treating patients with ACHBLF. Methods: 112 patients with ACHBLF were entered into a treatment group (ETV group) and a control group, according to whether combined treating with entecavir based on the comprehensive medical treatment, 55 cases and 57 cases, respectively. HBV DNA level, liver function and survival condition of the patients in different time-points were observed; factors possibly related to entecavir treatment efforts were also analyzed. Results: From week one to week eight, HBV DNA levels of patients in ETV group are lower than that in control group, and P \\ 0.01, at week 12, P = 0.03. Whether in ETV group nor in control group, HBV DNA levels of patients at week 12 are lower than that at baseline. Significant differences of cumulative survival rate of patients in two groups were observed after the third week of treatment. The cumulative mortality rate in the ETV group at week 12 was 43.9% while the rate in the control group was 64.9% (v 2 = 4.558, P = 0.033); Cox regression analysis showed the patients who were treated at an early stage and whose lower serum bilirubin level and young age, had a high survival rate and survival time (P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: Entecavir drops rapidly HBV DNA level of patients in ETV group and may improve the survival rate of patients with ACHBLF. Patient 0 s stage of the disease, serum bilirubin levels, and age at enrollment were major factors that may have affected entecavir therapeutic efficacy.",

However, the importance of innate immunity has been noted only recently. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TLRs on pathogenesis in ACLF patients. Methods: We isolated peripheral blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB, n = 20) or HBVassociated acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF, n = 40), compared with agematched normal controls (n = 20) and stimulated such cells in vitro with poly (I:C). TLR3 pathway gene of extracted RNA were detected using real-time PCR. Supernatant fluids from the cultures were analyzed for levels of six different pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, and TNF-a. Results: After in vitro challenge with poly (I:C), ACLF MoDC produced imbalanced relative levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF-a, were higer than CHB patients and controls. While, significantly lower amounts were found of IL-12p70, IL-1b, and IL-8 on MoDCs in ACLF. Conclusions: The results suggest impaired TLR3 pathway signaling in MoDC from patients with ACLF, resulting in secretion of selective pro-inflammatory cytokines integral to the inflammatory response that may be critical in the pathogenesis of ACLF. Background: Patients with subacute fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) and lateonset hepatic failure (LOHF) show relatively slow disease progression, although usually suffer serious liver damage. It sometimes seems that liver can lose its regenerative capability at the appearance of hepatic coma. No effective treatments have been established for such cases. We advocated that predicting the development of FHF and early intervention with intensive medical treatment for the underlying cause could improve the survival rate. The present study examined the efficacy of our treatment system. Method: Inclusion criteria of the present study were as follows: acute hepatitis patients admitted to our hospital from 2002 to 2008, prothrombin time below 60% of normal, and absence of hepatic coma on admission. Prediction of FHF was determined based on a previously reported formula (Yoshiba M, J Gastro 2002) . Treatment for underlying cause consisted mainly of immunosuppressive therapy and/or antiviral therapy. Patients were also given artificial liver support immediately after the appearance of hepatic coma; it comprised plasma exchange in combination with hemodiafiltration. Results: The inclusion criteria were met by 74 patients with causes of hepatitis listed as HAV (3), HBV (11), HBV carrier (23) Aims: Increasing evidence suggests the contribution of natural killer (NK) cells to pathogenesis of human hepatitis, but the detailed mechanisms have yet to be clearly elucidated. Methods: In this study, injection of polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and D-galactosamine (D-GalN) was used to establish a novel murine fulminant hepatitis model. We then examined the liver injury by determining serum transaminase ALT levels and liver pathologic changes. The FACS analysis provided us with the precise information about lymphocyte phenotype, activation and cytokine production. Hepatic NK cells and Kupffer cells were isolated by positive magnetic cell sorting (MACS) and were co-cultured with poly I:C stimulation. We used ELISA and real time PCR to examine cytokine levels.",

In this study, we investigate protective effects of CGX on Con A-induced liver injury and its underlying mechanisms. CGX was administered once daily during 6 days and 3 h before Con A injection (15 mg/kg, iv). After 6 and 20 h of Con A injection, determination of AST, AST, and organ weight, mRNA expression analysis and histological examination were performed. Spleen weight was increased, whereas thymus weight was decreased by Con A injection. CGX ameliorated splenomegaly. CGX prevented the increase of AST and ALT in serum, In histopathological examination, necrosis area of liver tissue was significantly reduced and DNA fragment was also decreased by CGX pretreatment. MDA, final product of lipid peroxidation in liver tissues increased by fivefold compared to normal by Con A injection. But CGX treatment decreased MDA content in liver significantly in a dose dependent manner.

Expression of ASPP2 was down-regulated by short hairpin RNA, then morphology and matasasis potential of tumor cells were further analysed. Results: The expression of ASPP2 was correlated with metastasis and recurrence in HCC patients (63.0 vs. 28.6%, P = 0.037). Down-regulation of ASPP2 made cells undergoing morphological changes from a classic epithelial morphology to a spindle-like shape. Down-regulation of ASPP2 also enhanced cell adhesion, migration and invasion through Matrigel in vitro, promoted lung metastasis in HCC xenografts in nude mice. Further studies revealed that down-regulation of ASPP2 activated the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src and then promoted b-catenin translocating from cytomembrane to cytoplasm and nucleus. Conclusion: Our results suggest down-regulation of ASPP2 promotes EMT and metastatic progression of HCC .These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms leading to matastasis of HCC and may have potential therapeutic applications. Background: The ankyrin-repeat-, SH3-domain-and proline-rich-region-containing protein (ASPP) family of proteins regulates apoptosis through interaction with p53 and its family members. This study evaluates the epigenetic regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and explores the effects of down-regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2 on the development of HCC. Methods: HCC cell lines and tissues from HCC patients were used to examine the expression and methylation of ASPP1 and ASPP2. Results: The expression of ASPP1 and ASPP2 was diminished in HCC cells by epigenetic silence owing to hypermethylation of ASPP1 and ASPP2 promoters. Analyses of 51 paired HCC and surrounding non-tumor tissues revealed that methylation of ASPP1 and ASPP2 was associated with the decreased expression of ASPP1 and ASPP2 in tumor tissues and the early development of HCC. Moreover, ASPP2 became methylated upon HBV x protein (HBx) expression. Down-regulation of ASPP1 and ASPP2 promoted the growth of HCC cells in soft agar and in nude mice, and decreased the sensitivity of HCC cells to apoptotic stimuli. Objective: The abnormal expression of many genes involved in the formation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic and epigenetic changes regulate the expression of cancer-related genes, which is the core biological processes in HCC. We investigated the dynamic expression and alteration of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) and its pathological features in hepotacellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Hepatomas model was induced with 2-FAA on male SD rats for investigating dynamic changes of HIF-1a. Liver specimen from HCC patients were collected by self-control method. The expression, cellular distribution, and pathological features of HIF-1awere analyzed by immohistochemistry. Results: Rat hepatocytes from granule-like degeneration to atypical hyperplasia and HCC development, and the progressing increasing of the levels of hepatic HIF-1a and HIF-1amRNA expression during the course. The levels of HIF-1a in hepatoma tissues and sera were significantly higher than those in normal and degeneration ones. There was positive relationship of HIF-1a levels between them in hepatoma tissues and sera (P \\ 0.05). The positive HIF-1a was brown and granule-like, mainly presented in cytoplasm and few in nucleus. Background: Deregulation of EGFR and ERBB2 signaling is seen in many human cancers and a wealth of clinical and experimental data indicate the etiological role of these events in cancer pathogenesis. Target therapies against the deregulation of EGFR and ERBB2 signaling exert effects on many human cancers, while there are modest effect on treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent evidence that ERBB3 is responsible for tumor resistance to therapeutic agents targeting EGFR or ERBB2 in lung cancer and breast cancer highlighted its critical role in the oncogenic signaling of EGFR family. However, roles of ERBB3-mediated signaling in HCC carcinogenesis remain totally unclear. Methods: Expression and phosphorylation of ERBB3 was assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot assays. Gene number was determined using fluorescence in-situ-hybridization. The roles of EGEF, ERBB2, and neuregulin in phosphorylation of ERBB3 were assayed via transfection with small-interference RNAs to silence their expression. The effects of ERBB3 on cell proliferation, invasion and tumorigenesis were assayed in vitro and in vivo. Results: We developed a high efficiency method to isolate HCC deregulated genes and identified ERBB3 as an upregulated gene in HCC. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed up-regulation of ERBB3 in about 70% of HCC tissues.",

            "text": "Histone Deacetylases (HDACs) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( Background: Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes occurs within a chromatin setting, and is strongly influenced by the post-translational modification of histones, the building blocks of chromatin, such as methylation, phosphorylation and acetylation. Within these modifications, acetylation plays an important role. Steady-state levels of acetylation of the core histones result from the balance between the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDACs. In general, increased levels of histone acetylation is associated with increased transcriptional activity, whereas decreased levels of acetylation is associated with repression of gene expression. HDACs associate with a number of tumor-suppressor genes, the transcription of which was suppressed through the recruitment of HDACs, thus the cancer cells are unable to undergo differentiation, leading to excessive proliferation. The link between HDACs and tumor has been reported in acute promyelocytic leukaemia originally. HCC is one of the most frequent solid tumors occurring worldwide. At present, there are some articles revealed that HDACs is also related with HCC. Methods: miRNA expression in normal and HCC cell lines and tissues was evaluated using qPCR array and hybridization based microRNA microarray. Angiogenesis and invasion across a matrigel layer were quantitated using commercial assays. Promoter methylation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, 2, 3, 9 mRNA and mature miRNA expression was quantitated by real-time PCR analysis. Results: Genome-wide qPCR array and microarray expression profiling identified a significant silencing of miR-125b in HCC tissues and cells, including tumor endothelial cells (T-ECs). The 5'-promoter region of miR-125b was noted to be embedded within a CpG island. The expression of miR-125b was considerably increased after 5-aza-dCyd treatment in T-ECs and PLC/PRF-5 HCC cells, suggesting that the level of miR-125b could be epigenetically modulated. Methylation-specific PCR detected that miR-125b promoter was hypermethylated in T-ECs as well as PLC/PRF-5 cells. Angiogenesis and cell invasion were significantly decreased by miR-125b precursor introduction in T-ECs and PLC/PRF-5 HCC cells. Bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assays identified placenta growth factor (PlGF), another angiogenic factor of VEGF family, as a direct target of miR-125b. Whereas PIGF expression in T-ECs and PLC/PRF-5 cells was high relative to N-ECs and N-Heps, overexpression of miR-125b resulted in a significant reduction of PIGF level. Furthermore, modulation of miR-125b also altered expression of MMP-2 and 9, mediators involved in enzymatic degradation of extracellular matrix. Conclusions: The discovery that epigenetic inhibition of miR-125b plays a significant role in the initiation of angiogenesis and invasive phenotype through PIGF provides the basis for an exciting field in which the epigenomic miRNAs of HCC endothelial cells may be manipulated with potential therapeutic benefits.",

The expression of Foxp3 in Tregs is due to Foxp3 promoter demethylation. In the previous works, we validated that the Foxp3 also can be expressed by hepatoma cell lines and involved in the Foxp3 mediated immune-suppression in tumor immune microenvironment. Whether the mechanism of Foxp3 expression in hepatoma cell lines is related to the Foxp3 promoter demethylation is very important for clarifying the roles of Foxp3 in hepatoma cell lines. Methods: 10 hepatoma cell lines Huh7, Hep3B, HepG2, et. al) Emerging evidence implied that miRNAs play critical roles in diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and development of diseases including cancer. To explore the effects of miRNAs on the pathophysiology of human liver cancer, we examined the expression patterns of some miRNAs previously reported as aberrantly expressed in clinical samples in different liver cancer cell lines. We further analyzed one miRNA with expression depletion for its potential role in cancer development and metastasis. Methods: Expression of five miRNAs was examined by real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction in seven human liver cancer cell lines. Functional analysis on miRNA was performed using gain-of-function approach in which the selected miRNA was restored for cell proliferation, viability, and migration/invasion assays. Result: Five miRNAs were differentially expressed among seven cell lines with one exception, miR-224, which expressed at extremely low level in 4 out of 7 cell lines. Functional assays based on both Huh-7 (hepatocellular origin) and Sk-Hep-1 (endothelial origin) cells that were transfected with pre-miR-224 indicated that cell migration and invasion were significantly intensified whereas cell proliferation and viability remained unaffected. Conclusion: The expression patterns of microRNA differ in each liver cancer cell line studied. Functional assays indicated that miR-224 may contribute to the metastasis of liver cancer by enhancing the cell migration/invasion. Background: Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) or its C-terminally truncated mutant (ctHBx) has been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, TGF-beta signaling is considered to be crucial in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby HBx/ ctHBx mediates TGF-beta signaling pathway and contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis are yet to be clarified. Methods: Using the subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) method, we identified HCC-related genes that were differentially expressed in HCC containing a mutant form of beta-catenin and functional ctHBx. Among them, BAMBI was identified and functionally analyzed to elucidate its role in HBxrelated hepatocarcinogenesis.",

The overexpression of YAP is frequently observed in several types of cancer, such as prostate, ovarian, and liver. Ectopic expression of YAP promotes cell proliferation, epithelical-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and anchorage-independent growth, signs of oncogenic potential. Given the important role of YAP in cancer development, we would like to investigate the regulatory mechanism of YAP expression in HCC. In this study, the miRNA regulation of YAP was investigated. From the miRNA profiling data, we found that miR-375 was significantly down-regulated in HCC patients, and bioinformatic algorithm predicted that YAP is a potential target of miR-375. To confirm the functional interaction between miR-375 and YAP, we performed a luciferase reporter assay, and the results showed that miR-375 significantly repressed the expression of luciferase carrying the 3'-untranslated region of YAP and reduced the endogenous protein level of YAP in HCC cell lines. Further investigation showed that the downstream target of YAP, such as CTGF, was also suppressed upon the etopic expression of miR-375, suggesting miR-375 is involved in regulation of Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Moreover, in vitro functional assay showed that ectopic expression of miR-375 slowed down the invasiveness and proliferation of HCC cells. Taken together, our data suggested that aberrant expression of miR-375 can contribute to HCC growth, and expression of YAP is regulated in part by a specific miRNA, leading to decreased tumor cell motility and proliferation.",

            "text": "Background: As a pro-inflammatory factor, the role of CXCL10 in chronic HBV infection disease progression and in persistent inflammation related tumorigenesis has been emphasized recently. A polymorphism in the promoter of CXCL10 gene, G-201A, is reported to alter the binding affinity of nuclear protein and regulate CXCL10 expression. Therefore, an increased CXCL10 activity is thought to be associated with liver tissue damage and cirrhosis. But also as an angiostatic factor, its role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis is inconsistent and unclear. We studied the association of G-201A polymorphism with disease progression related to HBV infection and the impact of CXCL10 on cell proliferation. Results: Five types of pre-S region deletions were found: pre-S1 start codon inframe deletion; pre-S1 deletion involving S promoter; pre-S2 start codon mutation; pre-S2 in-frame deletion and pre-S2 in-frame deletion with pre-S2 start codon mutation. The overall prevalence of S promoter deletion mutant was 14.6% (6/41) but none in non-tumor tissues. Immunocytofluorescence showed that unlike wild type LHBS's whole cell diffusion, the S promoter deletion LHBS mutant showed an aggregated cytoplasmic pattern, and was found mainly accumulated in endoplasmic reticulum. Accordantly, higher level of GRP 78 mRNA was detected in exogenous mutant LHBS expressing hepG2 cells in vitro. Conclusion: HBV S promoter deletion was found solely existed in HCC tumor tissue. Mutations which affect of L/M/S envelope protein ratio were found more frequently in tumor tissues. The altered ratio and changed secretion pattern of surface proteins, the aggregation of mutant large surface proteins in ER and consequent UPR activation might possibly involve in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Percutaneous liver Bx was histologically evaluated for inflammation and fibrosis. The extent of COX-2 and CD34 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and graded according to the number of hepatocytes expressing high intensity of COX-2. Results: HBV and HCV patients with higher fibrosis stage (0-4) presented with raised ALT and AST, however patients with fibrosis stage of 5 and 6 demonstrated fall in ALT and AST. The liver Bx from HCV patients showed higher HAI and fibrosis scores as compared to HBV group. The percentage of steatosis was higher in HCV (P \\ 0.05) as compared to HBV patients. COX-2 expression was confined to hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium and was not detected in vascular endothelium or inflammatory cells. The extent of COX-2 expression was greater in HCV infected liver Bx (5.13 \u00b1 1.11) than in hepatitis B (3.68 \u00b1 0.92). HCC infected liver Bx showed greatest COX-2 expression (11.68 \u00b1 6.32) and the expression of COX-2 was even greater in adjacent non-tumorous portion (25.61 \u00b1 6.32). The expression of COX-2 was significantly correlated with the fibrotic stage both in HBV [Low (0-2) vs. High (3-6) fibrosis, 2.45 \u00b1 0.41vs. 6.92 \u00b1 3.12], and HCV [Low (0-2) vs. High (3-6) fibrosis, 5.13 \u00b1 1.11vs. 10.17 \u00b1 5.76 ] and also the HAI. There was positive correlation between the CD34 and COX-2 expression in Bx obtained from HBV, HCV and HCC patients. Conclusion: Overexpressed COX-2 expression is associated with high levels of necroinflammation, regeneration activity and disease progression of liver disease. Background: The poor prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after surgical resection is due to recurrence and intrahepatic metastasis (IM). For study, HCC intrahepatic metastasis model using orthotropic implantation (OTI) of human HCC cell lines into mice liver has been established but it is time consuming. Aims: To compare the efficacies between OTI and of a direct injection method (DI) in SCID mice to induce IM. Methods: Ten mice were used in either the OTI or DI group. In the OTI method, approximately 1 9 10 7 cells in 0.2-mL culture medium were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the SCID mice, which were then observed daily for signs of tumor enlargement. Once the subcutaneous tumor reached 1-1.5 cm in diameter, it was removed, cut into 1-2 mm cubes, and then implanted into the left liver lobe. As for the DI method, HepG2 cells (1, 5, 10, 20 and 30 9 10 4 , respectively) were directly injected into the middle lobe of mouse liver. Two mice were scarified in each month and their livers taken out for macroscopic and microscopic observations (100 sequential sections, 4 lm, were cut and stained with H&E) to confirm IM in either the left and right lobe. Results: In the DI method using 30 9 10 4 cells, IM occurred in both the left and right lobes in two months. However, the OTI model required 4 months to derive the same severity of IM as in the DI method. Conclusions: The DI method was straightforward and saved much time when compared with the OTI model that was rather time consuming. Also, OTI was not suitable for studying specific HCC cell line with over-expression of some target genes because a lot of uncontrolled molecular changes might had occurred during this long-term and complicated process. This DI model will be especially useful in the experimental design for gene therapy to prevent IM using various genetic modified HCC cell lines. Methods: Small interfering RNA targeting HBV X (x-siRNA) were synthesized. The level of HBV X mRNA was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The nude mice model bearing human hepatoma xenograft was established by subcutaneous inoculating HepG2-GFP and HepG2-GFP /HBx cells. These mices were treated with x-siRNA (25 mg/g), 5-Aza-dC (1.5 mg/g) or combination of both. The growth of the hepatoma xenograft was observed. The methylation of p16 gene promoter was determined by methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), level of p16 protein was detected by Western blot.",

The experiment in hepatoma xenograft nude model showed that the growth of tumors in HepG2/GFP-HBx group was faster than HepG2/GFP group while slow growth was observed in X-siRNA treatment group or 5-Aza-dC treatment group (P \\ 0.05). MSP analysis showed that p16 gene methylation was observed in the tumor originating from HepG2/GFP-HBx, while no methylation was observed in thses tumor originating from HepG2/GFP. However,p16 methylation reduced in the tumors treated with x-siRNA or 5-Aza-dC. Western blot analysis showed that the level of p16 protein in HepG2/GFP-HBx group decreased, whie increased p16 protein was observed in these tumor treated with X-siRNA and 5-Aza-dC. Conclusions: HBV X promotes the growth of hepatoma cells in vivo by inducing p16 gene methylation and suppressing p16 protein expression. Specific siRNA targeting HBV X and methylation inhibitor can inhibit the growth of hepatoma cells via reversing p16 gene methylation and up-regulating p16 protein. Background: The present study explored the influence of AFP in alleviating the apoptosis was induced and the expression of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), it is the stromal cell derived factor-1 receptor was regulated by ATRA in hepatoma cells.

Results: The co-location of AFP with RAR-b in cytochylema; Co-IP indicated that AFP has a property to interact with RAR-b in Bel 7402 or in HepG2 cells, and the same effect also generated after HLE cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-afp for 36 hours; The expression of CXCR4 was repressed concomitant with blockdown the expression of AFP by siRNA in Bel 7402 or in HepG2 cells, but the expression of CXCR4 was enhanced while HLE cells was transfected with pcDNA3.1-afp, and co-treatment with Ly294002, the expression of CXCR4 was partial inhibited. Analyzed by ChIP-PCR indicated that AFP was able to impeded RAR-b binding to the promoter of CXCR4, treated with ATRA (160 lmol/L) for 12 h, the coupling of RAR-b with CXCR4 promoter was increased, and Western blotting analyzed showed that the expression of AFP was suppressed.",

Recently, another mechanism of intercellular communication has been proposed that involves Tunneling Nanotubules (TNTs), which contain Factin as a prominent cytoskeleton component. In contrast to gap junctions that permit direct passage of small molecules between cells, TNTs allow for exchange of larger materials, including organells, nutrients and cytoplasmic constituents. Association of such bridges with malignant transformation in vitro and their potential for supporting cancerous proliferation in vivo has been proposed. An in vitro study was conducted on HepG-2 cells to elucidate TNTs as novel conduits for intercellular communication and promising target for anti-cancer therapy using gallic acid (GA) as anticancer agent. Methods: Cell proliferation after graded concentrations of GA treatment was measured by MTT assay. Cell membranes were fluorescently labeled with lipophilic stain Vybrant \u00d2 Dii (red) and Dio (green), whereas F-actin was labeled with Oregon green and observed under laser confocal scanning microscope and fluorescent microscope. Study was also conducted to observe intercellular communication between normal liver cells (Chang) and malignant HepG-2. Number of cytonemic structures, length and breadth of TNTs in HepG-2 were measured with computer assisted program. Results: GA significantly reduced the cellular proliferation and also inhibited polymerization of F-actin that eventually decreased the cellular protrusions, cytonemic and TNT like structures in concentration dependant manner. Cell shape was also distorted with significant decrease in its size.",

Our data showed that knocking down AR protein level leads to increase in apoptosis induced by 5-Fu in HepG2 cells. Presumably, this increased apoptosis might be partially associated with inhibition of Caspase-12 expression by silencing human androgen receptor expression. Aims: Beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) is an autoantigen in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We have found that beta2-GPI could specifically binded to HBsAg and hepatocellular carcinoma cell membrane. This study determined the effect of beta2-GPI on the HCC in vitro. Methods: Hepatocellular carcinoma cells, SMMC-7721, exposed to the following different treatments. Group one: cells transfected with beta2-GPI; group two: cells transfected with HBsAg; group three: cells cotransfected with beta2-GPI and HBsAg; group four: cells transfected with control vector; group five: normal control cells. NF-jB activation was measured by non-radioactive EMSA and immunofluorescence. Whether IjB kinase inhibitor (BAY11-7082) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Piceatannol) played the role by analyzing the IjB activation by non-radioactive EMSA. Phosphorylated amino acids and residues on the IjBa were detected by co-immunoprecipitation assay followed by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Results: Group one and group two induced the activation of NF-jB with the relative NF-jB DNA binding activity of 55.84 and 50.25, respectively. However, higher relative NF-jB DNA binding activity was observed in the group three (75.5). BAY11-7082 decreased NF-jB activation more obviously than Piceatannol in a time dependent manner. Introduction: Injuries to the liver in the form of viral assault, ethanol or drugs can turn on the production of certain growth factors and mitogens for liver regeneration, which in turn will cause activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to the activation of various signaling events. Ethanol is the most common culpable chemical agent thought to play the role of a carcinogen. Ethanol induced liver injury and alteration in growth factor profiles and the consequent deregulation in signaling can act as a driving force for uncontrolled proliferation of the hepatocytes, leading to tumor growth. In present study we evaluated the hypothesis that chronic EtOH exposure activates Wnt b-catenin signaling in liver Aims: To study the differential mRNA expression profile of b-catenin in alcoholic liver cirrhosis and ethanol induced HCC. Methods: Quantitative Real time PCR analysis was done for b-catenin using bactin as endogenious control. Total RNA extracted from liver tissue of ethanol related cirrhosis (n = 10), HCC (n = 5) and healthy liver (n = 5). Immunohistochemistry was done for b-catenin. that its down-regulation is associated with cell migration, invasion and intrahepatic metastasis. Very few is known on the pathways and transcription factors that regulate miR-122 expression in the liver. The aim of this work was to isolate and study the promoter region of the HCC related miR122. Methods: The putative intergenic pre-miR-122 promoter region (-5000/ +1000 bp) has been studied using the UCSC, motif.genome.jp, dragon and genomatix resources. Expression of miR-122 mature miRNA was evaluated by a two step stem-loop real-time RT-PCR using the U38b small RNA as endogenous control. Recruitment of transcription factors on putative pre-miRNA promoters vivo has been assessed by ChIP. DNA methylation has been studied by bisulfite treatment followed by methylation sensitive PCR and direct sequencing.",

Low miR-122 tumors were less differentiated and more often multinodular. In silico analysis of the putative miR122 promoter revealed the presence of two conserved CpG islands. CpG island 1 (proximal to the TSS) is methylated in vivo in HepG2 cells. Accordingly, the demethylating agent azacytidine increases miRNA-122 expression but has no effect on the expression of other HCC deregulated miRNAs (miR-199, -21 and -221 There were different significances between the five proapoptotic proteins with Bcl-2 respectively (all P \\ 0.01). All the expression intensities of proapoptotic proteins in our study were significantly higher than that of Bcl-2. Moreover, the former indexs were mainly found at the grade (+) or (++), among which Bax expression was the highest and its positive rate was 88.57% (31/35 cases). While the latter was mainly found at the grade (+), and its positive rate was only 47.36% (9/19 cases). The expression rates of Cyto-c in low, medium and high PHC differentiation were 25.00% (1/4 cases), 91.18% (31/34 cases) and 100% (7/7 cases), respectively. The expression intensity was increased with the improvement of tumor cells differentiation. Conclusions: It is suggested that both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways are involved in the regulation of apoptosis in PHC. In addition, the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis according to AASLD guideline was 89.6% in pathologically cirrhotic patients and 92% in pathologically non-cirrhotic patients. No significant difference of sensitivity exists between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic groups (either imaging or pathologic cirrhosis). Further analysis also indicated that large tumors ([2 cm) exhibited a significantly higher sensitivity of HCC diagnosis than small tumors C2 cm) (P \\ 0.001) Conclusions: According to AASLD guideline, we can get a high sensitivity of HCC diagnosis for tumors larger than 2 cm. Diagnostic sensitivity for HCC less than 2 cm was still low, which may need further biopsy. The AASLD guideline can also be applied on non-cirrhotic patients.",

Methods: The distributions of the allelic, genotype and haplotypes at IL-10 rs1800896(-1082G/A)/rs1800871(-819T/C)/rs1800872(-592A/C) and ALDH2 rs4646778/rs671 were detected by PCR and oligonucleotide microarray. The sample population included 70 HCC patients, 34 patients with liver cirrhosis, 50 patients infected with hepatitis B virus and 52 healthy volunteers. Results: No significant difference was found in frequencies of genotypes and haplotypes of the three positions of IL-10 and two positions of ALDH2. The C allele frequency at ALDH2 rs4646778 (A/C) position was higher in HCC patients than in controls (79.5 vs. 65.4%, P = 0.037, OR = 2.051, 95% CI:1.037-4.058). Between HCC patients with different Child-Pugh liver function grades, IL-10-819 TT genotype frequency was higher in grade B patients than that in grade A patients (66.7 vs. 44.4%, P = 0.048). Among all the patients with liver diseases, GG genotype frequency, as well as G allele frequency at ALDH2rs671A/G position were lower in HBeAg-positive individuals than that in HBeAg-negative individuals.(GG: 65.8 vs. 85.1%, P = 0.033; G: 81.6 vs. 92.6%, P = 0.027).",

Thirty-three patients underwent ballooning, stenting and/or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). During the mean follow-up period of 109.6 months, 17 patients developed HCC. Among them, BCS and HCC were diagnosed simultaneously in three patients. The incidence of HCC in patients with BCS was 2.9%/year. No significant difference was observed between patients who developed HCC and those who did not, except for the pressure gradient between the right atrium and IVC. Conclusion: The annual incidence of HCC in patients with BCS (2.9%/year) was similar to the incidence in patients with other etiologic cirrhosis (2.5%/ year) in Korea. The pressure gradient between the right atrium and IVC was a predictor of HCC development. Background: Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is a proinflammatory cytokine with multiple biological effects and may play essential roles in inflammationlinked tumor development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between TNF-a gene polymorphisms and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma HCC in Chinese population. Methods: The study population consisted of 101 HCC patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and 166 health controls,all were Chinese Han ethnic. TNF-a polymorphisms-1031(T/C), -863(C/A), -857(C/T), -851(C/T), and -308(G/A) were genotyped by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. Allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls were compared using the chi-square (v 2 ) test with the statistical software SAS 8.0. Association testing for the haplotypes as well as the measure of linkage disequilibrium (D') between all pairs of SNPs was performed using the Haploview v3.1 software. Results: Of the five TNF-a polymorphisms investigated in our study, -1031(T/C), -863(C/A), -851(C/T), and -308(G/A) did not show correlation with HCC. However, -857(C/T) was found to be significantly associated with the increased risk of HCC. TNF-a-857T allele was more frequent in HCC patients than in control (P = 0.0093; odds ratios, 0.51; 95% confidence intervals, 0.30-0.85). High linkage disequilibrium was detected between -863C/A and -1031T/C (P \\ 0.001, D 0 = 1.0). Five haplotypes were found to occur in more than 1% of the study population. However, no significant associations between any of the estimated haplotypes and HCC were found. In addition, a literature review revealed that the distribution of the TNF-a genetic polymorphisms among populations with different ethnic origins varied significantly. Conclusions: Our data imply that genetic variations in TNF-a gene may confer different susceptibilities to the development of HBV-related HCC. Carriage of the -857T allele is a significant predictor of HCC development, and therefore it may be used as a biomarker for one's susceptibility to HCC. Result: Without inhibiting all the tested tumor cell proliferation at the concentration between 0 and 20 lg/mL, pazopanib significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis of HCCLM3 and PLC/PRF/ 5 but not HepG2 at the concentration of 20 lg/mL. In vivo tumor growth was significantly inhibited by pazopanib at the dosage of 40 mg/(kg day) in all the 3 xenograft models. Intratumoral CD31-positive microvessel density (MVD) decreased in pazopanib treated tumors, whereas the density of a-SMA-positive pericytes increased. Intratumoral blood perfusion detected by CEUS was significantly reduced by pazopanib treatment, peak intensity is significantly impaired in the treated tumors before the time when the treatment efficacy on tumor size can be observed. Mean transit time of the contrast media in the hotspot area of the tumors is reversely correlated with intratumoral microvessel density (r = -0.661, P = 0.001). Conclusion: These preclinical results indicate that the therapeutic effects of pazopanib in HCC xenografts might be at least partially attributed to its antiangiogenic effect, and this effect could be evaluated by quantitative CEUS. Method: 43 patients with HCC who were undergone RFA treatment were analyzed retrospectively. S-500 RF Generator, (Medsphere Co., Ltd) equipment was used for the treatment. Mean hospital stay was 3 days. Result: Number of lesions were 1.3 \u00b1 3 SD, with the diameter of 2.6 cm \u00b1 2.7 SD. No mortality was observed so far. Only two patients had a complication of skin burn. While the total HCC recurrence was observed in 11 patients (25.5%), the local recurrence was observed in 4 (9.3%). Six patients had previous treatments, which were TACE (n = 4) or liver resection (n = 2) respectively. Not much data was available about viral status of patients. 16 patients had their viral markers checked, out of which 8 (50%) patients had positive HBsAg, 7 (43.7%) were positive for HCV, while one patient (6.3%) had both HCV and HBV. Conclusion: Though RFA was introduced almost 15 months ago, the number of patients treated using this procedure is quite modest (2.8% of HCC patients). Many patients are still left with no treatment. According to our results RFA is a safe procedure with minimal complications. Besides technical aspects, the fact that RFA is not covered by insurance in our country is holding back the progress of the field. Background/Aims: Hepatocellular carcioma (HCC) is sometimes accompanied with an involvement of inferior vena cava(IVC). Aggressive surgical approaches for these patients has been reported to be useful. We herein investigate 8 operated cases of HCC with involvements of IVC (7 cases with tumor thrombus, one with the direct invasion). Patients and operations: The profiles of eight cases are listed on Table 1 . In all cases, hepatic resections were carried out after dissections of hepatic artery and the first branch of the portal vein on the tumor-side. Then thrombectomy and resection of invaded wall of IVC were done. Results: Major hepatic resections were performed in all cases. THVE was done during the tumor thrombectomy in five cases. The average time of THVE was 10.6 min, so no extracorporeal circulation system (ECS) was needed. The average of operative hemorrhage was 2,234.4 ml and 3 patients did not require an allogeneic transfusion by using auto-transfusion. There was neither operative death nor hospitalization death, and no major operative complication occurred. The mean survival time is 28.4 months, and 3-year survival rare was 65.6%. Two cases with tumor recurrence which are well controlled by hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy are still alive (Table 2) . Conclusion: The method that hepatic resections are carried out before the treatment for the lesions of IVC is useful. Because the treatment for IVC is done safely under good visual field, no severe complications due to the liberation of tumor thrombi occurred, not to use ECS is economical and the prognosis better. Cox-regressional hazard model, Child-Pugh class were the independent prognostic factors affecting poor survival (RR = 6.8, P = 0.002). Preoperative TACE did not affect survival outcome. Thirty-four (85%) patients recurred. Of these 32 patients recurred within 2 postoperative years. Overall 1-, 3-and 5-year disease-free survival rate were 31.2, 14.2, and 8.5% respectively. On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class was significantly related to poor disease-free survival. On Cox-regressional hazard model, Child-Pugh class were the independent prognostic factors affecting poor survival (RR = 4.0, P = 0.03). Only four patients survived without recurrences. Preoperative TACE did not affect survival or disease-free survival outcome.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Survival outcome of hepatic resection was better than non-surgical management. Although most patients experienced recurrences, a few patients had chance to cure after hepatic resection. [4 log(10) copies/ml at the time of resection were associated with HCC recurrence, and besides these variables, poorly differentiated tumor, intrahepatic micrometastasis, and HBeAg seropositivity at resection were also associated with poorer postoperative survival. On multivariate analysis, tumor size [5 cm (P = 0.050), Child-Pugh class B (P = 0.001), vascular invasion (P = 0.042), and sustained low viremia [HBV DNA[ 4 log(10) copies/ml] (P = 0.003) remained significant for recurrence, whereas tumor size [5 cm (P = 0.020), Child-Pugh class B (P = 0.002), and sustained low viremia (P = 0.021) remained significant for poor survival. Among patients in whom HBV DNA were serially checked, both HCC recurrence and postoperative deaths were more frequent in patients with fluctuating or lasting highlevel viremia than in those with persistently low or undetectable HBV DNA levels (all P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: High HBV replication state is among the most important predictors of adverse outcome after resection in patients with HBV-related HCC. The sustained suppression of HBV to the lowest possible level is of great importance to achieve long-term recurrence-free survival. Our findings underscore the need for future work that tests the applicability of antiviral therapy in this setting.",

Introduction: Complete mobilization of the right liver before parenchymal transection has been a standard approach during major right hepatectomy. However, in case of the patient with huge right hepatic tumor that had infiltrated the surrounding organs such as diaphragma or retroperitoneum, the mobilization of the right lobe of the liver may result in massive bleeding. Case: We experienced the patient with huge hepatocellular carcinoma occupying the right lobe that was estimated to be more than 30 cm in diameter. To avoid massive bleeding during the surgery, the liver hanging maneuver was performed in this case. This technique leads the anterior approach of liver transection much easier. The weight of the removed specimen was 6200 g, the operation time was 4 h 10 min. and the estimated blood loss during the operation was 3,100 ml. There was marked collateral veins in the retroperitoneum caused by portal vein tumor thrombus and a large blood flow into the tumor from right inferior phrenic artery. The most of the bleeding occurred during the resection of the retroperitoneum and diaphragma. In the patient like this case, the embolization of inferior phrenic artery before the surgery may reduce the bleeding during the resection of the tumor with diaphragma.

It is so emergent mostly and high mortality (25-75%) in the acute stage, and prognosis is not good. The option of treatment is observation, transarterial embolization (TAE) or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as palliative treatment and one staged operation or two staged operation as curative treatment. Two staged operation is the most ideal for cure, because we can stabilize the acute emergent state by TAE or TACE. We report a HCC patient who had ruptured mass and took a two staged operation. He was 68 years old male, heavy alcoholics, chronic hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis. Initially, we controlled the bleeding by TAE and took a TACE, after 3 months, and took a operation of hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) successfully, after 11 months from TAE. It is 5 months of post operation state, and healthy child A. Although it is so short of follow-up period, It is so fortunately good prognosis, so far. Background: Liver cancer (HCC) is number two cause of death in Mongolia with roughly 4,000 newly detected cases each year. Aim: Our study is aimed to analyze the current outcomes of liver resection and to improve the performance in the future. Method: 285 patients who underwent surgical treatment between years 2003 and 2007 at the National Cancer Center (NCC) were enrolled in this study. Variables included patient age, gender, predisposing liver conditions, stage of cancer, type of surgery, post surgical complications and pathology results. SPSS (version 15) software was used for statistical analysis. Results: 60.9% of patients were male and 39.1% were female with average age of 56 years. Liver cirrhosis was present in 47.3% of the patients, majority of whom were in Child A stage 83%. US was the primary modality (93%) to assess the tumor size which was on average 5.31 9 5.67 cm in diameter. CT was used in 70.5% of patients with average tumor size of 5.4 9 6.3 cm. 28% of the patients were diagnosed at their early stages (I, II), while 71.1% were diagnosed at their late (III, IV) stages. 43% (n = 108) of patients had minor resection, while the rest underwent major resection (32%), exploratory laparotomy (20.7%), laparoscopy (2.4%) and Wedge resection (1.2%) respectively. HCC was the main type of cancer detected, comprising 96.1% of the total, with cholangiocellular carcinoma and other types of malignancy making the rest (3.9%). Liver failure was the major post-operative complication, making 72% (n = 34) of the total n = 47. Though it is rapidly decreasing, the post-operative mortality rate was 5.4%. Conclusion: Although much attention was paid to patient safety in the past 4 years, the post-operative mortality rate of liver resection remains significantly high, and there is much room for improvement in this field. mally invasive surgery. Herein we report our preliminary experience in robotic-assisted laparoscopic anatomic hepatectomy in 13 consecutive patients. Methods: Between April and July 2009, 13 consecutive patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic anatomic hepatectomy for benign and malignant hepatic diseases. Major hepatectomy was performed in 9 patients (1 right hepatectomy, 1 right hepatectomy and simultaneous enucleation of lesion in segment IV, 6 left hepatectomy and 1 left hepatectomy and caudate segmentectomy, Roux-en-y hepaticojejunostomy for radical resection of hilar cholangiocarcinoma), left lateral sectionectomies in 4 patients. All the robotic-assisted hepatic resection procedures were performed anatomically with hilar dissection. Prior vascular control of the portal vessels was carried out before the parenchymal transection whenever possible. Eight major hepatectomies were for malignant disease and 5 hepatectomies (1 left hepatectomy and 4 left lateral sectionectomies) for benign disease. Results: No conversion to laparotomy occurred in all 13 patients. The mean operative time was 338 minutes (range150-720). The mean blood loss was 280 ml. No patients required intraoperative or perioperative blood transfusions. The Pringle maneuver was never needed. Without postoperative mortality, transient bile leakage was observed in the patient with hilar carcinoma. The mean postoperative stay was 6.7 days (range 2-13).",

Preoperative evaluation for balancing the risk of operation against the benefit of operation was important in patients with huge HCC. Hence, we classified subgroup based on morphological feature using preoperatively imaging study, analyzed long-term outcome according to subgroup, and investigate prognostic factor of patients with huge HCC. Patients and methods: From January 2000 to December 2005, 49 patients who underwent hepatic resection for huge HCC were retrospectively reviewed. Median age was 51 years (33-73). There were 44 men and 5 women. Based on preoperative radiologic morphology, patients were classified nodular HCC with irregular margin \\50% (Group A, n = 33), nodular HCC with irregular margin [50% (Group B, n = 9), and infiltrative HCC with totally irregular margin (Group C, n = 7). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on clinicopathological variables including radiologic morphology to analyze factors affecting survival and DFS. Results: On comparison using radiologic morphology, Group C showed significantly higher rate of liver cirrhosis (27.3% and 44.4 vs. 85.7%), macrovascular invasion (12. 1 and 44.4 vs. 85 .7%), and satellite nodules (12.1 and 11.1 vs. 42.9%). Five-year survival and disease-free survival rate according radiologic morphology were 33.7 and 27.5% in Group A, 25.0 and 11.1% in Group B, and 0% in Group C. Overall 1, 3, and 5-year survival rate were 70.5, 40.6, and 26.8% respectively. Overall 1, 3, and 5-year disease-free survival rate were 36.4, 20.5, and 20.5% respectively. On univariate analysis, macrovascular invasion, satellite nodules and radiologic morphology were significantly related to poor survival and disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis, macrovascular invasion was the independent prognostic factors of poor survival (RR = 19.5, P \\ 0.001) and infiltrative HCC with totally irregular margin was the independent prognostic factors of poor survival (RR = 6.4, P \\ 0.001). Conclusion: Although surgical resection for huge HCC was only hope of cure, the benefit of hepatic resection in patient with infiltrative HCC with totally irregular margin was limited. as compared to cells not pre-treated with bacitracin. Indeed, bacitracin pretreatment potentiated 3BP-induced apoptotic cell death, which was evidenced by more potent activation of caspase 9. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that hypoxia-mediated PDI induction protects hypoxic HCC cells against ER stress, and that PDI inhibition potentiates HK II inhibitor-induced JNK activation and apoptosis by increasing ER stress in these hypoxic cells. Thus, the simultaneous PDI inhibition may synergistically potentiate the anti-tumor efficacy of HK II inhibitor in HCCs, especially in advanced infiltrative type of tumors which are constantly exposed to hypoxic environment. .52, 75% in male) who had developed HCC after 6 months of antiviral therapy were included. As a control group, a total of 90 patients with CHB (mean age 60.29 \u00b1 9.17, 80% in male) did not received antiviral therapy who had developed HCC were enrolled. The medical records were reviewed for clinical, laboratory and radiographic evaluations. Results: About 26 months (mean 26.08 \u00b1 19.8 months) has passed for HCC to be discovered after antiviral therapy. At the time of diagnosing as HCC, 32 (88.89%) patients of liver cirrhosis and 7 (19.4%) of diabetes mellitus were established and the mean HBV DNA level was 4.6 9 10 7 \u00b1 1.4 9 10 7 copies/mL. HBV DNA level of 20 (61.76%) was under 2,000 copies//mL. Among 16 (44.4%) patients with HCC who was HBeAg-positive has experienced seroconversion only in four cases after antiviral therapy. There were no significant difference of clinical characteristics including mean aFP level, multinodularity, portal vein thrombosis, cirrhotic change, treatment modality and median survival except tumor size (p = 0.012) between patients who received antiviral therapy and those who did not receive antiviral therapy. Conclusion: Antiviral therapy decreases the incidence of HCC in chronic viral hepatitis B. But chronic viral hepatitis B can develop HCC in spite of antiviral therapy. Clinical course of HCC in the CHB during antiviral therapy seems to be similar to those without antiviral therapy. Periodical follow-up with surveillance program for HCC shoud be performed for patients of the CHB undergoing antiviral therapy. Further large scaled study should be warranted.",

Conclusion: The overall survival rate in diabetic group was significantly lower than those the in non-diabetic group. Alpha fetoprotein level was significantly low in diabetic that in non-diabetic group. Background: Esophageal variceal hemorrhage is the leading cause of death in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But the result of esophageal variceal hemorrhage and ligation in HCC is uncertain. We investigated the frequency of esophageal variceal hemorrhage and the effect of variceal ligation in the patients with HCC Material and methods: Between June 2003 and June 2008, 301 patients were diagnosed with HCC. One hundred thirty-nine patients were reviewed retrospectively with the exception of 131 patients who were lost from follow up within 1 year and 31 patients who were not performed with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) or liver dynamic computed tomomgraphy (CT). Various factors including the size of HCC, portal vein thrombosis, variceal form(F0-F3), red color sign, stage (by modified UICC), Child score, albumin, bilirubin, platelet, and splenomegaly were evaluated. Results: The gender ratio was 101:38 (male:female), mean age was 57.9 \u00b1 10 years (27-79 years), and the number of patients of stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 34, 32, 27, and 46, respectively. The mean follow up period was 18.4 months and the rate of bleeding during follow up period was 12.2%. The variceal hemorrhage occurred in 17 patients during the follow up periods and mortality associated with bleeding was 23.5% (4 patients). The variceal form and red color sign showed a significance for esophageal hemorrhage (p \\ 0.001). In 82 patients who were followed up from initial diagnosis to death, the ratio of esophageal hemorrhage was 7.3% (6 patients) from all cause of death.In 23 patients who were performed with prophylatic variceal ligation, 3 patients (13%) showed recurrent bleeding with 3 weeks of ligation and all hemorrhage were from the ligation ulcer. Conclusions: The mortality of HCC by esophageal variceal bleeding was 7.3% and the important predictor to the bleeding was the form of varix and red color sign.",

            "text": "Background: Hepatitis D superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B leads to accelerated liver injury, early cirrhosis and decompensation. It may be speculated that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may differ in these patients from HBV monoinfection. This study aimed to compare clinical aspects of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients of hepatitis D with hepatitis B alone. Methods: A total of 92 consecutive HCC cases seropositive for antibody against hepatitis D virus antigen (HDV group) were compared with 92 HBsAg positive but anti-HDV negative cases (HBV group). The clinical manifestations, Child Class, tumor characteristic, and staging were compared. Results: The mean age was not different in both groups of patients (55.4 years in HDV group and 53.7 in HBV group). Other features including sex, presence of ascites, serum biochemistry, gross tumor appearance, Child Class and Okuda stage were not significantly different between the two groups. Decreased liver size was noticed in more cases of HDV group as compared to HBV group where the liver size was normal or increased (p = 0.000). HDV group had lower platelets (p = 0.063) and larger varices on screening endoscopy (p = 0.005). Multifocal tumors were more common in HBV group (p = 0.057). TNM classification showed more stage III-IV disease in HBV group (p = 0.000) Conclusion: Hepatitis D virus superinfection does not accelerate the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, decreased liver size and indirect evidence of more severe portal hypertension and earlier TNM stage compared to HBV monoinfection might indicate that HDV infection causes HCC indirectly by inducing inflammation and cirrhosis. Objectives: There are notably limitations for resection and liver transplantation, at present. Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) and radiofrequency ablation (RF) have been presented in the treatment of small hepatocelluler carcinoma as curative treatments. The aim of the study was to review the available evidence comparing PEIT to RF for HCC. Material and methods: This study was carried out on 80 cirrhotic patients in Child-Pugh A/B/C with 1-4 nodes of HCC (diameter 15-50 mm), for a total of 117 lesions. Patients were divided into two groups to receive PEIT (n = 47) or RF (n = 33). Hepatitis B virus was the leading ethiologic factor for two groups (48/80, 60%). The primary end-point was complete response (CR) 1 year after the percutaneous ablation of all HCC nodes identified at baseline. Secondary end-points were early (30-60 days) CR, complications and survival. Results: It was found that, 1-year CR was achieved in 21/47 (44.7%) and in 21/33 (63.6%) patients treated by PEIT and RF, respectively. For lesions \\2.5 mm in diameter, there was better CR rate in the RF group (69.2 vs. 48.5%). An early CR was obtained in patients treated by RF 28/33 (84.8%) compared with patients treated by PEIT 36/47 (76.6%). The number of treatment sessions was smaller (2.1 times vs. 5.6 times, respectively) in RF versus PEIT. Three years survival rate was better (57.6 and 53.2%, respectively) with RF than with PEIT. RF was also considered not to be more expensive technique, due to less hospital stay and number of the sessions, comparing with PEIT. Conclusions: The early and 1-year CR rates of RF was significantly better than PEIT. Although beter survival rate was noted in RF treatment, but it was not found significantly.",

The stroma of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is markedly infiltrated with activated HSCs and associated invasion and metastasis of HCC. But little is known of the role of HSCs in HCC in immune responses. Methods: Quiescent HSCs (qHSCs) were isolated from normal Buffalo rat liver, and Intratumoral HSCs (tHSCs) isolated from Buffalo rat HCC. To detect tHSC surface molecules and gene expression by flow cytometry and fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. To observe T cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity by 3 H thymine ( 3 H-TdR) incorporating and releasing experiment. To test cytokines expression level of T cell by ELISA. T cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. To observe the migration and invasion of HCC by Transwell experiments. Results: qHSCs were found to express major key surface molecules. tHSCs express scant histocompatibility complex class I, histocompatibility complex class II, costimulatory molecules, and produce a scant or major variety of cytokines. Addition of the tHSCs suppressed thymidine uptake by T cells that were stimulated by alloantigens or by anti-CD3-mediated T cell receptor ligation in a dose-dependent manner. The tHSC-induced T cell hyporesponsiveness was associated with enhanced T cell apoptosis and contributed to the migration and invasion of hepatoma cell. tHSCs was associated with markedly enhanced expression of B7-H1. Blockade of B7-H1/PD-1 ligation significantly reduced tHSC immunomodulatory activity and hepatoma cell migration and invasion.",

Aims: This study determined the clinical significance and effect of beta2-GPI on the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Double fluorescent immunostaining analysis were performed in paraffin wax embedded histological sections of nine HCC cases, seven adjacent noncancerious tissues and seven hepatitis B controls using a beta2-GPI polyclonal antibody and a hepatitis B surface antibody. NF-jB activation was measured by immunofluorescence in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, SMMC-7721 exposed to the following different treatments. Group one: cells transfected with beta2-GPI; group two: cells transfected with HBsAg; group three: cells cotransfected with beta2-GPI and HBsAg; group four: cells transfected with control vector and group five: normal control cells. AFP expression of all groups was detected by ELISA. Results: The strongest merged fluorescent signal of beta2-GPI and HBsAg protein staining was seen in endochylema and localised to the border of nucleus in the cancer tissues. Weak beta2-GPI protein staining was present in the endochylema, with a strong signal of HBsAg protein in hepatitis B controls samples. In contrast, adjacent nontumorous liver tissue samples showed stronger beta2-GPI and HBsAg staining also in the endochylema. In vitro, Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 317",

The positivity rate of the number of NF-jB translocated from cytoplasm into nucleus each group compared with total cells was 13. 5, 8.7, 24.9, 5.7 and 0.95%, respectively. The AFP levels were significantly higher in the group three than in the group five (P \\ 0.001). It appeared higher in the group three than group one (P \\ 0.05) and group four(P \\ 0.05), without a significant difference between group three and group two, group four and group five. Conclusions: Beta2-GPI was strong expressed in the HBV-infected HCC. It played a role in the development of HCC by activated NF-jB with beta2-GPI and HBsAg combination. Results: Except micro HCC (B1 cm) which differed significantly from all other four groups in most clinicopathological variables analyzed, no differences were noted between Group 2 and Group 3, or Group 4 and Group 5. However, if B3 cm was set up as the cut-off value for small HCC (SHCC), and [3 cm for large HCC (LHCC), then the significant differences appeared between these 2 groups in the proportion of well-differentiated (grade I-II) HCC (48.0 vs. 19.4%, P = 0.000), the incidence of capsular invasion (15.4 vs. 36.3%, P = 0.000), the positive rates of tumor thrombi (6.9 vs. 23.5%, P = 0.000), the frequency of satellite nodules (12.3 vs. 35.5%, P = 0.000), the overall median survival (119.6 \u00b1 34.7 vs. 68.5 \u00b1 6.6 months, P = 0.000), and the median recurrence-free survival (67.0 \u00b1 16.7 vs. 29.5 \u00b1 3.2 months, P = 0.000). Conclusion: These tumor-size based results are currently good evidence showing that HCC smaller than 3 cm in diameter is closely related with other prognosis-related factors and can reflect the relatively benign pathobiological features of HCC at early developmental stage. Since HCC growing beyond 3 cm may exhibit highly aggressive behavior indicative of progressing towards a more malignant stage, we suggest that B3 cm in diameter can be considered a suitable size criterion for SHCC. Background: Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) is one of the standard therapy for liver tumor. Generally, the RFA region is confirmed by image comparison between pre-and post-treatment by contrast CT. However it is often difficult to confirm coagulation legion of RFA by CT. Therefore, we study the determination of coagulation legion used by ultrasound volume data as the alternative method, and we developed new ultrasound volume acquisition system. Methods: The system was consisted of ultrasound scanner (EUB-7500: Hitachi Medical Corporation, Japan), magnetic position sensor and PC with developed software and frame grabber. To measure the spatial accuracy of this system, we defined three target points in the phantom. One of them was about 2.5 cm in depth. The remained two targets were about 10 cm in depth and separated 10 cm each other horizontally. The ultrasound volume data have been taken seven times on the same day by one examiner, and analyzed. In addition, we evaluated the spatial accuracy in liver of healthy volunteer as preliminary experience. At first, the volume data have been taken at prone position and then turn out. After that, we took the data at prone position again. These data sets were compared.",

It is sometimes difficult during surgery to evaluate the local anatomy corresponding to hepatic arteries and bile ducts. We evaluated the usefulness of intraoperative exploration of the biliary anatomy using fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG). Method: A patient with polycystic liver and four patients with chronic cholecystitis were underwent laparoscopic surgery. ICG (5.0 ml/body of 2.5 ml/ml) was administered intravenously 1hr before operation and the bile duct was observed using the infrared-based navigation system. ICG was added intravenously to observe the location or flow condition of the cystic artery. Result: Common bile duct and intrahepatic bile duct in polycystic liver were clearly visualized and was easily and accurately identified after being fluoresced, where as the localization of bile duct was not visible under naked eye as a green spot. The location of the cystic artery was revealed after division of the connective tissues. There were no adverse events related to the intraoperative procedure or the ICG itself. Conclusion: Biliary tract identification based on ICG fluorescent imaging is useful without adverse effects at hepatobiliary surgery. were observed. 1-, 2-and 3-year survival rates of the patients who received radiofrequency ablation for liver metastases were 77, 49 and 26%, while those of the historical control were only 50, 0 and 0%. Multivariate analysis showed that prior chemotherapy, tumor size ([50 mm), and tumor number ([5 nodules) were significant prognostic factors. When the patients were divided into three groups according to these risk factors, the survival rates depended upon the risk grading. Conclusions: RFA could safely improve the prognosis of patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The earlier introduction of RFA, the better may be prognosis of the patients.",

This report describes a patient with an infected hepatic cyst treated with percutaneous transhepatic drainage. A 64-year-old woman presented at a nearby hospital because of acute right-upper-quadrant pain, mild left-lower-quadrant pain, diarrhea, and fever. She was admitted and received intravenous antibiotics for 1 week, but symptoms persisted. She was, therefore, referred to our hospital. On admission, ultrasonography demonstrated multiple hepatic cysts. One 13cm lesion was hypoechoic, unlike the other simple cysts, which were anechoic. Computed tomography showed that the density of the hypoechoic cyst was slightly higher than that of the other cysts. The wall of the cyst was thickened and showed contrast enhancement. On initial laboratory tests the serum Creactive protein concentration was 18.49 mg/dL, and the white-cell count was 13,300/lL. An infected hepatic cyst was suspected, and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the cyst was performed. A catheter was inserted into the cyst, and dark red fluid was obtained. The right-upper-quadrant pain gradually resolved after drainage. An infected hepatic cyst was diagnosed, and system antibiotics were administered. However, the mild left-lower-quadrant pain persisted. No pathogens were isolated from the drainage fluid. Minocycline hydrochloride (200 mg) was injected, and the catheter was clamped for 30 min, once daily for 3 days. The serum C-reactive protein concentration was 1.78 mg/dL, and the white-cell count was 5700/lL. The left-lower-quadrant pain resolved, and colonoscopic examination revealed multiple diverticula of the sigmoid colon. Infection has not recurred, and the hepatic cyst has not become larger. Angiomyolipoma is a benign neoplasm that has been reported frequently in the kidney but rarely in the liver. The radiologic appearances vary because of different compositions of fat, blood vessels, and muscle. We present an unusual case of hepatic angiomyolipoma that was indeterminate on radiological imaging. Case description: A 48 year-old lady (HBV negative, serum alpha-fetoprotein normal) with a history of treated breast cancer was incidentally found of a hypoechoic 3-cm mass in left lobe of liver on ultrasonography. CT confirmed a solid mass without fat density with three-phase contrast-enhancement (upper row). 18 F-FDG-PET was negative and 99m Tc-labeled Red Blood Cell study also negative (not hemangioma). 99m Tc-sulphur colloid SPECT/CT was photopenic in this lesion (lack of Kupffer cell function was not in favor of focal nodular hyperplasia). 99m Tc-mebrofenin scintiscan was also photopenic in this lesion (non-functioning hepatocytes excluded hepatic adenoma). In view of the above negative findings, 11 C-acetate-PET was performed. Markedly increased metabolism (lower row) was found in the left lobe lesion with SUVmax of 8.51 (lesion-to-liver ratio of 2.75). Our past data suggested that only renal angiomyolipoma and \\10% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had lesion-tobackground ratio [2. 75. In view of low pretest probability of HCC, this patient was diagnosed as an atypical ''angiomyolipoma without fat'' after 11 C-acetate-PET. Subsequently, ultrasound-guided core biopsy showed histopathological findings consistent with angiomyolipoma with minimal fat elements. 11 Cacetate is highly intense in non-fat components of angiomyolipoma, thus useful in helping the diagnosis when CT and other imaging modalities were indeterminate in liver masses of low-fat content. Objective: To report a case of primary carcinoid tumor of the liver in a 22-yearold Filipino female. Background: Primary carcinoid tumors of the liver are rare and usually asymptomatic. The presence of an extrahepatic primary lesion, usually in the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas, must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of a primary hepatic carcinoid tumor. In confirmed cases, treatment of choice is liver resection, regardless of the presence of metastasis. For non-resectable tumors or those with widespread liver involvement, liver transplantation may be considered. Transarterial chemoembolization may offer good palliation. Summary: A 22-year-old female presented with rapid weight loss and an abdominal mass of six months duration. No other symptoms were noted. Liver function tests and alpha-feto protein were normal. Initial abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large hepatic mass occupying both lobes of the liver, which was diagnosed as carcinoid tumor by liver biopsy. Work-ups to search for a primary lesion in the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas by endoscopic gastroduodenotomy (EGD), colonoscopy, and holoabdominal triphasic CT scan with triple contrast failed to reveal the presence of a primary tumor. Subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, believed to be metastatic, were detected on chest CT scan. Bone scan showed no evident bone metastasis. Due to the non-resectability of the tumor, transarterial chemoembolization was offered as alternative to treatment, however, the patient opted for palliative care and remained on close follow-up. Background: Since the introduction of lamivudine to treatments of chronic hepatitis B, the prevalence of lamivudine resistance in liver transplantation (LT) candidates continues to increase. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of pre-LT lamivudine resistance (LAM-R) on the post-LT prognosis of recipient, which has not been well elucidated. Methods: The LT recipients who were tested for pre-LT genotypic resistance to lamivudine between September 1999 and August 2009 at a single tertiary care center, Seoul, Korea were consecutively included. We compared the overall survival, and the incidence of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between the patients with LAM-R (the resistance group) and those without LAM-R (the non-resistance group). Results: Eighty-three consecutive patients were included. All patients were treated with both intravenous hepatitis B immunoglobulin and antiviral agents (lamivudine, entecavir, or adefovir). Thirty-seven patients were assigned to the resistance group and 46 to the non-resistance group. Their median follow-up duration was 21 months (range, 1-121). Mortality occurred in two cases of the resistance group and three cases of the non-resistance group, respectively. The occurrence of graft failure, recurrent hepatitis and HCC were one case, two cases, and two cases, respectively, in the resistance group; and two cases, one case, and two cases, respectively, in the non-resistance group. Univariate and multivariate analysis using Cox-regression model showed that there was no significant difference in survival, graft failure, HCC occurrence and recurrent hepatitis between two groups. Conclusions: Our result indicates that pre-LT LAM-R does not significantly affect on the post-LT prognosis. Thus, considering LT in patients with underlying hepatitis B disease as a therapeutic modality, LAM-R may not be a barrier if it is treated with adequate antiviral agents. Background: Biliary strictures are the most serious complications, especially in non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) liver transplantation (LT). MRP2 (Multidrug resistance-related protein 2) is a bile salt transporter located in canalicular membrane of hepatocyte, and it is a major determinant of bile flow. The purpose of this study is to identify the value of immunohistochemical detection of MRP2 as a marker predicting persistent and serious biliary strictures after liver transplantations. Methods: Thirty-three recipients of DDLT (including 14 recipients of NHBD LT) who underwent liver biopsy within 2 months and followed for more than 2 years were included in this study. Among the 14 patients with biliary strictures, 7 patients showed intrahepatic strictures. Recipients were divided into two groups: those who required biliary intervention for more than 2 years (Group A, n = 8) and who did not (Group B, n = 25). We evaluated paraffinembedded liver graft tissues with immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies for MRP2, and MRP2 score was obtained by the product of the staining intensity (1+, 2+ and 3+) and the extent (the percentage of cells staining). Results: MRP2 score was significantly lower in Group A (P = 0.022). The AUC to predict persistent biliary stricture was estimated to be 0.768 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-0.93). MRP2 score value with the best combination of sensitivity and specificity was 185 (sensitivity 87.5%, specificity 60.0%). Patients with lower MRP2 score (\\185) were more frequently involved in Group A (P = 0.039), and the odds ratio for persistent biliary stricture was 10.50 (95% confidential interval, 1.12-98.91). Furthermore, NHBD LT recipients were more frequently involved in the lower MRP2 score group (P = 0.049). Conclusion: Our results suggest that there is a potential utility of MRP2 as an early postoperative marker for prediction of persistent biliary stricture after liver transplantation, especially in NHBD LT.",

Nine of the 12 patients were healthy until this manuscript was completed, and the last follow-up CT obtained at a median of 65.3 months after inferior vena cava stent placement, revealed the patency of the stent-placed inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. Inferior vena cava stent placement seems to be an effective treatment with an excellent, longterm patency for treating post-transplant stenosis, although the possibility of hepatic venous outflow abnormalities following inferior vena cava stent placement should also be considered.",

Which indicator is more related to the injury of graft is what we studied. Methods: 210 adult male Wister rats were randomly divided into three groups: liver transplant group, sham surgery group and control group. Animals were sacrificed in each group at different time points: 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 24 h, 10 day, 20 day, 30 day, 40 day, 50 day after liver transplantation. The changes in serum biochemical indicators (AST, ALT) were measured by biochemical dosimeter, and the expression of Ref-1 and ICOS were detected by immunohistochemistry analysis. Results: As compared to sham surgery group and control group, the expression of Ref-1 protein in transplant group was higher during early period after liver transplantation and decreased in the late period. Meanwhile, Anti-ICOS was low in the early period and then rise in the late period (Fig.1) .The AST and ALT rise both in early period and late period. Conclusions: In the earlier period the serum indicators showed a strong relationship with the expression of Ref-1, and in the late period with the ICOS. We analyzed the morphological particularities of the CL venous drainage on 150 liver corrosion casts. The casts were made by injecting the hepatic vasculoductal systems with plastic, followed by parenchyma corrosion with hydrochloric acid. In 84% cases, left hepatic vein (LHV) and middle hepatic vein (MHV) form a common drainage trunk, and right hepatic vein (RHV) drains separately. In 8% cases we found an inferior RHV, and in 4% cases a middle RHV. The intraparenchymal portion of the portal hepatic vein (PHV) is the main element of liver's afferent pedicle, guiding the other afferent elements into the hepatic parenchyma. PHV is one of the intrahepatic vasculo-ductal elements with a most constant distribution. According to the intraparenchymal distribution of the RHV, segmentation of hepatic parenchyma was homologated. We present a hepatic corrosion cast with multiple anatomical variants of distribution; the variations are compared with those encountered on a total lot of 150 corrosion casts. PHV trunk forks into the left branch (LBr) and the posterior branch (PBr) (on the study lot this variation is present in 4% cases). LBr of the PHV gives birth to: anterior branch (ABr), that gives birth to four segmental branches (SV, SVa, SVIII and SVIIIa) (aspect encountered on 1.33% of the study lot), a single superior lateral branch (SII) (aspect present in 98% of the study lot), an inferior lateral branch with distribution in bouquet (SIII) (aspect present in 56.67% of the casts) and three medial branches (SIVa, SIVb and SIVc) (aspect present in 5.33% cases of the total lot). The right branch of the PHV is absent as a morphologic entity. It is replaced only by PBr (aspect encountered in 4% cases of the total lot). From the initial portion of the PBr emerges the paracaval branch (SVIa) (present in 11.33% of the total lot). PBr forks into a posterior superior trunk with two segmental branches (SVII and SVIIa) (aspect present in 14% cases of the total lot) and a posterior inferior segmental branch (SVI). The caudate branches emerge both from LBr and from PBr. We analyzed a hepatic corrosion cast with 15 segments and 5 major anatomical variants. Knowing these morphological variations is important for liver resection and transplant surgery. Introduction: Split-liver transplantation (SLT) and Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation (APOLT) provide ideal means to expand the donor pool. APOLT is indicated for potentially reversible fulminant hepatic failure and non-cirrhotic metabolic liver diseases. In the former scenario, the graft can be allowed to atrophy once the native liver regenerates. In the latter scenario, the graft can be allowed to atrophy, following application of successful gene therapy in future. The larger benefit in both situations is withdrawal of life-long immunosuppression. We hereby report first successful SLT and APOLT from India. Case Report: Cadaveric organ from a healthy 17-year-old gentleman (cause of brain death: road traffic accident) was split in-situ to benefit two recipients. First recipient was a 22-year-old lady suffering from Criglar Najjar syndrome type-I (CNS-I) and kernicterus. Her pre-transplant serum bilirubin was in the range of 20-25 mg%. After left lateral hepatectomy, segment 2 and 3 from donor were successfully transplanted orthotopically. Technically, care was given to divert requisite amount of portal inflow to the allograft, while at the same time preserving inflow to the native liver. Second recipient was a 55-year-old lady with end stage liver disease (cryptogenic cirrhosis, MELD = 17), in whom right lobe from donor was transplanted successfully after recipient hepatectomy. Both the recipients fared well during postoperative period and achieved good graft function. First recipient is able to maintain serum bilirubin in normal range, with normal bilirubin fractions.",

            "text": "Conclusions: For patients with non-cirrhotic metabolic liver diseases with severe extra-hepatic complications, APOLT is technically feasible, provides adequate hepatocyte mass and hence should be considered as an alternate to orthotopic liver transplant with recipient hepatectomy. SLT and APOLT should be encouraged in appropriate circumstances for judicious use of donor organ pool. Background: High demand for orthotopic liver transplantation has prompted some centers to consider using donor livers previously considered marginal, although no consensus yet exists about the specific factors that define a graft as marginal. Graft survival in HCV-infected recipients is worse than those transplanted for other liver diseases, thus they are more vulnerable to the added adverse effects of a marginal donor graft. We studied whether donor diabetes type II contributes to worse outcomes for HCV positive and HCV negative liver transplant recipients. Methods: We obtained data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) on all adult liver transplants performed in the United States between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2007. In total, 36,499 transplant events were evaluated. Independent predictors of graft survival were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after controlling for factors previously found to be associated with differences in transplant outcomes. Results: Donor diabetes was a strong independent risk factor for graft failure [ Background/ Aims: The MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease) score is used widely for assigning priority to liver organs for patients with chronic liver diseases. However, majority of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients will not die from liver failure, but more likely from the cancer itself. The UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing)/ OPTN (Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) allocation policy allows for MELD adjustment based on the estimated 15% probability of death within 3 months. This formula assumes that for the patients listed with HCC, each has an average risk of 15% of dying within 3 months. However, the actual risk for HCC patients is very much dependent on the waiting list time, graft availability as well as the tumor biology and staging of HCC listed which are factors that can be very different in each centre. Thus a standard method to adjustment score may not be appropriate for all. We aim to propose a simplified model for MELD score assignment for HCC. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with non-malignant conditions who died without a transplant from October 2003 to October 2009 in our centre were studied. Their MELD scores were plotted against their survival and a linear relationship was derived. Based on extrapolation from the linear graph, the median survival post listing for patients with HCC was used to obtain a corresponding MELD score.",

Approximately, 80 cases have been reported in literature by 2008. GvHD predominantly occurs in the first few weeks after LTX. Fever, skin rash, pancytopenia and diarrhea constitute typical symptoms. The mortality rate of acute GvHD following LTX exceeds 75%. Treatment remains challenging. Case: A 58 years old female who suffered from acute-on-chronic liver failure associated with HBV infection underwent deceased donor LTX. Donor was 33years-old male with head trauma. Ischemic time was 493 min. Quadruple immunosuppression with IL-2R antibody, Steroid, MMF and FK-506 was introduced. She showed unremarkable postoperative recovery until 20 postoperative days, when massive diarrhea occurred. It was followed by intermittent fever (up to 38.5\u00b0C) and skin rash. Colonoscopic examination showed denudation and shallow ulceration in the terminal ileum. Pathologic examination showed increased crypt apoptosis and crypt loss, consistent with acute GvHD. The authors decided to reduce her immunosuppresion level. MMF was stopped. Oral prednisolone was also stopped by 30 days after LTX. Trough level of FK was reduced from 12 to 6.2 ng/ml by 25 days after LTX. Then FK was switched to cyclosporine and the level was maintained at around 50 ng/ml. Her diarrhea was uncontrollable with any medication. Colostrum showed some beneficial effect of only short duration (2-3 days). On 32 days after LTX, WBC count dropped precipitously from 4,710 to 940/mcl. Leukopenia did not show any response to granulocyte stimulating factor or WBC Hepatol Int (2010) 4:94-345 327",

Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) is a traditional Chinese herb widely used to treat liver diseases in Asian culture. The aim of our study is to screen for the active compound of Dashen on hepatocyte apoptosis. Methods: Apoptosis was induced by Act D/TNFa in a hepatocyte cell line HL-7702. Six ingredients of Danshen were screened by high content screening apoptosis assay (fluorescence labeling nuclear and mitochondrial mass). The potential effective compound was validated in two kinds of mice models of acute liver injury (LPS/GalN and CCl4). TUNEL assay was used to determine hepatocyte apoptosis in liver tissue. Results: Compared with normal control cells, hepatocytes treated with Act D/TNFa undergone apoptosis markedly, reflected by decreasing nuclear size(nuclear fragmentation or condensation) and increasing abnormal mitochondrial mass. Of all the ingredients screened, Salvianolic acid A and B (Sal A, Sal B) showed an effective inhibition of apoptosisspecifically, they protected hepatocytes from nuclear fragmentation and inhibited abnormal accumulation of mitochondrial mass. Subsequently, we tested whether Sal B attenuated hepatocyte apoptosis in mice which induced by LPS/GalN and CCl 4 , respectively. TUNEL staining showed that rare hepatocyte apoptosis occurred in normal liver, massive hepatocyte apoptosis were observed in model mice, Sal B significantly inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis in both models. Conclusion: Sal A and Sal B can effectively inhibit hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro, while Sal B has also been confirmed to have a good effect against hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Background: TGFb1, as a multifunctional cytokine, has important effects in the occurrence and development of liver neoplasm and hepatic fibrosis. At least 10 SNPs exist in TGFb1 gene, Leu10Pro is located in TGFb1 signal peptide whose base substitution will influence TGFb1 secretion theoretically. This study was designed to determine whether Leu10Pro influence TGFb1 secretion and function of hepatic cells. Method: Two TGFb1 plasmids CMV-Leu and CMV-Pro were constructed by cloning TGFb1 DNA fragment, which encoding either the Leu or Pro forms of TGFb1, into pcDNA3.1 vectors. L02 and HepG2 cells were chosen to be transfected with CMV-Leu, CMV-Pro or pcDNA3.1 empty vectors. The cell medium was collected and analysed by TGFb1 ELISA kit 24 h after transfection. The transfected cells were stained by Annexin V and PI, then analyzed by flow cytometry. All data was calculated by Student's t test. Background: Natural supplements and alternative medicine have attracted significant attention in recent years. Previously we reported that the standardized freeze-dried powder made from fresh grapes, promotes liver cell viability and proliferation, prevents H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative cell damage, ameliorates mitochondria-and death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Methods: To explore the mechanism underlying the cytoprotective effects of grape and identify the active polyphenolic components involved, we examined the signaling pathways and the active compounds in grape, such as epicatechin, cyanidin, quercetin, and resveratrol in Huh7 cells.",

            "text": "Result: The Akt/PKB signaling pathway functions as a critical regulator of cell survival and proliferation. Our findings demonstrated that treatment with grape increased the phosphorylation of both Akt and IjB. Silencing Akt expression with Akt-specific siRNA or cell pretreatment with a pharmacologic inhibitor of Akt signaling pathway (LY) almost abolished the grape-induced Akt phosphorylation. Additionally, we found that treating cells with grape induced expression of PCNA which is associated with cell cycle progression. Assessment of individual active components revealed that at concentrations corresponding to 300 lg/ml grape powder, only quercetin demonstrated slight cytoprotective effects against mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Increased concentrations of other individual polyphenolic compounds were required to produce measurable cytoprotective effect. Only combinations of all four polyphenolic compounds restored a degree of the anti-apoptotic effects seen with 300 lg/ml grape powder Conclusion: In addition to the anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant effects which was reported previously, grape enhances liver cell growth and proliferation, which are associated with the Akt/ NF-jB cell survival pathway. We speculate that quercetin, epicatechin, and cyanidin are the active compounds within grape that are involved in attenuation of mitochondria-induced apoptosis. These findings may contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in protective effects of grape in a variety of liver conditions associated with oxidative cell injury and apoptosis, and may assist in developing clinical protocols to treat the stress-mediated diseases predominant state of liver. Bloodstream plays an important role in lymphocytes homing and recruitment. Comparing with other tissues which receive only arterial blood, liver has another special blood supply from portal vein which constitutes 75% of the total hepatic blood influx. The portal venous blood returns from the intestine and connects the liver and intestine anatomically and immunologically. Published studies have shown aberrant homing of mucosal T cells to liver under certain inflammatory conditions and inhibition of hepatic dendritic cells by gut-derived bacterial products. Our study aims at unveiling the contribution of portal venous blood flow to the high frequency of NK cells in liver under normal physiology condition. Methods: By flow cytometry, we detected percentage of NK cells in peripheral blood, portal venous blood, postcaval venous blood, and blood in sinusoids. Results: We found that NK cells percentage is much higher in liver sinusoidal blood than in other blood. However, we did not found any difference in NK cell percentage among lymphocytes from peripheral blood, portal venous blood, postcaval venous blood. In addition, the rate of NK cells in liver was not affected after tail intravenous injection of portal venous blood plasma. Nevertheless, we observed the existence of CD4 + CD3 -CD127 + lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)like cells in liver. Moreover, an immature subset of NK cells present in liver was absent in both portal venous blood and thoracic arterial blood. Background/Aims: Natural killer (NK) cells as important populations in innate immune system are the first line of defense against infections. Liver is a particular anatomical and immunological organ, which is enriched in innate immune cells including NK and natural killer T cells. Previous studies indicated that mouse liver NK cells are a heterogeneous population with different functional subsets. However, there was no established phenotypic marker that can distinguish this NK subset. Method: We compared the levels of extensive surface molecules on liver NK cells with other lymphoid organ-derived NK cells by flow cytometry, such as bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes etc. Results: By means of phenotypic comparison, we found the liver contain a high frequency of phenotypically immature NK cells, which is much lower in other organs except mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). The expression levels of CD51, CD61, CD69 and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on liver and MLNs are markedly higher than other organs. While reduced expression of CD62L, CD49d and KLRG1 was observed on liver and MLN NK cells compared to NK cells from other organs or tissues. Despite the fact that there are many similarities in phenotype between liver NK cells and MLN NK cells, differences also existed. Liver NK cells expressed higher levels of TRAIL and CD11c than MLN NK cells. Conclusion: These results suggested liver NK cells might have a similar function as MLN NK cells, and the slight differences in phenotype between liver and MLN NK cells may be attributed to the distinct microenvironment of the two organs. Functional analysis and comparison between liver NK cells and MLN NK cells should be further investigated.",

            "text": "Background: It is reported that the lymph node contains a small population of natural killer (NK) cells, suggesting an important function of NK cells in adaptive immunity. The liver with overwhelming innate immune cells including NK cells produces a large volume of lymph, representing about 25-50% of flowing through the thoracic duct. It is suggested that 80% or more of hepatic lymph drains into the portal lymphatic vessels. The purpose of the study is to examine the trafficking of hepatic NK cells to liver draining lymph nodes. Methods: Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice received adenovirus containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-EGFP,8 9 10 9 pfu virus) injection in a volume of 100 lL (intrahepatic injection) or 2.0 mL(hydrodynamics-based injection through tail vein). The surface phenotype of NK cells isolated from liver, spleen, bone marrow, blood and lymph node were analyzed by Flow cytometry. Results: In this study, we found that the liver NK cells had an immature phenotype CD3 -NK1.1 + DX5 -TRAIL + CD11c + CD11b -CD51 + CD2 low in adult C56BL/6 mice, but rarely in the spleen, bone marrow and blood. By the hydrodynamics-based intravenous injection or intrahepatic injection Ad-EGFP, we found that the hepatic lymphocytes population with GFP fluorescence trafficked into the liver draining lymph nodes after various time points. In na\u00efve C57BL/6 mice, NK cells in the liver draining lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph node, cervical lymph node, inguinal lymph node and popliteal lymph node were phenotypically analyzed,and a higher proportion of CD3 -NK1.1 + DX5cells were found in the liver draining lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph node than cervical lymph node, inguinal lymph node and popliteal lymph node, suggesting that mesenteric lymph node is possibly the secondary draining lymph node of the liver. Conclusion: The presence of immature NK cells in liver and its draining lymph nodes might suggest a possible role of hepatic NK cells in formatting adaptive immunity against hepatic pathogen or tumors.",

NK cells widely distribute in lymphoid organs and non-lymphoid organs in both human and mice. Whether NK cells present in different organs are different NK subsets becomes an important scientific question. Methods: We analyzed surface phenotype of NK cells isolated from blood, spleen, liver, lung, bone marrow and lymph node by Flow cytometric analysis. Results: It seems that NK cells in liver and bone marrow are more immature than those in blood, spleen, lung and lymph node, because of the lower expression of CD11b and Ly49 family receptors. We also found adhesion molecules and chemokines expressed on NK cells may change in different tissues. Moreover, heterogeneity of NK cells exists in the same tissue. On the basis of surface expression CD27 and CD11b, NK cells can be categorized into four stages which represent different growth stages of NK cell. Each stage can be found in all tissues we examined, though they have different proportions. Conclusion: The presence of NK cells at different developmental stages in various organs may provide a new hypothesis for NK cells development. However, we still need more straightforward evidence to prove that these heterogeneous NK cells are in different developing stage so that to exclude the possibility that they are different functional subgroups.",

Methods: Several HBV X gene specific RNA interference target sequences were designed and the corresponding shRNA expression retroviral vectors were constructed. These vectors were cotransfected into Huh7 cell line with pAAV-HBV1.3 HBV replication competent clone and the best RNAi target expression vector was selected. The excellent shRNA sequence expression nonviral vector was also constructed and compared its function with retroviral counterparts. Both shRNA expression vectors were injected into C57 BL/6 mice with same quantity pAAV-HBV1.3 plasmid and detected the HBV serological marker and viral titer more than 16 weeks post injection. Results: There was no significant difference in suppress HBV replication between retroviral and nonviral HBx specific shRNA expression vectors. Sera HBsAg positive percentage, HBsAg quantity, serum HBV DNA concentration and HBcAg positive hepatocytes number can lowered significantly at least 4 weeks after retroviral vector injected mice versus about almost 1 week in nonviral vector mice. Conclusions: The retroviral shRNA expression vector can prolong the time of suppression HBV replication effectively by hydrodynamic tail vein injection without retroviral package process. It gives some light on the study method about specific gene's function in a longer period in a simple way. WB-F344 cells stimulated by CTGF, while TIPM-1 expression increased when stimulated by TGF-b. Conclusions: Although both transforming growth factor-b and connective tissue growth factor could inhibit the proliferation of rat hepatic progenitor cells, the two cytokines play different roles on the differentiation and TIMP-1 expression on hepatic progenitor cells.",

They can exhibit cytolytic activity against a variety of targets cells which are harmful for health. Nature killer cells are heterogeneous populations which express many kinds of surface antigens, by which the NK cells development may be described. Methods: We test the phenotype of liver and spleen NK cells in mice of different ages by Flow cytometric analysis. Results: We have analyzed many kinds of surface antigens and found that liver and spleen nature killer cells express high level NKG2A, which is an inhibitory receptor, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in fetal and new born mice, but none ly49 family receptors were found. In adult mouse, liver nature killer cells and spleen nature killer cells express higher level Ly49 family receptors than fetal mouse and new born mouse, suggesting NKG2A hi TRAIL + may represent an immature phenotype, and Ly49+ may represent an much more matured phenotype. Liver nature killer cell express much low Ly49 family receptors than spleen nature killer cells, and only liver nature killer cells can express TRAIL without any stimulation. Conclusion: These results indicate that liver may supply a unique microenvironment for nature killer cells development and education. Background: Based on the sequence variation in the N-terminus of the UL55 gene, which encodes glycoprotein B (gB), human cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be classified into four gBn genotypes. Genotyping and quantity of HCMV gBn by real-time PCR was established in our previous study. Methods: This study examined the distribution of CMV gBn genotypes, and the correlation between CMV gBn DNA (detected by real-time PCR) and CMVpositive pp65 cells (identified by immunohistochemical staining) in a cohort of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Results: The distribution of gB genotypes was as follows: gBn1, 60% of patients; gBn2, 13.3%; mixed gBn1 and gBn3 infection, 36.7%; and gBn4 and other mixed infections, 0%. The detected level of CMV gB DNA correlated well with the number of CMV-positive pp65 cells (r = 0.514). Conclusions: The gBn1 is the most popular genotype in CMV. In the future, the relationship between gBn genotype and clinical outcome would be studied.",

Our objective was to identify clinical parameters for diagnosis of tubercular liver abscess in patients initially diagnosed as amoebic liver abscess (ALA). Methods: Between November, 2004 and October, 2008, 213 cases with ALA were admitted. All patients were started on antiamoebic therapy. Patients with liver abscesses with initial size of more than 10 cm, evidence of pre-rupture, left lobe abscesses or no response to antiamoebic therapy after 48 h, underwent drainage procedures. In patients who had evidence of pulmonary TB or where drainage persisted without ultrasonic decrease in size of the abscess, ELISA test for TB, drain fluid for PCR for TB and smears for AFB were sent. Patients with positive PCR were started on antitubercular treatment (ATT). The response was documented by serial ultrasounds. Results: Out of 213 patients, 13 were included in the study on basis of persistence of drainage without radiological evidence of decrease in the size of abscess (n = 11),or recurrence after initial improvement (n = 2). Pus culture was sterile and smears for AFB were negative in all. ELISA was positive in four patients. There was associated pulmonary TB in four patients. In 12 patients, PCR was positive. In one patient with persistence of drainage, diagnosis of tubercular liver abscess was made on the basis of radiological evidence of pulmonary TB even though PCR was negative. After starting ATT, drainage catheter was removed after 2 weeks in 10 patients, whereas 3 others required the drain till 3 weeks. Subsequent follow-up at 3 months showed complete radiological resolution of the liver abscess. Conclusion: TB should be considered in patients of liver abscesses not responsive to antiamoebic therapy, with recurrence of the abscess or where the aspirate is sterile even in the absence of biochemical/bacteriological evidence of TB or associated pulmonary TB.",

Background: Hepatitis-B-associated glomerulonephritis is a distinct entity occurring frequently in hepatitis-B-prevalent areas of the world including Sudan (prevalence of Hepatitis B is 8%). The general objective was to determine the prevalence, sociodemographic, socioeconomic and risk factors of HBV infection among patients with renal problems in hospitals of Khartoum state from September to November 2007. Methods: A hospital-based, analytic, cross-sectional design study among patients of renal problems in renal departments of selected Khartoum State hospitals: Khartoum teaching hospital, Soba university hospital, Ja'afr Ibn Aouf pediatric hospital, Ibn Sena'a specialized hospital and Dr. Salma renal centre between September and November 2007 and they were 44 patients selected as comprehensive non-probability sample. Data collection by: Structured questionnaire, interview and blood sample applying third generation ELISA for HBsAg. Results: Nine patients were HBsAg carriers and the prevalence of HBV nephropathy is 20.5% which is much higher than the prevalence in Sudan (8%) and this support the theory of epidemiological, clinical and immunological evidence which suggest a causal association between HBV carriage and the development of nephropathy. More than 66% of them are below 18 years old. Sociodemographically, there is a significant relation between developing the disease and the place of origin and West Sudan having the highest percentage (44%). Developing HBV nephropathy has a relation with low socioeconomic status. There is a strong association with HBV vaccination; more than 77% of the cases were not vaccinated. There is no association with: parental medication, blood transfusion, cupping or tattooing, past dental history or past-medical history of jaundice. Conclusion: HBV nephropathy prevalence in Sudan is 20.5%. More than 66% of them are below 18 and 44% from West Sudan. It has a relation with low socioeconomic status.

Tru-cut biopsy (TCB) is common while co-axial biospy (CAB) is not recognised by many hepatologits who need adequate fragments of hepatic tissue for molecular studies such as RT-PCR and immunostaining. Aims: To compare the success rate of complete biopsy, bleeding rate, and pain score in patients who underwent either TCB or CAB. Patients and methods: 276 chronic hepatitis C patients were randomised to undergo tru-cut or co-axial liver biopsies for hepatic fibrosis between 2006 and 2009 at Buddhist Tzu Chi Hospital, Hualien, Taiwan. Gelfoam dissolved in 1 mL of normal saline was used to inject into the biopsy tract for hemostasis only for patients in the CAB group. Exclusion criteria included patients with platelet count\\50 9 109/L, of Child Class B and C liver function, or with any malignancies. Success rate of complete biopsy (SRCB) was defined as having three fragments of hepatic tissue, one for pathologic fibrosis score (FS Grades 0-4), one for RT-PCR, and one for NS3 protein direct immunostaining (IS) without bleeding complication. Bleeding was detected by sonography within 24 h after either biopsy procedure with or without hemodynamic change. A 10-point pain score was used for patients to answer immediately and 24 h after the procedure. Results: 140 patients received TCB and 136 patients underwent CAB. There was no difference of age and gender between both groups. Comparing the TCB and CAB groups, the SRCB were 87.1 vs. 97.1%, P \\ 0.0001, the bleeding rates were 4.3 vs. 0% (P \\ 0.001), pain scores were 3.4 \u00b1 1.1 vs. 3.6 \u00b1 1.4 (P [ 0.05) immediately and 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 vs. 2.2 \u00b1 0.7 (P [ 0.05), 24 h after biopsy. Conclusion: Co-axial biopsy caused no bleeding. It was more successful to obtain adequate tissues for both pathological and molecular studies and did not cause more pain than its conventional counterpart. This study implicates that the special design of CAB (i.e gelfoam injection) is the solution for molecular hepatologists to obtain adequate tissues for pathological-molecular studies.",

Methods: Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed under ultrasonographic guidance in a patient with a stenotic hepaticojejunostomy after hepatectomy for hepatic hilum malignancy. The technique used was as follows. After dilatation of the drainage root, an 11-Fr tube (11Fr PTCS tube, Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) with several side holes is passed through the stenosis of the hepaticojejunostomy. A 10-Fr BLAKE Silicon Drain is flexible, precluding one-step insertion. One week after insertion of the 11-Fr tube, a 0.035-inch guidewire is inserted into the tube. After removal of the 11-Fr tube, the guidewire is put into the channel of a 10-Fr BLAKE Silicon Drain. The drain is inserted into the jejunal limb through the intrahepatic bile duct and is connected to a J-VAC Suction Reservoir. Low-pressure continued suction is applied. Patients can be discharged after insertion of the 10-Fr BLAKE Silicon Drain connected to the J-VAC Suction Reservoir. Conclusions: Placement of a percutaneous transhepatic biliary stent using a 10-Fr BLAKE Silicon Drain connected to a J-VAC Suction Reservoir is useful for the treatment of a stenotic hepaticojejunostomy.",

In Vietnam the mortality of AP about 10%. In the past we based on the Ranson, Glasgow, Imrie, SAPS criteria in the prognosis for grave AP. Aims: Using the TNF a as a factor in the diagnosis and prognosis of AP, especially in the first 24 h of the diseases. Subjects and method: 51 AP. Patients enrolled in the study, 30 temoins. The diagnosis of AP: Based on the clinical features + Amylasemia [ 3 Normal + Imagery of ultrasound or CT Scanner of pancreas. Exclusive criteria: Increasing of amylase extra pancreas, the increasing of TNFa.dues to the others causes ex: infection, immunology, corticotherapy\u2026 Results: The concentration of TNFa.: The temoins: TNFa.. The AP: 24.39 \u00b1 13,43 pg/l [10-72,1]. In mild AP: 18.06 \u00b1 6.43 pg/l [10-35.8], in severe AP: 39.59 \u00b1 13.91 pg/l [16. 5-72.1] The relationships and cut-off point of TNF: TNFa has middle positive relation with neutophile (r = 0,356; p \\ 0.05); with amylasemia: (r = 0.417; p\\ 0.05), with glycemia: (r = 0.417; P \\ 0.05), and with LDH: (r = 0.417; P \\ 0.05). TNFa has middle negative relationship with: PaO 2 (r = -0.558, P \\ 0.01), weak negative relation with calcemia (r = -0.265, P [ 0.05), and albuminemia (r = -0.428, P \\ 0.01). TNFa has close positive relation with Imrie criteria. Cut -off point of TNFa and LDH in acute pancreatitis: TNFa: 28.1 pg/ l, in AP corresponding to the sensitivity. 85.7% and the specificity 94.6%, instead of the cut off point of LDH: 309U/L and the sensitivity and the specificity only 92.9 and 70.3%.",

The respective overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96.8, 76.4, and 61.6% in the TACE group and 96.0, 88.5, and 88.5% in the HR group (p = 0.017). In a subgroup analysis, the HR group overall survival rates were significantly higher than those of the TACE group in patients with less than 2 cm or CLIP score 0 HCC. However, no significant difference was detected between the two groups for patients with[2 cm (and B3 cm) size (p = 0.2183) or CLIP 1 (p = 0.5214) HCC. Conclusions: HR showed better overall and recurrence-free survival rates than TACE in patients with single HCC less than 3 cm and Child-Pugh class A. TACE had overall survival rates similar to those achieved by HR in the subpopulation with [2 cm (and B3 cm) sized or CLIP 1 HCC. In such cases, TACE can be considered in patients who are not candidates for resection.

Cytotoxic effects of the L. obtusiloba extract were determined via uptake of fluorescent ethidium-homodimer-1 (EthD-1) in damaged cells. Effects on insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1; 100 nM) stimulated HIF-1a, PPARc and COX-2 expression were analyzed by Western-Blot. Effects on migration/ invasion were checked using the ''wound healing'' assay and a transwell system. Results: The L. obtusiloba extract induced a concentration dependent reduction of proliferation by *70% (IC 50 = 100 lg/mL) with only marginal cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, the migration of both cell lines were decreased strongly. IGF-1-increased PPARc (30%), HIF-1a (350%) and COX-2 (250%) expression were neutralized to control values by L. obtusiloba concentrations near the IC 50 .

Combined treatment with silibinin enhanced the gefitinib-induced growth inhibitory effects in some HCC cell lines such as Huh-BAT and SNU 761. In addition, it found that these results were similar to those of colony forming and cell counting assay. The combination of gefitinib and silibinin was synergistic in SNU 761 cell line however it was only additive in Huh-BAT cell line. Conclusions: The anti-tumor effects of gefitinib in HCC",

Results: Expression of WIF-1 was repressed due to its promoter hypermethylation and this suppression in HCC cell lines could be restored by demethylating agent. Furthermore, cell growth was inhibited by overexpression of WIF-1 in HCC cells. Conclusions: These results suggest that WIF-1 is frequently inactivated by promoter methylation and it may be a candidate tumor suppressor in HCC.

There was a trend towards an increased risk of hepatic artery thrombosis in active smokers (8%), versus non-smokers (3%) (P value 0.09). There was no increase in non-skin malignancy or cardiovascular disease in smokers. Conclusion: Pre-transplant smoking status did not influence patient survival post-transplant. There was a trend towards reduced graft survival and this entire course, AST/ALT level never rose above normal range. She succumbed to sepsis 47 days after LTX. Conclusion: The authors consider reduction in immunosuppression level nor WBC transfusion works for acute GvHD after LTX",

Moreover, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-jB) corresponded to the up-regulation of survivin. Inhibitor of NF jB, BAY 11-7082, suppressed the expression of survivin and eliminated the biphasic response. It reveals that the up-regulation of survivin is mediated by the activation of NF-jB. Conclusion: These data suggest that a low dosage of GCDC cause hepatocyte apoptosis to exhibit the biphasic response, which may result from the expression of Survivin and mediation of NF-jB.

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) is a key mediator of angiogenesis during tumor development. This study evaluated whether adenovirus-mediated small hairpin HIF-1a (shHIF-1a) and IL-8 (shIL-8) inhibited angiogenesis and metastasis in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines; HepG2 and Huh7. Method: HCC cell lines were infected with adenovirus expressing shRNA and cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% O 2 , 24 h). Following infection, the expression levels of HIF-1a, angiogenesis factors, and matrix metalloproteinase were examined through Western blotting, while tumor growth was measured by cell proliferation assay (MTT assay) and angiogenesis was measured by angiogenesis related assay (Tube formation assay, Migration assay, etc). Results: The inhibition of HIF-1a by adenovirus-mediated shRNA led to the repression of tumor growth, while the inhibition of IL-8 did not. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with culture medium from HIF-1a and IL-8 knockdown HCC cell lines, we observed reduced tube formation capacity and invasion compared to HUVECs treated with culture medium from wild-type cells. Similar effects were observed ex vivo (aorta ring assay), where the microvessel formation was inhibited significantly. Conclusions: These data suggest that adenovirus-mediated shHIF-1a and shIL-8 inhibit tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in HCC cell lines",

Although single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in miRNA regions have been reported to be rare and unlikely to be functionally important, recent studies have implicated that the rs11614913 SNP in miR-196a2 was associated with susceptibility of lung cancer, congenital heart disease, breast cancer and shortened survival time of non-small cell lung cancer. Our aim was to investigate the association between this genetic variant and the risk and/or progression of HBV-related HCC. Methods: A total of 528 patients with chronic HBV infection were periodically enrolled. The patients were divided into two groups: those without (n = 167) and those with HCC (n = 361). DNA was extracted from blood specimens, and miR-196a2 polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR). Results: The risk of HCC was non-significantly higher with miR-196a2 CC genotype or miR-196a2 C allele containing genotypes compared with those with the TT genotype among all or male patients. Interestingly, in female patients, we observed the opposite trend: carriage of the T allele contributes to the pathogenesis of HBV-related HCC. Furthermore, in a subsequent analysis of the association between this polymorphism and clinicopathological characteristics, there was still no significant difference in both the distribution of genotype or allelic frequency within HCC patients. Conclusions: Our results suggested that miR-196a2 polymorphism was not associated with both an increased risk and progression of HBV-related HCC in Chinese",

Since there are several ligands of NKG2D, such as Rae-1, Mult-1 and H60 in mice, construction of a liver-specific shRNA vector for simultaneously silencing multiple NKG2D ligands will be highly attractive. Methods: Albumin enhancer/promoter and alpha-fetoprotein enhancer/albumin promoter fragments were prepared from plasmid Albumin2335A and pLIVE, respectively. These promoter fragments were cloned into plasmid pEGFP-C1 to replace the CMV promoter and hepatocyte-specific expression vectors were constructed. A liver-specific shRNA vector for simultaneously silencing multiple NKG2D ligands (Rae-1, Mult-1 and H60) was also constructed. Results: The results showed that albumin promoter had a strong transcription activity in hepatoma cell line such as Hep2, HepG2 and Hepa1-6. EGFP was observed under the fluorescence microscope. Albumin enhancer and alphafetoprotein enhancer raised the transcription activity of albumin promoter as EGFP expression level was increased in the transfection experiments. In another study, after hydrodynamic injection of plasmid containing three shRNA sequences (siRae1-siMult1-siH60), we found the decrease of expression of these three ligands on liver (hepatocytes)",

Recent evidence suggests that activation of NK or NKT cells also contributes to the development and progression of liver injury in a variety of rodent models. However, the roles of NKT cells in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain unclear. The aims of this study are to explore the changes of Va24 natural killer T cells (NKT) in peripheral blood and their correlations with the severity of hepatic injury in patients with chronic HBV infection. Methods: Va24 natural killer T cells were detected in 43 patients with chronic HBV infection by the method of Flow Cytometry. The patients included in this study are 26 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 9 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC), 8 patients with acute on chronic liver failure(ACLF) and 7 normal control (NC).

Aim: To revealed the prevalence and risk factors of sexual transmission of HCV from male to female partner of patients with HCV-HIV co-infection. Method: Cross sectional study were done for index patients with inclusion criteria: male patients with anti-HCV positive and anti-HIV positive. Results: There were 114 patients included in this study. Almost all (99%) patients had history of injection drug user (IDU), mean of age 29.5 (range 21-44) years old with 92.1% (105 person) of CD4+ less than 200 sel/uL. The sexual relationship with their wife: 78.1% not always use condom, 92.1% with vaginal intercourse, 58.8% (67 person) with anti-HIV positive and 9.6% (11 person) with anti-HCV positive. Multivariate analysis of several factors regarding the positivity of anti-HCV in sexual partners revealed that the only factor associated with heterosexual transmission of HCV in this group of patients was their sexual behavior (rectal intercourse). Conclusion: Sexual transmission of HCV is rare even in patients with HCV-HIV co-infection and occurred as consequence of odd sexual behavior.PP274 Distribution of Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Infection in China Li-Jun Liu 1 , Shao-Cai Du 1 , Lai Wei 1 1 Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Hepatology Institute, No. 11, Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, China",

Pant Hospital, New Delhi, 201, Academic Block, G.B Pant hospital, New Delhi, 2 Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, D-1, Vasant kunj, New Delhi, 3 Lady Hardinge Medical College, Cannaught Place, New DelhiBackground: In acute viral hepatitis E virus (AVH-E) the patterns and mechanisms of specific cellular immune responses have been studied, still knowledge lacks on innate immune responses; specifically Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) and role of dendritic cells (DCs) in antigen presentation. Aim and objectives: To explore the role of TLRs (2, 3, 4, and 9) downstream pathways (MyD88&TRAF6) also function of plasmacytoid (pDC) and myeloid (mDC) in AVH-E infection. Materials and Methods: Seven acutely infected icteric hepatitis E patients presenting within 4 weeks of the prodrome were serially studied at weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6 compared with ten healthy subjects. PBMC's isolated and stained before and after stimulating with polyI:C, CpGODN and LPS with flourochrome labelled antibodies to investigate frequencies of subsets of pDC &mDC, TLR 2, 3, 4, 9 and DCSIGN. mRNA expression of Myd88, TRAF6, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-a and IFN-c by RT PCR syber green chemistry was done. Results: We found no difference in mDC population (18.06%) whereas pDC (41.11%) were significantly higher (p \\ 0.001) than healthy controls. This pattern persisted during follow-up and these cells were found functionally active with higher secretion of IFN-c (p \\ 0.02). On the other hand, none of the TLR's were upregulated in HEV infection. Moreover, TLR agonist stimulation by poly I:C, CpG ODN and LPS, showed no significant changes in IFN-c levels. No change in mRNA levels of MyD88 and TRAF6 was detected, but levels of TNF-a and IFN-a were upregulated (p \\ 0.03, 0.00). DC-SIGN (integrin involved in virus uptake) on mDC and pDC was significantly higher (p \\ 0.001, 0.00. Conclusions: Our findings clearly depict that TLRs and their downstream pathways are not involved in the recognition of HEV. Enhanced expression of DC SIGN and IFN-c production suggests an efficient uptake of the virus and their predominant role in HEV infection and consequent hepatic injury.

Rutledge 2 , Thomas Huser 1,2 1 Biophotonics Center of Science and Technology, University of California, Davis, 2 Dept. of Internal Medicine, University of California, Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA, USA Background: Intracellular lipid droplets are pathologic hallmarks of liver injury of various etiologies, especially in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the dynamic process, subcellular origins and chemical composition of lipid droplets remain poorly understood. Aims: To dynamically monitor the formation of lipid droplets, and to evaluate chemical changes in their composition in primary hepatocytes. Methods: The formation of lipid droplets in living primary hepatocytes exposed to lipolysis products from very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and lipoprotein lipase (LpL), or free fatty acids was monitored by coherent antistokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy in real time. Raman spectra of individual lipid droplets in hepatocytes were analyzed to determine changes in their lipid composition. Lipotoxicity was determined by oxidant stress and cell death. Results: After exposure to VLDL and LpL, lipid droplets formed within cells and increased in size and numbers over the observation period of 200 min. At the same time, some lipid droplets were observed to merge and increase in size. Spectroscopic Raman analysis of hepatocellular lipid droplets before and after exposure to VLDL and LpL revealed that the major components of droplets are esterified unsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid unsaturation ratio increased with droplet size. With exposure to 13-HODE and palmitic acid (PA), a marked increase in saturated fats was recorded when compared to incubation with PA alone, indicating a greater accumulation of saturated fatty acids in the presence of 13-HODE. These changes occurred in association with enhanced oxidant stress and cell death as indicated by increased DCF fluorescent signals and apoptotic cell staining. Conclusion: CARS microscopy and Raman spectroscopy are novel biomedical tools useful for understanding the dynamics of lipid accumulations and for determining changes in the chemical composition of lipids in living hepatocytes.PP415 Effect of MEK/ERK Signal Pathway on the Expression of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 in NAFLD Induced by High-Fat Diet in Rats Yu-Lin Song 1 , Wei-Mei He 1 , Fang Fang 1 , Jian-Ming Xu 1 1 Department of Gastronenterology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Jixi Road 218, Hefei, Anhui Province, 230022, China Objective: To investigate the effect of MEK/ERK signal pathway on the expression of SREBP-1 in NAFLD induced by high-fat diet in rats.",

The effects of TGF-b 1 on the MSCs transplantation on hepatic fibrogenesis and hepatoma in rats were investigated. Results: Combined with density gradient centrifugation homogeneous MSCs of male SD rat were isolated, purified and passaged by stationary culture. The mean value of Schmid M fibrosis score was 1.58 in the transplantation group and 5.12 in control group (l = -3.653, P \\ 0.01). The mean value of Scheuer inflammation score was 3.58 and 0.42, respectively (l = -4.214, P \\ 0.001). But with the different transplant time, sixth week and eighth week, significant differences were found in both twelve weeks model groups. The mean value of Scheuer inflammation score was 0.42 and 3.64, respectively (l = -4.146, P \\ 0.01). Based on the hepatic fibrosis model induced by CCl 4 , the mean value of Scheuer inflammation score, Schmid M fibrosis score and the activation score of HSC between control group and intervention group were obviously different, with 3.58 and 0.42 (l =-4.22, P \\ 0.01), 5.17 and 1.58 (l = -3.65, P \\ 0.01), 2.25 and 0.58 (l = -2.93, P \\ 0.01), respectively. Conclusion: Early MSCs transplantation can alleviate inflammation reaction and improve fibrosis stage in transplanted rats induced by CCl 4 . MSC transplantation via the caudalis vena and intrahepatic injection has the same effect on alleviating inflammation and fibrosis in transplanted rats induced by CCl 4 .

Recent studies have demonstrated that canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays a key role in the development of fibrosis and the activation process of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). In the present study, we investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), a specific inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, on hepatic fibrosis. PAP attenuated the histological changes and the content of hydroxyproline (Hyp) in liver tissue. PAP also reduced the mRNA expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), b-catenin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type-1 (TIMP-1) in rats and decreased both mRNA and protein expressions of a-SMA in HSC-T6 cells and the viability of HSC-T6 cells with an increase of b-catenin phosphorylation.

The aim of this study is to construct recombinant lenti-virus carrying small interfering RNA (siRNA) of TIMP-1 and to investigate the effects on rat hepatic stellate cell (HSC) in vitro. Methods: Two different short fragments in accordance with rat TIMP-1 mRNA gene sequence, nt 161-181 and nt 445-463, were selected, U6 promoter followed by annealing siRNA which had the strongest suppression effect were cloned into the lenti-virus vector (PGCL/siRNA-TIMP-1/GFP) and packed in 293 cells to construct recombinant virus lenti/siRNA-TIMP-1/GFP. Rat HSC-T6 cells were infected by recombinant lenti-viruses at a concentration of MOI of 10. To monitor the efficiency of infection, fluorescence microscope and flow cytometer were used. Results: HSC-T6 had no significant morphological changes after recombinant lenti/siRNA-TIMP-1/GFP treatment, with the infection efficiency rate from 51.2 to 68.2% by detecting the report gene GFP expression. TIMP-1 levels were significantly suppressed at 50 and 90% at 7 and 14 days after lenti/ siRNA-TIMP-1/GFP (nt 161-181) infection by Western blot analysis (P \\ 0.05).

The aim of this study was to investigate the capability of a novel biochemical and clinical model, BioCliM, in predicting the survival of cirrhotic patients. Methods: We prospectively evaluated the survival of 172 cirrhotic patients. The model was constructed using clinical (ascites, encephalopathy and variceal bleeding) and biochemical (serum creatinine and serum total bilirubin) variables that were selected from a Cox proportional hazards model. It was applied to estimate 12-, 52-and 104-week survival. The model's calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was computed at 104 week in a validation dataset. Finally, the model's validity was tested among an independent set of 85 patients who were stratified into two risk groups (low risk \\ 8 and high risk[ 8). Results: In the validation cohort, all measures of fit, discrimination and calibration were improved when the biochemical and clinical model was used.

Methods: By long-time following-up, we observed the upper gastrointestinal bleeding as the end point.Results: During a median follow-up of 50 months, in patients with small esophageal varices, the cumulative probability of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Fuzheng Huayu Capsule group is significantly higher than that of the placebo group (96.6 vs. 76.3%) (P = 0.028). In patients with median or heavy esophageal varices but without history of esophageal variceal bleeding, the cumulative probability of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Fuzheng Huayu Capsule plus propranolol group is 84.8%, which is obviously higher than propranolol group (P = 0.013). However there are no significant differences between Fuzheng Huayu Capsule group and propranolol group (P = 0.147), Fuzheng Huayu Capsule plus propranolol group and Fuzheng Huayu Capsule group (P = 0.147). The bleeding risk of propranolol group is 4.065 times of Fuzheng Huayu Capsule plus propranolol group, and the 95% Confidence Interval is 1.282-12.886 (P = 0.017).In patients with history of esophageal variceal bleeding, the cumulative probability of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeding in Fuzheng Huayu Capsule plus propranolol group and the median time of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeding both are significantly higher than these of propranolol group (44 vs. 24.2%, 40.00 \u00b1 17.92 months vs. 7.00 \u00b1 2.35 months) (P = 0.035). The bleeding risk of propranolol group is 2.474 times of Fuzheng Huayu Capsule plus propranolol group, and the 95% Confidence Interval is 1.018-6.011 (P = 0.046). Conclusions: Fuzheng Huayu Capsule can increase the cumulative probability of non-upper gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with small varices.

Results: In the group of 596 patients average value of FibroScan in the group with large varices (gr II and III) was 46.9 \u00b1 19.5 kPa (N = 238) statistically significant higher than in the group of patients without varices or with small esophageal varices 21.7 \u00b1 10.6 kPa (N = 358), P \\ 0.0001. We have identified a value of 23.3 kPa that can predict the presence of large varices with a sensitivity of 89, 5%, specificity of 67.1%, positive predictive value of 71.5% and negative predictive value of 87.3% AUROC = 0.8811 (P \\ 0.0001). At a value of 41.3 kPa TE can predict variceal bleeding with a sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity 81.2%, positive predictive value 96.6% and negative 42.7% Conclusion: Liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography may be accurate for assessing the risk of variceal hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients and help selecting the patients which require endoscopy. The identified cut-off values are: 23.3 kPa for the presence of large varices and 41, 3 kPa for bleeding risk.",

We aim to evaluate the frequency of recurrence of SBP in our community and the factors responsible for it. Methods: We analyzed patients with cirrhosis who were admitted at AKUH with diagnosis of SBP from June 2007-June 2009. Any episode of SBP after resolution of the first index case of SBP within one year was considered as recurrence. Results: Out of 238 cirrhotic patients, 157 (66%) had single episode of SBP while 81 (34%) had recurrent episodes. Portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) was the most common associated presentation in patient with recurrent SBP i.e. in 97(40.3%) with P = 0.03. Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) was found to be 113 (47.5%) and 139 (58.4%), respectively. Only 58 (24.4%) patients were on prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Univariable analysis revealed that female gender (P = 0.03), complain of fever (P = 0.03) and PSE at time of admission (P = 0.03) were significant factors for recurrence of SBP. Similarly raised serum bilirubin with P = 0.01 and deranged serum creatinine with P = 0.03 were found to be significantly associated with recurrence of SBP. Furthermore, on multivariate analysis bilirubin level of[1.0 mg [(aOR 7.03; 95% CI = 1.55-32), HBV and (aOR 0.31; 95% CI = 0.13-0.70)] and presence of UTI [(aOR = 2.24; 95% CI = 0.99-5.09) were significant factors in patients with recurrent SBP.

However, the role and molecular mechanism of Foxp3 expression in hepatoma cells were unclear. Methods: We evaluated Foxp3 mRNA and protein expression in hepatoma cell lines (included HepG2, MHCC97-L, MHCC97-H, HCCLM3, etc.) with different metastasis potentiality. To elucidate function of Foxp3, we examined up/ down-regulation of Foxp3 expression in hepatoma cell lines by Foxp3 plasmid and Foxp3 shRNA transfected. Then, analyzed down-stream regulatory gene of Foxp3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines using microarray. Moreover, cocultured Foxp3+/-tumor cells with CD4+ and CD8+ T response cells and evaluated immune-related inhibitory functions of Foxp3+/-HCC cells in coculture systems. Result: Foxp3 mRNA and protein was detected in all hepatoma cell lines and the tumor cells with high metastasis potentiality could express higher levelFoxp3 mRNA or protein than tumor cells with low metastasis potentiality or non-metastasis. Up-regulation of Foxp3 in tumor cells decreased the expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8 and HLA-A, increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) in hepatoma cells. The invasion assay showed that upregulation of Foxp3 in tumor cells could increase tumor cells migration and cell invasion. Silencing of Foxp3 by shRNA in hepatoma cells could upregulate expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, HLA-A, B2 M, et.al and down-regulate TGFb2, TGFb3 in HCC cell lines. The Foxp3+ HCC cells could inhibit the CD4+ effector T cells proliferation and activation. Moreover, The Foxp3-HCC cells by Foxp3 shRNA silenced could increase CD4+ effector T cells proliferation and activation. Conclusion: These findings suggested that expression of Foxp3 in hepatoma cells could involved in immune-suppression in tumor microenvironment and contribute to the tumor cells migration and invasion.",

Methods: Retrospectively records were reviewed for 5,814 patients who visited PCR-Hepatitis Laboratory, LN Hospital, New Delhi during January 2006 to September 2009 with liver diseases. Demographic, etiological and clinical data were collected from all the patients. HBV-DNA, HBV viral load and HBV genotyping was done with PCR, Real Time PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. The seroprevelance of HBsAg was high (16.9%) in liver diseases patients. Majority of HBsAg positive (75.6%) patients were HBeAg negative possibly due to the length of time of infection. 58.4% of HBeAg+ patients and 30.8% of HBeAg-patients had both HBV DNA and ALT levels raised that will prompt consideration of antiviral therapy.

Result: Out of the 68 patients from 15 families, one showed triplicate infection of genotype C, D and CD1 recombinant in 2006 but only genotype D was found in 2007. Further clonal analysis showed that different kinds of recombination happened in this patient. Sequencing analysis indicated that the CD1 recombinant in this patient were not from the recombination between genotype C and D. All genotype C, D and CD1 recombinant strains may recombine with each other as a parental sequence to form a new recombinant in this patient. Conclusion: The recombinational analysis of quasispecies from the mixedgenotype coinfection patient in 2006 showed several different types of recombination events between genotypes whereas genotype D was the only HBV strain after 18 months. This indicated that the recombination can happen between different strains of HBV but rarely can be observed in nature.

Serum HBV-DNA was detected in the transgenic mouse by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR after 22 days. Meanwhile, HBsAg and HBcAg expression was observed in the liver tissues of the HBV transgenic mouse by immunohistochemistry dyeing respectively. Results: Compared to sodium chloride group, SJAMP can inhibit the transgenic mouse's serum HBV-DNA in dose-effect relationship, but this inhibitive effect is lower than IFN group. HBsAg and HBcAg of HBV transgenic mouse's livers demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship too.

Although recently approved for use in treatment-na\u00efve chronic hepatitis B (CHB), Tenofovir has been restricted in New Zealand to patients with HIV co-infection or those with lamivudine resistance who have failed adefovir rescue. This audit evaluates the antiviral efficacy of tenofovir in patients who have failed adefovir rescue. Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out on patients with CHB who received tenofovir rescue therapy. All patients had documented lamivudine resistance or adefovir resistance and had failed to respond to combination lamivudine plus adefovir (defined as \\1 log reduction after 6 months). HBV Introduction: Add-on therapy with a non-cross-resistant agent such as adefovir can suppress hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in chronic hepatitis B patients who fail lamivudine. However, sequential treatment may result in failure of the second agent. We report here the safety and efficacy of early add-on telbivudine therapy in a patient with chronic hepatitis B and compensated cirrhosis who failed sequential treatment with lamivudine and adefovir. Case Description: In August 2000, a 60-year-old man presented with chronic hepatitis B and compensated cirrhosis, serum HBV DNA level of 107,532 IU/mL and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 178 U/L. He received lamivudine 100 mg/day and had undetectable viremia until January 2005, when he experienced a [3-log increase in HBV DNA level and was switched to adefovir 10 mg/day. His HBV DNA level decreased and remained undetectable for 4 years until February 2009, when it increased to 303 IU/mL on two occasions despite good patient compliance to therapy.",

Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from 343 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with peginterferon alpha plus ribavirin from April 2004 to December 2008 in Busan Paik Hospital Department of Internal Medicine was done. 249 (genotype 1: 121, genotype 4:1, genotype 2: 121, genotype 3: 7) patients were treated with peginterferon alfa (2a: 180 mcg/wk, 2b: 1.5 mcg/kg/ wk) plus ribavirin 1,000-1,200 mg/day for 48 weeks (for genotype 1/4, depending on body weight) or 800-1,000 mg/day for 24 weeks (for genotype 2/3). 91 (genotype 1: 30, genotype 2: 63) patients with RVR (and low pretreatment viremia for genotype 1) were treated with same regimen for 24 weeks (genotype 1) or for 12-16 weeks (genotype 2). Results: The overall ETR, SVR was 98.5% (338/343) and 86.9% (252/290), respectively. The SVR in genotype 1, 2, 3, 4 were 80.8% (122/151), 92.9% (171/184), 85.7% (6/7) and 100% (1/1), respectively. In genotype 1, RVR was 60.9% (92/151), SVR in patients with RVR was 92.4% (85/92). In the case of 24 weeks treatment for the patients with RVR and low pretreatment viral load (2600,000 IU/mL), SVR was 100% (30/30). In genotype 2, RVR was 89.1% (163/184) and SVR in patients with RVR was 95.1% (155/163). SVR in patients with RVR and standard treatment (380% of expected treatment duration and dose), in patients with RVR and short-term (12-16 weeks) treatment was 94.0% (94/100), 96.8% (61/63), respectively. Conclusion: In Korean patients with chronic hepatitis C, peginterferon and ribavirin therapy is very effective. We might reduce treatment duration according to response pattern (tailored therapy) without compromising sustained virlolgic response.24 Weeks Treatment with Pegylated Interferon Alfa Plus Ribavirin may be Possible in Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Patients with Rapid Virological Response who have Low Pretreatment Viremia Byung Jin Choi 1 , Young Jin Song 1 , Sang Bun Choi 1 , Eun Uk Jung 1 , Sang Heon Lee 1 , Ji Hyun Kim 1 , Sung Jae Park 1 , Jung Sik Choi 1 , Sam Ryong Jee 1 , Youn Jae Lee 1 , Sang Young Seol 1 Inje University, Busan Paik Hospital, 633-165 Kaegum-dong, Busanjin-gu, Busan, KoreaBackground/Aims: The standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C infected with HCV genotype-1 is a combination of pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin over a 48 weeks period. It is unclear if 24 weeks treatment is possible for patients showing a rapid virologic response (RVR) without compromising the sustained virologic response (SVR) in Korea. Method: Between June 2005 and September 2008, among patients chronically infected with the HCV genotype-1 who were treated with pegylated interferon alfa subcutaneously once weekly plus ribavirin based on body weight, 29 patients who had low pretreatment viral load (\\600,000 IU/mL) and RVR were treated for 24 weeks and followed up for 24 weeks. The HCV RNA was quantitatively assessed pretreatment, after 12 weeks of treatment and was qualitatively assessed 4 weeks of treatment, End of treatment (24 weeks), 24 weeks after end of treatment. RVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the 4 weeks. Result: Among the 29 patients, all patients (100%) had rapid virololgical response (RVR), End of treatment (ETR), and had sustained virologic response (SVR). Conclusions: HCV-1 infected patients with a low baseline HCV RNA concentration who become HCV RNA negative at week 4 may treat for 24 weeks without compromising sustained virlolgic response. However, an additional trial will be needed to optimize the treatment duration.Bioluminescence Imaging of Hepatitis C Virus NS3/4A Serine Protease Activity in Cells and Living Animals Qiu-Xia Fu 1 , Li-Cui Wang 1 , Ya-Feng Dong 1 , Yong Zhou 1 , Shuai-Zheng Jia 1 , Lin-Sheng Zhan 1Beijing Institute of Transfusion Medicine, 27(9) Tai Ping Road, Beijing, ChinaBackground and aim: The lack of robust small animal model has hindered the screening of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitors in vivo. The aim of this study is to describe a reporter assay system for in vivo noninvasive imaging of NS3/4A serine protease activity using split firefly luciferase complementation strategy. Methods: We constructed a reporter construct ANLuc (NS5A/B)BCLuc which constitutes the split N-and C-terminal fragments of luciferase, fused to interacting peptides, pepA and pepB, respectively, with an intervening HCV NS3/4A cleavage motif of NS5A/B. The reporter molecule could be proteolytically cleaved by NS3/4A at the NS5A/B motif in cells and living animals. Association of pepA and pepB brings inactive fragments of luciferase into close proximity, thereby restoring bioluminescence activity. Results: The increase in luciferase activity was proportional to the dose of active NS3/4A protease. The ANLuc (NS5A/B) BCLuc reporter also can be used to detect the activity of NS3/4A-specific shRNA and IFN-a. Conclusion: the reporter assay system using split firefly luciferase complementation strategy should prove useful for evaluating NS3/4A protease activity in cells and living animals.Prognosis of Chronic Hepatitis C after Interferon Therapy by Long-TermCohort Study Daisuke Maruoka 1 , Fumio Imazeki 1 , Kenichi Fukai 1 , Keiichi Fujiwara 1 , Makoto Arai 1 , Yutaka Yonemitsu 1 , Osamu Yokosuka 1 Department of Medicine and Clinical Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-Ku, Chiba CityBackground/Aims: The prognosis of patients with C-viral chronic liver disease (CLD) after interferon (IFN) therapy is not well characterized. We investigated the efficacy of IFN therapy on the survival by a retrospective cohort study. Methods: Seven hundred and twenty-one consecutive patients with C-viral CLD who underwent liver biopsy at our department between January 1986 and December 2005 were enrolled in this study. Five hundred and seventy-seven of these patients were treated with IFN (male 369; female 208; average age 54.0 \u00b1 11.1 years old; average observational period 9.9 \u00b1 5.2 years) and the other 144 were IFN-untreated (male 75; female 69; average age 50.4 \u00b1 12.1 years old; average observational period, 9.9 \u00b1 5.3 years). Survival status was examined by medical records or direct questionnaires. Results: Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved in 221 (38.3%) of 577 patients. HCC developed in 25.7% of untreated, 2.3% of SVR and 23.6% of non-SVR patients. Annual mortality rate of overall death was 3.19, 0.44 and 1.98% and that of liver related death was 2.52, 0.10 and 1.26% in untreated, SVR and non-SVR patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis showed that the risk factors for overall death were male (RR 2.186), over 50 years old (RR 3.172), fibrotic stage (RR for F2, F3 and F4 was 2.807, 2.240 and 5.848, respectively), SVR (RR 0.173) and ALT C80 IU/ L (RR 1.878). None of 221 patients with SVR became HCV-RNA seropositive during observation period (average 6.9 \u00b1 5.2 years). The aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index decreased significantly in patients with SVR, but not in those with non-SVR.Conclusions: Favorable prognosis was observed in patients who achieved SVR, but not in those without SVR. Reappearance of HCV-RNA in patients with SVR was not detected in this long-term cohort study.Top 10% PostersRelapse Rate after Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2a and Ribavirin Therapy in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C SeokHyun Kim 1 , NamHwan Park 1 , KwanWoo Nam 1 , HeeJung Lee 1 , EaumSeok Lee 1 , ByungSeok Lee 1 , HeonYoung Lee 1 , JaeHoon Jung 2",

BMS-650032 was safe and well tolerated at single doses up to 1200 mg and up to 600 mg Q12hr for 14 days in healthy subjects. Methods: Two randomized, placebo-controlled studies evaluated single and multiple ascending doses of BMS-650032 in subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1. In study 002 (SAD), BMS-650032 was administered to treatment-na\u00efve and experienced subjects at doses of 10, 50, 200 and 600 mg (6 subjects per dose; active placebo). Study 004 (MAD) included na\u00efve subjects only and evaluated 3 days of BMS-650032 at doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg Q12 h (5 subjects per dose; active placebo). Results: There were no deaths or discontinuations due to AEs and all AEs were mild to moderate. SAD: BMS-650032 exposures increased in a dose-related manner and were similar or higher to that observed in healthy subjects. Tmax was *2 to 4 h, mean terminal half-life was *15 to 20 h, and mean oral clearance ranged from 302 to 491 L/h. Actively treated subjects experienced a mean decline in HCV RNA of *0.5, *2.0, *2.1 log 10 at 16 h after a single 50, 200 and 600 mg dose of BMS-650032, respectively. Maximal activity of the 600 mg dose occurred at 24 h with a mean decline of HCV RNA of *2.4 log 10 . MAD: Maximal antiviral responses with 200, 400 mg and 600 mg Q12 h BMS-650032 were observed at Day 3. Treated subjects experienced a mean decline in HCV RNA of 3.1, 3.3 and 3.4 log 10 for the 200, 400 and 600 mg Q12 doses, respectively. Conclusions: Based on the favorable safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity demonstrated herein, further development of BMS-650032 in combination with peg-IFN/RBV, an NS5A inhibitor and/or with other direct acting antivirals is warranted.PP320 A Phase 1b Dose-Ranging Study of 4 Weeks of PEG-Interferon (IFN) Lambda (PEG-IFN-k) in Combination with Ribavirin (RBV) in Patients with Chronic Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection A.J.

The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between insulin resistance (IR) or diabetes mellitus and SVR rates in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Methods: Between 2003 and 2008 a total 680 adult patients (55 patients with carbohydrates disorders-insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus) with chronic hepatitis C and 248 patients with chronic hepatitis B were evaluated. Overweight was defined as BMI [25 kg/m 2 , and IR as HOMA [2. Serum HCV RNA and genotype were determined for all patients. Fibrosis was evaluated using Metavir score. Severe fibrosis was F3-F4. Results: 82% of the patients were with genotype 1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is more often seen in patients with CHC (8 vs. 2% in patients with CHB). Severe fibrosis and cirrhosis (F3-F4) among patients with diabetes mellitus and high IR (HOMA-IR[4)  were appeared in 53% cases. SVR in patients with low IR (HOMA-IR \\4) was 63% (vs. 9% in patients with high HOMA-IR[ 4). SVR among chronic hepatitis C patients with diabetes mellitus was 27%. Lowest SVR (18%) was appeared in patients with BMI [30 kg/m 2 . Most of chronic hepatitis C patients with diabetes mellitus had BMI [25 kg/m 2 (85%). Conclusions: Insulin resistance emerges as the most important host factors in the prediction of response in non-diabetic patients treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin. Management of IR should become part of the assessment of chronic hepatitis C patients. Diabetes mellitus is a predictor of treatment failure in HCV patients treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, especially in group of the patients with BMI [30 kg/m 2 .Estimation of Insulin Resistance in Patients with Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Virus Related Chronic Liver DiseaseAkmat Ali 1 , Mamun Mahtab 1 , Salimur Rahman 1 , Mobin Khan 1Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, BangladeshBackground: Liver is the principal organ regulating carbohydrate metabolism. It is still unclear whether hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus are responsible for insulin resistance. The aims of the study was to evaluate if patients with HBV and HCV related chronic liver disease (CLD) develop insulin resistance (IR) * p-value \\ 0.05 comparison of responders and non responders and to compare if there is any difference in the IR between these two groups of patients. Methods: 30 patients of HBV and 30 patients of HCV related CLD between 20 and 60 years were studied. They had no metabolic syndrome. Result: Mean age of HBV and HCV related chronic liver disease were 35.37 \u00b1 10.04 and 42.33 \u00b1 12.88 years respectively. Mean fasting serum insulin 7.06 \u00b1 2.2 lU/ml in HBV related CLD and 9.08 \u00b1 3.06 in HCV related CLD groups. The difference of mean fasting serum insulin was significant between the two groups (p = 0.013). The mean fasting serum glucose in HBV related CLD and in HCV related CLD groups were 4.37 \u00b1 .58 and 4.6 \u00b1 .59 mmol/L respectively (p = 0.781). The cutoff value of HOMA-IR was 1.73, mean HOMA-IR of HBV and HCV related chronic liver disease were 1.35 \u00b1 .44 and 1.89 \u00b1 .71 respectively (p = 0.001). The HOMA-IR value was significantly higher in HCV related CLD than those with HBV. Conclusion: HCV is likely to be independently associated with insulin resistance.Antioxidant and Immunomodulator Effect of Viusid \u00d2 in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C: A Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study Eduardo Vilar Gomez 1 , Yadina Martinez Perez 1 , Hector Vega Sanchez 1 , Mar\u00eda de la Concepcion Abreu Vazquez 1 , Ali Yasells Garcia 1 , Enrique Arus Soler 1 , Luis Calzadilla Bertot 1",

This study is to explore whether IFN combined with ribavirin can affect TBC1D20 expression in HepG2 and Huh7 cell lines. Methods: HepG2 and huhu7 cells were treated by various dose of interferon-2alpha (1-1,000 U/ml) and ribavirin (20-500 um/L). The mRNA levels of TBC1D20 in the cultured cells were quantified by real-time PCR.Results: It was shown that expression of TBC1D20 mRNA in HepG2 and huh7 cell lines had been suppressed in dose-dependent fashion by interferon 2a (IFN-2a) (p \\ 0.05). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the abundance of TBC1D20 mRNA decreased by roughly 90% following treatment with IFN-2a (1,000 U/ml) .Here we show there was no potential role of ribavirin in expression of TBC1D20 mRNA in HepG2 and Huh7 cells (p [ 0.05). No synergistic effect on suppression of human TBC1D20 mRNA by interferon 2a (IFN2a) and ribavirin were found (p [ 0.05). Conclusions: These results raise the possibility that suppressing the expression of TBC1D20 in host hepatocytes may be one of the antiviral mechanisms of Interferon-2a.Ain Shams University, Faculty of Pharmacy, Abbasia, Cairo, Egypt, 2 Tanta University, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta,Faculty of Medicine",

The sustained virological response (SVR) in treatment of CHC genotype 4 using this combination therapy for 48 weeks is about 60%. Objective: Assessment of the efficacy of a novel 20-KDa linear PEG interferon a-2a (Reiferon Retard \u00d2 ) derived from Hansenula polymorha expression system combined with Ribavirin for treatment of CHC genotype 4. Patients and methods: One hundred and four patients biopsy proven CHC genotype 4 assigned to receive a fixed weekly dose of 160 lg of the PEG interferon (Reiferon Retard \u00d2 ) in combination with Ribavirin 13 mg/kg and were followed up by PCR after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. End of treatment response (ETR) defined as lose of detectable HCV RNA by PCR at week 48, SVR rate defined as lose of detectable HCV RNA by PCR at week 72 (24 weeks post-treatment) and possible side effects o the drug were reported. Results: One hundred and four patients (19 females and 85 males) received the treatment for 48 weeks, At 12 weeks the overall early response was 54%, ERT at 48 weeks was 43.2% and SVR at 72 weeks revealed an overall response rate Treatment of CHC genotype 4 with once weekly Reiferon Retard \u00d2 plus Ribavirin for 48 weeks produces only 25% SVR which is significantly lower than other PEG-interferons.Outcomes of Conseus Interferon and Riba Therapy for Chronic Hep C G3Patients Who Relapsed with Previous Peg-Interferon and Riba Therapy Uzma Adeeb 1 , Fatima Khatak 1 , Muzzaffar Gill 1Maroof International Hospital F 10 Markaz IslamabadAims and objectives: There are no published studies about the efficacy of consensus interferon and Riba combination in chronic hepatitis C (G3) relapsers wiith Peginterferon Riba combination therapy. To evaluate the efficacy of consensus interferon and Ribavirin in patients previously treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy. We consecutively enrolled 20 patients with chronic hepatitis C G3 who relapsed with previous treatment with pegylated interferon for atleast 6 months. Methods: The study was conducted between February 2009 to September 2009. Inclusion criteria: Chronic hepatitis C G3 relapsers patients with documented history of Pegylated interferon and Ribavirin therapy for 6 months. Exclusion criteria: Active psychiatric history, platelet count \\75,000, INR [1.5, S. Albumin \\2.5, portal vein diameter [13 mm on ultrasound and active ischemic heart disease. All enrolled patients have CBC, ALT, HCV PCR quantitative, HCV genotype, thyroid function tests and blood sugar. Patients were given 15 lg thrice weekly consensus interferon and Ribavirin 400 mg bid.The treatment duration was for 6 months. Patients were reviewed 4 weekly basis for clinical examination and CBC. We did check HCV PCR quantitative at week 12. The patients who had HCV PCR negative or 50% reduction in HCV PCR at week 12 were given further 3 months of therapy. Results: Among 20 patients 15 were male and 5 were female. Median age was 45. Median viral load was 900,000 IU/ml .Sixteen out of 20 (80%) patients were HCVPCR negative at week 12 of therapy. These 16 patients completed further 12 weeks of therapy and remained HCVPCR negative at end of total 24 weeks of therapy. Two patients required filgrastin to keep neutrophil count in normal range. Conclusion: Consensus interferon (infergen) Ribavirin combination is very optimistic option for HEP C G3 relapsers with Peg Interferon Riba combination. Further studies are needed to confirm/refute these observation. We did give 6 months of therapy because of financial consideration.Occurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Achieving Sustained Virological Response to Interferon Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Rika Ishii 1 , Takafumi Saito 1 , Hisayoshi Watanabe 1 , Kazuo Okumoto 1 , Yuko Nishise 1 , Jun-Itsu Ito 1 , Koji Saito 1 , Hitoshi Togashi 2 , Sumio Kawata 1 Department of Gastroenterology Yamagata University Faculty of Medicine, 2-2-2 Iida-Nishi Yamagata Yamagata Japan, 2 Yamagata University Health Administration Center, 1-4-12 Kojirakawamachi Yamagata Yamagata Japan Background: Interferon (IFN) therpy has been reported to improve serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Complete eradication of HCV reduces the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Although, several cases have been reported that HCC developed in patients after achieving sustained virological response (SVR) to interferon therapy. Methods: We identified four patients who developed HCC despite SVR (male 3, female 1). Result: The mean age of the patients was 65.0 years and the mean interval until detection of the initial HCC after achievement of SVR was 46.8 months. Activity of hepatitis and stage of fibrosis of noncancerous tissue were also determined according to the international standard classification before and after IFN therapy. At the time of HCC diagnosis, 3 remained noncirrhotic, but one had progressed to cirrhosis. The mean tumor size was 32.4 mm in diameter, and mean level of AFP and PIVKA-2 were 31.18 ng/ml (\\10 ng/ml) and 64.3 mAU/ml (\\40 mAU/ml), respectively. Pathological diagnosis was performed in each HCC, 4 of them were moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and one was poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. 3 patients underwent surgical treatment for initial HCC. However, one patient already had a metastasis of lymph node at the operation, and 6 months later, computed tomography revealed portal venous invasion. Another patient had multiple bone metastasis 3 years after the operation. One patient were treated with radiofrequency ablation, however, HCC recurrence progressed quickly in both patients. Conclusion: Thus, our findings suggest that CHC patients need for careful follow-up, even if they achieve SVR to IFN therapy.Peginterferon Alfa-2a (40KD) (PEGASYS \u00d2 ) Plus Ribavirin (COPEGUS \u00d2 ) has a Wide Safety Margin in Patients Infected with HCV Genotype 1 Patrick Marcellin 1 , Donald M.

Recent trials have explored the use of a high induction dose (360 lg/week for 12 weeks) in difficult-to-treat patients. The aim of this analysis was to examine the safety margin of standard versus high dose peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD).Methods: Data were pooled from four randomized multicenter trials including naive and treatment-experienced patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) 180 or 360 lg/ week plus RBV 1,000/1,200 mg/day for 12 weeks (n = 1,549 and 863, respectively); after week 12, all patients received peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) 180 lg/wk. Safety outcomes were restricted to the first 12 weeks of treatment and included all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, treatment discontinuations, and dose modifications. Results: Demographics were similar for both groups with two-thirds of patients being male. Mean age was 45 versus 46 years (180 vs. 360 lg/week, respectively) and mean body mass index was 27 kg/m 2 in each group; a similar proportion of patients had bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis(19 vs. 23%). The overall reporting frequency of AEs and SAEs was similar in both groups and the same percentage of patients discontinued treatment for safety reasons (seetable). Significant predictors for discontinuation were Black race (p = 0.034) and lower serum albumin (p = 0.034), but not starting dose of peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) or gender. Conclusion: Administration of a high dose of peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) for 12 weeks is well tolerated, indicating a wide safety margin for its use.",

Methodology: The study is based on the records of 594 patients of hepatitis C, who completed 24 weeks of interferon therapy. The presence of Hep-C virus was confirmed through PCR. Each patient was given conventional interferon alpha 2b thrice a week + Ribavirin 800 mg daily for 6 months. After 6 months of treatment, qualitative PCR for HCV RNA was carried out to know End of Treatment Response. Those found PCR negative were declared as ETR responders. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 15 to 63 years with a mean age (\u00b1SD) of 35.8 \u00b1 8.7 years. Eighty-seven percent were married. Out of them, 433 cases (72.8%) were categorized as Responders based on clearance of virus as determinant by PCR. The End of Treatment Response (ETR) was 72.8%. These responders were followed for another 24 weeks. Another qualitative PCR was done to confirm the absence of HCV. Two hundred and eight responders were free from HCV showing an SVR of 48%. Conclusion: ETR of 72.8% signifies the success of therapy. The success rate is similar to other studies from Pakistan and abroad.Rapid Virological Response is a Predictor of Sustained Virological Response in Chronic Hep C G3 Patients Treated with Pegasys and RibavirinUzma Adeeb 1 , Fatima Khattak 1 , Gill Muzzaffar 1Maroof International Hospital, Markez F10 IslamabdIntroduction: Genotype (GT) is generally considered the most important predictor of sustained virological response (SVR). Role of viral clearance at week 4 i.e. rapid virological response (RVR) to predict SVR is not adequately studied in Chronic HepC G3 patients. We wanted to study the importance of rapid virological response (RVR) to predict SVR in chronic HepC G3 patients. Aims & Methods: A prospective study was conducted in our institution between January 2008 to January 2009. 150 consecutive chronic Hep C G3 patients eligible for treatment were enrolled in this study. They were given 180 ucg of pegasys weekly along with Ribavirin 400 mg twice daily. Treatment duration was for 6 months. They were seen in outpatient clinic on 4 weekly basis.Quantitativ HCVPCR was done at baseline at week 4, week 12 and week 24 during treatment and then 6 months after the completion of treatment to establish SVR.RVR was defined as HCVRNA \\50 IU/ml at week of therapy Complete EVR was defined as HCVPCR \\50 IU/ml at week 12 of therapy and partial EVR was defined as [2log10 drop in HCVPCR at week 12 of therapy. Results: Out of 150 patients 140 were available for analysis. Median age was 44, median ALT was 90, median HCVPCR was 850,000 IU/ml. Logistic regression analysis was done. RVR was considered independent/predictor variable and SVR (sustained virological response) was considered dependent/outcome variable.100 out of 150 (67%) patients had RVR and SVR in that group was 88%. 30 patients had EVR (20%) and SVR was 60%. Conclusion: Rapid virological response (RVR) is a good predictor of Sustained virological response (SVR) in HCV G3 patients. Patients who do not have RVR but EVR may need therapy for 9 months to a year. Further studies are needed to confirm this observation.PP339Outcomes of Chronic HepC G3 Cirrhotics Treated with Pegintron and Ribavirin Uzma Adeeb 1 , Fatima Khatak 1 , Muzzaffar Gill 1Maroof International Hospital, Markez F10 IslamabdIntroduction: Treating HCV cirrhotics is very controversial and difficult. There are side effects of treatment and poor tolerability with questionable efficacy. It is very pertinent to identify non responder patients early to avoid unnecessary prolonged treatment. Rapid virological response (RVR) is defined as HCVPCR negative after 4 weeks of Peginterferon and Ribavirin therapy and is highly predictive of sustained virological (SVR). We wanted to study the prognostic value of RVR in HEPC G3 compensated cirrhotics. Aims & Methods: This study was conducted in our institution from January 2007 to January 2008. 50 consecutive Hep C G3 compensated cirrhotics (child B) were included in this study. They were given 1 ucg/kg of pegintron/ week and 400 mg BID of Ribavirin. Treatment was given for 24 weeks. These patients were seen at 4 weekly basis. They had HCVPCR done at week, 4, 12, 24 and 6 months after completing the treatment. All patients were G3, mean age 48. 35 were males and 15 were females. Results: Out of 50 patients 5 patients lost to F/U.22 out of 50 (44%) patients were HCVPCR negative at week 4 and 24.This was labelled as group A. After 6 months completion of therapy 20 patients (40%) were HCVPCR negative (SVR). Twelve out of 50 (25%) patients were negative at week 12 and week 24.This group was labelled as group B. Six months after completion of therapy 8 patients (16%) were HCVPCR negative (SVR). Nine patients were HCVPCR positive after 12 weeks of therapy and were labelled as non responders. Conclusion: Overall treatment response is significantly lower in HEP C G3 Cirrhotics. 4 week stopping role in this patient population may be considered to avoid unnecessary complications of treatment. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations.Hepatocyte Growth Factor Activator in Liver Biopsies of EgyptianPatients with Hepatitis C Virus-Related Chronic Hepatitis: Correlation with Hepatic Repair Doha Taie 1 , Nermine Ehsan 1 , Rehab Samaka 2 , Hayam Aiad 2 , Mona Kandil 2 National Liver Institute, Department of Pathology, Menoufiya University, 2 Faculty of Medicine, Menoufiya University",

However, due to the smaller stature of Koreans, the current recommended ribavirin dose results in a higher ribavirin dose, especially for lowweight patients, but the efficacy of the current ribavirin dosing has not been thoroughly assessed. Methods: A total of 129 treatment na\u00efve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients were reviewed retrospectively.Result: The ribavirin dose was C16 mg/kg in 57 patients (44%) and \\16 mg/ kg in 72 patients (56%). The patients with a higher ribavirin dose (C16 mg/kg) experienced more ribavirin associated side effects (60 vs. 24%, p \\ 0.001) as well as a significant lower ribavirin adherence (mean of 0.71 vs. 0.81, p = 0.025), but the sustained virologic response (SVR) was similar (63 vs. 65%, p = 0.803). A ribavirin dose of C16 mg/kg was not an independent factor associated with SVR, while it was an independent risk factor for ribavirin associated side effects. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the current ribavirin dosing regimen should be reassessed for Korean patients with RBV dose C16 mg/kg.

Results: Treatment of Huh7/Con1 with IFN-b and ribavirin, could upregulate ISG54 mRNA and cause a cytostatic effect on cell growth respectively. Ribavirin could suppress HCV RNA modestly. MicroRNA array could detect 151 microRNAs in Huh7/Con1, but only identify two-to sixfold changes of 13 marginal microRNAs in response to IFN-b and ribavirin, where miR-574-3p and miR-638 were validated by qPCR. Conclusions: MicroRNAs might not be critical parameters for synergistic anti-HCV action of interferon and ribavirin in vitro.Baseline Characteristics and Interim on-treatment Responses from the Real-world PROPHESYS Cohorts Inform Future Treatment Paradigms for Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) Peter Ferenci 1 , Alan D.

Each cohort is run according to country-specific requirements. Patients are treated in accordance with the local label. Methods: In PROPHESYS 1, data are collected from patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS \u00d2 ) plus ribavirin (RBV, COPEGUS \u00d2 ). In PROPHESYS 2/3, data are collected from patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a/RBV or peginterferon alfa-2b/RBV. This interim analysis is for treatment-naive patients with baseline and week 12 HCV RNA. We assessed the proportion of patients who had undetectable HCV RNA (\\15 IU/mL) by week 4 (RVR) or week 12 (cEVR), or who had detectable HCV RNA but C2-log drop at week 12 (pEVR). Results: Overall, 2,781 patients received peginterferon alfa-2a/RBV (PROPHESYS 1/2/3; table). By MLR analysis, RVR or cEVR in genotype 1 (G1) patients was significantly (p \\ 0.01) associated with younger age, Asian race or Caucasian/other race (vs. Black/Hispanic race), lower viral load, higher ALT ratio, no cirrhosis or unknown histologic diagnosis versus cirrhosis, and higher platelets. In PROPHESYS 2/3, 495 G1/4 patients received peginterferon alfa-2a/RBV (n = 422) or peginterferon alfa-2b/RBV (n = 73). By MLR factors significantly associated with viral clearance in G1 patients were Asian In this large cohort, patient demographics differed by genotype. A high proportion of patients had undetectable HCV RNA, and predictors of viral clearance were similar to those reported in randomized trials.

However, many studies investigating virological responses utilized assays with relatively high detection limits, reported qualitative data only, or did not adjust for baseline variables that influence SVR, such as hepatic fibrosis. Aim: To determine the probability of SVR in different fibrosis stages in relation to quantitative measurements of viral load at week 4 (VL 4 ), week 8 (VL 8 ) and week 12 (VL 12 ). Methods: 309 HCV genotype 1 subjects with prior liver biopsy were treated with peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) (PEGASUS \u00d2 ) 180 lg/week and ribavirin (RBV; COPEGUS \u00d2 ) 1,000/1,200 mg/day for 48 weeks in the CHARIOT study. VL 4, VL 8 and VL 12 were assessed using TaqMan TM (detection limit of 15 IU/mL). Multiple linear regression models were developed with significant baseline factors (race, Metavir score) and either VL 4 , VL 8 , or VL 12 . The probability of an SVR was estimated from these models for different levels of VL 4 , VL 8 , and VL 12 for Caucasians in different fibrosis stages. Results: Relationships among SVR, VL 4 , VL 8 , VL 12 , and fibrosis stage are illustrated (seefigure). Patients with stage F3/4 had a lower probability of achieving an SVR for each value of VL 4 , VL 8 , and VL 12 . For all fibrosis groups, the probability of achieving an SVR was generally higher for VL 4 and lower for VL 8 and VL 12 . Conclusions: Combining Metavir score with early viral load measurements can predict SVR in patients undergoing HCV treatment. Early on-treatment viral load measurement combined with severity of liver fibrosis may influence treatment decisions during therapy. PEGASYS \u00d2 ) 180 lg/week plus ribavirin (RBV; COPEGUS \u00d2 ) 800-1,200 mg/day for 48 weeks were analyzed for serious AEs (SAEs) and non-serious AEs of special interest (dose reductions/discontinuations for AEs, neutrophils \\750 /mm 3 , platelets \\50,000 /mm 3 and Hgb \\10 g/dL). This program ran from 2000 to 2007 in 55 countries. Potential predictors of dose reductions/discontinuations were analyzed by MLR. Results: Mean age was 44.7 years, 68.7% of patients were male, and 23.5% had cirrhosis. Asian patients were less likely to have cirrhosis (11.9%) than non-Asian patients (23.9%), but were of a similar age (43.6 vs. 44.7 years, respectively). Overall, 63.4 and 55.9% of patients completed 48 weeks' treatment with peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) and RBV, respectively, with Asian patients more likely to complete treatment; 6.6% experienced C1 SAE (3.2% treatment-related) and 44.0% experienced C1 non-serious AE of special interest. Twenty-eight patients (0.4%) died (two treatment-related). Dose modifications of peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) or RBV for AEs occurred in 24.4 and 16.2% of Asian patients and non-Asian patients, respectively; premature withdrawal for AEs occurred in 10.3 and 11.4% of patients. See table for factors associated with dose reductions/withdrawal. Conclusion: Older patients, females, and those with cirrhosis are more likely to have dose reductions for AEs. Asian patients were more likely to have dose reductions of RBV (but not discontinue RBV or discontinue/dose reduce peginterferon alfa-2a [40 KD]). Increasing age predicted discontinuations of both drugs and female gender predicted discontinuation of RBV.PP357Efficacy of new PEG-Interferon a-2a (Reiferon Retard \u00d2 ) Plus Ribavirin in Egyption Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Gamal Shiha 1 , Shahera El-Etreby 1 , Khaled Zalata 1 , Waleed Samir 1 , Amira Elbeeh 2Mansoura University, Egypt, 2 Biotechnology Research Center, New Damitta, EgyptBackground: The standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a combination of ribavirin plus pegylated interferon (PEG-interferon alfa-2b, 12 KDa or PEG-interferon alfa-2a, 40 KDa). The sustained virological response (SVR) in treatment of CHC genotype 4 using this combination therapy for 48 weeks is about 60%. Objective: Assessment of the efficacy of a novel 20-KDa linear PEG interferon a-2a (Reiferon Retard \u00d2 ) derived from Hansenula polymorha expression system combined with Ribavirin for treatment of CHC genotype 4. Patients and Methods: One hundred and four patients biopsy proven CHC genotype 4 assigned to receive a fixed weekly dose of 160 lg of the PEG interferon (Reiferon Retard \u00d2 ) in combination with Ribavirin 13 mg/kg and were followed up by PCR after 3, 6, 12 and 18 months . End of treatment response (ETR) defined as lose of detectable HCV RNA by PCR at week 48, SVR rate defined as lose of detectable HCV RNA by PCR at week 72 (24 weeks post-treatment) and possible side effects of the drug were reported. Results: One hundred and four patients(19 females, 85 males) received the treatment for 48 weeks. At 12 weeks the overall early response was 54%, ERT at 48 weeks was 43.2% and SVR at 72 weeks revealed an overall response rate 25% viral clearance. Relapse rate was 42.2% (19/45) of patients. There were notably minimal haematologic complication. Conclusion: Treatment of CHC genotype 4 with once weekly Reiferon Retard \u00d2 plus Ribavirin for 48 weeks produces only 25% SVR which is significantly lower than other PEG-interferons.

Reasons for nontreatment were as follows: 40.3% declined treatment, 16.0% had advanced liver disease, 11.8% were considered too elderly, 14.3% had minimal liver injury on histology, 8.4% had psychiatric history, 5.0% had significant coexisting medical comorbidities and 4.2% had ongoing alcohol or substance abuse. Independent predictors for non-treatment on multivariate analysis were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = 0.004), female gender (aOR 1.75,.08, p = 0.05), psychiatric history (aOR 3.39, 95% CI 1.06-10.87, p = 0.04) and advanced liver disease (aOR 6.05, 95% CI 1.66-22.00, p = 0.06). Conclusions: Current treatment uptake for CHC patients was suboptimal, as a large proportion of patients were either reluctant for treatment or not suitable for the current antiviral therapy. Multidisciplinary interventions are needed in the short term while superior alternative antiviral therapy is desired in the long term to overcome barriers to treatmentPP359 A Need for a Dynamic Approach to Modelling Disease Progression in Cost-Effectiveness Studies of Antiviral Therapies in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Phil McEwan 1 , Yong Yuan 2 , Ray Kim 3 Cardiff Research Consortium, Eastgate House, 35-43 Newport Road, Cardiff, UK, CF24 0AB, 2 Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey, USA., 3 Mayo Clinc, Rochester, Minnesota, USABackground: Current models describing the natural history of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) use static rates of disease progression. This can have important implications for cost-effectiveness results obtained when modelling certain sub-groups, in particular, patients of advanced age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of utilising age-dependent disease progression rates on the cost-effectiveness outcome obtained in a CHC model. Methods: A Markov model describing the natural history of CHC in genotype 1 patients was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavarin versus interferon and ribavarin. The model was populated with data and validated using a previously published costeffectiveness model(Sullivan et al. 2004). The model was then re-calibrated using different rates of disease progression between CHC and compensated cirrhosis. A third party payer's perspective was adopted and the analysis was run over the patient's expected lifetime with costs and utility discounted at 3.5%. Results: The table below reports the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) obtained with age-independent (basecase) and age-dependent disease progression rates. The use of age-dependent progression rates has a considerable impact, particularly in patients of advanced age(65, 75)where the costeffectiveness results are improved by 40 and 30% respectively. Conclusion: Epidemiological studies that better characterise the rate of agedependent disease progression in CHC patients are needed if the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of new interventions is to be robust and fit for purpose; particularly when considering treating patients of advanced age.PP360 Treatment of Chinese Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C with Peginterferon Alfa-2a (40 KD) plus Ribavirin (RBV) Ling-Li He 1 , Yang Chen 1 , Zhu Chen 1 , Hong Tang 1 , Bing-Jun Lei 1 , Xue-Zhong Lei 1 West China Hospital, Center for Infectious Diseases, Sichuan University, Sichuan, ChinaBackground: The combination of peginterferon plus ribavirin cures chronic hepatitis C in 50-60% of Western patients and is the standard of care for this condition; however, few data are available on the efficacy/safety of this combination in Chinese patients. Methods: We analyzed data from 108 patients treated for 48 weeks with peginterferon alfa-2a 180 lg/wk plus ribavirin 800 mg/day (if \\65 kg) or 1,000 mg/day (if C65 kg) under care at Hua Xi Hospital between April 2004 and March 2008. HCV RNA was assessed at baseline, week 4 and 12, the end of treatment (EOT), and after 24 weeks' follow-up (sustained virological response; SVR) with a test range of 1.0 9 10 3 to 5.0 9 10 7 IU/mL. Patients were stratified by age, gender, route of transmission, duration of infection, baseline HCV RNA level and RBV dosage.Results: Of the 108 patients treated, 58 were female, mean age was 39 years and mean HCV RNA was 6.21 \u00b1 0.82 IU/mL (range 3.98-7.70). HCV genotype was assessed in 29 patients (genotype 1b, 21; genotype 2a, 7; genotype 1b/2a, 1). Rapid virological response (RVR; HCV RNA negative at week 4), early virological response (EVR; HCV RNA negative at week 12), EOT response, and SVR were achieved in 84 (78%), 105 (98%), 105 (98%), and 95 (88%) patients, respectively (10 relapsed; 2 had breakthrough, 1 was a non-responder). Younger age, female gender, infection by a route other than surgery/blood product exposure, and RBV exposure [60% were associated with higher SVR rates. Patients with an RVR had higher SVR rates and lower relapse rates than patients with an EVR. Conclusion: Chinese patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin have high rates of RVR, EVR, and SVR. This analysis suggests that overall SVR rates in Chinese patients are higher than those typical of Western patients.Evaluation of Egyptian Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 4 with Persistently Normal ALT Including Response to Antiviral Therapy Alyaa Sabry 1 , Naglaa Allam 1 , Medhat Asem 1 , Maha Allam 2 , Hana Badran 1 , Eman Rewisha 1 , Imam Waked 1 Hepatology, National Liver Institute, Shebeen Al-koam, Menofeya, Egypt, 2 Clinical Pathology, National Liver Institute, Shebeen Al-koam, Menofeya, Egypt Background and Aims: Approximately 25% of patients with chronic hepatitis C (10-46%) present with persistently normal serum ALT (PNALT). In these individuals, the extent and rate of disease progression as well as the need for treatment remain controversial. Hence the aims of the present study were to compare between the fibrosis score in Egyptian chronic hepatitis C patients genotype 4 with PNALT and those with elevated ALT levels (EALT) and, in addition, to evaluate their response to treatment with pegylated interferon a-2a (180 lg weekly) and ribavirin. Methods: 206 patients attending the National Liver Institute from January 2005 to May 2009 were recruited. Normal ALT was set as \\30 IU/ml in males; \\19 IU/ ml in females on 3 consecutive measurements 2 months apart. 104 patients presented with EALT and 102 with PNALT. Fibrosis score, early (EVR), end of treatment (ETR) and sustained virological response (SVR) were assessed. Results: Patients with PNALT were younger and weighed less but the difference was not significant. Most of the patients with PNALT (73.5%) had mild fibrosis [F0-F2] versus 56% of patients with EALT (p = \\ 0.01). Advanced fibrosis and high body mass index served as significant predictors of nonresponse to therapy in both groups. No significant difference between the two groups regarding ETR and SVR was detected. A significant correlation between the development of anemia on treatment and SVR in both EALT (p = \\0.01) and PNALT (p = \\0.05) was found. Conclusion: Treatment of patients with PNALT should not be deferred based only on their ALT profile and it should be individualised.",

However, Taiwanese patients could obtain satisfactory treatment results with 24-week therapy. Whether 48-week therapy is superior to 24-week therapy in Taiwanese patients with genotype 1 CHC is unclear and needs investigation. Methods: In this open-label, randomized, multi-center study, treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 CHC received peginterferon alfa-2b (1.5 lg/kg/wk) plus ribavirin(1,(0)(1)200 mg/day) for 24 weeks and were then randomized to discontinue or continue the treatment for 24 weeks further. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response(SVR, undetectable HCV-RNA at  follow-up [FU]  week 24). Secondary endpoints included end-of-treatment (EOT) response and virologic response 48 weeks after randomization. Results: Totally 160 patients were enrolled (24-week treatment n = 78; 48-week treatment, n = 82). There were more male patients in the 24-week arm (74.4 vs. 52.4%, P = 0.004), and those who completed the treatment and FU was 69.2% in 24-week arm and 87.8% in 48-week arm. EOT response was similar between 24-and 48-week arms (85.9 vs. 84.2%). SVR tended to be lower in 24-week arm (56.4 vs. 67.1%; P = 0.165) indicating a higher relapse rate in those with 24-week treatment. At 48 weeks after randomization, virologic response rates were 67.1% in 48-week arm (FU week 24) and 57.7% in 24-week arm (FU week 48). Adverse events were more frequent in 48-week arm (76.83 vs. 58.97%, P = 0.015). Conclusions: No significant difference in SVR was detected between 24-week or 48-wk treatment for Taiwanese patients with genotype 1 CHC. However, the high drop-out rate in the 24-week arm should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. There seemed a tendency of better response in the 48-week treatment.Nurse-Provided Therapeutic Education in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Treated By Peg-Interferon-Alpha2a-Ribavirin: Impact on Quality of Life Dominique Larrey 1,2 , Annie Sals\u00e9 1 , Christelle Castelli 3 , Marie-C\u00e9cile Bozonnat 3 , Gerges-Philippe Pageaux 1 , Didier Ribard 4 , Natalia Kharlov 5 , Jean-Pierre Daur\u00e8s 3 , Study Group PEGOBS 1 Liver Unit, Saint-Eloi Hospital -Montpellier, 2 Unit 632, INSERM -Montpellier, 3 Biostatistics Department, IURC -Montpellier,4  Hepato-Gastroenterology, Caremeau Hospital -N\u0131\u02c6mes,5 Clinical Research, Roche LaboratoryBackground: Recently, we reported that nurse-provided therapeutic education (TE), significantly increased adherence to treatment and virologic response in pts with chronic hepatitis C treated by Peg-Interferon-alpha2a-Ribavirin in a prospective multicentric randomized study (PEGOBS) (Larrey et al.Hepatology 2007; 46: 377 (310)). Aim: To evaluate the impact of TE on quality of life (QoL) during this study. Methods: PEGOBS included 123 pts in TE group versus 121 pts in control group with pragmatic follow-up (C). QoL was analyzed by 2 auto-questionnaires: SF36 (short form 36), with 8 dimensions, comprising 36 questions; NHP (Nottingham's Health Profil), with 38 questions. Comparative analysis of QoL was performed according to the course and duration of treatment and characteristics of pts. Results: NHP showed QoL alteration during the treatment, which was more important for the longer treatment, 48 versus 24 weeks (NHP score +39 points, p = 0.04, without difference between groups TE and C). SF36 allowed analysis by dimension and on physical and psychological scores. Overall, there was no difference between the 2 groups in all pts. There was an alteration of psychological score in pts of TE versus C group, with extensive fibrosis (F3-F4) (-12 points, p = 0.001). Alteration was further increased for the following parameters: age [48 years, HCV genotype 1, previous treatment failure. Conclusion: Systematic nurse-provided TE which allows to improve adherence to treatment and sustained virological response, particularly in difficult-to-treat pts is associated with a stress which induces an alteration of the psychological aspect of QoL. These results suggest to improve TE method to find the best compromise balance between adherence, virological response and impact on QoL.PP364A Response-Guided-Therapy is Feasible in Peginterferon Plus Ribavirin Combination Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Patients with Genotype 1 and Amino Acid Substitutions in the Core Region Yoshiaki Iwasaki 1 , Fusao Ikeda 1 , Akinobu Takaki 1 , Testuya Yasunaka 1 , Yasuhiro Miyake 1 , Haruhiko Kobashi 1 , Kazuhide Yamamoto 1 Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1, Shikata-cho, Kita-ku, Okayama 700-8558, JapanBackground/Aims: Recently, substitutions of amino acids 70 and 91 in the core region were shown to predict resistance to combination therapy of peginterferon plus ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C. In this prospective cohort study, we sought a possibility of the response-guidedtherapy for these difficult-to-treat patients. Methods: A total of 75 patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 and high viral load (C100 KIU/mL) were treated with peginterferon alpha-2b (1.5 mg/kg weight) plus weight-based dosing of ribavirin. Patients with an early virological response (cEVR), a negative result of qualitative HCV RNA test at week 12, were treated for 48 weeks, whereas those without cEVR but with a negative result of HCV RNA test by week 24 (LVR) were treated for up to 72 weeks. Using pretreatment sera, the amino acid sequences of the HCV core at positions 70 and 91 and of the interferon sensitivity determining region (ISDR) were analyzed. Results: Of 75 patients, 65 (87%) had no or one amino acid substitution in the ISDR. Of the 65 patients with wild type ISDR, 23 (35%) had core amino acid substitution at 70, 20 (31%) had substitution at 91, and eight (12%) had both substitutions at positions 70 and 91. In the eight patients with the double substitutions, five completed treatment and the rest discontinued treatment due to poor response or adverse events. Of the five patients who completed treatment, both of the two patients with cEVR achieved sustained virological response (SVR) with standard 48-week treatment. In the remaining three patients with LVR, two successfully achieved SVR and one relapsed after extended 72-week treatment. Conclusions: A response-guided-therapy is feasible even in patients with amino acid substitutions in the core region.Transfer of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-Reactive T Cell Specificity for the Treatment of HCV-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma Yue-Ying Liu 1 , Ya-Hui Zhang 1 , Lucy Golden-Mason 2 , Hugo Rosen 2 , Michael Nishimura 1 , Yi Zhang 1 Medical University of South Carolina, 86 Jonathan Lucas Street, Suite 512C, Charleston, SC 29425, USA, 2 University of Colorado, 12605 East 16th Avenue, Aurora, CO, 80045, USABackground: An approach have recently been described that retroviral vectors encoding T cell receptor (TCR) genes are used to redirect the specificity of normal peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL)-derived T cells to recognize the tumor antigens. The therapy in which T cells have been genetically modified with TCR genes to recognize HCV would represent a novel approach for the treatment of HCV infections and HCV-related malignancies. Methods: We have previously shown that HCV + liver transplant patients that have received HLA disparate liver allografts have HCV reactive T cells of host origin in their peripheral blood that are restricted by the donor HLA molecules. Initial studies indicate that the TCRs expressed by HCV reactive T cell clones from these patients have relatively high affinity for their ligands. Results: We have cloned and expressed two TCRs which mediate recognition of the 1,406-1,415 and 1,073-1,081 epitopes from the HCV NS3 protein. The results indicate that these TCR transduced T cells can recognize the wild type epitopes, as well naturally occurring mutant variants of these epitopes. Most importantly, the TCR transduced T cells could also recognize HCV + hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Conclusions: These data suggest this high affinity HCV-specific TCR might have potential new immunotherapeutic implications.Effect of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) on the Efficacy of Standard Interferon (SdiF) Plus Ribavirin Combination Therapy in Patients of Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype-3Masroor Qazi 1 , Ali Imran 1 , Hashim Raza 1 , Ghulam Muhy-ud-din 2Quaid-e-Azam Medical College, Bahawalpur, 2 Nishter Medcial College, Multan, PakistanBackground: Relationship between chronic HCV infection and DM is very complex. Either HCV is common in DM or vice versa. DM is a possible risk factor for reduced efficacy of SdIF plus ribavirin combination therapy. Aim of the study was to examine the effect of DM on response to combination therapy in na\u00efve patients with chronic HCV genotype-3. Methods: An experimental study conducted at Quaid-e-Azam Medical College (QAMC)/Bahawal Victoria Hosptial (BVH), Bahawalpur, Pakistan (from 30 May 2006 to 30 June 2008). A total of 88 patients, with equal number of patients (44) in Group-A (HCV with DM) and Group-B (HCV without DM) of similar age, gender and BMI were included. All the patients were treated with SdIF plus ribavirin therapy for 6 months. End of treatment response (ETR) was noted in both the groups. Results: There were 58 (65.9%) males and 30 (34.1%) females. The age ranged from 28 to 55 years (mean = 42.41 years). Sixty-four (72.6%) patients were C40 years of age while 24 (27.4%) \\40 years. BMI was \\25 in 60 (68.2%) patients, while C25 in 28 (31.8%). ETR was 84.1%. ETR was reduced in Group-A as compared to Group B (79.5 vs. 88.6%, P = 0.244) but it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: DM does not significantly reduce the response of SdIF plus ribavirin combination therapy in chronic HCV genotype-3 patients when compared to non-diabetic chronic HCV genotype-3 patients of similar age, gender and BMI.Pegylated Interferon/Ribavirin Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Who Did Not Response to Previous Conventional Interferon/RibavirinTherapy Chia-Yen Dai 1,2,3 , Ming-Lung Yu 1,3 , Jee-Fu Huang 1,3 , Ming-Yen Hsieh 1 , Nai-Jen Hou 1 , Zu-Yau Lin 1,3 , Shinn-Cherng Chen 1,3 , Liang-Yen Wang 1,3 , Wen-Yu Chang 1,3 , Wan-Long Chuang 1,3 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, No. 100, Tzyou 1st Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 2 Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, No. 100, Tzyou 1st Rd, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, 3 College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, No. 100, Shihchuan 1st Rd, Kaohsiung, TaiwanBackground: Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) failing to respond to conventional interferon alfa (conIFN)/ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy might be retreated with pegylated interferon alfa (pegIFN)/ RBV. The aims of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of different regimens of pegIFN/RBV for conIFN/RBV relapsers or nonresponders. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 61 Taiwanese CHC patients (44 males, mean age 51.5 years) who have failed to respond to 24-week conIFN/RBV combination therapy (51 relapsers/10 nonresponders). Patients were re-treated with two regimens of pegIFN/RBV therapy: 39 patients for 24 weeks and 22 for 48 weeks. After cessation of therapy, patients received another 24 weeks follow up to determine whether they have sustained virological response (SVR) or not (defined as nonresponders). Results: Most of the enrolled patients were infected with HCV genotype 1 (85.2%, 52/61). After the pegIFN/RBV retreatment, the over all rapid virolgical response (RVR) rate and SVR rate were 26.2% and 50.8%, respectively. Patients with RVR and treated with 48 weeks have significantly higher SVR rates than patients who did not achieve RVR (81.3 vs. 40%, P = 0.005) and who were treated for 24 weeks (68.2 vs. 41%, P = 0.042). Other clinical factors including age, gender, previous response, HCV genotype, ALT level, HCV RNA level and BMI were not associated with the response to retreatment. Multivariate logistic regression showed achieving RVR [odds ratio (OR)/95% confidence interval (CI): 23.928/3.453-165.802] and a 48-week pegIFN/RBV combination therapy [OR/95% CI: 10.276/2.118-49.845] were independent predictors for SVR to the retreatment with PegIFN/RBV (P = 0.001 and 0.004, respectively).Conclusion: Around a half of Taiwanese HCV patients who failed to respond to previous conIFN/RBV combination therapy achieved SVR after pegIFN/RBV retreatment. Patients with a favorable on-treatment factor (achieving RVR) and receiving a longer duration of regimen (48-week) can gain a better response to the retreatment with pegIFN/RBV.Preliminary Findings on the Effectiveness of Heat-Treated EnterococcusFaecalis FK-23 Preparation in the Management of Hepatitis C Carriers Khin May Oo 1 , Aye Aye Lwin 1 , Yi Yi Kyaw 1 , Myat Tin Htwe Kyaw 1 , Ohmar Lwin 1 , Haymar Hpoo 1 , Takashi Shimada 2 , Shigeru Okada 3 A clinical trial on heat-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 preparation is being conducted on adult volunteer subjects who are anti-HCV positive with the objective of determining the effect of heat-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 (Fekalin 80) on reduction of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in hepatitis C carriers. One hundred and fifty anti-HCV positive persons between the ages of 18-60 years are screened for the study. Thirty participants (16 females and 14 males) who fulfilled the selection criteria and give voluntary consent are enrolled in the study. The age range of the subjects is (21 years to 60 years) and the mean age is (42.73 \u00b1 8.49) years. Each subject is given 2,700 mg of Fekalin 80 per day (1 packet 3 times daily) by oral route. Among the subjects, 21 had completed 3 months, 13 had completed 6 months, 10 had completed 9 months, and 6 had completed 12 months of therapy. Blood samples were taken at enrollment and at every 3 months of therapy. Significant decreases in ALT levels were observed at 3 months (34.18 \u00b1 12.43 vs. 60.20 \u00b1 6.94 IU/ml), at 6 month (35.38 \u00b1 11.8 vs. 60.26 \u00b1 6.94 IU/ml), (32.34 \u00b1 12.07 vs. 59.62 \u00b1 6.74 IU/ml) at 9 months and (30.2 \u00b1 13.67 vs. 63.38 \u00b1 5.77 IU/ml) at 12 months. Heat-treated Enterococcus faecalis FK-23 preparation is well-tolerated by the subjects and there are no major side-effects apart from the complaint of transient headache and giddiness and mild constipation in a small percentage of subjects.Clinical Outcome of Pegylated Interferon Plus Ribavirin Combination Therapy for Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Korea Young Oh Kweon 1 , Dong Seok Lee 1 , Soo Young Park 1 , Chang Min Cho 1 , Won Young Tak 1 , Jeong Heo 2 , Mong Cho 2 , Ki Tae Yoon 2 , Hyun Young Woo 2 Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea, 50, Samduk 2-Ga, Jung-Gu, Daegu, Korea, 2 Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Korea, 10, Amidong 2-Ga, Seo-Gu, Pusan, Korea Background/Aims: Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy is currently the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy for Korean patients with chronic HCV infection. Methods: Between April 2004 and March 2008, we consecutively enrolled 529 patients (338 genotype 1, 183 genotype 2, 8 others) with chronic HCV infection who received Peg-IFN plus ribavirin combination therapy in a standard medication protocol. Early virologic response, end of treatment response, sustained virologic response (SVR), relapse, and adverse events were analyzed. Results: Overall SVR rate was 54.4%; 42.2% in genotype 1 and 76.6% in genotype 2 patients. No significant difference was found in SVR between Peg-IFN a2a and Peg-IFN a2b received patients in each genotype. Relapse was observed in 29.4% of genotype 1 and 8.8% of genotype 2 patients. Nonresponse was observed in 14.2% of genotype 1 and 5.6% of genotype 2 patients. Adverse events were found in 437 (82.6%) patients. Adverse eventrelated dose modification of medications occurred in 248 (46.9%) patients. The patients with dose modification of Peg-IFN and/or RBV showed lower SVR rate compared to patients without dose modification (p \\ 0.001). Peg-IFN dose during entire period of treatment (OR 5.8; p \\ 0.001), and cumulative RBV dose after week 12 of treatment (OR 2.9; p \\ 0.001). Conclusions: The results of Peg-IFN plus RBV combination therapy for Korean chronic hepatitis C patients showed similar efficacy compared with that of western patients in real practice.

Jaundice and fatigue were the most frequent manifestations at diagnosis. Complete biochemical remission rate was about 61% in AIH, PBC, OS while 25% in AIC, PSC. Six patients (2 from AIH and 4 from PBC) developed HCC. The most common associated disease at diagnosis was thyroid disease (mostly thyroiditis), while that in PSC was ulcerative colitis. Especially, PSC patients were less accompanied with ulcerative colitis comparing with study in western population. Conclusions: ALDs are not rare any more in Korea, one of the hepatitis B virus endemic area. Nevertheless there are some differences between two groups, clinical characteristics of ALDs in Korea seem to be similar to those were reported in Western population. Moreover there is switchover overlap syndrome in Korea, therefore it is need to reassess diagnosis and change treatment strategy if patients become resistant to treatment that have been effective previously. 88% were treated with UDCA. 70% of patients treated with UDCA had biochemical responses defined by normalization of ALP or [40% decrease of ALP at 6 months.

Zhang 1 , R.P. Gao 1 , J. Zhu 1 , X.J. Zhang 1 , Y.G. Yang 1 1 Research Institute of Liver Diseases, Norman Bethune First Hospital, Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun 130021, ChinaBackground: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a cysteine-rich matricellular protein that has been implicated in regulating diverse processes in vivo, including angiogenesis, placentation, embryogenesis, chondrogenesis, fibrogenesis, and tumorigenesis. A recent study in xenograft animal model has described that CCN2 acts as a downstream mediator for TGF-b1-induced tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of CCN2 in tumorigenesis of human HCC remains elusive. Methods: Liver samples from 36 patients (who underwent hepatic resection for the first HCC between 2006 and 2009) and 6 healthy individuals were examined for TGF-b1 and CCN2mRNA by in situ hybridization. Alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemistry was used to identify vascular structures. Computer imaging analysis was performed to measure integrated optimal density (IOD) of CCN2mRNA-positive cells in carcinoma foci and surrounding stroma respectively. Results: In situ hybridization analysis showed that a significance increase of TGF-b1 mRNA was mainly detected in arteries and stroma surrounding carcinoma foci and that 9.4-fold enhanced expression of CCN2 mRNA in stroma surrounding the carcinoma foci (IOD: 60.2 \u00b1 28.7) and only 1.9-fold expression of CCN2 mRNA in carcinoma foci (IOD: 12.3 \u00b1 6.0) in comparison with normal controls (IOD: 6.4 \u00b1 2.3) (P \\ 0.01). The average number of CCN2 mRNA-positive neoarteries detected in surrounding stroma was 3.8 fold higher than that in carcinoma foci. Conclusion: CCN2 is overexpressed in HCC, especially in surrounding stroma and neoateries, suggesting that CCN2 may play an important role in development of HCC.Rapamycin, a mTOR Inhibitor, Prevents Hepatocellular CarcinomaDevelopment in the DEN Induce Rat Ting-Bo Liang 1 , Wei Chen 1 , Xu-Ning Shen 1 , Guo-Dong Xu 1 , Rui-Dan Zhuang 1 , Tao Ma 1 , Jun-Jian Li 1 , Xue-Li Bai 1 1 Departments of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Key Laboratory of Multi-Organ Transplantation of Ministry of Public Health, the First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, PR ChinaPurpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth common malignant tumors worldwide. There is no effective agent for HCC. Rapamycin is an immunosupressive drug with antitumor effect. We first investigated chemopreventive and chemotherapative effect of rapamycin in the rat model of HCC induced by DEN. Methods: The rat's HCC model were induced by DEN. First we investigate the preventive effect of rapamycin in hepatocarcinogenesis. Then, we evaluated the inhibitory role of rapamycin for the growth of rat's tumor. In order to investigate the mechanism, mTOR pathway, cell proliferation, cell progression and angiogenesis were evaluated. Results: Almost all rats (7/8) in group which rapamycin pre-treatment were tumor-free while the majority of rats (7/8) developed tumors in control group. The numbers and volumes of tumor in rapamycin treatment group were significantly lower than control group. Downstream targets of mTOR, cell proliferation, antiangogenesis and cell cycle progression was inhibited by rapamycin. Conclusion: Rapamycin could prevent hepatocellular carcinoma development in the DEN induce rat. These findings indicated rapamycin would be a chemopreventive and chemotherapive agent for HCC.Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the top three most common malignant tumors in China. Methylation of a special gene can cause its expressional suppression. The low expressions of miR-9-1 have been reported in colon carcinoma, breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether miR-9-1 promoter hypermethylation and consequential expression suppression play a role in the development of HCC with chronic HBV infection. Methods: Twelve HCC cell lines' miR-9-1 promoter hypermethylation statuses were assayed first. Thirty eight matched tumor and non-tumor tissues were collected from HCC patient with evidence of chronic HBV infection. Four normal liver tissues were form liver donors. DNA samples are treated with methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease Hha I alone, methylation dependent enzyme McrBC alone, both enzymes and no enzyme mock respectively. Then all four treated parts are quantitatively analyzed by real time PCR using primers specifically amplifying the CpG island in the miR-9-1 promoter region. The methylation status was quantitatively evaluated by calculating with the Ct value. Result: Five out of twelve HCC cell lines analyzed have a hypermethylation with rates of more than 80%. The hypermethylation rate in normal liver tissues is rare, while this rate in cirrhosis tissues is significantly higher compared with the normal tissues. Also we detected 38 pairs of prime HCC tissues and corresponding paratumor tissues; we found that 36.8% (14/38) HCC tissues have at least 20% higher methylation than the corresponding paratumor tissues. Besides, our result showed that mature miR-9-1 expression level was coincidence with their methylation status: high methylation status causes a low mature microRNA expression, otherwise low methylation reflects on a high mature microRNA expression. Conclusion: Our result suggests that methylation related miR-9-1 ectopic expression may play a role in the tumorigenesis and development of HCC.Frequent Upregulation of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 was Implicated in Deleted in Liver Cancer 1 Gene Silencing and HCC Progression Sandy Leung-Kuen Au 1 , Carmen Chak-Lui Wong 1 , Joyce Man-Fong Lee 1 , Chun-Ming Wong 1 , Irene Oi-Lin Ng 1 1 The University of Hong Kong, 21 Sassoon Road, Pokfulam, Hong KongBackground: Epigenetic dysregulation events including aberrant expression of histone modifying enzymes and DNA hypermethylation are significantly implicated in tumor suppressor gene silencing during malignancy development. In HCC, the roles and functions of many deregulated histone modifying enzymes are still warranted. In a pilot study, we observed that Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase catalyzing histone H3 Lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), was frequently upregulated in human HCC. H3K27me3 acts as a repressive mark for gene transcription. The purpose of this present study is to investigate the role of EZH2 in hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine the expression of EZH2 in human primary HCC samples. Clinicopathological analysis was done to correlate EZH2 overexpression with clinicopathological parameters of HCC patients. Ectopic overexpression and stable knockdown approaches were employed to study the functional implication of EZH2 in HCC cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and bisulfide sequencing were used to reveal the histone modification and DNA methylation status of DLC1 promoter, respectively. Results: We found that EZH2 was significant upregulated in 69.5% (41/59) of primary HCC cases examined. EZH2 expression was progressively increased during multistep hepatocarcinogenesis. Clinicopathologically, EZH2 overexpression was associated with aggressive and invasive tumor behaviors in HCC patients including the presence of venous invasion (P = 0.029) and liver invasion (P = 0.010), and the absence of tumor encapsulation (P = 0.035). Functionally, RNAi knock-down of EZH2 reduced global H3K27me level and suppressed colony formation and cell migration in HCC cells. Suppression of EZH2 induced re-expression of tumor suppressor gene, deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1). ChIP assay confirmed EZH2 mediated H3K27me3 was implicated in epigenetic silencing of DLC1 in human HCC. More importantly, concomitant removal of H3K27me3 and DNA methylation exhibited synergistic effect in restoring DLC1 expression, indicating a crosstalk of the two epigenetic silencing mechanisms. Conclusion: Frequent EZH2 upregulation in HCC suppressed DLC1, thus leading to HCC progression and invasion.Role of Wnt/ b-Catenin in Progression of Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis and Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Dinesh Mani Tripathi 1 , Sujoy Bose 1 , Neetu R.

Results: The positive expression intensity of PTEN in HCC was remarkably weaker than that in normal liver tissues,while the expression intensity of ERK2 was stronger in HCC than that in normal liver tissues.Moreover, there was a negative relationship between the expression of PTEN and that of ERK2. The positive expression rate of PTEN in HCC was related to the progress of the tumor pathological differentiation and invasion (P \\ 0.05),whereas that was not related to the sex and AFP levels (P [ 0.05). The positive expression rate of ERK2 in HCC was related to the invasion (P \\ 0.05), whereas that did not show correlation to the tumorpathological differentiation, sex and AFP levels (P [ 0.05). Conclusion: The expression of PTEN and ERK2 may reflect the differentiation and invasive potential of HCC tissues to varying degrees. Decrease or deletion of PTEN protein expression may not be able to inhibit Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway,this will result in carcinogenesis,invasiveness and metastasis.Top 10% PostersThe Diagnostic Sensitivity of AASLD Guideline on Hepatocellular Carcinoma and its Application on Non-cirrhotic Patients Ming-Tzung Lin 1,2 , Tsung-Hui Hu 1,2 , Yu-Feng Cheng 1,3 , Hock-Liew Eng 1,4 , Chih-Chi Wang 1,5 , Chao-Long Chen 1,5 1 Chang Gang Memorial Hospital-Kaohsiung Medical Center, 123,Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Country, 833, Taiwan, R.O.C., 2 Division of Hepato-Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, 123, Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Country, 833, Taiwan, R.O.C., 3 Radiology, 123, Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Country, 833, Taiwan, R.O.C., 4 Pathology, 123, Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Country, 833, Taiwan, R.O.C, 5 Surgery, 123, Ta-Pei Road, Niaosung Hsiang, Kaohsiung Country, 833, Taiwan, R.O.C.Background: The American Association for the Study of Liver Disease(AASLD, 2005)  issued guidelines to propose a diagnostic approach for HCC. HCC diagnosis can be made by dynamic images or AFP in a cirrhosis liver. In non-cirrhotic liver, biopsy is suggested. Methods: From January 2006 to November 2008, total 343 pathologically diagnosed HCC patients via surgical resection were reviewed. 124 patients were excluded for final analysis (AASLD guideline sensitivity) due to inadequate information (including image or AFP). Finally, 219 patients were enrolled for final analysis. Pre-operative cirrhosis was diagnosed by ultrasonography using scoring system C8 Tumor sizes were recorded by pathologic report. Pathologic cirrhosis was verified by modified Knodell classification as fibrosis score: 4. Results: The accuracy of cirrhotic diagnosis by ultrasonography was 72.9% preoperatively. Diagnostic sensitivity of HCC by single image study was around 65-80%, with a very low value for HCC \\2 cm. Among these 219 patients, the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis according to AASLD guideline was 89.7% in image-cirrhotic patients, and 92.2% in image non-cirrhotic patients.",

This study aimed to elucidate the prognostic significance of LAPTM4B-35 and ASS proteins as biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Methods: Expressions of LAPTM4B-35 and ASS in HCCs and paired noncancerous liver tissues were evaluated by Western blot (WB) and/or Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations of LAPTM4B-35 and ASS expressions with clinicopathologic parameters were assessed by chi-squared test. Patient survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Cox regression was adopted for multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. Results: LAPTM4B-35 staining was markedly enhanced in 74.3% of HCC specimen. ASS expression was negative in 70.4% of HCC samples. Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 and positive expression of ASS were both significantly associated with pathologic grading, TNM stage, portal vein invasion and recurrence of HCC. On multivariate analysis, combined LAPTM4B-35 and ASS expression showed markedly poorer overall survival and disease-free survival than patients with HCC that were negative for both of these proteins or positive for one and negative for the other (P = 0.039 and P = 0.035, respectively). Conclusions: Overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 in combination with positive expression of ASS is an independent biomarker of poor prognosis for HCC patients after hepatectomy.Top 10% PostersUpregulation of Osteopontin Encourages Tumor Growth and Metastasis of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Qiong-Zhu Dong 1,2 , Chun Dai 1,2 , Hai-Jun Zhou 1,2 , Hu-Liang Jia 1,2 , Ning Ren 1,2 , Qing-Hai Ye 1,2 , Lun-Xiu Qin 1,2 1 Liver Cancer Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, China, 2 Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, ChinaBackground: Hepatic metastasis is a primary cause for failure of locoregional therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). The mechanism by which OPN functions in regulating tumor malignancies is not well defined. Here we investigate the effect of OPN on progression in HCC.Methods: The expression levels of OPN were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR. We constructed the vectors for upregulation of OPN expression in HCC cells. Tumorigenicity and metastatic potentials of HCC cells were studied in vitro and in nude mice. In addition, we evaluated the influence of OPN on the cell proliferation and the signal pathway induced by OPN. Results: The expression levels of OPN were significantly increased in primary HCC tumors and their secondary metastatic lesions compared with surrounding non-cancerous tissue. In the transfected cells, up-regulation of OPN resulted in a remarkably increased ability of cell adhesion (56.08 \u00b1 2.0) and the migrating cell numbers (25.2 \u00b1 2.08) compared withMock (49.93 \u00b1 1.74, 17.4 \u00b1 1.45)   (P \\ 0.05). Furthermore, up-regulation of OPN promoted the in vivo tumor growth and metastasis of human HCC cells. In addition, the cell proliferation was influenced by the concentration of exogenous recombinant OPN. OPN could induce the expression of MMP2 and uPA, and activate the AKT-Survivin pathway. Conclusions: Both in vitro and in vivo assays suggested that OPN could promote the invasion and metastasis of HCC. OPN contributed to HCC growth and metastasis possibly by activated AKT-Survivin pathway. These suggested that OPN could be a hopeful target for the therapy of HCC.PARs are not Related to the Effect that Thrombin Mediates Overall Survival and Recurrence of HCC Patient who Underwent Primary and Curative Resection Xiao-Fei Zhang 1,2 , Yu-Hua Xue 1,2 , Qiong-Zhu Dong 1,2 , Li-Yun Fu 1,2 , Jian Sun 1,2 , Hu-Liang Jia 1,2 , Lun-Xiu Qin 1,2 1 Liver Cancer Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, China, 2 Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, China",

Based on the previous study, we introduce the laser capture microdissection (LCM) plus gene expression array to explore some target genes favoring extra-hepatic tumor metastasis. GOLM-1 was one of the candidate genes that may contribute to Heptocelluar Carcinoma (HCC) extra-hepatic metastasis. Thus, the functional role of GOLM-1 in HCC metastasis need to be further investigated. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to analyze the different GOLM-1 mRNA expression level both in HCC cell lines and clinical samples in 135 patients. The expression level of GOLM-1 in HCC tissue microarray was detected by immunohistochemistry analysis in 152 cases. GOLM-1 was knocked down in metsastatic HCC cell line (MHCC97 h) by lentiviral-mediated RNA interference to explore the possible mechanisms of GOLM-1 in HCC metastasis.",

The aim of this study is to investigate whether measurement of both PIVKA-II and AFP every 3 months can detect small HCC (B3 cm) better than conventional surveillance. Methods: In this prospective study which began since June 2007, cirrhotic patients (n = 674) with Child A were randomly allocated to group I (AFP+PIVKA-II q 3mo, n = 298) and group II (AFP q 6 mo, n = 376). All patients underwent surveillance ultrasonography every 6 months. The tumor characteristics and outcomes were compared between two groups. Results: In all patients, the mean age was 53.7 years (433 men and 241 women). The main etiology was hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (n = 505, 74.9%). The baseline mean Child-Pugh score was 5.1 \u00b1 0.5, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) score was 18.6 \u00b1 14.1 kPa. During the median follow-up of 16.7 months, 35 (5.2%) patients were diagnosed as HCC (12 in group I and 23 in group II). The LSM score was higher in HCC patients (20.5 \u00b1 16.1 kPa) compared to non-HCC patients (18.5 \u00b1 14.0 kPa) without statistical significance (P = 0.45). In group I, two cases (16.7%) were diagnosed as HCC only due to elevated PIVKA-II. In comparison of group I and II, the number of uninodular HCC was 8 (66.7%) and 18 (78.3%), respectively. There was no significant difference of mean tumor size (3.5 \u00b1 3.3 cm vs. 3.1 \u00b1 2.0 cm, P = 0.62), and number of single HCC B3 cm was 9 (75.0%) and 14 (60.9%), respectively (P = 0.48). The 2-year cumulative survival rate was 91% in group I and 89% in group II (P = 0.63). Conclusion: Combined measurement of AFP and PIVKA-II every 3 months with 6-month ultrasonography did not detect early HCC more than standard surveillance. However, long-term results are required to conclude this trial.Top 10% PostersUsefulness of Prediction of Treatment Response by 18 F-FDG PET for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Myeong Jun Song 1 , Jin Dong Kime 1 , Jung Hyun Kwon 1 , Jeong Won Jang 1 , I Ryung Yoo 2 , Si Hyun Bae 1 , Jong Young Choi 1 , Seung Kew Yoon 1 , Jin Mo Yang 1 , Young Sok Lee 1 , Chang Don Lee 1 , Kyu Won Chung 1 1 Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 505, Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Korea, 2 Nuclear Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 505, Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Korea Background/Aims: 18 FDG PET is associated with differentiation grade in HCC and significant predictor of tumor recurrence in LT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate correlation with clinical features and prediction of treatment response by 18 F-FDG PET as additional prognostic modality. Methods: This study retrospectively enrolled a total of 86 HCC patients who underwent 18 F-FDG PET before locoregional treatment between October, 2006 and May, 2009. We analyzed the effect of 18 FDG PET uptake on clinical features and evaluated treatment response by modified RECIST criteria in HCC patients. Three PET parameters (SUVmax, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, Tsuvmax/ Lsuvmean) were tested as predictive factors. Results: Among the 3 PET parameters tested, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax (cutoff value of 1.45) was the most significant predictor of treatment response. In a multivariate analysis of predictive factors including Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax, size and number of tumor, vascular invasion, portal vein thrombosis, AFP, BCLC stage, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax was the only significant for treatment response(P=0.007). Conclusions: The PET parameter can provide important prediction for treatment response in HCC. Especially, Tsuvmax/Lsuvmax (cutoff value of 1.45) can provide effective information on prognosis of the treatment response and the selection of adequate candidate for HCC treatment.

The aim of this study was to compare the ability of seven different staging systems (Okuda staging, TNM, CLIP, BCLC, JIS, Tokyo score and GRETCH staging) in predicting survival in an Indian cohort of patients with HCC. Patients and methods: In this prospective study 101 HCC patients were diagnosed and stratified according to 7 different staging systems; along with analysis of independent predictors of survival and their correlation with survival was evaluated Results: CLIP, Tokyo score and BCLC staging system showed a significant difference in the probability of survival according to the Kaplan-Meier method. All other staging systems failed to show a significant difference in survival. The P value for CLIP, Tokyo score and BCLC staging were 0.03, 0.05 and 0.05 respectively. Age, portal vein thrombosis, serum bilirubin, MELD score showed a significant difference with survival in univariate analysis. However serum bilirubin was only an independent predictor of survival with a hazard ratio of 1.609 (95% CI 1.015-2.553, P = 0.043). Conclusion: The CLIP, Tokyo score and BCLC are the most useful staging systems in Indian cohort.Evaluation of Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Interlukin-1 beta (IL-1b) in Patients with Hepatitis C Virus Infection (HCV) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Zakia Abdelrahman 1 , Ola Abdelkader 1 , Hanaa Kohail 1 , Lobna AbouShamaa 1 , Marowa Abdelfatah 1 1 Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, Egypt, 165 El Horria Street, Alexandria, Egypt",

Chawla 1 , Jyotdeep Kaur 1 1 Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Sector 12, Chandigarh 160 012, IndiaBackground: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer, and hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections are major risk factors. DNA methylation alterations have been linked to various carcinomas in different populations. Aberrant CpG island methylation of genes has been recognized in HCC, information is limited for hepatitis viruses related hepatocarcinogenesis. HCC risk has not previously been studied with genespecific DNA methylation in India. Methods: Promoter region methylation of a panel of six tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CDH1, GSTP1, SOCS1, and APC) and three oncogenes (MYC, HRAS, and KRAS) was determined by methylation-specific PCR among 23 HCC samples and 20 control hepatitis samples. Results: CDKN2B methylation frequency in HCC was double that for hepatitis, and methylation allele density of APC, GSTP1, and CDKN2B increased 2.2-, 2.3-, and 7.6-fold, respectively. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes starts during viral infection and progresses toward HCC with the chronicity of the disease. Findings of altered methylation status support involvement of these tumor suppressor genes in HCC. MYC showed decreased methylation in HCC, relative to hepatitis. Conclusion: These observations on DNA methylation suggest the involvement of CDKN2B, SOCS1, CDH1, GSTP1, and MYC in pathogenesis of HCC in India and implicate altered DNA methylation in the molecular pathogenesis.Efficacy of Tumor Markers for Early Detection of Metastasis in Patients with Hepatocellular CarcinomaSeong Woo Nam 1 , Hyeok Choon Kwon 1 , Seong Eun Lee 1 , Kyonam Kim 2 , Ji Weon Yu 1 National Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, 2 Hong's internal medicine, Seoul, Korea Background: We evaluate serum AFP and PIVKA-II for HCC in patients who were diagnosed and managed.

Because they show rapid growth, vascular invasion and distant metastasis. We investigated the clinical usefulness of combination diagnosis by Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI (EOB-MRI) and Sonazoid contarastenhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for judgement of biological malignant potential in HCC Methods: The subject were 70 liver nodules which were histologically diagnosed. We performed Sonazoid-CEUS and EOB-MRI and compared these results with histological differentiation of HCCs. Kupffer phase was evaluated at 10 min after Sonazoid-injection and hepatobilliary phase was observed at 20 min after EOB injection. Results: 63 nodules were low intensity in hepatobilliary phase of EOB-MRI and 86% of them were diagnosed as HCCs. 59 nodules were hypoechoic or defect in Kupffer phase of Sonazoid-CEUS and 61% of them were diagonsed as HCCs. 58% of the nodules which showed low intensity in EOB-MRI and hypoechoic or defect in Sonazoid-US were diagnosed as moderately or poorly differentiated HCCs, whereas 78% of the nodules which showed low intensity in EOB-MRI and isoechoic in Sonazoid-CEUS were diagnosed as well-differentiated HCCs. Two cases of cholangiocellcarcinoma were observed as low intensity in EOB-MRI and defect in Sonazoid-CEUS. There was one nodule which showed isointensity in EOB-MRI and isoechoic Sonazoid-CEUS and the pathological diagnosis was liver adenoma.

Methods: The project included 184 patients with PHC pathologically confirmed and 125 patients with cirrhosis as control. Sera AFP was detected with microparticle enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Cutoff values of AFP were divided into nine sequent levels:20,50, 100, 150,200, 250, 300, 350, 400 lg/ L. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+, LR-), diagnostic odd ratio (dOR), accuracy were calculated with 2 9 2 table; receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was presented with SPSS11.5 software. Results: The sensitivity was highest for diagnosis of PHC as cutoff value of AFP was 20 lg/L and the specificity was highest as AFP was 400 lg/L. The specificity, LR+, dOR highest as AFP was 250 lg/L The corresponding cutoff value of AFP with the highest point in ROC lef t corner was 50 lg/L, and its accuracy was highest. Conclusion: It suggested that 50 lg/L of AFP seems a suitable Screening cutoff value for PHC. It suggested that 250 lg/L of AFP seems a more suitable diagnostic value for PHC than 400 lg/L.AFPL3% versus AFP in Diagnosis of HCC in Egyptian PatientsAli Nada 1 , Naglaa Allam 1 , Eman Rewisha 1 , Mohsen Salama 1 , Ahmed Abbas 1 1 National Liver Institute, Menofeya, EgyptBackground: The global incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising and in Egypt a threefold increase between 19 and 2008 has been reported. Hence early diagnosis of HCC is crucial. It was concluded that total AFP had a relatively poor sensitivity and specificity as a surveillance test and EASL guidelines in 2008 deferred its use as a screening tool. Aim of the study: To evaluate the utility of Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP percentage of the total AFP concentration (AFP-L3%) in the diagnosis of HCC in Egyptian patients and to study its relationship to tumor characteristics. Methods: AFP L3 was estimated by LiBASys technique in a group of 30 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (Group I) as well as 60 patients with viral-related HCC diagnosed by characteristic imaging findings (Group II) and further classified into: Group IIa AFP [400 ng/ml; Group IIb AFP \\400. Results: A high statistically significant difference in level of AFP L3 was found between Group I and IIa; Group I and IIb; Group IIa and IIb (P \\0.01). A higher level of AFPL3% was associated with multinodular focal lesions and lesions [5 cm, with the difference approaching statistical significance. When we used standard cut off level of AFL3% at 10% in Group IIb (total AFP level \\400), sensitivity and specificity for detection of HCC were 30.6, 96.7% respectively. At cutoff level 23.5%, the sensitivity was 25% and specificity 100 %. When AFPL3% was set at the cut off point of 23.5%, HCC was diagnosed in an additional 9 patients (15%) in the study. Conclusion: Determination of AFP L3% by LiBASys technique and using the cutoff point of 23.5, together with determination of total AFP level, increases the specificity of diagnosis of HCC in Egyptian patients especially those with indeterminate increases of total AFP level (10-400 nglml).Assessment of Serum N-glycans Marker in HBV-related HepatocellularCarcinoma Follow-up Study Yun-Peng Zhao 1 , Jun Ji 1 , Meng Fang 1 , Fei-Guo Zhou 2 , Chun-Fang Gao 1 1 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Changhai Road 225, Yangpu District, Shanghai, China, 2 Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Changhai Road 225, yangpu District, Shanghai, China",

Detection of HCC at an early stage that enables curative treatment is critical for a favourable outcome. Studies on Japanese and American patient cohorts suggest improved diagnosis of HCC by the additional determination of Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3) and of desgamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP).1,2  The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of AFP-L3 and DCP in a Turkish patient cohort. Methods: From 01/2008 to 03/2009 118 patients with mostly HBV and HCV infection were studied. 89 of them had proven HCC and 29 had liver cirrhosis. AFP, the fraction of Lectin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3%) and DCP were measured using the LiBASys TM automated immunological analyzer (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd, Japan). The following cutoffs were used for the markers: AFP [ 13 ng/ml, AFP-L3 [ 10% and DCP [ 3,0 ng/ml. Results: Levels of AFP, AFP-L3% and DCP were higher in patients with HCC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value for AFP was 53, 93, 96 and 39%, for AFP-L3% 37, 93, 94 and 33% and for DCP 58, 83, 91 and 40% respectively. The sensitivity could be increased to 72% by using all three markers, whereas the specificity decreased to 79%. In contrast to AFP and AFP-L3, DCP showed a strong correlation with tumor diameter and portal vein invasion. Conclusions: The exclusive determination of the routinely used marker AFP showed a fair sensitivity of 53%. The sensitivity of the investigated markers alone is slightly higher for DCP compared to AFP, but in combination the markers showed a significantly increased sensitivity. DCP indicated in addition clinical characteristics such as tumor size and portal vein invasion. Combination of these markers provides a useful non-invasive method for the diagnosis of HCC.Early Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma using the New Generation of High-sensitive Lens Culinaris Agglutinin-reactive Fraction of Alpha-fetoprotein Assay Shintaro Kikkawa 1 , Fumio Nomura 2 , Osamu Yokosuka 1 1 Department of Medicine and Clinical Oncology, Graduate school of Medicine, Chiba Universtiy, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ward, Chiba, Japan, 2 Department of molecular diagnosis, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ward, Chiba, Japan",

We measured AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA-II levels in the all samples by highsensitive immunoassay system, lTAS WAKO. Result: AFP-L3 was significantly increased in HCC patients compared with patients without HCC. Furthermore AFP-L3 level in sera before tumor detection was increased compared with controls. When the cut-off values of AFP-L3 was set at 7%, the positive rate was 39%. Conclusion: New generation of high-sensitive AFP-L3 assay is a useful tool for diagnosis of HCC. We should closely follow up the patients with AFP-L3 more than 7%.Bone as the First Site of Metastasis from Hepatocellular Carcinoma-Detection and Analysis by Dual-tracer PET/CT Chi-Lai Ho 1 , Sirong Chen 1 , Eric Yim Lung Leung 1 , Thomas Kam Chau Cheng 1 1 Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital, 2 Villiage Road, Happy Valley, Hong KongBackground: Dual-tracer PET/CT using 11 C-acetate (ACT) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has high sensitivity for the detection of primary and secondary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The most frequent sites of metastasis are lung and abdominal lymph nodes. Bone has long been regarded as an uncommon site of metastasis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic pattern and statistics of HCC patients who had bone as the first and only site of metastasis. Methods: Thirty patients (mean: 59 years; male/female: 14) had bone as the only site of metastasis out of 257 HCC patients with extrahepatic metastases during 2006-2009 in this center. All patients had undergone ACT PET/CT followed by FDG PET/CT. Lesions were identified as positive by visual inspection and maximum standard uptake value (SUV max ) C 2.5. Bone metastasis was confirmed by histopathology, supportive radiological findings, bone scintigraphy, or serial PET/CT. Results: The incidence rate of bone as the first metastatic site from HCC was 12% (30/257). Of 71 lesions confirmed as bone metastases (size: 3.25 \u00b1 1.88 cm), 25 were avid for ACT, 3 for FDG and 41 for both tracers. Overall sensitivity using dual-tracer was 97%. ACT-PET was significantly more sensitive than FDG-PET (93 vs. 62%, P\\0.05). The mean lesion metabolism of ACT was significantly higher than that of FDG (SUV max = 7.42 \u00b1 4.25 vs 4.81 \u00b1 2.07, P = 0.0002). There was 1 false-positive lesion by ACT, 2 by FDG and no false-positive lesions by dual-tracer (positive predicative value = 100%). The primary HCC lesions of these 30 patients were 60% avid for ACT (well-differentiated), 35% avid for both tracers (moderately-differentiated) and 5% for FDG (poorly-differentiated). Conclusions: Bone is not an uncommon site of metastasis from HCC. Welldifferentiated HCC may have a greater propensity to metastasize early to bone.ACT-PET may be the more sensitive imaging technique that is essential for its early detection.Oct4, an Embryonic Stem Cell Marker, Promoting Cell Proliferation and Metastasis is an Oncogene in Hepatocelluar CarcinomaChun Dai 1,2 , Qiong-Zhu Dong 1,2 , Yue Zhao 1,2 , Jun-Jie Zhu 1,2 , Hai-Jun Zhou 1,2 , Hu-Liang Jia 1,2 , Ning Ren 1,2 , Qing-Hai Ye 1,2 , Lun-Xiu Qin 1,2 1 Liver Cancer Institute, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, China, 2 Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Room 610, Mingdao Building, Dong'an Road 130#, Shanghai, China",

However, it is not fully evaluated whether OPN could be used as a single marker for the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly in those patients with the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I HCC. A total of 151 patients with HCC who underwent surgical resection were enrolled, including 112 patients of the TNM stage I. OPN expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in the tissue microarrays derived from these patients. Immunoreactivity was classified according to the percentage and intensity of staining: negative (-), weak (+) and strong (++). The impact of OPN expression on survival of patients was analyzed. In total, 65.6% (99 of 151) of HCC tissues expressed OPN. The overall survival (OS) rates in patients of OPN (-) group were significantly higher than those of OPN (+) or OPN (++) group (P = 0.049 and P = 0.001). OPN was an unfavorable prognostic factor for OS, but not for disease-free survival (DFS). Interestingly, in the TNM stage I HCC, OPN expression was correlated with the early recurrence after surgical resection (P = 0.001). Further analysis showed that OPN expression was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS in patients with the TNM stage I HCC (hazard ratio, 2.272, P = 0.014 and 1.982, P = 0.037). These results suggest that OPN expression is common in HCC and it is a useful marker for predicting the prognosis of patients with the TNM stage I HCC, contributing to determining which individual patients need adjuvant therapy to prevent the early recurrence after surgical resection.Detection of the Altered Expression of DDAH-1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Using Laser Capture Microdissection and Proteome Analysis Qing Wang 1 , He-Ping Hu 1 1 Department of Gastroenterology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, 225 Changhai Road, Shanghai, 200438, PR China",

This study attempts to further characterize the association between FoxP3 + Treg and tumor metastasis of HCC. Methods: One-hundred and thirty HCC patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (designated as HBV-related HCC patients), including 40 patients without tumor metastasis, 58 patients with local metastasis (LM) and 32 patients with distant metastasis (DM), 26 HBV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and 35 normal controls were enrolled. Flow cytometric, immunohistochemical, and immunosuppressive assays were employed for analyses of property of Treg. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for overall survival was made using Cox's proportional hazards model. Results: Both circulating and tumor resident FoxP3 + Treg were significantly increased and correlated with disease progression in HCC patients. HCC patients with tumor metastasis had higher FoxP3 + Treg than patients without tumor metastasis, and DM patients had significantly higher FoxP3 + Treg than LM patients. We also found that a large numbers of FoxP3 + Treg infiltrated in tumor embolus and metastatic HCC tissues in other organs. The increased suppressive function of Treg in tumor region was found in tumor regions compared with non-tumor regions. Furthermore, circulating Treg of HCC patients with tumor metastasis displayed an increased suppression on effector T cells compared with patients without tumor metastasis. Importantly, increased numbers of circulating Treg were associated with high mortality and reduced survival time of HCC patients with metastasis. Conclusion: Increased FoxP3 + Treg may promote tumor metastasis and disease progression in HCC patients. Manipulation of Treg function maybe a promising strategy for prevention of HCC metastasis and relapse.Association of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism of IL-10 and ALDH2 with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Zhi Du 1 , Ying-Tang Gao 1 , Juan-Juan Liu 1 , Bin Yang 1 , Tao Han 2 , Yi-Jun Wang 3 , Feng-Mei Wang 2 , Jing Xiang 3 1 Key Laboratory of Artificial Cell, Institute for Hepatobiliary Disease, Tianjin Third Central Hospital, Tianjin, China, Jintang Road 83, Hedong District, Tianjin 300170, 2 Department of Hepatology, Tianjin Third Central Hospital, Tianjin, China, Jintang Road 83, Hedong District, Tianjin 300170, 3 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Tianjin Third Central Hospital, Tianjin, China, Jintang Road 83, Hedong District, Tianjin 300170",

BCS can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although the incidence is not clear. We evaluated the long-term clinical course of BCS and predictive factors associated with the development of HCC. Methods: We analyzed 67 consecutive patients with primary BCS between June 1988 and May 2008. BCS was diagnosed by confirming hepatic venous outflow obstruction using abdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or venography. The end of followup was 31 March 2009. Results: The mean age of the 67 patients was 46 years (range, 21-67 years) and 34 (50.7%) were male. At diagnosis, 34 (50.7%), 26 (38.8%), and 7 (10.4%) patients were Child-Pugh class A, B, and C, respectively.

However there is scanty information regarding the epidemiology of HCC from India. Aim: To study the epidemiological changes of HCC in north Indian HCC patients. Material and methods: 212 HCC patients were included in this study who attended the Liver Clinic of PGIMER, Chandigarh from January 2005 to December 2009 and divided in five groups year wise. Group 1: 35 HCC patients (2005); group2: 43 HCC patients (2006); group3: 39 (2007); group 4: 48 HCC patients (2008); group 5: 47 HCC patients (2009) HCC patients. All the biochemical, haematological and clinical history were recorded and various parameters were compared within and among groups. Results: HBsAg and antiHCV were positive in 55 and 33% in group 1, 54 and 32% in group 2, 55 and 28% in group 3 and 51 and 29% in group 4, respectively. However in group 5, 60% patients were found to have HCV infection, only 17% patients were with HBV infection and 23% were of unknown etiology. Radiological findings were suggestive of BCLC stage C (70-75%) in most of the patients of all the groups. Mean age, main clinical symptoms among the groups were almost similar. Majority of the HCC patients in different groups were male and had normal AFP levels Conclusion: Hepatitis C virus is becoming a main risk factor for the development of HCC in the north Indian HCC patients.

However, it is not fully elucidated whether MS increases the risk of HCC recurrence after curative treatment in non-B non-C chronic liver disease patients. We conducted this study to investigate whether MS is a risk factor of HCC recurrence after curative treatment in non-B non-C chronic liver disease patients. Methods: We enrolled 137 na\u00efve, non-B non-C HCC patients including alcoholic and non-alcoholic chronic liver disease. All of them were curatively treated by percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) between 1999 and 2007. The diagnosis of MS was based on International Diabetes Federation criteria. Based on comorbidity with MS, patients were divided into two groups: the MS group (n = 44) and the normal group (n = 93). The effects of MS on HCC recurrence was analyzed together with other factors including tumor and liver function-related ones. Results: The cumulative recurrence rates significantly differed between the two groups (P = 0.019); 22.7, 62.6, and 72.6% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively, in the MS group and 15.8, 38.7, and 55.6% in the normal group. Multivariate analysis indicated higher age (HR 1.04, per 1 year, P = 0.026), comorbidity with diabetes mellitus (HR 1.67, P = 0.041), presence of MS (HR 2.05, P = 0.005), lower platelet counts (HR 0.93, per 10 3 /ll, P = 0.002), tumor multinodularity (HR 2.18, P = 0.009), higher AFP level (HR 1.02, per 10 ng/ml, P = 0.001), and higher DCP level (HR 1.01, per 10 mAU/ml, P = 0.001) as independent risk factors. Conclusions: These results indicated that MS is an independent risk factor of HCC recurrence after curative treatment in non-B non-C chronic liver disease patients.Family History Does Not Affect Survival from Hepatocellular CarcinomaNalani Grace 1 , Linda Wong 2 1 John A. Burns School of Medicine, 651 Ilalo Street, MEB 3rd Floor, 2 Hawaii Medical Center -East, 2226 Liliha Street, Suite 402Background: A family history of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in a first-degree relative has been shown to be a risk factor for development of HCC, especially in Asian countries related to hepatitis B. Little is known if a family history of HCC affects survival. Aim: To compare HCC patients with a family history of HCC (FH+) to HCC patients without a family history (FH-). Methods: In a prospectively-collected database of 581 HCC patients(1993- 2009), 47 patients had a family history of HCC. Tumor characteristics, liver function, treatment, and survival were compared between FH+ and FH-. Results: In FH+, 19 had a sibling, 19 had a parent, and 1 had both with HCC. Eight patients had second-degree relatives and 3 had more than one relative with HCC. FH+ were more likely to be female, non-diabetics, hepatitis B+, and have higher albumin (all p \\ 0.05). FH+ were as likely to be screened for HCC and the treatments did not differ. Median survival in FH+ was 1322 days (95%CI 569-2074 days) compared to FH-at 643 days and was not quite significant (p = 0.051). Cox regression showed that tumor size, MELD score, and albumin were the best predictors of survival. The presence of a family history of HCC did not affect survival. Conclusions: Only 8% of HCC is familial-related and the association is likely related to hepatitis B transmission. The presence of family history of HCC does not confer a worse prognosis as tumor characteristics and underlying liver function were more important.African-American Ethnicity, Filipino Ethnicity, and Low SES are Independent Unfavorable Prognostic Factors for Overall Survival in Hepatocellular Cancer Fen Jiang 1,2,3 , Sai-Hong Ignatius Ou 1,2,3 1 Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, CA 92868, USA, 2 Genetic Epidemiology Research Institute, School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine CA 92697, USA, 3 Department of Epidemiology, School of Medicine, University of California Irvine, Irvine CA 92697, USABackground: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. HCC is associated with poor survival among Asians in Asia. The survival of HCC among different ethnic group (Asians, Hispanic, African-Americans, and Caucasians) and within Asians in California was analyzed. In this study, the role of SES in the survival of racial disparity in HCC was investigated. Methods: Retrospective analysis(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006) of HCC patients from the California Cancer Registry (CCR) was performed. Univariate analyses of overall survival (OS) were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards ratios (HRs). Results: 7392 HCC patients were analyzed. Male to female ratio is about 3:1. African-American (AA) patients were found to have higher proportion of advanced stage of disease, poorly differentiated status, fewer surgeries, fewer married status and Low SES. Among Asian-Americans, Filipinos were found to have higher proportion of advanced stage of disease, well and moderately differentiated status, fewer surgeries, and Low SES. Incremental improvements in SES quintile correlated with statistically significant decreases in the hazards ratios for death. In multivariate analysis, AA had unfavorable prognosis when compared to the rest of ethnicities; Filipinos had unfavorable prognosis when compared to the rest of Asian Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). Conclusions: African-American ethnicity, Filipino ethnicity, and Low SES are independent unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival in HCC.Association of TNF-a Gene Polymorphisms with Risk of Hepatitis B-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chinese PopulationXiang-Mei Chen 1 , Yi-Bin Chang 1 , Xiu-Feng Chu 1 , Ling Wang 1 , Feng-Min Lu 1 , Hui Zhuang 1 1 Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xueyuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100191, China",

Patients and methods: The number of the cases with HCC included in the study was 324 (233 males, 91 females). The medium age of the patients was 56(19- 78). The patients were diagnosed by clinical findings, ultrasonography, computerized tomography, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, alpha-feto protein (AFP) and the fine needle aspiration biopsy. Results: The lesion was located on the left lobe, on the right lobe of the liver and was disseminated diffusely in 22.1, 20.2, 57.7% respectively. The lesion was single in 41.2%, double in 18.2% and multiple 40.6% of the patients. The ratio of the tumors lower than 3 cm in diameter was 52.4% while those exceeding 3 cm in diameter was seen in 47.6% of the cases. The reasons for etiology agents were HBV in 69.8%, HCV in 23.2%, HDV in 1.8%, alcoholic liver cirrhosis 0.6% and with an unknown origin in 4.6%. The patients were treated with ethanol injection in 11.7%, RF in 4.9, chemoembolization in 52.8%, systemic chemotheraopy in 0.6%, surgical resectioning 13.0% and liver transplantation in 0.4%. The 16.6% of the patients were treated with only supportive treatment due to the diffuse distribution of the tumors. Conclusion: The most important etiological factor is HBV infection and the cirrohosis for HCC. More than half of the patients underwent to chemoembolization therapy and liver transplantation were applied in only two cases.PD-1 and PD-L1 Upregulation Promotes Tumor Evasion of Immune Control in Hepatocellular Carcinoma PatientsFeng Shi 1,2 , Ming Shi 1 , Ji-Yuan Zhang 1 , Zheng Zhang 1 , Po Tien 2 , Fu-Sheng Wang1  1  Research Center for Biological Therapy, Beijing 302 Hospital, 100 Xi Si Huan Middle Road, Beijing, China, 2 Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients are often found to have functional deficiency in immune surveillance of tumor growth. Recent reports showed that programmed death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating host immune response. However, the inhibitory effect on the function of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes, the main potent effector cells, in HCC patients was not well defined. Methods: We characterized circulating and intratumor PD-1/PD-L1 expression and analyzed their functions in a cohort of HBV-related patients including 56 with HCC, 20 with liver cirrhosis (LC) and 20 healthy controls (HC). To achieving this, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry techniques were adopted. Results: The frequency of circulating PD-1+ CD8+ T cells increased with disease progression from LC to HCC patients versus HC. Furthermore, tumorinfiltrating effector CD8+ T cells showed a drastically increased PD-1 expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that PD-L1 expressing hepatoma cells and apoptotic infiltrating CD8+ T cells were both enriched in tumor sections. In vitro, block PD-L1 with monoclonal antibody could revitalize the proliferation and killing functions by CD8+T cells. Conclusions: This study, for the first time, demonstrated that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway plays a pivotal role in tumor evasion and blockade of PD-1/ PD-L1 interaction with anti-PD-L1 antibodies could revitalize CD8+ T cells against tumor. Further understanding of the immunopathogenesis of HCC should be of critical importance for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies for the disease.Hepatocellular Carcinoma Mortality in Canada from 1980 to 2004 Hong-Xing Wu 1 , Edward Ng 2 , Anil Dudani 1 , Jun Wu 1 1 Public Health Agency of Canada, 100 Eglantine Dr, 0601E2, Ottawa, Canada, 2 Statistics Canada, 100 Eglantine Dr, Ottawa, Canada Background: The aim of this present study was to analyze the mortality from HCC over a 25 year period to explain the dramatic rise of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deaths in Canada. Methods: Based on the Canadian Mortality Database from Statistics Canada, we used the Age-Period-Cohort analysis to estimate trends from 1980 to 2004 in HCC mortality.Results: Results indicate an increasing secular trend in HCC mortality over the last 25 years. Overall, a birth-cohort effect was found that persons born in 1920-1929 had the highest risk of dying from HCC. The male-to-female death ratio was approximately 3:1. By nativity, the HCC mortality rates per 100,000 people aged 40 years and older was 5.98 (95% CI 5.11-6.99) in non-Canadian-born individuals and 2.86 (95% CI 2.38-3.44) in Canadian-born individuals. Poisson regression analysis revealed that non-Canadian-born people were more likely than Canadian-born people to die from HCC (adjusted risk ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.80-2.02). Age difference in this nativity effect was also observed. In the age group of 40-49 years old, the relative risk of dying from HCC was 2.93 (95% CI 2.43-3.54) times higher among non-Canadian-born people than among their Canadian-born counterparts. In the age group of 70-79 years old, the relative risk of dying from HCC was only 1.78 (95% CI 1.62-1.97) times higher among non-Canadian-born people than among Canadian-born people. Conclusions: Due to the dramatic increase in the mortality of HCC in Canada, there is a need to further investigate the risk factors associated with HCC mortality. This may enable us to determine the susceptibility to HCC among high-risk groups and to provide these individuals with effective measures for early intervention and early treatment.Screening for HCC in India: Early Detection and Impact on Survival Alison Murphy 1 , C. Agarwal 2 , Shyam Kottilil 1 , Michael Polis 1 , Mani Subramanian 3 , Sb. Desai 4 , Samir Shah 2 1 Lir/Niaid/Nih, 9000 Rockville Pike Bethesda, MD USA 20892, 2 Department Of Gasteroenterology, Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, India, 3 Human Genome Sciences Inc, Rockville, MD USA 20850, 4 Department Of Radiology, Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, IndiaBackground: An increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) reflects the increasing burden of advanced liver disease due to high prevalence of viral hepatitis in India. The usefulness of existing screening strategies for detection of HCC and survival of patients in India has not been studied. Aim: Assess the effectiveness of current standard screening for early detection of HCC. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was performed at a specialty liver clinic for incidence of HCC. A total of 2,258 patients with chronic liver disease who received adequate follow-up with biannual ultrasonograms and serum alfafetoprotein (AFP), resulted in a diagnosis of 75 cases of HCC. The control group included patients who presented with HCC without previous documented standard follow-up in the same time period. Two-way ANOVA was performed for statistical significance. Results: The baseline demographics (age, sex, underlying liver disease diagnosis) of both groups (N = 153; cases 75; controls 78) were similar (p = 0.5). However, the presentation of HCC indicated earlier lesions in the case study group when compared to the control group with regards to single (47 vs. 25, p \\ 0.03) or multiple tumor(19 vs. 41, p \\ 0.02), size of the vs. 11) respectively. The overall survival rates of case study group were 62% at 6 months and 29% at 12 months and 11% at 24 months after HCC diagnosis. At the time of HCC diagnosis 41% (25 of 61) had normal levels of AFP. Conclusions: Current guidelines for diagnosis of HCC may result in early diagnosis but the overall survival of these patients is poor. Development of better biomarkers and aggressive therapeutic strategies for early HCC lesions will be required to reduce mortality. Future research will focus on identification of disease-specific biomarkers for HCC diagnosis in India.Changing of HCC Profile in the Last Decade at Medistra Hospital Suwandhi Widjaja 1 1 Atma Jaya School of Medicine, Jakarta, Indonesia, Pluit Raya 2 Jakarta Utara. IndonesiaThe prevalence of HCC at Medistra Hospital from Jan 2004 to June 2008 was 103 patients. Moving backwards from June 1996 to December 1998 the HCC cases at the same hospital were 77. Some developments have occurred during this last decade, such as: The application of blood screening against HCV in blood transfusion since 1993. Also since the year 2000 we apply to vaccination against Hepatitis B. Moreover, we have come to a more effective and choices in armamentarium on treatments against the HBV and HCV infection and its complications. Last but not least an improvement of life expectancy in the Indonesian population. The prevalence of HCC was the same for the last decade, and the prevalence of HCC associated HBV was also pretty much the same to 10 years ago. But to our surprise, the prevalence of HCC associated HCV was in less number than numbers on the previous decade. And the prevalence of HCC non B non C was indeed increased compared to 10 years ago. Meanwhile for age distribution, the clinical picture and alpha feto-protein level maintain as the same profiles as 10 years ago. And TACE is showing a better result than the one in previous decade.Transarterial Chemoembolization in Combination withSorafenib for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis B-Endemic Asian Population Guo-Hong Han 1 , Wei Bai 1 , Zhan-Xin Yin 1 , Chuang-Ye He 1 , Rui Huang 1 , Jing Niu 1 , Wen-Gang Guo 1 , Kai-Chun Wu 2 , Dai-Ming Fan 2 1 Dept. of Digestive Interventional Radiology Xijing Hospital of Digestive Disease, No.15 Changle West Road, Xi'an, China, 2 Xijing Hospital of Digestive Disease, No.15 Changle West Road, Xi'an, ChinaBackground: This is a retrospective analysis of 52 patients receiving transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with Sorafenib from a single centre in China. Methods: Patients with advanced HCC have TACE performed with an emulsion of Pirarubicin (10-40 mg) and Mitomycin(2-8 mg)  followed by embolization with absorbable gelform particles. Sorafenib (400 mg bd) is dosed continuously with dose interruptions between 1 and 7 days during the TACE procedure. Patients receiving the combination therapy were included in this study if they survived for more than 4 weeks after the first treatment. Results: A total of 52 patients received the combination therapy. 3 patients died within 4 weeks and one patient was lost to follow up. Data for 48 patients are reported in this abstract. The median age is 52 years (range, 28-80) and 81% of patients were in ECOG Performance Status 0-1. The etiology for HCC is hepatitis B in 83% of the patients. 85% of patients were BCLC stage C (advanced stage). The median overall survival is 189 days(95%CL,. In all 52 patients, 5 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events. In those, 3 patients were suffered from grade 3 hand foot skin reaction and 2 patients experienced grade 3 TBIL elevation. Other grade 3 or 4 adverse events seen were fatigue, rash with one patient respectively. All patients improved upon dose modification and no patients dropped off the study due to adverse events. Conclusion: The TACE and Sorafenib combination appears to be safe and tolerable in patients with HCC. The efficacy,however, is comparable to single agent Sorafenib in the BCLC stage C setting. Further studies are required to identify the subset of HCC patients who may benefit from this combination therapy.Comparsion of Sorafenib and Radiotherapy in UnresectableHepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Whom Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization was Ineffective or Unsuitable Sung Bum Cho 1 , Ho Seong Rew 1 , Tae Jin Seo 1 , Hae Kyeng Jeong 1 , Seon Young Park 1 , Wan Sik Lee 1 , Young Eun Joo 1 , Jong Sun Rew 1 , Sung Kyu Choi 1 1 Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, hak 1 dong, dong gu, Gwang ju, KoreaBackground: Therapeutic modalities have not been estabilished for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whom could not undergone transcatheter artierial chemoembolization (TACE). We compared the feasibility, efficacy and side effects of sorafenib and radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for treatment of patients with advanced HCC Methods: Sorafenib group (34 cases) and radiotherapy (RT) group (28 cases) from sixty two patients with advanced HCC of Child-Pugh status A or B were retrospectively reviewed. Result: The clinical characteristics of two groups was no significant difference. The median oral administration time of sorafenib was 65 days (range, 5-245 day). The radiologic responses were 25% (7/28) in RT group and 6% (2/34) in sorafenib group. The rates of ongoing hepatic failure at 3 month later were 53% (15/28) in RT group and 32% (11/34) in sorafenib group. The median duration of time to progression was 121 days in RT group and 146 days in sorafenib group. The mean overall survival was 162 days in RT group and 285 days in sorafenib group. The most frequent adverse events were nausea (32%) in RT group and dermal reaction (44%) in sorafenib group. The severe adverse events such as variceal bleeding (11%) and HCC rupture (7%) were more frequent in RT group. Conclusion: The radiotherapy was shown to more frequently cases of hepatic failure than sorafenib therapy inspite of more good radiologic response. Careful choice of treatment modalities should be need in patient with advanced HCC and Child A or B in whom TACE was ineffective or unsuitable.Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Long Term Outcome and Prognostic Factors Affecting Survival Gerby Coronel 1 , Ernesto Que 1,2 , Ferdinand Morabe 2 , Riza Marquez 2 1 East Avenue Medical Center, East Avenue, Quezon City, Philippines, 2 National Kidney And Transplant Institute, East Avenue, Quezon City, PhilippinesObjectives: To evaluate the effect of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) on the long term survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), likewise determine the prognostic factors that could affect survival including tumor response characteristics. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed in 51 patients who underwent 86 TACE procedures (range, 1-5) between 2002 and 2005. Mean duration of follow-up was 29.3 months. Prognostic factors including baseline patient characteristics, biochemical markers, radiologic tumor characteristics, and tumor response characteristics were evaluated. Results: Using Kaplan-Meier, the 1,2,3 and 5 year survival was 85.7, 59, 37.8, 15.3% with a mean and median survival of 33.21 and 28 months respectively. Liver related events which included liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome were the common causes of death followed by infections. TACE related events include post embolization syndrome (57%), infections (6%) and reversible liver decompensation (6%). There was no TACE related mortality documented. 3-month post treatment tumor size reduction of at least 25% was noted in 52.9% of the population. Univariate and multivariate analysis, using Cox proportional hazard, showed that presence of ascites (HR = 2.003 CI95%(1.385-2.898), p = 0.035), the Child's-Pugh classification (HR = 2.330 CI95% (1.408-3.453), p = 0.041, initial tumor size (HR = 1.254 CI95% (0.950-1.834), p = 0.005, and the presence of vascular tumor invasion (HR = 1.456 CI95% (1.125-1.730), p = 0.029, were the only independent significant prognostic factors of patient survival.Conclusion: TACE is effective as a palliative therapy in improving survival in patients with HCC. The presence of ascites, Child's-Pugh class, initial tumor size and presence of vascular tumor invasion are strong predictors of patient survival. Backgrounds/Aims: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), the palliative treatment option for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has been contraindicated in HCCs with main portal vein (MPV) invasion. However, it was recently suggested that TACE could be safely performed in patients with good hepatic function although there is MPV invasion. In this study, we aimed to refine the efficacy and safety of TACE in patients with HCC with MPV invasion. Methods: We assessed the efficacy and safety of TACE in newly diagnosed HCC with MPV invasion patients from January 2004 to December 2007 at a single tertiary medical center in Korea. Clinical data was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Results: One hundred and twenty-five patients (male, 83.2%; mean age, 55.7 year) were enrolled and their median follow-up duration was 3.7 months (range, 0.2-33.3). Eighty-three (66.4%) patients were treated with TACE and 42 (33.6%) patients received best supportive care (BSC). Repeated TACE showed significant survival benefits compared with BSC in patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A (median survival, 7.4 vs 2.6 months; P \\ 0.001) and class B (median survival, 2.8 vs. 1.9 months; P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, treatment with TACE [hazard ratio, 0.263 (95% CI, 0.164-0.424), P \\ 0.001] and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A [hazard ratio, 0.550 (95% CI, 0.368-0.822), P = 0.004] were independent favorable predictive factors. Conclusions: TACE can be performed safely and, furthermore, improve overall survival in HCC patients with MPV invasion. Major Complications of Percutaneous Radiofrequency Ablation are Associated with the Number of RFA Zones Created: A Caution on Trying to do too Much Esperanza Grace Santi 1 , Stephen Wong 1,2 , Diana Payawal 1 1 University of Santo Tomas Hospital, Manila, Philippines, 2 Chinese General Hospital, Manila, PhilippinesIntroduction: Major complications from percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are low (0-5%). However, improvements in needle design and RFA techniques have led to increased targeting of larger tumors and may increase complication rates. We aimed to determine factors that predict complications after RFA. Methods: Seventy four RFA sessions in 56 consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 33) or liver metastasis (n = 23) from March 2007 to November 2009 were analyzed. Complications directly related to RFA were classified according to recent guidelines (Radiology 2005; 235:728). Sessions where C1 tumor was within 5 mm of a vital structure or C3 mm vessel were considered high-risk. Results: A mean of 2.1 \u00b1 1.3 tumors with an aggregate size of 6.7 \u00b1 3.3 were ablated per session. There were 4 (5.4%) major (1 hemothorax requiring drainage, 1 biloma, 1 tumor seeding, and 1 subcapsular hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion) and 2 (2.7%) minor (asymptomatic biliary dilatation) complications observed. Variceal bleeding in 2 patients (1 leading to death) were not directly related to RFA. Sessions that had major complications had more RFA zones (7.5 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 4.7 \u00b1 1.9; p = 0.008) and longer RFA time (78.8 \u00b1 29.2 vs. 50.9 \u00b1 20.9; p = 0.018) than those without. Although not significantly higher in high-risk sessions (5.6% highrisk vs. 0% low-risk;p = 1.0), all major complications occurred in high-risk sessions. The sole independent predictor of a major complication was the number of RFA zones created during the session (OR=1.8 [95%CI = 1.1-2.9]; p = 0.021). Conclusion: RFA of liver malignancies is a safe procedure with acceptable complication rates. However, prudence is needed in trying to ablate more areas in a single session. Staged procedures may decrease complication rates.EthanolAblation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Sized Up To 5 cm by Using a Multi-pronged Injection Needle with High-Dose Strategy Ming Kuang 1 , Ming-De Lu 1 , Xiao-Yan Xie 2 1 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong Shan Road 2, Guangzhou 510080, China, 2 Department of Medical Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, 58 Zhong Shan Road 2, Guangzhou 510080, ChinaBackgrounds: Routine ethanol ablation (EA) of HCC accomplishes limited necrosis in tumors larger than 3 cm, because of the incomplete ethanol infiltration inside the whole tumor tissue. RF ablation achieves a higher rate of complete response with fewer treatment sessions, compared with EA. However, RF ablation of tumors at high-risk locations increases the risk of complication. Therefore, PEI will continue to play a role in the treatment of HCC. We investigated whether EA using a multi-pronged needle could eradicate hepatocellulcar carcinoma (HCC) sized up to 5 cm with single-session high-dose strategy. Methods: The hospital ethics committee approved the prospective study and each patient provided written informed consent. One hundred and forty one patients (125 men, 16 women, mean age, 53 years, age range, 27-76 years) with 164 primary or recurrent HCC ranged 1.3-5.0 cm (mean, 2.9 \u00b1 0.9 cm) were treated with high-dose multi-pronged EA. Patients were unsuitable for surgery, or declined surgery and RF ablation, or had tumors located at unfavorable sites. Primary technique effectiveness (PTE) (complete ablation within two sessions), local tumor progression (LTP) and complications after the treatment were observed. Twenty risk factors of local efficacy and complication were analyzed by means of univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Mean treatment sessions were 1.1. The average volume of ethanol per tumor was 31 mL (range, 8-68 mL). PTE was achieved in 134 patients (95%, 134/141) and significantly associated with tumor pattern (encapsulated vs. noncapsulated, P = 0.018). After a mean follow-up period of 25 months, LTP was observed in 16 patients (14%, 16/134) and 9 occurring in tumors 3.1-5.0 cm in size. Alanine aminotransferase level (P = 0.023) was the independent risk factor of LTP. Three patients had major complications (2%, 3/141). Conclusion: Multi-pronged EA with a high-dose strategy is capable of treating HCC up to 5 cm in diameter effectively and safely, often in a single session.Comparison of Radiofrequency Ablation and TransarterialChemoembolization for Treatment of Single Hepatocellular Carcinoma Smaller Than 4 cm Soon Sun Kim 1 , Min Jae Yang 1 , Da Mi Lee 1 , Myoung Hee Lee 1 , Su Jin Jeon 1 , Kyung Hyun Koh 1 , Jae Youn Cheong 1 , Sung Won Cho 1 1 Ajou University School of Medicine, Wonchon-dong, Yeongtong-ku, KoreaBackground/Aims: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is accepted as an established curative therapeutic modality for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been used as a palliative treatment for inoperable HCC. It is still unknown whether RFA and TACE are equally effective to improve survival of patients with unresectable HCC which is amenable to either treatment. This retrospective study aimed to compare the clinical impacts of two treatments, and analyze the prognostic factors for recurrence and survival. Methods: From January 2002 to February 2009, 93 patients with single HCC smaller than 4 cm who received treatment with RFA (n = 43) or TACE (n = 50) were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for 13 potential prognostic factors by using the Cox proportional hazard model.Results: Time to recurrence rate at 1, 2, and 3 years in the RFA group and TACE group were 32.9/44.3/55.4%, and 42/68.3/71.7%, respectively (p = 0.129). The probability of survival at 1, 2, and 3 years were 97.7/77.4/ 63.1% in the RFA group; 95.9/76.1/60.2% in the TACE group, respectively (p = 0.495). There was no significant difference in time to-recurrence rate and overall survival rate between the two groups. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed that tumor size larger than 3 cm and low serum albumin level were independent risk factors for recurrence, and male, positivity of hepatitis B surface antigen, and high serum albumin level were independent favorable prognostic factors for survival. Conclusions: TACE was similar to RFA in reducing recurrence rate and improving survival rate for patients with single HCC smaller than 4 cm.A Prospective Study on Radiofrequency Ablation versus Surgical Resection for Small Solitary Hepatocellular CarcinomaZhen-Wei Peng 1 , Min-Shan Chen 1 , Xiao-Jun Lin 1 , Yao-Jun Zhang 1 1 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Cancer Centre of Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road East, Guangzhou 510060, ChinaBackground: Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) has been proven to be as effective as surgical resection (SR) for small HCC. But, which is the better choice for selected patients with solitary small HCC B3 remains debatable. Methods: Patients with solitary HCC B3 cm, and Child-Pugh A scores were prospectively allocated to two groups. Group A: patients received PRFA as first choice if HCC was located 1 cm or more away from liver peripheral envelope; the other patients received SR. Group B: patients received SR as first choice if HCC was located 3 cm or less away from liver peripheral envelope; the other patients received PRFA. Results: A total of 195 patients were included, 103 in Group A and 92 in Group B. In Group A, 79 patients received PRFA, and 24 patients received SR because of tumor location (21 cases) or because of patient refusal of PRFA (3 cases). In Group B, 75 patients received SR, and 17 patients received PRFA. There were zero and 2 cases of treatment-related mortality in Group A and Group B, respectively. The 1-, 3-, 4-year overall survival rate for Group A and Group B were 95.9,75.8, 70.7 and 90.1, 63.7, 55.5%, respectively. Group A had a significantly better survival rate than Group B (P = 0.038). Conclusion: A treatment strategy based on PRFA as the first choice for patients with solitary B3 cm may be more appropriate than surgical resection in this group of selected patients.Transarterial Chemoembolization in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Renal InsufficiencyTeh-Ia Huo 1 , Chia-Yang Hsu 1 , Yi-Hsiang Huang 1Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 201, Shi-Pai Rd, Taipei, TaiwanBackground: Renal dysfunction is often present in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Acute renal failure (ARF) may occur after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) due to radiocontrast agent. This study investigated the incidence and risk factors of ARF and prognostic predictors in HCC patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency undergoing TACE. Methods: A total of 566 HCC patients undergoing TACE were enrolled. Renal insufficiency was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 ml/(min 1.73 m 2 ). Results: In a mean follow-up duration of 18\u00b116 months, 231 (40.8%) patients undergoing TACE died. Renal insufficiency, which was present in 134 (23.7%) patients at baseline, independently predicted a poor prognosis in the Cox proportional hazards model [risk ratio (RR): 1.47, p = 0.012]. Of them, 13 (10%) and 6 (5%) patients had transient and prolonged ARF after TACE, respectively. Post-TACE gastrointestinal bleeding [odds ratio (OR): 16.54, p = 0.001 and higher Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) scores C2; OR: 4.22, p= 0.02] were independent risk factors for ARF in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the Cox model, prolonged ARF (RR: 3.28, p \\ 0.001) and higher CLIP scores (C2; RR: 2.13, p \\ 0.001) were independent poor prognostic predictors for HCC patients with renal insufficiency receiving TACE. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal bleeding and higher CLIP scores are associated with the development of ARF in patients with HCC and renal insufficiency undergoing TACE. Higher CLIP scores and renal insufficiency, either preexisting before TACE or as a complication of TACE, are poor prognostic predictors in HCC patients receiving TACE.The Comparison of Treatment Efficacy between Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy and Hepatic Arterial Infusion Therapy in Advanced Hepatocellular CarcinomaKyung In Lee 1 , Eun Soo Kim, Byoung Kuk Jang, Woo Jin Chung, Kyung Sik Park, Kwang Bum Cho, Jae Seok Hwang, Young Hwan Kim 2 , Jung Hyeok Kwon 2 , Jin Hee Kim 3 Department of Internal Medicine, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Korea, 2 Radiology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Korea, 3 Radiation Oncology, Keimyung University School of Medicine, KoreaBackground/Aims: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma has a poor prognosis and there is no curative therapy. The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and hepatic arterial infusion therapy (HAIT) in advanced HCC.Methods: Between January 2004 and February 2009, 58 patients (CCRT; 16  and HAIT; 42)  with advanced HCC (TNM stage IV-A) were included in this study. Exclusion criteria was older than 80 years, more than ECOG 2, Child-Pugh class C, renal dysfunction, or extrahepatic metastasis. The patients received 5-FU(250 mg)/Cisplatin (10 mg)/Leucovorin(12 mg) for 5 days every 3 weeks via implanted chemoport. In CCRT group, patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy (4,500 cGy/5 weeks) in addition to HAIT. After 2 cycles of all these therapies, abdominal CT and serum alpha-fetoprotein were checked to evaluate therapeutic response. Results: (1) In patients treated with CCRT or HAIT, response rates after 2 cycles were 43.8% (partial response 7, stable disease 9) versus 19.0% (partial response 8, stable disease 20, progressive disease 14), respectively (P = 0.010). (2) Particularly patients with Child-Pugh class A in CCRT showed good response (P = 0.008). (3) There is no difference of response rate according to presence of portal vein tumor thrombosis. (4) The median survival time of CCRT group was 171 days compared with 152 days for HAIT (P = 0.654). (5) Patients who underwent HAIT with high pre-treatment alphafetoprotein level (C1,000 ng/mL), they had poor response (P = 0.003). (6) Patients treated with CCRT showed significant decline of post-treatment alphafetoprotein (P = 0.042). Conclusions: CCRT can achieves favorable results in advanced HCC with good reserve liver function compared with HAIT. CCRT can be considered as a treatment option for the management of advanced HCC. However further investigation is required to assess long term response rate and overall survival.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of 22 patients who were initially treated with sorafenib and TACE for unresectable HCC, with particular attention to sorafenib interruption or delay of consecutive TACE due to their SEs, during initial two sessions of combination therapy. SEs were graded using Common Toxicity Criteria version-3.0. Tumor response was assessed based on MRI evidence of tumor necrosis or the appearance of new tumors. Results: During the initial two sessions of combination therapy, all grades SEs occurred in 17 patients (grade 3/4 SEs in 10 patients). Among those, 14 patients required transient-interruption or discontinuation of sorafenib within average of the first 2.5 weeks of combination therapy. Seven patients required delay of the consecutive TACE for grater than 4 weeks. However, all patients recovered from grade 2/3 to grade 0/1 SEs within an average of median 2.5 weeks. Five patients achieved effective tumor necrosis without intra-/extra-hepatic metastases with two sessions of combination therapy. Conclusions: SEs of combination therapy occurred frequently during early phases of treatment, which could lead to treatment interruption or delay of the scheduled consecutive TACE. Our experiences suggest to be the possibilities that combination therapy with sorafenib and TACE might interface with each other due to their SEs in some patients with unresectable HCC, contrary to our expectations that combination therapy would interact with each other synergistically.Top 10% PostersThe Comparison of Effects between Concurrent Chemoradiation Therapy and Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, Cisplatin and Doxorubicin for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Seul Ki Min 1 , Sang Gyune Kim 1 , Young Seok Kim 1 , Jae Young Jang 1 , Soung Won Jeong 1 , Sae Hwan Lee 1 , Hong Soo Kim 1 , Moon Sung Lee 1 , Boo Sung Kim 1 1 Digestive Disease Center, Soon Chun Hyang University, South Korea Objectives: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. Currently liver transplantation within Milan criteria or surgical resection shows best survival gains, though there are diverse opinions for treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We conducted this study to compare the clinical efficacy between concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin, and doxorubicin. Methods: From May 2002 to June 2009, 51 unresectable HCC patients were recruited and received HAIC or CCRT at our hospital. Localized external beam radiation therapy was performed to a total delivered dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks with conventional fractionation. HAIC was done using an intra-arterial implanted port and infusion of 5-FU, cisplatin and doxorubicin. Patients were scheduled to receive four serial courses of HAIC. Responders were defined as having either a complete response or partial response. Results: 28 patients were in CCRT and 23 patients were in HAIC. There were no statistically significant differences between the two study groups with respect to age, gender, residual liver function, size of intrahepatic tumor and serum level of alpha-fetoprotein. In CCRT group 3 patients (10.7%) were classified as responder. In HAIC group 3 patients (13.6%) were classified as responder. The median follow-up time was 10.30 months (95% CI:4.97-15.63). Median survival time of CCRT group was 9.10 months (95% CI:7.57-10.69) and HAIC group was 14.80 months (95% CI:4.36-25.24) but statistically not significant (p = 0.40). Median time to progression of CCRT group was 5.97 months (95% CI:3.81-8.13) and HAIC group was 14.80 months (95% CI:5.06-24.54) but statistically not significant (p = 0.377). Conclusion: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy didn't showed benefits to overall survival time, time to progression and tumor response.Background and aim: Impaired liver function with pharmacokinetics must be taken into consideration in the clinical study of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Here, we demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of TSU-68, a multi-kinase inhibitors in Japanese patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC. Methods: Patients were stratified based on the liver function, from no cirrhosis to Child-Pugh class B in phase I, and the effectiveness of TSU-68 were evaluated in phase II at the dose determined in phase I. TSU-68 was given orally twice a day after meals without interruption. Results: Twelve patients were enrolled in phase I. Dose-limiting toxicities were found with TSU-68 at the dose of 400 mg bid in Child-Pugh B patients, and 200 mg bid was established as the phase II dose. Phase II was performed on 23 additional patients and a total of 35 patients were evaluated for safety and efficacy. One patient (2.9%) had a complete response. Two patients (5.7%) had a partial response, and 15 patients (42.8%) showed stable disease. The median time to progression was 2.1 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. Common adverse events were hypoalbuminemia, diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, malaise, edema and AST/ALT elevation. The analysis of angiogenesis-related parameter suggests serum soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 is the possible marker to show the response. Conclusions: TSU-68 at a dose of 200 mg bid that was determined by stratification into liver function, showed promising efficacy with a high safety profile in heavily pretreated HCC patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials gov, number NCT 00784290.Immunological Effects of a Recombinant Genetic Vaccine Encoding Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Antigen HCA661 and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Heat Shock Protein 70 C-terminal Stimulatory Domain Fusion Protein Yu-Qin Li 1 , Lei Liu 2 , Yan Tan 2 1 Department of Gastroenterology, 1st Hospital, Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130021 China, 2 Central Laboratory, 1st Hospital, Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Street, Changchun, Jilin, 130021 ChinaBackground/Aims: In China, hepatocellular carcinoma counts for more than 90% of original liver cancers and the second most cancer-caused death. Long-term outcome is bad due to a tendency of reoccurrence, metastasis and the limited therapeutic means. Recombinant DNA vaccine encoding tumourspecific antigen can be injected into patients, and continuous expression of the antigen induce comprehensive and long-lasting humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the tumor. Methods and results: In this study we made a genetic vaccine using the hepatocellular HCA661, also called TFDP3 or CD40, since HCA661 has a hepatocellular carcinoma-specific expression pattern and showed strong immunogenicity toward hepatocellular carcinoma. The stimulatory domain C-terminal of mtHSP70 was used as the adjuvant because it was shown to improve the CD40L-induced DCs maturation and increase the phosphorylation of p38MAP in the CD40-HSP70 pathway. Flow cytometry showed that mice immunized by HCA661-mtHSP70E (fused with the mtHSP70 C-terminal stimulatory domain) had significantly higher levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, total T cells and CD4+/CD8+ values than the control and HCA661-mtHSP70C (fused with the complete C-terminal of mtHSP70).(2)   Western blot and ELISA showed that HCA661-mtHSP70E immunized mice have higher serum antibody concentration than control and HCA661-mtHSP70C. (3) Specific lethal effect experiments carried out in a NIH3T3 cell line stably expressing HCA661-GFP showed that HCA661-mtHSP70E immunized mice had higher CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) killing than control and HCA661-mtHSP70C. (4) HCA661-mtHSP70E immunized mice do not produce antibody against mtHSP70. Conclusion: We constructed a DNA vaccine expressing HCA661-mtHSP70E fusion protein in mice, and verified that HCA661-mtHSP70E is more efficient than HCA661-mtHSP70C in inducing humoral and cell-mediated tumorspecific immune responses, possibly because p407-425 can decrease the selfimmune responses caused by mtHSP70C.Combination Therapy of Intra-arterial 5-FU and Systemic IFN for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Portal Venous Invasion Shuntaro Obi 1 , Shinpei Sato 1 , Takahisa Sato 1 1 Kyo-Un-Do Hospital, 1-8 Kandasurugadai, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, JapanBackground: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal venous invasion (PVI) has a very poor prognosis, with a median survival of 3 months and virtually no survival at 1 year. The combination of intraarterial 5-fluorouracil (FU) and systemic peg-interferon (peg-IFN) was recently reported to be effective against HCC with PVI, but these were small pilot studies. Methods: Six hundred and forty nine patients with HCC with PVI received peg-IFN (90 micrograms subcutaneously on Days 1 of each week of treatment) and 5-FU (500 mg into hepatic artery on Days 1-5 of the first and second week of each 4-week cycle). The therapy was either terminated at the end of the first cycle in cases with progressive disease, or continued for at least three cycles, when responses to treatment were evaluated by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group criteria. Results: Seventy one (10%) patients showed complete response and another 154 (24%) showed partial response. Adverse events were limited to nausea and appetite loss. The survival rates at 12 and 24 months among overall patients were 33 and 14%, respectively. MST was 6.9 months. Survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 91 and 61% among complete responders, respectively, and 52 and 16% among partial responders. Conclusion: The combination therapy with 5-FU and IFN was safe, and substantially improved the survival rate among the complete responders.Effects of Avastin Combined with Sorafenib in a HighlyMetastatic Murine Model of Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Wei Zhang 1 , Yu-Quan Xiong 1 , Peng-Yuan Zhuang 1 , Xiao-Dong Zhu 1 , Hua-Xiang Xu 1 , Ling-Qun Kong 1 , Wei-Zhong Wu 1 , Lu Wang 1 , Hui-Chuan Sun 1 , Zhao-You Tang 1 1 Liver Cancer Institute and Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 136 Yi Xue Yuan Road, Shanghai 200032, ChinaBackground: To investigate the effect of combination of sorafenib and avastin, a VEGF neutralizing antibody on tumor growth, lung metastasis and survival of tumor-bear nude mice in a highly metastatic xenograft murine model of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Xenograft of a highly metastatic human HCC tumor (LCI-D20) was used to evaluate survival, primary tumor growth and lung metastasis after treatment with avastin alone or in combination with sorafenib. Tumor angiogenesis was identified by immunohistochemistry staining for CD31 and calculated as microvessel density (MVD). Apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells were determined by double immunofluoresence staining for CD31 and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL). Results: Tumor volumes were (5.7 \u00b1 0.17), (1.1 \u00b1 0.18), (0.6 \u00b1 0.12) and (2.1 \u00b1 0.28) mm 3 in control, sorafenib, sorafenib plus avastin and avastin group. Lung metastasis was (191 \u00b1 23), (98 \u00b1 18),(31 \u00b1 19)  and(98 \u00b1 20)   in four groups, and median survival were 70, 87, 112 and 80 days, respectively. Combination of avastin and sorafenib significantly reduced plasma VEGF, decreased tumor volume, inhibited numbers of lung metastasis, and prolonged survival compared to mice treated with sorafenib alone. No obvious side effects were observed in the combined group and body weight was similar in four groups.

This study aimed to evaluate the preclinical effects of pazopanib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with overlapping but not identical spectrum with sorafenib, in experimental hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Firstly, in vitro direct effects of pazopanib on human HCC cells (HCCLM3, HepG2, and PLC/PRF/5) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were evaluated. In vivo therapeutic effects were determined in the subcutaneous HCCLM3 and PLC/PRF/5 and orthotopic HepG2 xenograft nude mice models. Intratumoral blood perfusion was detected by contrastenhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in the subcutaneous HCCLM3 models, and parameters were quantitatively profiled from the time-intensity curves established according to the sonography.",

Radiofrequency Ablation Combined with Hypertonic Saline: An Ex Vivo Study in Bovine Liver Paolo Villareal 1 , Stephen Wong 1 , Arl Ann Mendoza-Manzo 1 , Esperanza Grace Santi 1 , Redigo Aguilar 1 , Hendra Nurjadin 1 1 University of Santo Tomas Hospital, Espana, Manila, Philippines Background: Previous studies show that injection of hypertonic saline (26% NaCl) during radiofrequency ablation (RFA) results in larger coagulation volumes compared to RFA alone. Injecting hypertonic saline at a distance from the RFA electrode may further increase coagulation volume. Objective: To determine the effects of hypertonic saline injected beside or at a distance from the RFA electrode on coagulation diameter and volume after RFA. Methods: A Cooltip RFA electrode with 3 cm tip was used in freshly excised bovine livers. The experiment was divided into five groups with three repetitions each: (A) RFA alone; RFA with 33 mL (B) and 16.5 ml (C) hypertonic saline injected 15 mm away from the electrode; RFA with 33 mL (D) and 16.5 ml (E) hypertonic saline injected immediately beside the electrode. The maximum diameter and volume of coagulation, and sphericity ratios were compared using one-way ANOVA. Results: There were no differences in baseline impedance, and baseline and final tissue temperatures between the five groups (p [ 0.05). Despite a drop of 15.2 \u00b1 7 Ohms in impedance after hypertonic saline injection, there were no differences in maximum coagulation diameters (A = 3.93 \u00b1 0.49 cm vs. B = 3.53 \u00b1 0.15 cm vs. C = 3.13 \u00b1 0.15 cm vs. D = 3.83 \u00b1 0.65 cm vs. E = 3.27 \u00b1 0.49 cm; p = 0.19) and volumes (A = 33.14 \u00b1 7.19 cm 3 vs. B = 22.87 \u00b1 1.52 cm 3 vs. C = 18.99 \u00b1 3.29 cm 3 vs. D = 25.41 \u00b1 4.81 cm 3 vs. E = 22.55 \u00b1 7.33 cm 3 ; p = 0.074). Sphericity ratios were less than 1 in all groups (p = 0.373), indicating slightly elongated coagulation. Conclusion: Although a decrease in impedance due to hypertonic saline may allow increased energy deposition, there was no advantage of combining hypertonic saline injection compared to RFA alone in bovine livers. A Case of Complete Response after Transaterial Chemoembolization and Radiotherapy for Portal Vein Malignant Thrombus in Patient with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Nam Hwan Park 1 , Kwan Woo Nam 1 , Hee Jung Lee 1 , Sun Chang Hong 1 , Hee Seok Moon 1 , Eaum Seok Lee 1 , Seok Hyun Kim 1 , Byung Seok Lee 1 , Heon Young Lee 1 1 Chungnam National University School of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea Background: Radiation therapy (RT) is one of treatment choice for the patients who had unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and was unresponsive to the local ablation therapy or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). RT is relatively safe, even if there is malignant thrombus in portal vein. We experienced a patient who had complete response after combined TACE and 3dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for portal vein malignant thrombus in unresectable HCC. Method: A 49-years-old male patient who was diagnosed as multiple hepatic cellular carcinoma. He had underlying chronic hepatitis B related cirrhosis and liver function was Child-Pugh Class A. Its largest size was 9.1 cm and stage was III, T3N0M0. Malignant thrombosis was found at the left portal vein. He received two times TACE and radiation therapy in sequential order. Chemoembolization procedure was performed using lipiodol 18 cc and adriamycin 50 mg. A daily radiation dose was 180 cGy/day, and it was administered at 5 fractions a week, to deliver a total dose was 4,500 cGy. Result: Three months later, hepatoma presented marginal recurrence without thrombosis on the abdominal computer tomography. So, third TACE was done. Up to now, he is alive without any evidence of recurrence during 16 months. There was not any radiation induced toxicity.

Methods: Studies comparing laparoscopic and open liver resection published between 2002 and 2009 were included using the Medline search. Endpoints were: operative blood loss, operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications. Results: Six nonrandomized pair-matched studies were identified. They comprised totally 677 patients of which 409 (60,4%) had laparoscopic procedure and 268 (39,6%) had open surgery. Operative blood loss was estimated in five studies where in all but one study it was significantly reduced in laparoscopic group (mean blood loss = 135 ml vs. 348 ml in open group; p \\ 0.05). Operative time was assessed in five studies where in three of them it was significantly longer in laparoscopic group (mean time = 173 vs. 135 min in open group; p \\ 0.05). Other two studies failed to show any statistical difference. Hospital stay was assessed in four studies, where in all of them it was significantly shorter in laparoscopic group (mean stay = 6.45 vs. 9 days in open group; p \\ 0.05). Postoperative complications were assessed in only two studies where they were significantly more often seen in open group (mean rate = 37.4 vs. 9.3% in laparoscopic group; p \\ 0.05).Conclusions: According to analyzed studies laparoscopic hepatectomy is at least as safe as open surgery. In most studies laparoscopic liver resection has benefits of significantly decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stay and fewer postoperative complications.Anterior Approach for a Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma Joji Yamamoto 1 , Yoshiaki Shimizu 1 , Fumiharu Makino 1 , Shigehiro Kojima 1 , Yuuki Ozamoto 1 , Motoki Nagai 2 1 Kamagaya General Hospital, 929-6 Hatsutomi Kamagaya, Chiba, Japan, 2 Chibanishi General Hospital, 107-1 Kanegasaku Matsudo, Chiba, Japan",

Recently surgical skill, surgical instrument, perioperative management and diagnostic tools developed and surgical outcome also improved. Hence, we analyzed recent outcome of hepatic resection for HCC and investigated the prognostic factors relating to this. Methods: Between January 2001 and December 2006, 399 patients who underwent hepatic resection were retrospectively reviewed. Mean age was 53.8 year (17-81). There were 329 (82.5%) men and 70 (17.5%) women. Among these, 13 palliative cases were excluded. Median follow-up duration was 28 months (0.2-96.1). The chronological comparison was based on 2003. Results: Overall 5-year survival and disease-free survival rate were 59.4 and 33.5% respectively. According to chronology, 3-year survival rate, 3-year survival rate before and after 2003 were 65.7 and 78.8% respectively (P = 0.002). In-hospital mortality (3-month) and major morbidities after 2003 were significantly lower than before 2003 (4.8 vs. 0.4%, P = 0.004; 15.9 vs 5.4%, P \\ 0.001). On multivariate analysis, preoperative AFP (HR = 1.66, P = 0.021), tumor size (HR = 2.49, P \\ 0.001), microvascular invasion (HR = 2.94, P \\ 0.001), and intraoperative transfusion (HR = 2.45, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors for survival. According to subgroup analysis using tumor size B5 cm and microvascular invasion (mvi), survival rate of group with B5 cm & mvi(-),[5 cm & mvi(-), B5 cm & mvi(+), and[5 cm & mvi(+)  were 79.0, 59.0, 60.9, and 28.1% respectively (P \\ 0.001), 5-disease-free survival rate of each group were 54.0, 34.4, 20.1, and 9.5% respectively (P \\ 0.001). Especially, 5-year survival rate of BCLC A1 patients with tumor size B5 cm was 83.7%. Conclusion: Recently the rate of operative mortality and morbidity is getting lower.

However, clinical course or treatment strategy for inoperable cases remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nonsurgical treatment option as well as relevant factors in survival in such cases. Methods: Inclusion criteria were consecutive patients who were diagnosed as HCC with bile duct invasion and were not eligible for SR, between January 2005 and December 2008 at a single tertiary medical center in Korea. Survival analyses were performed to compare various clinical parameters and to evaluate prognostic factors. Results: Except for six patients who undertook SR, a total of 66 patients were included (mean age, 56.3 years; male, 80.3%). Hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 62% of patients at the time of diagnosis (mean, 5.0 \u00b1 7.25 mg/dL). During the observation period (median, 34.1; range, 10.4-57.4 months), 50 patients died (median survival, 5.9 months; 95% C.I., 3.6-8.2 months). Independent predictors for overall survival included UICC T stage, tumor morphology (nodular vs. diffuse), and initial treatment modality (transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) vs. systemic therapy) in the multivariate analyses. Other factors such as morphologic classification (Ueda) of bile duct invasion, UICC N or M stage and serum a-fetoprotein level failed to affect the OS significantly. Considering patients with Child-Pugh class A or B, patients treated with TACE showed significantly longer survival than those who did not receive TACE (median OS, 9.3 months vs. 1.9 months, respectively; P \\ 0.0001). Conclusion: Although inoperable cases with HCC accompanying bile duct invasion demonstrated poor prognosis, survival benefit might be anticipated with TACE if performed in properly selected cases according to their intrahepatic tumor stage and underlying hepatic function.The Analysis of Variceal Hemorrhage in the Patients with Hepatocelluar Carcinoma Jae Young Jang 1 , Dong Kyun Kim 1 , Soung Won Jeong 1 , Sae Hwan Lee 1 , Sang Gyune Kim 1 , Young Koog Cheon 1 , Young Seok Kim 1 , Young Deok Cho 1 , Hong Soo Kim 1 , Boo Sung Kim 1 1 Institute for Digestive Research, Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine, 22, Daesagwan-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, 140-743, Korea",

Methods: From 2002 to 2009, 125 patients with unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer were treated by RFA. At the initial ablation, the mean number and size of hepatic tumor foci were 6.0 \u00b1 7.4 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 47 \u00b1 36 mm. Patients were not considered for surgical resection due to the presence of extrahepatic metastases (67 patients), prior hepatic resection (24), extent of tumor involvement (41), and age([75 year old, 31). 67 patients were nonresponders to previous chemotherapy. Prognostic factors of the patients were evaluated by multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The enrolled 125 patients have received a total of 418 RFA procedures.

And, blood supply to bile duct is important in pathogenesis of biliary complications. The objective of this study is to verify the effect of different techniques for bile duct anastomosis method on posttransplant biliary complication. From August, 2005 to August, 2008, 68 LDLT using right lobe graft recipients were enrolled in this study. We used different techniques for biliary dissection by period. First 38 recipients used 'Classic dissection', next 30 recipients used 'Hilar plate looping technique. 'Hilar plate looping' technique means that the complete hilar plate and glissonian sheath around the hepatic duct is looped after full dissection of right hepatic artery and portal vein. Biloma or stricture that required surgical or radiologic intervention treatment and developed within 6 months after transplantation was determined as complication. There was statistically no difference of demographics in each group. The incidence of complication in group 1 was 15 (39.5%), and 3 (18.8%) in group 2. Especially, there was no biliary stricture in group 2. There was significant difference of complication rate between group 1 and 2 (P = 0.006). This new technique of 'Hilar plate looping' during donor surgery significantly reduces recipient biliary complications in LDLT.Top 10% PostersTheEffect of Pretransplantation Lamivudine Resistance on the Prognosis in Liver Transplantation Recipients Joon Suk Kim 1 , Sang Youn Hwang 1 , Goh Eun Chung 1 , Hwi Young Kim 1 , Jeong-Hoon Lee 1 , Jung-Hwan Yoon 1 , Hyo-Suk Lee 1 , Nam-Joon Yi 2 , Kyung-Suk Suh 2 , Kuhn Uk Lee 2 , Yoon Jun Kim 1 1 Department of Internal Medicine and Liver Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 28 Yungun-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea, 2 Department of Surgery, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, 28 Yungun-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea",

MHV, situated in the plane of the main portal fissure, is an important element for resection and transplant surgery of the liver. We analyzed the morphological aspects with surgical value of the MHV on 150 corrosion casts. They were made by injecting with plastic of the vasculo-ductal elements and hepatic parenchyma corrosion with hydrochloric acid. According to the dimensions of the origin affluents, MHV was classified into three morphological types: TI, where the two affluents of origin (right anterior vein-RAV and left anterior vein-LAV) have comparable sizes; TII, where RAV is larger; TIII, where LAV is larger.

            "text": "Background: Hypoxia may activate survival signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. We have previously shown that hexokinase II (HK II) is actively participating in HCC cell survival, especially in a hypoxic environment, and that HK II inhibitor can induce apoptosis by activating mitochondrial signals. Hypoxia may also activate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is counteracted by unfolded protein response such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activation. Since HK II inhibitor may as well activate pro-apoptotic JNK, and ER stress can also lead to JNK activation,we hypothesized that PDI inhibition may potentiate HK II inhibitor-induced JNK activation and apoptosis by increasing ER stress in hypoxic HCC cells. Methods: Huh-7 cells were used in this study. Cells were treated with bacitracin,a PDI inhibitor, and/or 3-bromopyruvate(3-BP),a HK II inhibitor. Cellular apoptosis was analyzed by MPT assay, and apoptotic and kinase signaling pathways were explored by immunoblot analysis. Results: The expression of PDI was increased in HCC cells cultured in hypoxia as compared to normoxic cells. Bacitracin treatment alone did not induce HCC cell death. While 3-BP treatment alone did not induce ER stress in hypoxic HCC cells, 3-BP treatment was able to induce ER stress in the presence of bacitracin. Accordingly, a strong 3-BP-induced JNK activation was observed Aim: Prognosis of advanced cholangiocellular carcinoma is extremely poor. We reported the effectiveness of Combination Therapy of 5-Fluorouracil and Interferon-Alpha for Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (S Obi et al. Cancer 2006). This study aimed for pilot study of combination therapy of 5-fluorouracil and interferon for advanced cholangiocellular carcinoma. Method: Fifteen patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma received peginterferon (90 ng, subcutaneous injection on weekly) and 5-Fluorouracil (500 mg into hepatic artery on Days 1-5 of the first and second week of each 4-week cycle). The therapy was either terminated at the end of the first cycle in cases with progressive disease, or continued when responses to treatment were evaluated by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group criteria. Result: Four (27%) patients showed partial response (PR) and complete remission (CR) was not observed. Two patients (23%) showed stable disease (SD). The median survival time was 9.0 months. Adverse events were limited to thrombocytopenia (2 patients), leucopenia (2 patient) Conclusion: The combination therapy with 5-Fluorouracil and Interferon was safe, and improved the survival rate among the responders.",

Hsp27 is involved in radioprotective responses of tumor cells, while machinery of such Hsp27-involving radioprotection is not quite unraveled. The present study was aimed at elucidation of a role of Hsp27 phosphorylation in the phenomenon of irradiation-responsive Akt activation (phosphorylation) that contributes to the hepatocarcinoma cell radioresistance. Methods: Human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2 and HCCLM3 lines) were exposed to gamma-radiation at clinically relevant doses (3-6 Gy). The site-specific phosphorylation of Hsp27 and Akt or Hsp27-Akt interaction was determined by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation (IP), respectively. The post-irradiation cell death and survival were assessed in TUNEL or annexin V-staining and clonogenic assays. Transient transfection with dominant negative or constitutively activated Akt was used to manipulate the Akt activity in the cells. Results: It was found that human hepatocarcinoma cells, constitutively expressing high Hsp27 levels, respond to gamma-radiation exposure by Hsp27 phosphorylation and subsequent Akt phosphorylation (activation); later, some cell fractions entered apoptosis. Down-regulation of Hsp27 with RNAi as well as inhibition of the Hsp27 phosphorylation with SB203580 or dominant-negative MAPKAP kinase-2 suppressed the Akt activation and enhanced apoptosis. Effects of (co-)transfection with mutant Hsp27 and/or Akt also suggest implication of the Hsp27 phosphorylation in catalyzing the radioprotective Akt activation in the irradiated tumor cells. IP from the cell lysates revealed Hsp27-,Akt-containing complexes which dissociate when Hsp27 is phosphorylated following irradiation. Conclusion: These findings characterize the Hsp27 phosphorylation as an important event in the radioprotective response of hepatocarcinoma cells. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of the Hsp27 phosphorylation in human hepatocarcinomas may sensitize them to radiotherapy.",

Patients and methods: Predictive factors of tumor recurrence were tested by multivariate analysis by Cox model from 35 preoperative variables in 373 patients transplanted for HCC (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) in 14 centers [training cohort (TC)]. A prognostic score was derived from this analysis by linear transformation of b coefficients. The score was tested in a validation cohort (RVC) of 175pt and in a validation cohort (ABM VC) of 478pt, prospectively followed. Results: In the TC, the probability of tumor recurrence at 5 years according to AFP were 20.7% (\\100 ng/ml), 32.2% (100-1,000 ng/ml) and 53.8% ([1,000 ng/ml) (p \\ 0.001). Three independent predictors of recurrence were identified: the diameter of the largest nodule (p \\ 0.0001): score: \\3 cm = 0, 3-5 cm = 1, [5 cm = 5, the AFP level (p = 0.01) score \\100 ng/ml = 0, 100-1,000 = 2, [1,000 = 3, and the number of nodules (p = 0.05) score: B3 = 0, or C 4 = 2. Two prognostic groups were identified in the TC according to the score B2 or C3. The prognostic model was validated in the two validation cohorts. In patients with a score B2, the incidence of recurrence and overall survival at 5 year were similar whether patients comply or not the Milan criteria. In the ABM VC cohort 59 patients were outside Milan with a 5-year probability of recurrence of 10.1 \u00b1 4.3% and overall survival of 74.4 \u00b1 5.7%. Conclusion: AFP level is highly predictive of HCC recurrence. A prognostic score with AFP identifies among patients outside Milan, those with low risk of recurrence. A score B2 could be proposed to rationally select patients. Background: Primary non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) of liver is a very rare malignancy. Surgical resection and chemotherapy are the effective treatment, especially using chemotherapy before surgical resection is more efficacious. Ultrasound-guided or CT-guided biopsy is the most important diagnostic method of primary NHL of liver. We aimed to investigate the different clinical and pathological features of primary NHL of the liver between B and T cell original in needle biopsy of liver. Methods: Here, we report three case of Primary NHL of liver. Etiological factors, clinical character, and histological features of three cases of NHL were retrospectively analyzed. Then the difference between B and T cell original were discussed in combination with immunohistochemical stain. Results: Three cases were all male. But all of them were no HBV/HCV infection in serum. With microscopic examination, the tumorous lymphocytes' destructive action was clearly visible. The tumorous lymphocytes infiltrated in portal area predominantly were B cell original, and infiltrated in sinus hepaticus were T cell original. The B cell original NHL were all expressed CD20. Conclusion: The histological features combined with immunophenotype are enough to diagnose, and differentiate between B and T cell original NHL. That was very important for the selection of chemotherapeutical program before surgical operation. (1) MP showed inhibitory effects on the proliferation of both two kinds of cells, which were related with the concentration of MP. (2) MP showed inhibitory effect on the expression of HBV DNA in HepG2.2.5 cells.(3) MP showed induction of cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which was more obvious in the HepG2.2.5 cells than HepG2 cells, and the difference was statistically significant. (4) Treated by different concentrations of MP, expression of integrin a5b1 in HepG2.2.15 cells was significantly higher than that of HepG2 cells, and the expression rate increased as the concentration of MP increased. (5) MP reduced the expression of cyclin A, and expression of cyclinA decreased as the concentration of MP increased. Conclusions: MP showed inhibitory effects on proliferation of hepatoma cells and replication of HBV, in which expression of integrin a5b1 and cyclinA played an important role.",

The aim of this study is to report the outcome after liver transplantation for HBV at NZLTU following adoption of new prophylaxis regimens. Method: Medical records of all HBV OLT recipients registered with NZLTU from 1998 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Data was collected on demographic, Indication for OLT, Hepatitis B prophylaxis regimen, HBV recurrence, and Survival. Results: 86 patients were included in this study. Mean age was 53 years and duration of follow up 5.5 years. Thirty-three were Maori, 20 Pacific Islanders, 19 Asian, 11 European. Over the study period, the indication for listing has changed from decompensated cirrhosis (80-14%) to HCC (10-71%). Forty-eight received HBIG-LAM and 36 received LAM-ADV. Of those on HBIG-LAM, 26/48 were switched to LAM-ADV, 3 were switched to LAM-Tenofovir. Six patients became HBsAg positive, of whom four also became HBV DNA positive. The remaining two patients remained HBV DNA negative but had recurrent HCC, suggesting HBs gene integration in tumour. Five year cumulative HBV recurrence rate was 4.4%. 10 patients died (8 recurrent HCC). Post-transplant survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 96, 89 and 84%, similar to non-HBV patients. Pretransplant HCC was associated with reduced survival (see Fig. 1 ). Conclusions: Liver transplantation for HBV is now associated with very low HBV recurrence and excellent long-term outcomes. However, recurrent HCC remains an important problem. (3.38 \u00b1 1.00) g/L; PLT: (10 8 \u00b1 60) 9 10 9 /L vs. (184 \u00b1 108) 9 10 9 /L, all P \\ 0.01]. In the first week after operation, elevated PT, APTT, TT and INR levels decreased gradually, APTT was even lower than the preoperative level [(32.05 \u00b1 6.50) s vs. (40.19 \u00b1 4.11) s, P \\ 0.01]. These changes appeared usually on 1-2 days after operation. Decreased PLT and Fib regained slowly at the first week after operation when compared with the preoperative levels [Fib: (2. 13 \u00b1 0.53) g/L vs. (3.38 \u00b1 1.00) g/L, P \\ 0.01; PLT: (145 \u00b1 90) 9 10 9 /L vs. (184 \u00b1 108) 9 10 9 /L, P \\ 0.05], but the values were normal. Stratification analysis indicated more obvious hypocoagulability in patients with moderate/severe cirrhosis and those with Child-Pugh B level than in their counterparts. Conclusion: LALC's coagulation functions shift from hypocoagulatory to hypercoagulatory or normal during perioperative period. Prevention of bleeding should be focused on at anhepatic phase and on 1-2 days after operation while prevention of thrombosis should be focused on after the first week of operation. The degree of liver cirrhosis and Child-Pugh level could help evaluate postoperative coagulation disorder.",

Now we would like to explore the role of it after liver transplantation. Methods: This study contains 77 patients that received LT from February to October 2009. They are divided into AR (acute rejection) and NAR (non-acute rejection) group while 56 healthy people being the control group. Blood specimen were collected preoperatively, 1, 2 and 4 week postoperatively. Results: ATP values within CD4+ T lymphocyte were elevated significantly in each group compared with those preoperatively. It reach the peak level in AR group and was apparently higher than those of the contemporary NAR group (P \\ 0.05). By ROC curve analysis, the obvious elevation of the ATP value within CD4+ T lymphocyte 1 week postoperatively has better sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing the AR. The ATP sensitivity rate for early AR was 76.9% and specificity rate 81%. 1 week after LT. The ATP value within CD4+ T lymphocyte at the day of AR has positive relationship with the rejection acting index (RAI), with the relative index(r) being 0.876 (P \\ 0.05). After the steroid dump treatment, all the ARs were reversed; and the ATP value declined significantly compared with that of the control group and of the day when AR occurred (P \\ 0.05). Conclusions: During the postoperative period, the dynamic change of ATP value within CD4+ T lymphocyte had close relationship with acute rejection after liver transplantation. So it might be used as a feasible and noninvasive monitoring item in diagnosing the AR and the effectiveness of the anti-rejection treatment.",

This event has previously been ascribed to amplified phosphate utilization of hepatic regeneration. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between postoperative hypophosphatemia and both donor morbidity and the degree of hepatic resection. Methods: The cases of 112 living liver donors were retrospectively evaluated, who had undergone right (n = 106) and left (n = 6) hemihepatectomy from March 2006 to December 2008 at liver transplantation center of the West China Hospital. We categorized the living donors according to severity of hypophosphatemia as follows: mild (1.5 to 2.5 mg/dL), moderate (1.1 to 1.5 mg/dL), and severe (\\1.0 mg/dL). We compared the incidence of complications in these groups and analyzed the possible correlation between the serum phosphorus levels and the variables of hepatic regeneration. Results: 110 of all cases (98.2%) developed hypophosphatemia postoperatively, including mild (n = 60), moderate (n = 28) and severe (n = 22). Postoperative phosphate began to fall on POD2, typically reaching a nadir (1.88 \u00b1 0.71 mg/dL) on POD3, and returned to the normal range on POD5. The incidence of complications was no found significant difference among three hypophosphatemia groups (P = 0.931). The nadir phosphorus level was no correlated with the follows variables, including the remnant liver volume (P = 0.478), the ratio of graft weight to donor body weight (P = 0.263), the postoperative increase of ALP (P = 0.460) and the serum nadir uric acid level (P = 0.657). However, the phosphorus decrease positively correlated with the uric acid decrease between POD1 and POD3 (R = 0.317, P = 0.038), but the increases of two variables were not significantly correlated each other between POD3 and POD7 (P = 0.895).Conclusion: Hypophosphatemia after hepatectomy was a frequent occurrence in healthy living donors. However, the phenomenon was transient and selflimited with hepatic function recovery, and unlikely to induce serious postoperative outcome. Furthermore, we presumed that the minor plasma phosphorus possibly influxes into hepatocytes so as to sustain salvage nucleotide synthesis after partial hepatectomy, but the event is no responsible for hepatic regeneration.",

            "text": "Ductular Reaction in Hepatitis C Recurrence Post Liver Transplantation Emilia Prakoso 1,2 , James Kench 2 , Andrew Clouston 3 , David Bowen 1,2 , Geoffrey McCaughan 1,2 , Nicholas Shackel 1,2 1 Centenary Institute Sydney, NSW -Australia, 2 Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Sydney, NSW -Australia, 3 Envoi Pathology Brisbane, Queensland -Australia Background: Ductular reaction (DR) is a reaction of ductular phenotype associated with liver injury and fibrosis. The appearance of DR in the setting of hepatocellular/cholangiocyte injury suggests there are regenerating hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs). In HCV recurrence post-liver transplantation (LTx), the pathogenesis of progressive fibrosis is unclear and the role of DR in this setting is unknown. We aimed to characterise DR, HPC, replicative arrest and intrahepatic proliferation in patients with HCV recurrence post-LTx and to correlate these changes with liver fibrosis and steatosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed on liver biopsies with HCV recurrence post-LTx. Donor livers (n = 15) served as controls. DR (ck7) and a-SMA (activated stellate cells and myofibroblasts) were quantified by image analysis. HPC was calculated by counting isolated ck7-positive cells periportally. Hepatocellular proliferation (Ki-67) and replicative arrest (p21) were assessed by counting positive hepatocyte nuclei. Fibrosis was staged (F0-4) according to Scheuer. Results: There were 105 patients with 194 liver biopsies. DR, HPC, a-SMA, replicative arrest, proliferative index and replicative arrest ratio were higher in HCV recurrence patients vs control donors (P B 0.020). There was significant positive correlation between DR and HPC (r s = 0.629, P \\ 0.001). There were also significant positive correlations (P \\ 0.001) between DR and HPC with a-SMA, fibrosis, portal and total Scheuer's scores. DR also positively correlated to proliferative index (P \\ 0.001). Steatosis (P = 0.018) and lobular score (P = 0.003) only correlated to HPC, but not DR plateau and HPC peaked at F3. Conclusions: The DR and HPC responses correlate with the extent of fibrosis in early stage liver injury. The lack of correlations in the latter stages of injury is probably related to the diminished liver regeneration in advanced fibrosis. Further studies are warranted to investigate the role of the DR in liver injury and regenerative responses in HCV recurrence post-LTx. Background: Survival of the partial graft after living donor liver transplantation owes much to its tremendous regenerative ability. With excellent venous outflow capacity, a graft within a wide range of graft-to-standard-liver-volume ratio can cope with portal hypertension that is common in liver transplant recipients. Methods: However, when the ratio range is exceeded, modulation of graft vascular inflow becomes necessary for graft survival. The interplay between graft-to-standard-liver-volume ratio and portal pressure, in the presence of portosystemic shunt or otherwise, requires individualized modulation of graft portal and arterial inflows. Portal inflow boosting by shunt ligation can be guided by transonic flowmetry, whereas portal inflow muting by splenic artery ligation can be monitored by portal electronic manometry. Results: Here we describe four cases to illustrate this. One patient had hepatic artery thrombosis resulted from splenic artery steal syndrome which was the sequela of small-for-size syndrome. Emergency splenic artery ligation and reanastomosis of the hepatic artery successfully muted the portal inflow and boosted the hepatic arterial inflow. Another patient with portal vein thrombosis underwent thrombendvenectomy. Portal inflow was boosted with ligation of portosytemic shunt, which is often present in these patients with portal hypertension. The coexistence of splenic aneurysm and splenorenal shunt required ligation of both in the third patient. The fourth patient, with portal pressure and flow monitoring, avoided ligation of a coronary vein which became a main portal inflow after portal thrombendvenectomy. Conclusion: A management scheme of graft inflow modulation guided selectively by transonic flowmetry or portal manometry was formulated. Aim: To retrospectively investigate the experience of microsurgical hepatic artery reconstruction and management of hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT) in adult-to-adult liver transplantation (ALDLT). Methods: From 1/2001 to 9/2009, 182 recipients, 10 of which received dual grafts, with end-stage liver disease underwent ALDLT. Mean age was 42 years (range 18-68 years), male-to-female ratio was 157:25. Microsurgical techniques and running sutures with back-wall first techniques were performed in all arterial reconstructions under surgical lope (3.59). Direct end-to-end anastomosis was applied between the recipient hepatic arteries (HA), including 62 right HAs, 20 left HAs, 90 proper HAs, 11 common HAs, and 2 aberrant right HAs arising from superior mesenteric artery, and the graft HAs. Intimal dissections were handled by interposition of great saphenous vein (GSV) between donor right HA and recipient common HA (3 cases) or abdominal aorta (AA) (2 cases), by interposition of cryopreserved iliac vessels between donor right HA and recipient AA (2 cases). Results: In incipient 48 patients of this series, HAT was encountered in 4 patients, and thereafter did not occur in consecutive 124 cases. Overall incidence of HAT was 2.20%. All HATs were suspected by color Doppler ultrasonography and confirmed by hepatic angiography. Two of these HATs, which occurred on 1st and 7th days following ALDLT, were immediately revascularized with GSV between graft and recipient AA, one of these HATs occurred on 46th days after ALDLT with no symptom, remain one of these HATs, which occurred on 3rd days following ALDLT, was cured by thrombolytic therapy combine with anticoagulant, and died of multiorgan failure on 36th days after ALDLT. No death related to HAT. Conclusion: Applying microsurgical techniques and running suture with backwall first technique for HA reconstruction can reduce the high risk of HAT following ALDLT. Background: The CMV pp65 antigenemia assay has been widely used to assess viral load of CMV infections in transplant patients and is often considered as a golden standard. The Quantitative real-time PCR for CMV DNA provides sensitive and specific data for detecting CMV as well as monitoring the infection. However, each laboratory uses its own standard threshold. In this study, we have described the real-time PCR and compared it with CMV pp65antigenemia assay in Chinese haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and solid organ transplant (SOT) patients. Methods: 73 patients, 56 men and 17 women who underwent HSC transplantation and 181 recipients, 128 men and 53 women who underwent SOT were included in this study. Blood specimens were collected and used for detecting the CMV-DNA loading in plasma and the CMV pp65 expression in leukocytes, respectively. Eight healthy men distributed to the control group. Results: CMV DNA positive in HSC transplant recipients and in SOT recipients was 52.1% (0-8.14 9 10 6 copies/ml), 57.9% (0-6.08 9 10 6 copies/ml), respectively. The positive antigenemia in HSC transplant recipients and in SOT recipients was 49.3% (positive cell number 1-30 per 5 9 10 4 WBC), 53.9% (positive cell number 1-37 per 5 9 10 4 WBC), respectively. The positive rate by both assays was 43.8% (32/73) and 45.9% (83/181), respectively. The negative rate in both assays was 41.1% (30/73) and 40.3% (73/181), respectively. The coincidence was 86.5 % in post-HSC transplant patients and 87.5% in SOT transplant patients. X 2 = 0.12, P [ 0.05. Conclusion: The real-time PCR assay was able to detect CMV reactivation in HSC transplant patients and SOT patients as well as pp65 antigenemia assay. Background: The reported recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the Milan criteria after liver transplantation is very low, and the prognosis is extremely favorable. We experienced two rare recurrences of HCC within the Milan criteria. We report these cases with a consideration of the literature. Case 1: A 47-year-old man had three HCCs each about 2.5 cm in diameter. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was one moderately differentiated HCC and a multicentric outbreak of suspected multiple well-differentiated HCC 3-4 mm in diameter. It recurred as a stalked polyp in the hypopharynx 22 months postoperatively. A polypectomy was performed, but 2 years after that procedure, it metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. A cervical lymph node resection was performed, and he was alive without further recurrence 12 months postoperatively. Case 2: A 61-year-old woman had a one 4.0-cm-diameter HCC. All tumor makers were negative including CEA, CA19-9, PIVKA-2 and AFP. The HCC was hypovascular on dynamic computed tomography (CT) and positive on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/ CT; SUV 5.66). The postoperative pathological diagnosis was undifferentiated HCC accompanied by sarcomatoid alteration. It recurred in the retroperitoneum, mesenteric lymph nodes, and lumbar spine in early postoperative period. Conclusion: In follow of the patient, we have to be careful for not only the graft, lung, and bone, but also the head and cervical region via the portalvertebral venous system. Some transplantation centers reported that in addition to tumor size and number, tumor differentiation and pathological vascular invasion may contribute to a recurrence. But these factors are not clear preoperatively. If atypical HCC is recognized that is hypovascular, strongly positive on FDG-PET, and negative for tumor markers, it may be necessary to exclude in from transplantation within the Milan criteria. Results: Ten types of complications were diagnosed out. The incidence of 7 out of 10 complications was 60.2-100% within the first 3 months after OLT. According to the diagnostic frequency, 10 complications were divided into 3 stages. Stage I (early stage:\\1 month): Mainly seen as small-for-size liver syndrome, ischemia reperfusion injury, acute cellular rejection and borderline rejection, the incidences accounting for total frequency of each lesion in this stage was 100, 97.2, 64.7 and 60.2%, respectively. Stage II (middle stage: 1-3 month): Mainly seen as vascular complications, cytomegalovirus infection and drug-induced liver injury, the incidences accounting for total frequency of each lesion in this stage was 64, 62.5 and 60.6%, respectively. Stage III (late stage: [3 month): Mainly seen as chronic rejection, primary liver disease recurrence and bile duct complications, the incidences accounting for total frequency of each lesion in this stage was 100, 91.3 and 68.5%, respectively. Percent 59.5 of central perivenulitis (CP) type ACR and 82.1% of late ACR (LACR, over 6 months after OLT) had more than twice ACR attacks, which were significantly higher than that of portal triad (PT) type ACR (30.6%, P B 0.001). Conclusion: The first 3 months after OLT is a high-incidence period of complication occurrence. CP type ACR is predisposed to repeated attack. Frequent attacks of ACR, or the first attack of ACR is CP pattern, might be two high-risk factors for LACR. The present staging provides a useful reference for determining the scope of diagnosis and differential diagnosis of OLT complications.",

However, it is controversial whether Kupffer cell promotes or protects from liver injury. To explore this issue, we examined the role of Kupffer cell in liver injury, cell death, regeneration, and fibrosis on cholestatic liver injury. Methods: A model of partial bile duct ligation (PBDL) was developed. The left hepatic duct of wild-type C57BL/6 male mice was ligated with 6-0 silk, and the animals were sacrificed 10 days after the surgery. Liver injury, regeneration, and fibrosis were compared between the ligated left and non-ligated right lobes. Hepatocyte apoptosis was induced by administration of D-galactosamine and TNF-alpha to the PBDL mice. The effects of Kupffer cell depletion by alendronate liposomes, or inhibition of AKT by adenovirus expressing dominant-negative AKT were investigated. Results: In the cholestatic liver injury, remaining viable cells represented tolerance for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and regenerative features along with AKT activation. Inhibition of AKT abolished the survival and regenerative properties in hepatocytes. Moreover, Kupffer cell depletion increased hepatocyte damage and the sensitivity of TNF-alpha-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in ligated lobes. Kupffer cell depletion decreased hepatocyte regeneration and liver fibrosis with reduced AKT activation. Conclusion: Kupffer cell has a protective role for hepatocyte damage, and promotes cell survival, liver regeneration, and fibrosis in cholestatic liver disease. Kupffer cell is crucial for AKT activation of hepatocytes that is required for the survival and regenerative responses. Background/Aims: The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is rising due to alcohol drinking, hepatitis C viral infection, and metabolic syndrome. Differential expression of CYP2E1 may play a pleiotropic role in the multistep process of liver carcinogenesis. The antitumor effect of trichostatin (TSA) as well as the apoptotic effect of CYP2E1 has received a lot of attention. However, very little is known regarding the effect of TSA on CYP2E1 gene regulation and the mechanism by which TSA induces apoptosis. The current study examines the mechanism by which TSA regulates the expression of CYP2E1 and the role of CYP2E1 in TSA-mediated apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Methods: HCC cells and normal primary human hepatocytes were treated with TSA (10 lM). Using real-time PCR, ChIP assay, siRNA and confocal microscopy, we studied the effect of TSA on CYP2E1 expression and the function of CYP2E1 in TSA-induced apoptosis of HepG2 cells.Background: Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a kind of single-chain polypeptide consisting of 53 amino acid which widely exist in the tissues and extracellular fluid of body. Studies have found that EGF +61 polymorphism in 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR) play an important role on liver including promoting the synthesis of DNA in liver, stimulating the regeneration of liver cell and protecting the liver. Now we study the EGF +61 polymorphism in cirrhosis patients and healthy people to explore the relationship between EGF +61 polymorphism and the occurrence as well as progression of cirrhosis in Chinese patients. will be withdrawn. Since NTBC withdrawn will induce liver inflammation, the role of hepatic lymphocytes in the damage is studied. Methods: We examined the progressive changes in body weight, survival rate, hepatocytes and liver inflammation when the protective drug is withdrawn. Results: After removing of NTBC, we found that the body weight of Fahdeficient mice reduced gradually and almost all the mice died finally when the body weight largely reduced (low to 70%). The survival rate of the NTBCwithdrawn mice was only 10% compared to 100% of the NTBC-protected mice. At the same time, the liver in the drug-withdrawn mice became smaller and the serum level of ALT was increased week after week. Interestingly, the frequency of T cells in the liver of NTBC-withdrawn mice increased gradually while the frequency of NK cells decreased. Furthermore, histological examination showed that the lymphocyte infiltration in the liver was more and more serious with the extension of the time after NTBC withdrawn. Conclusion: These results indicated that the inappropriate liver T cell response may be responsible for the death of NTBC-withdrawn Fah -/mice. Objective: To explore the biological effects of human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene expression on CCl4 injured human hepatocyte and rat hepatic stellate cell line and its protective effect of HGF to CCl4 injured human hepatocyte line (HL-7702), and also the effect of HGF to CCl4 injured rat hepatic stellate cell line (CFSC-2G cells) apoptosis, further explore the mechanism of apoptosis produced. Methods: The proliferative activity of cells was determined by MTT method, the expression of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were determined by Western Blot method. Results: The normal human liver cells (HL-7702) transfected with PCI-neo-HGF and cultured for 48 h, the cell proliferation activity was significantly higher than the PCI-neo, liposome and non-transfected HL-7702 cells (P \\ 0.01), and cell proliferation activity had increase trend with the increase of transfected dose of PCI-neo-HGF, but there did not have significant difference between different dose groups. The expression of caspase-3 protein decreased significantly in PCI-neo-HGF-transfected HL-7702 cells compared with CCl4 injured HL-7702 cells and PCI-neo-transfected HL-7702 cells. The expressions of caspase-8 and caspase-9 protein did not be detected in PCI-neo-HGF-transfected HL-7702 cells. The expression of caspase-3 protein increased in PCI-neo-HGF-transfected CFSC-2G cell compared with CCl4-induced CFSC-2G cell, and the expression of caspase-9 protein was also positive. Conclusion: The expression of PCI-neo-HGF gene can promote the growth and proliferation of HL-7702 in vitro, and inhibit the apoptosis of CCl4 injured HL-7702, and promote the apoptosis of rat CFSC-2G cell, the possible mechanism of promoting apoptosis in rat CFSC-2G cell may be due to the increase the expression of caspase-3 and -9 protein. (20, 40, 80, 160, 200 ng/ml) in the serum-free medium for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured by Brdu incorporation analysis, un-treated WB-F344 cells were taken as control. After treatment with Wnt3a (160 ng/ml) for 24 h, the subcellular localization and protein expression of b-catenin in Wnt3a treated and untreated WB-F344 cells were examined by Immunofluorescence Staining and Objective: The hepatocyte-like cells induced from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) recover liver function in animal and human with liver failure. Our initial findings revealed that human BMSCs improved liver function in hepatitis B patients with end stage liver disease. However, the susceptibility of BMSCs to HBV infection during induction toward hepatocytes remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the susceptibility of BMSCs to HBV infection during induction toward hepatocyte and the role of asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) in HBV infection. Methods: BMSC obtained from hepatitis B patients were cultured with HBV infectious serum in vitro and induced to differentiate into hepatocyte through exposure to HGF, FGF-4, and EGF. Subsequently these cells were assayed for the presence of HBeAg, HBsAg, HBV DNA and ASGPR. Results: After 6 days of exposure, BMSC-derived hepatocyte-like cells showed hepatic special genes and proteins, that were AFP, CK18, ALB and got hepatocyte functions. The BMSC was resistant to HBV infection in HBV patients and during induced to hepatocyte in vitro. ASGPR was low expressed in BMSC, but increased on the induced BMSC. Conclusion: BMSC proved resistant to HBV infection, both in vivo and during differentiation into hepatocytes in vitro. The expression of ASGPR increased during BMSC was induced to hepatocytes. ASGPR may play an important role in HBV infection. Background; Engelbreth-Swarm (EHS) gel has been reported to maintain the mature hepatocyte phenotypes in primary cultured hepatocytes. We investigated the effects of EHS gel on the differentiation of fetal liver cells, which contain stem/progenitor cells. Methods; Fetal liver cells were isolated from embryonic day 14.5 livers of mice. After deletion of hematopoietic cells, the cells were plated on either normal plastic, EHS gel coated, or type 1 collagen coated dishes and cultured for 4 days in appropreate medium. Expression of albumin and CK19 were examined by double immunofluorescent staining. Liver specific protein and mRNA expression in the cultured fetal liver cells were examined by Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Then we transplanted the fetal liver cells with or without EHS gel to BALB/c nude mice subcutaneously to investigate cell survival and functions in vivo. Result: The isolated fetal liver cells cultured on EHS gel formed a spherical shape and increased liver-specific gene expressions compared with cells cultured on normal or collagen coated dishes. The hepatic progenitor cells that were transplanted subcutanoeusly to BALB/c nude mice could survive and express hepatocyte marker alpha-hetoprotein when the cells were transplanted with EHS gel. Conclusion; These findings demonstrate that EHS gel supports cytodifferentiation from immature progenitor cells to mature hepatocytes and maintain its differentiated phenotypes in vitro and in vivo. Background: Stem cells located in bone marrow (BM) have been shown to mobilize and migrate to the liver in response to injury and thereby contributing to liver regeneration. In this study, we investigated the resident stem cell population in adult human liver and their mobilization during liver transplantation. Methods: Liver tissue samples and perfused graft preservation fluids were collected for stem cell isolation at the time of liver transplantation. Phenotypic and functional characterization was extensively investigated in vitro, in NOD/SCID mice and in transplant patients. Results: Culturing of perfusates and liver biopsies, resulted in the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Liver-derived MSC were equivalent to BM MSC in adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation and Wnt-stimulated proliferative responses. Moreover, the genome-wide gene expression was highly similar, with a two or more-fold difference found in only 82 of the 32,321 genes (0.25%). Liver MSC differentiation into hepatocyte-lineage was demonstrated in vitro, by acquiring the ability to support HCV infection. After engraftment in mice, a majority of MSC survived and maintained stem cell characteristics, indicating selfrenewal, and a subpopulation differentiated into hepato-like cells. Like BM MSC, liver MSC were found to be immunosuppressive shown by significant inhibition of T cell proliferation. Meanwhile, we found the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) during graft perfusion, which were characterized by surface marker expression and colony forming capacity in vitro and after engraftment in mice. After liver transplantation, donor HSC continue to migrate from the graft and were detectable in recipient circulation, with approx. 2-8% of peripheral blood CD34 + cells being of donor origin. Conclusions: Adult human liver contains resident population of MSC and HSC. Graft cold-storage associated with hypoxia results in mobilization of hepatic MSC and HSC, suggesting responsiveness to tissue injury. Their continuous migration after transplantation may contribute to hematopoietic chimerism and organ tolerance in patients.",

            "text": "Background: MSCs are characterized by self-renewal and multi-directional differentiation. Autogenetic MSCs do not cause immunological rejection and have been clinically used in France, Germany, Japan, Italy and China. We have applied autogenetic MSCs in the treatment of hepatitis B (HB) patients and satisfactory therapeutic effects were achieved. To improve the effectiveness of autoplastic transplantation and investigate the mechanism, biological characteristics of MSCs from HB patients were explored in our previous studies. This study aimed to investigate and compare differentiation of MSCs from HB patients with liver failure into hepatocytes-like cells with different induction systems in vitro. Methods: The differentiation of MSCs from HB patients with liver failure were induced in vitro into hepatocytes-like cells by three culture media [serum-free medium (group 1), auto serum-containing medium (group 2) and medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) (group 3)]. And the cell morphology, cell growth curve, amount of urea and glycogen and mRNA expressions of ALB, CK18 and AFP were detected and compared.Result: Morphological changes in group 1 and 2 were more evident than that in group 3, and cell growth in group 3 was faster than the other two groups. The amount of urea and glycogen in group 1 and 2 was significantly elevated when compared with that in group 3 after 6 days of culture. RT-PCR analysis indicated the mRNA expressions of ALB, CK18 and AFP in group 1 and 2 were markedly increased as compared to that in group 3. Conclusion: The differentiation of MSCs from HB patients with liver failure into hepatocytes-like cells can be induced by three different cell culture media and the inductive effects were more profound in cells grown in the serum-free medium and auto serum-containing medium.Conclusion: Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreatic gland, the evolution of the disease is rapid and the extend of the inflammation reaction is violence, so the level of TNFa increase highly and rapidly notably in the first 24 h of the AP; therefore the dosage of TNFa is very useful and important in the diagnosis and prognosis of AP.",

Methods: Nine cases of pre and post hepatic portal hypertension who presented to Hospital Selayang from 2001 till May 2009 were reviewed. Results: The mean age group at presentation was 29 years of age. Four of the cases were female and five were male. Seven cases presented with upper gastrointestinal bleed due to esophageal varices, one case with ascites and one case with acute liver failure. The chart below summarizes the laboratory results of the cases on presentation. All patients had an ultrasound and a subsequent CT abdomen which revealed a non cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension. The reason for portal hypertension was portal vein thrombosis in six cases, splenic vein thrombosis in one case and Budd Chiari syndrome in two cases. The underlying aetiology for the thrombotic tendencies were protein C and S deficiencies in two cases, previous umbilical catheterization in one case, polycythaemia in one case, chronic pancreatitis in one case with the remaining four cases pending further haematological workout. Conclusion: In young patients who present with complications of portal hypertension with an essentially normal liver imaging and biochemistry, a pre or a post hepatic cause should be considered. The underlying reason for the thrombotic tendencies should be assessed as systemic diseases can present in this manner to the hepatology unit.",

Envelope glycoprotein B(gB) of HCMV plays an important role in HCMV infection and induction of immune response. gBn1 is a major pathogenic genotype,and holds an obvious quantitative advantage in HCMV infected Chinese. Methods: Based on the GenBank sequence (M60929), amino acid sequence of gB antigen peptide was selected and decided. After the peptide gB conjugated Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin immunized New Zealand rabbits (including the initial vaccination and three times of enhanced immunization), serum of rabbits were obtained and purified. ELISA, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical staining were used to identify antibodies and the titer of antibody. Results: Titer of the serum could reach 1:64,000.Through ELISA assay, the serum could specificly link to gB peptide, and it could both interact with HCMV AD169 and Towne strain. Furthermore, the serum could interact with HCMV AD 169 and Towne strain with immunoprecipitation and Immunofluorescence technique. With the serum, some plasma from Chinese could be verified that it infect HCMV in immunocytochemical staining. Conclusions: The synthetical peptide has a favourable immunogenicity. In the future, more research would be dedicated to screening epitope in the synthetical peptide, which could help us to know HCMV, understand neutralizing antibody of HCMV, prepare HCMV vaccine and antivirus drug.",

But owing to its easily bleeding tendency, it is very important to regulate the control of it during hepatic resection. We have done mainly with RFA precoagulation, but there is little fundamental examination. Purpose: We perform a clinicopathological examination of a RFA precoagulation and examine an optimum precoagulation method for LPH. Object and method: LPH enforcement 12 examples in our department concerned. RFA using cool tip TM needle and, for in principle left liver 60 W/ 1 min, performed it for right liver 80 W/1 min. We examined cauterization depth by the pathological examination of the sample, weight, bleeding, postoperative liver function, CRP and postoperative complications including bile leakage. Result: The left liver was cauterized in depth than the right liver, and there were few amounts of bleeding. We did not recognize the sample weight and the cauterization depth and the relevance with the postoperative liver functional impairment and complication. Conclusion: RFA precoagulation is feasible and easy to dissect the hepatic vein and parenchyma. We may simplify the RFA precoagulation of left liver LPH.",

Material/Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, 30 patients (60% female) diagnosed with BCS based on the clinical, biochemical, imaging and histological findings were evaluated retrospectively. Clinical status, etiologic factors, laboratory and imaging findings at the admission and development of complications and survival during the follow-up period were determined. Results: Mean ages of patients were 36 \u00b1 12 years [Median diagnosis period 5 months, mean follow-up time 48 \u00b1 40 months (6-120)]. 7% of patients were diagnosed acute, 40% subacute and 53% chronic BCS according to disease duration. Centrilobular necrosis was found in 9 of 17 (56.7%) biopsy performed patients. Etiologic distribution were as follows: 5 APS, 6 factor V Leiden mutation (3 heterozygote), 5 myeloproliferative disease, 2 IVC stenosis, 1 tumour infiltration, 2 protein C and 1 protein S deficiency, 1 PNH and 1 Behcet disease. There were multiple etiologic factors in 5, where etiologic factors were not detected in 37% of patients. Twelve of them received anticoagulant therapy, whereas 16 were followed-up without treatment. Mesoatrial shunt surgery was performed in four cases; only one patient had Denver shunt operation. Five patients died after mean 14.5 \u00b1 9 months follow-up period. Although, there was a positive correlation between survival and centrilobular necrosis (r = 0.683, P = 0.014), negative correlation was observed between albumin levels and survival (r = -0.0586, P = 0.008). These factors were not effective over survival in Cox regression analysis. The mean survival periods were 94.5 months (%95 CI 63-125 months) and 96.4 months (%95 CI 72-120 months) in anticoagulant treated and untreated patients, respectively (log rank analysis P [ 0.05). Conclusion: Most of patients with BCS apply to hospital in subacute and chronic stage and approximately half of them have underlying thrombotic risk factor. In our study, no beneficial effect of anticoagulant therapy was observed on the survival. Aim: The ''Metroticket'' prognostic model for survival post liver transplant for HCC was developed by (Lancet 2009) from a European cohort of predominantly alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C-related HCC. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of this Metroticket model in an independent cohort of predominantly HBV-related HCC in an Asia-Pacific transplant programme. Methods: All patients listed for HCC at NZLTU between January 1998 and December 2008 were included. For each patient, a Metroticket predicted 3 and 5 year survival score was calculated using the pre-transplant measurements of tumour size and number (http://www.hcc-olt-metroticket.org/calculator/ index.php). The primary outcome was the comparison between observed 3 and 5 year survival with predicted survival calculated by the Metroticket model incorporating pre-transplant radiological measurements of tumour size and number. The secondary outcome was the comparison with predicted survival calculated by the Metroticket model incorporating explant pathological measurements of tumour size and number. Results: 84 patients were listed for HCC-71 were transplanted and 13 delisted for disease progression. Another nine patients had incidental HCC in the explant. On intent to treat analysis, survival after listing was 72% (62-82%) at 3 years and 68% (58-80%) at 5 years. Predicted post-transplant survival calculated by the Metroticket model incorporating pretransplant radiological data (n = 71) was 76% at 3 years and 70% at 5 years. Observed post-transplant survival was 83% (49/59) at 3 years and 74% (35/47) at 5 years. Actuarial 3 and",
