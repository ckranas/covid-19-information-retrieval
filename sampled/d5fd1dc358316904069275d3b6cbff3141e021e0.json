However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-airground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.",

Besides all applications and requirements mentioned above, we can learn from 5G tactile Internet applications [2] that wireless networked control of robotic objects (e.g., automated driving or factory logistics) is a new exciting application for cellular technology, but this also generates new challenges. When analyzing the network traffic generated by these applications, many mobile objects must share sensor as well as control information, which overburdens a centralized control system. Instead, distributed control systems using AI are becoming a focus in research and development. In particular federated learning shows to be a promising approach, where dataset correlation algorithms are distributed over mobile robotic objects and aggregated learning happens over the cloud. Interestingly, this generates a completely new class of network traffic, with large bandwidth and widely varying latency demands. It is highly likely to assume that these and equivalent AI applications will not only overtake but dominate the network traffic demands of 6G. This is untouched soil, which makes it exciting and very challenging at the same time!",

New air interface and transmission technologies are essential to achieve high spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency, including new waveforms, multiple access approaches, channel coding methods, multi-antenna technologies, and proper combination of all these diversity techniques. In the meanwhile, novel network architectures are needed, for example, software defined network/network functions virtualization (SDN/NFV), dynamic network slicing, service-based architecture (SBA), cognitive service architecture (CSA), and cell-free (CF) architectures.",

The use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers versus domain specific chips in a virtualized radio access network (RAN) implies a large increase in energy consumption, countering measures for improving energy efficiency. This results in the current fact that 5G networks consume more power than 4G networks, but of course at a delivery of a higher bandwidth. In contrast, we should deliver networks that at the time of their introduction do not exceed the previous generation's power needs. For 6G we therefore will require a new computing paradigm to support all benefits of softwarization without bearing the costs of energy consumption.",

First of all, 6G wireless communication networks will be space-air-ground-sea integrated networks to provide a complete global coverage. The satellite communication, UAV communication, and maritime communication will largely extend the coverage range of wireless communication networks. To provide a higher data rate, all spectra will be fully explored, including sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz, and optical frequency bands. To enable full applications, AI and ML technologies will be efficiently combined with 6G wireless communication networks to have a better network management and automation. Furthermore, AI technology can enable the dynamic orchestration of networking, caching, and computing resources to improve the performance of next-generation networks. The last but not the least trend is the strong or endogenous network security for both physical layer and network layer when developing it. Industry verticals, such as cloud VR, Internet of things (IoT) industry automation, cellular vehicle to everything (C-V2X), digital twin body area network, and energy efficient wireless network control and federated learning systems will largely boost the developments of 6G wireless communication networks.

One of the main distinguishing features of 5G is low latency or more specifically guaranteed (deterministic) latency, which needs deterministic networking (DetNet) to guarantee end-to-end latency with punctuality and accuracy that future use cases demand. The 6G will have additional requirements of high time and phase synchronization accuracy beyond what 5G can deliver. Additionally, 6G will have to provide near 100% geographical coverage, sub-centimeter geo-location accuracy and millisecond geo-location update rate to meet use cases. As 5G networks are still limited to some typical scenarios, remote areas such as villages and motorways are not well covered, which limits some applications such as driverless vehicles. Non-terrestrial and specifically satellite communication networks are needed to complement the terrestrial networks for cost-effective, seamless, and ubiquitous service availability. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network is important for fast response in harsh and difficult environments. Maritime communication network is needed to provide ships with high quality communication services. While mmWave can provide Gbps level transmission data rate in 5G, Tbps level transmission data rate will be needed for applications such as high quality three-dimensional (3D) video, virtual reality (VR), and mix of VR and augmented reality (AR), where terahertz (THz) and optical frequency bands can be candidate bands. Faced with the big datasets generated by using extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. One automation level is for improving the network performance itself in many aspects, for example, quality of service (QoS), quality of experience (QoE), security, fault management, and energy design and dimension 6G networks to match the upcoming bandwidth, latency, reliability, as well as resilience demands which are set by the applications. While 5G mainly concentrates on eMBB, mMTC, and uRLLC, 6G networks will largely enhance and extend the application scenarios. In [8] , the authors named the enhanced three scenarios as feMBB, umMTC, and enhanced-uRLLC (euRLLC). Several other application scenarios, such as LDHMC, and ELPC, are also promising. In [4] , these three scenarios were named as the ubiquitous mobile ultrabroadband (uMUB), ultra-high-speed with low-latency communications (uHSLLC), and ultra-high data density (uHDD), respectively. In [10] , apart from the three scenarios, the authors also illustrated other applications, including AI, mobile ultra-wideband, and super IoT.",

The key contribution of their study is to demonstrate how the presence of foveated rendering can improve the rendering performance by reducing the field of view.

The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to save 42% of encoding time without degrading the graphic quality. Authors in [22] explored the approach to interpolate the frames by introducing motion estimation.

LTE-V is developed based on the long term evolution (LTE) system and primarily provides key information delivery and exchange for basic road safety. NR-V is based on the 5G NR system and enhanced to support more stringent requirements on latency, reliability and throughput for advanced V2X applications, such as platooning, high-level autonomous driving, extended sensor and remote driving. NR-V aims to achieve 3 ms or lower latency, 99.999% reliability and even 1 Gbps data rate for extended sensor information. Key technologies for NR-V to meet these key performance indicator (KPI) requirements include effective wireless resource scheduling and powerful MEC. Many methods have been proposed to optimize resource scheduling on PC5 interface [31] [32] [33] . The MEC architecture has been defined well by 3GPP V2X applications and the MEC platform (servers) can be deployed either inside of a cellular network, or at the roadside with a connection to the cellular network. The choice will depend on both the business model and related policies. With the help of MEC, C-V2X has the capability to support cooperative perception, cooperative computing, and cooperative decision for autonomous vehicles. The computing task offloading strategies have been investigated extensively for distributed sensor data computing.",

Hence, the only solution foreseeable today is to build domain specific compute engines for 6G which will complement COTS servers and reduce the energy consumption by orders of magnitude. Today we rely on exactly this approach for implementing ML efficiently.

These schemes include the multicarrier system with sub-band filtering and the multi-carrier system with sub-carrier filtering. The former includes universal filtered multi-carrier and filtered OFDM, and the later includes generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC). The selection of the new waveform needs to consider not only the above performance, but also the frame structure design, the flexibility of parameter selection, the complexity of signal processing algorithm and so on. To flexibly support different applications, multi-service OFDM has been studied. In future systems, the new waveform should also support flexible slicing of the network. The band above 52.6 GHz is considered as a potential band of 6G systems. Transmitters (Txs) above 52.6 GHz have higher PAPR requirements, because frequencies above 52.6 GHz are faced with more difficult challenges, such as higher phase noise, extreme propagation loss owing to high atmospheric absorption, lower power amplifier efficiency, and strong power spectral density regulatory requirements, compared to lower frequency bands. Therefore, it is necessary to study the waveform suitable for higher frequency bands. Single-carrier system has been proved to be an effective low PAPR transmission method and has been applied to the IEEE 802.11ad standard. With the increase of bandwidth, the flexibility of single-carrier transmission to use large bandwidth is limited. In [42] , multi-carrier transmission combined with single-carrier frequency-domain equalization was studied. Its basic idea is to use filter banks to realize a carrier aggregation and single-carrier frequency-domain equalization on each carrier to reduce PAPR and receiver (Rx) complexity.",

For the past generations of mobile networks, orthogonal multiple access (OMA) has been used, where orthogonal bandwidth resource blocks are first generated in the time, frequency, or code domains (e.g., time slots, sub-carriers, and spreading codes), and then allocated to users in an orthogonal manner, i.e., one resource block is solely occupied by a single user. The success of OMA in the past-generation mobile networks is mainly due to the fact that it can be implemented in a low complexity way, although it has been known since Shannon's work on multiple access channels that the spectrum efficiency of OMA is sub-optimal [51] . Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a paradigm shift for the design of next-generation multiple access techniques. The key idea of NOMA is to encourage the spectrum sharing among mobile users, where the superior spectral efficiency gain of NOMA over OMA is obtained by opportunistically utilizing the users' dynamic channel conditions or heterogeneous QoS requirements [52] . Take the power-domain NOMA as an example [53] . Multiple users with different channel conditions are served at the same time, frequency, and spreading code. As such, NOMA avoids spectrally inefficient situation in which valuable bandwidth blocks are solely occupied by users whose channel conditions are poor. Sophisticated multiuser detection techniques are used by NOMA to ensure that multi-access interference owing to spectrum sharing is effectively suppressed with reasonable computational complexity.",

In particular, users with low QoS requirements can be grouped with users with demanding QoS requirements for spectrum sharing, which can significantly improve spectral efficiency.

Initial studies have shown that the use of NOMA can support semi-grant-free transmission, which can reduce handshaking signaling compared to grant-based transmission and also avoid the QoS guaranteeing issues compared to random access protocols [66] .",

Turbo codes, as well as low-density parity-check code (LDPC) and polar codes [68] were compared [69] in terms of their error correction capability, flexible code-rate and codeword length reconfiguration, their ability to support hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), their complexity and numerous other considerations [70] . Ultimately, LDPCs were chosen for protecting the eMBB data channels, because they are quite flexible in terms of their code rates, code lengths, and decoding delay, whilst conveniently supporting HARQ [70] . By contrast, polar codes have found favor for the low-delay control channels, as discussed in [70, 71] in the light of a rich set of performance results recorded for diverse codeword length. Further design lessons, performance results, and the extension of polar codes to quantum coding can be found in [72] .",

Historically, the first iterative detection aided channel decoder was Gallager's LDPC decoder [91] , but it was not until the discovery of turbo codes that the full benefits of iterative soft-information exchange between the decoder components became widely acknowledged [92] . In simple conceptual terms, the iterative exchange of soft-information seen at the right of Figure 12 [93] is beneficial, because the decoder components refrain from making a hard-decision until they arrive at a consensus and become sufficiently confident in their decision. More quantitatively, it was shown in [94] that Berrou's turbo code is indeed capable of outperforming a similarcomplexity convolutional decoder by about 2 dB at the BER of 10 \u22124 , provided that a sufficiently long turbo interleaver is used.",

The SCC encoder consists of an outer encoder (Encoder I) and an inner encoder (Encoder II), interconnected by an interleaver. The introduction of the interleaver scrambles the bits before they are passed to the other constituent encoder, which ensures that even if a specific bit has been gravely contaminated by the channel, the chances are that the other constituent decoder is capable of providing more reliable information concerning this bit. This is a practical manifestation of time-diversity. Iterative processing is used in the SCC decoder, and a performance similar to that of a classic PCC may be achieved [95] . In fact, the serial concatenation constitutes quite a general structure and many decoding/detection schemes can be described as serially concatenated structures, such as those used in turbo equalization [87, 94] , coded modulation [88, 89] , turbo multi-user detection [97, 98] , joint source/channel decoding [99] [100] [101] , and LDPC decoding [102] .

In the early days of FEC design, a criterion was that of maximizing the Hamming distance of the legitimate codewords, which was rather closely related to minimizing the BER even for transmission over Gaussian wireline channels. More explicitly, designers wanted to maximize the Hamming distance between all pairs of legitimate codewords. The family of BCH codes satisfied this design criterion [94] . The Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes relied upon the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) algorithm [107] , which does not minimize the BER, but the erroneous sequence estimation probability. However, in 1974, Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) had invented another optimal decoding algorithm for the family of linear codes, which acquired the fond co-notation of the BCJR decoder [108] . Although it was capable of directly minimizing the BER, its performance remained similar to that of MLSE, despite its significantly higher complexity. Hence the BCJR decoder remained dormant until the invention of turbo codes, which required an algorithm that provided bit-by-bit confidence metrics for the decoder. After decades of using diverse code design criteria, a historic breakthrough was discovered by Ten Brink in the form of the powerful analytical tool of extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts [109] [110] [111] [112] , which visualizes the convergence behavior of iterative detection aided turbo-receivers.",

CF massive MIMO has been shown to achieve higher spectral efficiency than centralized massive MIMO and small cell [117] . Our recent prototyping system in largescale distributed MIMO has demonstrated that the data rate of 10 Gbps could be achieved by a 128\u00d7128 large-scale distributed MIMO (or CF massive MIMO) with 100 MHz bandwidth [118] . However, CF massive MIMO is also facing some obstacles such as high implementation complexity, high requirement of backhaul/fronthaul, and difficulty in synchronization and channel state information (CSI) acquisition. At present, researchers have studied the capacity of CF massive MIMO. The results have shown that in the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading channel, when the number of BS goes to infinite, the channels have asymptotic orthogonality. Moreover, when each BS is equipped with an appropriate number of antennas (for example 5-10), CF massive MIMO also has a channel hardening effect [119] .",

Another way is to send an over-the-air synchronization signal between nodes. Like massive MIMO, in CF massive MIMO, time division duplex (TDD) mode is usually assumed to reduce overhead. However, in practice, owing to the non-ideal characteristics of radio frequency (RF), reciprocity calibration is needed.

For example, it is not known under what exact fading distributions the max-min fairness rate will approach zero when the size of the network increases. Also, the computational load grows very unfavorably with the system size. A remedy is to partition the access points (APs) into clusters and associate each user with one or more such serving clusters [121] .

Recently, a decentralized, trustworthy wireless access paradigm enabled by the blockchain technology, namely blockchain radio access network (B-RAN), was proposed with its prototype [137, 138] , as shown in Figure 15 . B-RAN can build trusted physical links between service providers and clients while supporting, e.g., spectral sharing, cooperative transmissions, multi-hop data brokers, D2D communications, etc. [137, 139] .

In principle, B-RAN plays as a multi-sided platform [147] , by leveraging network effects and attracting more participants, to deliver intelligence services to every corner of the network via the integration and coordination of communication, computing, caching, and control units.

First, cryptocurrency blockchains can usually safeguard security but suffer a relatively long latency, also known as the security-latency tradeoff [148] . It still needs more investigations to achieve shorter latency for the delay-sensitive wireless services [149] . Second, current blockchain technologies are facing the scalability problem, which limits the network throughput of blockchain based networks. Studies that analyze and design new blockchain structures may help remove this obstacle [150, 151] . Third, most consensus mechanisms, e.g., proof-of-work, consume a large amount of energy to achieve resistant and robust performance against misbehaviors and are thus unsuitable for mobile devices with limited power and capability [137, 142] . Hence, energy efficient consensus mechanisms are urgently needed in mobile environments.",

As shown in Figure 16 , the BB waveform is first modulated onto an optical carrier at frequency f 0 and sent to the local optical to THz (O/T) converter. The optical signal is then translated to a THz carrier by photo-mixing with a local oscillator (LO) laser tone at a frequency f Tx,LO in an ultra-fast uni-travelingcarrier photodiode (UTC-PD). The THz data signal is radiated into the free space by an antenna. At the Rx, the THz signal is converted to the optical domain by means of an ultra-broadband optical modulator, thus leading to high-density photonic integration without all-electronic down-conversion to the BB or to an intermediate frequency. The THz data signal is received by a horn antenna (HA), amplified by a THz amplifier, and then fed to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) for modulation onto an optical carrier at f Rx,LO . After modulation, the optical signal contains an upper and a lower modulation sideband. An optical bandpass filter (BPF) is used to suppress the carrier and to select one of the modulation sidebands. It is expected that the combination of direct O/T and T/O conversion in ultra-compact devices has the potential to greatly accelerate THz communications and to advance the integration of THz wireless links into fiber-optic infrastructures.",

Another challenge is related to the energy consumption, as the wireless data traffic will soon be the highest consumption of energy per habitant in the world [159] . Such challenges will still require developments of technologies to generate more power at the Tx while increasing the overall system efficiency. The primary technology that could improve both the power at the Tx and the overall efficiency of the system is \"photonic integration\". Photonic integration will naturally reduce coupling losses, such as the loss from fiber to chip and in particular the loss between the laser and the photo mixer [160] . It should also enable the use of multiple antenna systems that would lead to advanced active array antennas to compensate for the path loss and allow for some tracking. However, even with such developments, there is still a clear need for amplification at both the emitter and Rx, thus low-noise and wide-bandwidth THz amplifiers for both Tx and Rx are also at key priority [161] .

According to the 3GPP, the main objective of the uRLLC is to minimize the latency down to 1 ms while ensuring packet error rates of less than 99.999%. As is known, in 4G, reliability is obtained by the HARQ procedure. However, the strict latency constraint in the uRLLC does not endorse multiple retransmissions. Fortunately, researchers in industry and academia have found several new approaches to solve this conflicting problem and proposed some advanced techniques in 5G. In order to increase the probability of successful access, the grant-free technique has been standardized where the user equipment (UE) can initiate a transmission without sending any service request to acquire a dedicated scheduling grant. In addition, the uRLLC can occupy the resources which are already assigned to other types of applications by introducing a preemptive scheduling mode, once it has data to transmit. The other related techniques include mini-slot, control resource set, and packet duplicate [164] .",

Let us take smart factory as an example. Increasing the reliability of communications is one of the most critical and challenging tasks for massive production. Reliability also plays an important role in multi-factory production, because the failure of one entity may induce a vigorous chain reaction to the others. If the end-to-end reliability and latency can reach 99.99999% and 0.1 ms in future 6G, the productivity and products quality are deemed to be improved significantly. On the other hand, some upcoming new applications will blur the boundary between the eMBB and the uRLLC. For example, it is widely accepted that as a full immersive technique, extended reality (XR), will emerge in many commercial services in the future. XR is expected to encompass augmented mixed, and VR technique can capture all the perceptual inputs stemming from human senses, cognition, and physiology [3] . However, current 5G cannot support XR owing to its inability to deliver huge data in a very low latency.

This is because the reliability and latency of a communication system are inherently contradictory with each other. Fortunately, the potential solution can be found in recent information-theoretic achievements in finite packet length regime. In 2010, built upon Dobrushin's and Strassen's previous asymptotic results, Polyanskiy et al. [165] provided a unified approach to obtain tight bounds on R (coding rate), as a function of n (packet length) and P e (packet error probability). The rationale behind this approach is that when n is finite, R becomes a random variable composed of channel capacity and dispersion. Channel dispersion is also a random variable introduced as a rate penalty to characterize the impact of n. On the other hand, the probability that the coding rate is smaller than R gives the packet error probability P e . Because the latency constraint can be illustrated equivalently by packet length n, this finding paves a possible road to enhance the system performance of the uRLLC from an information-theoretic point of view [166] .",

From the recent information-theoretic achievements on finite packet length, we learn that the MCo transmission can be modelled as a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system with short packets and its reliability is highly dependent on the number of antennas. In this case, the design principle of 6G's uRLLC turns into the following mathematical problem. For a given data rate R and packet length n, how many antennas are needed to support the desired reliability P e ? Solving this problem would provide important guidance for designing practical systems, because it would yield minimum implementational cost. In addition, for a given number of antennas, as the variance of information density achieved by a capacity-achieving distribution, the channel dispersion is introduced to show how far the data rate is deviated from the capacity owing to the shortening of packet length. In other words, the key issue to solve this problem is to find out the relationship between the channel dispersion and the antenna number under certain conditions.",

            "text": "Another potential solution to balance the reliability and high data rate with low latency is the distributed antenna system (DAS) technique [168] , which is naturally an extension of the MCo. Basically, DAS is implemented through massive separated RAUs and is especially useful for providing quality coverage of a specific area, such as an industrial plant. Similar to the MCo, DAS sends the data to the same destination through multiple radio links, and moreover it can take advantage of flexible balance between reliability and data rate. The reason behind is that the DAS can be treated as a distributed MIMO [168] . Therefore, a tradeoff can be made between diversity and spatial multiplex by exploring the inherent property of MIMO [169] . Supposing that the spatial degree of freedom (DOF) of the distributed MIMO is dof, a full multiplex gain (i.e., highest data rate) can be obtained if the number of dof independent data streams is transmitted to the destination. Alternatively, a higher reliability will be achieved at a cost of a reduced data rate, provided that a number of d < dof independent data streams are sent at the Tx. As a special case, a maximum reliability but with a minimum data rate will be achieved if all the RAUs send an identical data stream to the same destination, which is the same as the SIMO case. More importantly, this approach can be easily extended to multi-user scenarios with the balanced uRLLC performance.",

The data plane consists of distributed network elements that forward and route the data packets to the SDN controllers according to the instructions made in the controller plane via the southbound interfaces, also called data-controller plane interface (D-CPI). The controller plane is composed of one or a set of logically centralized SDN controllers, which are responsible for translating the applications' requests and exerting more granular control over the network elements. It also provides relevant information up to the applications. Thus, the controller plane plays the role of the bridge between the data plane and application plane. The application plane consists of applications and communicates their requirements towards the controller plane via the northbound interfaces, i.e., application-controller plane interface (A-CPI). The management and administration plane was recently proposed by open networking foundation (ONF) and Internet engineering task force (IETF). This plane is responsible for provisioning and monitoring the networks [170] [171] [172] [173] . The SDN architecture is programmable, agile, and cost effective, making it a key enabler for 5G. SDN can be used to provide an overall framework to enable 5G to function across a control plane and better data flows for data moving across the 5G network. Many advancements of applying SDN in 5G have been made [174] . However, there are also many problems in terms of deployment, reliability, security and so on. First, deploying SDN in existing networks will incur economic, technical, and organizational challenges. SDN deployments will incur considerable cost in the initialized equipment transformation and professional training. 5G networks will inevitably increase the complexity of SDN design and deployment. Second, to guarantee uRLLC in 5G, a fast and expensive out-of-band wide area network between SDN controllers and switches will be needed, which will pose the huge challenges on the reliability of SDN networks. Third, because SDN controllers are logically centralized and run on Windows or Linux operating systems, the risk of being attacked or failures will also increase. Thus, security is also a fundamental challenge [172] .",

SDN aims to separate network control functions from network forwarding functions, while NFV aims to abstract network forwarding and other networking functions from the hardware on which it runs. SDN abstracts physical networking resources, like switches, routers and so on, and moves decision making to a virtual network control plane which will decide the traffic forwarding. In this approach, the hardware continues to direct and handle the traffic. While NFV aims to virtualize all physical network resources beneath a hypervisor, it allows the network to grow without the addition of more devices. For example, when SDN executes on an NFV infrastructure, SDN forwards data packets from one network device to another. The SDN's networking control functions for routing, policy definition and applications run in a virtual machine defined by the NFV. Thus, NFV provides basic networking functions, while SDN controls and orchestrates them for specific uses [177] . In conclusion, NFV is closely related to SDN. They are highly complementary to each other, but not dependent on each other. They can be mutually beneficial and accrue greater value.

Each service instance represents a service provided by the network operator or third party. The network slice instance provides the service instance with the required network characteristics, i.e., a service instance is realized by a network slice. A network slice instance may be fully or partly, logically and/or physically, isolated from another network slice instance.

Isolation is the most important property of network slicing, meanwhile, it is also the main challenge for its realization. To guarantee the service quality of each slice, different areas of isolation should be realized, including traffic, bandwidth, processing, and storage. In this case, the main challenge is the orchestration and control that need to be implemented to harmonize the different isolation techniques in different domains, while there is still not a holistic and final standardized network slice architecture for this. Besides, the isolation techniques significantly rely on the SDN and NFV technologies, which are not yet mature. (ii) Dynamic slice creation and management. To accommodate different services and meet diverse requirements, the efficient dynamic slice creation and deletion is necessary. However, it is challenging to create or delete slices because it has to guarantee that these operations have no effect on the currently running slices, which involves the isolation and security issues. Besides, the network slices should be able to scale dynamically with the varying load. Thus, efficient sharing is needed, which will also cause some issues like isolation and security. In this context, the lifecycle management of network slices is a critical problem to be solved [180, 184] .",

The access and mobility management function (AMF) hosts all mobility management related functionality and terminates the non-access stratum (NAS) and N2 reference point messages. NAS messages are sent between the UE and the AMF for mobility management, and between the UE and session management function (SMF) for session management. The policy control function (PCF) provides a policy framework incorporating network slicing, roaming, mobility management, and the SMF controls the user plane function (UPF) for session management (e.g., session establishment, modify, and release). The unified data management (UDM) stores subscriber data and profiles, and the UPF is the user plane gateway serving the UE by connecting the RAN nodes to the data network (DN). The application function (AF) enables dynamic policy and charging control for applications. The UE is the mobile terminal, and the next-generation radio access network (NG-RAN) is the new air interface for 5G.

NEF offers an interface gateway which allows external users, such as enterprises or partner operators, the ability to monitor, provision and enforce application policy such that users can be inside the operator network [188, 189] . The SBA is based on the related technologies across cloud computing, virtualization, microservice, stateless service, etc. Cloud computing provides on-demand computing to the SBA. Virtualization realizes more flexible and efficient resource management and usability. Microservice is an emerging and useful architectural design pattern, where the network is divided into small-granularity, highly cohesive, and loosely coupled services. Each service can realize a specific functionality. Thus, microservice can enable the SBA with flexibility, granularity, and independent scaling [189] . The case study and deployment considerations about the SBA in 5G can be found in [190] . However, the SBA also brings new security challenges to 5G and 6G. The SBA introduces the set of security features that enable network functions of the SBA to securely communicate within the serving network domain and with other network domains. These include network function registration, discovery and authorization security aspects, as well as the protection for service-based interfaces. SBA domain security is a new security feature in 5G and 6G. To ensure security between UEs in the SBA, security mechanisms such as transport layer security and open authorization are needed [191] .",

First, it can accurately recognize target behaviors, scene semantics, and user characteristics. Second, it adjusts the network services adaptively and dynamically through the unified service description method. These features are supported by a cognitive interface, the lightweight learning agent, and the distributed service analyzing module. With the cognitive interface, the 6G core network has the ability of situation cognition and can perceive the change of service demand in a very fine-grained way. Then the lightweight learning agent makes the decision according to gained information by rule matching or approximate reasoning.

The original 5G core network running in the cloud will no longer directly participate in the control of the network. It just helps edge cores to communicate with each other. With core network sinking to the edge, the network response delay is reduced, and the flexibility of network management is improved. Besides, owing to the sinking deployment of the core network, the CSA will realize the whole network coverage from the core network to the UE. On this basis, the UE can adopt a variety of communication modes and can switch seamlessly when service scenario and requirement change. Edge core supports service adaptation, service migration, service collaboration, and service evolution through distributed service agents running in edge core. Taking service migration [192, 193] as an example, edge core discovers migration requirements and completes migration decisions through service cognition and invokes various modules through the north interface of the network layer to realize various processes such as state data transmission, cell handover, and user session switching.

            "text": "Since it was first introduced in 1970s [198, 199] , cellular networks have become a core structure of mobile networks. Cellular networks offer many advantages in terms of practical implementations and the use of radio resources. However, the main inherent limitation of cellular networks is the boundary effect: the users at the cell boundary receive weak desired signal (due to path loss) and strong interference from other cells. As a result, these cell-edge users perform badly. The boundary effect is not a problem in the past and current mobile networks. This is the reason why the cellular-based topology is still the key option for mobile networks for many decades. However, in beyond 5G and future 6G communication systems, the high demand on data rate certainly will cause ultra-densified and heterogeneous BSs/APs deployment. While, with the density of BSs/APs, the cell coverage becomes smaller. The distance between BSs/APs has been reduced to tens of meters in 5G networks. Such densification of future wireless networks leads to more interference which makes the boundary effect a main bottleneck of cellular systems. From information theory, Refs. [116, 200] have shown that cellular networks are hitting the physical limit to the area spectral efficiency. Whatever the advanced technologies we use, we cannot overcome the boundary effect. Although there have been many techniques proposed in the last decades such as network MIMO, CoMP with joint transmission, and distributed antenna systems, their ability to overcome this bottleneck is limited. This is because these techniques are still based on cellular structures and/or require too complicated co-processing and high deployment costs. In addition to the issue of network convergence owing to the boundary effect, future wireless networks face many further issues, such as load balancing, handover overhead, interference management, to name a few. For example, heterogeneous communication networks need to interconnect with each other, and thus many issues in terms of routing, protocol, and management raise. To solve the above problems, the CF (or cell-less) massive MIMO networks have been proposed in [117] as a practical and scalable version of network MIMO. Figure 22 shows a general system model of CF massive MIMO where many (thousands or more) APs jointly serve many user terminals in the same timefrequency resources. All APs are distributed in a large area (e.g., the whole city) and connected to one or several CPUs. A specific design of CF architecture using the SDN controllers for high-density smart city is illustrated in Figure 23 [201] . In this example, compared with the traditional cellular networks, where a (mobile) terminal needs to be associated with a BS/AP in advance, in this network, a terminal can decide to access several BSs/APs via different uplinks and downlinks depending on the wireless channel status and its demands. As a result, BSs/APs do not need to maintain a list of associated terminals. Instead, the associate control in the SDN controller will decide which BSs/APs the terminals should be associated via the control link. Moreover, the transmission control in the SDN controller will create dynamic uplinks/downlinks and backhaul links to support the joint transmission or reception between terminals and BSs/APs. That means the BSs/APs in the same group can cooperate with each other to realize the joint transmission and reception for a specified terminal [201] . CF massive MIMO has been attracted a lot of research interest, and become one of the promising candidates for beyond 5G and towards 6G wireless communication systems [202] [203] [204] . The main benefits of CF massive MIMO are as follows.",

The communication between the CPUs and the APs is mainly limited to the payload data and power control coefficients. MR processing is simple and can be implemented in a distributed manner to offer good performance. Other linear processing schemes such as ZF and MMSE are much better than MR processing in terms of the system performance [205] . However, they cannot be directly implemented in a distributed manner. So the system is not scalable, i.e., it is not implementable when the number of APs/terminals grows large.

These power controls are done at the CPU via solving a sequence of convex second order cone programs, under the assumption that the CPU has perfect knowledge of large-scale coefficients of all AP-terminal links. These schemes are not scalable with the network size (the number of APs/terminals). In [121] , a distributed power control scheme is proposed where the power control is done at the APs with local knowledge channel conditions. This power control scheme works well, and most importantly, is scalable. However, compared to the centralized scheme in [117] , the performance of this distributed power control is still far below. In addition, because this scheme is a heuristic power control, its performance depends a lot on the propagation environments.

            "text": "(1) The evolution of computing technologies. Over the past decades, computing paradigms have evolved from distributed computing to centralized cloud computing. Now the pendulum swings back. Cloud computing is an architecture with centralized resources and management in the clouds, referring to data centers, backbone Internet protocol (IP) networks and cellular core networks [62] . Owing to centralized resources and management, it enables end devices and consumers with elastic on-demand resource allocation, reduced management efforts, flexible pricing model (pay-as-you-go), and easy applications and services provisioning [207] . However, this main advantage of cloud computing -consolidated resources and management -is also its main weakness. Centralized resources and management mean that functions and controls are located far from where tasks are generated. Owing to long physical distance, limited communication bandwidth, intermittent network connectivity, etc., cloud computing alone cannot meet the requirements of many delay-sensitive applications in 5G, such as automatic driving. Aiming at providing cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the network, in 2014, the industry specification group within European telecommunication standards institute (ETSI) proposed MEC. As defined by ETSI, MEC is a network architecture that provides IT and cloud-computing capabilities within the RAN in close proximity to mobile subscribers [208] . In March 2017, the ETSI expanded the scope of MEC and after that replaced the term \"mobile\" by \"multi-access\" [207] . The edges of non-mobile networks are also being considered in MAEC. Fog computing, first initiated by Cisco, is further promoted by OpenFog consortium to extend and generalize edge computing [209] . The OpenFog consortium defines fog computing as \"a system-level horizontal architecture that distributes resources and services of computing, storage, control, and networking anywhere along the continuum from cloud to things\" [210] [211] [212] . This thanks to the proliferation of smart devices, which can connect with each other and provide shared and flexible resources along the cloud-to-things continuum, driving the new service model call fog as a service technology [213] . A key difference between MEC and fog computing is that MEC functions only Figure 24 (Color online) Multi-tier computing network architecture, which integrates cloud, edge, and fog computing technologies to enable intelligent services for anything at anytime and anywhere [216] .",

Cloud computing is equivalent to the top hierarchical level in the company, possessing the most information sources, the strongest analytical intelligence, the maximum storage space, and the highest decision-making authority. As such, cloud computing is expected to handle challenging tasks at the global level, such as cross-domain data analysis and processing, abnormal behavior diagnosis and tracing, hidden problem prediction and searching, new knowledge discovery and creation, and long-term strategic planning and decisions. Edge computing, on the other hand, is equivalent to front-line staff, having the least resources and capabilities but being able to directly interact with customers in different application domains. Therefore, edge computing is good at handling delay-sensitive tasks at the local level, such as data collection, data compression, information extraction, and event monitoring. Between the cloud and the edge within the network, there is fog computing, which is equivalent to midlevel management in the company. Like an efficient management system with many levels of resources, duties, and responsibilities, fog computing is a hierarchy of shared computing, communication, and storage resources that can collaboratively handle complex and challenging tasks at the regional level, such as cross-domain data analysis, multi-source information processing and on-site decision making for large service coverage. Because user requirements are usually dynamic in terms of time and space, fog computing can provide a flexible approach to incorporate distributed resources at different geographical or logical locations in the network, thus offering timely and effective services to customers.",

Multi-beam satellites have been widely adopted in satellite communication systems as they can provide increasing wireless data rates. Commonly for multi-beam satellite communication systems, a four-color frequency reuse scheme where adjacent beams are allocated with non-overlapping frequency spectrum (or different polarizations) is adopted to mitigate the co-channel inter-beam interference. Recently, a more aggressive full frequency reuse scheme has been advocated to enhance the spectral efficiency of satellite communications further. Nevertheless, the inter-beam interference owing to full frequency reuse should be carefully considered. Note that it is usually not straightforward to extend the interference mitigation approaches widely adopted in terrestrial communication networks to satellite communication networks owing to the significantly different channel propagation properties and the practical satellite payload limitations.",

With regard to topology structure, the meshed UAV structure has a good performance in terms of reliability and flexibility. In [233] , the performance of mmWave UAV mesh network in beam management and network self-healing was studied. In addition to the above characteristics, there are three mechanisms playing important roles in LAPbased communication networks. Firstly, in order to complete military or civilian tasks, LAPs should be moved to the target regions by using a variety of effective movement control mechanisms, which include single-LAP movement control and multi-LAP cooperative mechanisms. The authors in [231] proposed a relatively simple mechanism to control all UAV nodes' desired trajectory, which minimized the total flight distance of all UAVs in motion. Secondly, after LAPs are moved into target regions, networking mechanisms take effect in LAP networks, which can improve QoS and network resource utilization efficiency. Besides, good network mechanisms can respond well to configuration changes in LAP networks. Thirdly, transmission mechanisms can help LAP-based communication networks provide reliable and high-speed data transmission. In [234] , the authors proposed a broader neighbor discovery scheme in term of network recovery, which can improve the packet-delivery ratio and reduce the total network disconnection time by increasing the transmission power of 'Hello' messages. Furthermore, in the civil field, LAP networks also face various challenges related to network security [235] .",

As a typical HAP-based communication network, the airborne network have several unique characteristics. First, most of these network nodes will have multiple links to achieve network reliability, high capacity, and low latency. Second, most of the nodes will be mobile so both the network links and the network topology will vary with time, some faster than others. Third, the distances between adjacent nodes will vary significantly, from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometres. Fourth, the power supply to the nodes will be limited, so the energy efficiency of each node impacts not only the operation cost, as in the case for terrestrial networks, but also commercial viability. Fifth, when applicable it would be highly desirable for antennas on the airborne platforms to be conformal in order to meet the aerodynamic requirements and maintain mechanical integrity.",

Firstly, in consideration of the above advantages, HAP-based communication networks have attracted several prospective studies. The authors in [237] proposed single HAP and multiple HAP LTE cellular capacity analysis and integrated LTE technology into HAP-based communication networks. The study in [238] aimed at evaluating a pilotbased estimation technique for single-carrier frequency division multiple access (FDMA) LTE deployed via HAPs and analyzed the single-carrier FDMA performance on HAPs with pilot-based channel estimation. In [239] , the authors proposed a novel framework for maximizing the sum rate of a relay-aided HAP drone wireless system when the CSI was not available, which can provide broadband wireless connectivity to ground users effectively. The authors in [240] investigated a vertical framework to backhaul/fronthaul small-cell base stations via networked flying platforms, which utilized HAPs and free space optics to transport traffic between the access and core networks. Secondly, owing to the special stratospheric transmission characteristic, the HAP channel model shows differences with other UAV channel models in the 3D transmission nature. The authors in [241] proposed a non-stationary 3D wideband geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM), which is more practical to characterize the HAP-MIMO channel. Thirdly, there are several key challenges for future HAP-based communication networks. These key challenges include safety and regulations, seamless integration with existing networks, optimized telecommunications payload, optimized signal processing and protocols, needs for high-speed backhaul/fronthaul links [236] , as well as interference dynamics and limited energy [242] .",

To avoid the unnecessary signaling overhead for efficient resource utilization, distributed control architectures are suitable for services in remote areas. Specifically, owing to low user density, resource management in such scenarios is relatively straightforward, and distributed algorithms can generally achieve satisfactory performance in local operation without involving SDN controllers. In urban/suburban scenarios, on the other hand, the network management is complex, resulting from high service demands, multi-dimensional resources, and complicated communication environments.

However, as the protocol suite was originally designed to support best-effort services in the wireline Internet with arbitrary network topologies, it has some limitations when applying to the future integrated network. First, satellite communication networks (e.g., Starlink) have dynamic but deterministic topologies, which will deviate even more from random topologies in the Internet in coming years with densely deployed LEO satellites. Second, LEO satellites have high mobility and the communication delay varies significantly. The large variations of round trip time (RTT) can affect the transmission rate and degrade the TCP performance. Third, the transmission rate asymmetry in satellite uplink and downlink channels also affects the TCP performance. A lowrate uplink reduces the arrival rate of acknowledgments (ACKs) and the increase of the TCP sending rate, leading to poor channel utilization in the downlink. Last but not least, with emerging network virtualization technology such as in 5G cellular systems, the future integrated network will be logically circuit-switching under the network slicing framework. As a result, in-path network intelligence can be achieved for effective and efficient transport protocols, different from packet switching in the Internet that relies only on end nodes in transmission control [252] .

A LEO satellite network uses a constellation of several similar satellites to provide wireless networking services to the Earth [253] . The LEO satellite network topology in the whole inter-satellite communication process is time-varying and redundantly connected multipath may exist, which causes fast retransmit and recovery and delayed acknowledgments. Several cooperative routing algorithms for satellite networks have been proposed to improve the network throughout and end-to-end delay performance [254] [255] [256] [257] [258] [259] . In UAV group networks [260, 261] , the mobility and altitude of UAVs, transmitted power, inter-UAV distances, extraneous noise, uneven UAV access users' traffic distribution in both spatial and temporal domains, will largely affect the routing protocol [262] and conventional routing protocols fail to work.

The propagation characterization and channel models in sub-6 GHz bands have been extensively investigated in 5G. The signal fading in propagation mainly originates from two aspects: large-scale fading depending on path-loss and shadowing, as well as small-scale fading coming from multipath propagation. Generally, the models of small-scale fading can be divided into two categories, deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic channel models aim to provide a realistic and site-specific description of the channel between Tx and Rx. Stochastic channel models condense the channel characteristics to a statistical description, e.g., the power delay profile (PDP). To close the gap between the above two approaches, a spatial channel model (SCM) has been developed to incorporate not only a random PDP but also a random angular profile by 3GPP [270] . Furthermore, as the standardized 3GPP 3D SCM model has been proposed for LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) to provide additional flexibility for the elevation dimension, thereby allowing modeling for 2D antenna systems [271] .

Therefore, directional transmission using large antenna arrays at both BSs and UEs is imperative to compensate the distance-dependent path loss with high antenna gain and reduces the multi-user interference, corresponding to the increase of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Thanks to the shorter wavelength at mmWave bands, large antenna arrays can be emitted in a certain physical size whereas the aperture of the array with the same number of elements will be remarkably enlarged below 6 GHz. Combining with full-dimension or 3D beamforming technology, mmWave communications can provide excess DOF in beam sweeping and not dramatically worse coverage range. Moreover, although the potential of mmWave directional transmission is exciting, ultra-dense small cell networks is necessary to reduce the average propagation distance and ensure the sum capacity of mmWave networks. The other distinguishing feature of mmWave systems is their vulnerability to blockage. Penetration losses at mmWave bands are much larger than those at lower frequency bands and seem to be site-related (e.g., building structures, materials, and incident directions). On the other hand, diffraction is extremely weak owing to the smaller wavelengths of mmWave signals in comparison with the dimensions of surrounding objects, while reflection becomes rich which will enhance the coverage in actual mmWave networks.",

In terms of the integrated space information networks, there are some typical THz communication applications, such as the satellite cluster networks, inter-satellite backbone networks, and satellite-to-ground networks.

Noticeably, the super-heterodyne transceiver scheme is also adopted in the 220 GHz solid-state communication system where the 220 GHz sub-harmonic mixer performs the function of spectrum conversion. However, the solid-state THz system endures the phase noise deterioration, conversion loss, and it needs high gain power amplifiers. This solid-state THz system is easily integrated and saves the power energy. Secondly, with regard to the direct modulation based THz system, a continuous THz carrier wave is generated by the THz source, and the amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation signal from the BB is loaded on the modulator to realize the modulation of the THz carrier wave directly. One may note that the direct modulation based THz system possesses high flexibility, achieves higher output power and is easily integrated with small size. However, this modulation mode is very difficult and endures relatively low spectrum utilization. Then, to the best of our knowledge, the photoelectric combination based THz system is able to achieve extremely high data rates and high bandwidth utilization.

This means that it is possible to cover a few square meters down to a very small area of only a few square centimeters with the same light source. This makes this technology very versatile to build terabit point-to-point backhaul systems as well as ultra-small cell terabit mobile access systems. In the latter, the signals can be piggybacked on existing lighting systems. It has been demonstrated that LiFi can sufficiently and effectively support indoor mobile communication systems including both effective interference management and handover [301] . In addition, sleep mode concepts can be used effectively. For instance, while all the lights may be turned on for illumination, only those luminaires may activate their communication function when there are active users within their coverage area. This will enhance efficiency and at the same time will reduce co-channel interference.",

This means that FSO appears to be an ideal candidate for high-speed backhaul links and fixed meshed optical wireless networks. However, the requirements for ATP systems in high-speed mobile communication scenarios are very challenging. In this case a gridof-beam and an associated beam-switching approach might be more advantageous. Another promising way to manage high-speed mobility and multi-user access in OWC is the newly proposed optical mobile communication (OMC) technology [290] . OMC uses optical phased arrays to steer optical beams to mobile users with high energy efficiency. Different from conventional ATP subsystems, optical phased array steers the laser beams by changing the optical phases. Specifically, a pixelated liquid crystal spatial light modulator device can be used to adjust the beam phase. This approach introduces more DOF to optical systems and makes the optical elements work in a way which is comparable to massive MIMO systems. Through optical phased array, the original beam can be split with adjustable power allocations and redirected to multiple users at different locations, making it possible to serve a large number of mobile terminals.",

Here we briefly introduce channel measurements and models for 5G and beyond, including mmWave, THz, optical, satellite, UAV, maritime, underwater acoustic, HST, V2V, ultra-massive MIMO, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and industry IoT communication channels. mmWave and THz channels show similar channel characteristics, such as large bandwidth, high directivity, large path loss, blockage effects, atmosphere absorption, and more diffuse scattering. THz bands show more severe path loss, atmosphere absorption, and diffuse scattering than mmWave bands. mmWave channel has been well studied at 26/28, 32, 38/39, 60, and 73 GHz bands [313, 314] . Even though, mmWave channel measurements with MIMO antennas, high dynamics, and outdoor environments are still required [315, 316] . For THz channels, most of the channel measurements are around 300 GHz band [317] [318] [319] . The channel characteristics above 300 GHz are still not clear and need extensive channel measurements in the future. The deterministic mmWave channel models include ray tracing, map-based, and point cloud models. The ray tracing model is applied to IEEE 802.11ad, while the mapbased model is applied to METIS. The quasi-deterministic (Q-D) model is used in MiWEBA and IEEE 802.11ay. The stochastic models include Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V), propagation graph, and GBSM. GBSM is used in several standardized channel models, such as NYU WIRELESS, 3GPP 38.901, METIS, and mmMAGIC. The ray tracing model and GBSM are also widely used in THz channel modeling. Meanwhile, human/vegetation blockage and rain/cloud/snow/fog attenuations also need to be modeled for mmWave/THz channels.",

For air-to-sea channel, the UAV or relay is used as the BS to communicate with ships on the sea surface. This type of channels is also named as the UAV-to-ship channel. For near-sea-surface channel, a ship can communicate with other ships (ship-to-ship) or fixed BS near the sea (ship-to-land). The unique features of the maritime propagation environment cause sparse scattering, sea wave movement, ducting effect over the sea surface, time non-stationarity, long communication distances, and climate factors. Maritime channel measurements are conducted at 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands with maximum distances up to 10 km. The path loss is shown to be different for ship-to-ship, ship-to-land, moving, and drifting scenarios. The underwater channel is prone to multipath propagation owing to refraction, reflection, and scattering. It disperses in both time and frequency domain, which leads to the time-varying and Doppler effects. Channel measurements are unusually conducted at several kHz, ranging from 2 kHz to 32 kHz. Ray tracing can be used as a deterministic simulation method for maritime channel and underwater acoustic channel. Apart from it, the two-ray model and three-way model are also used in practice. Stochastic models include GBSM and two wave with diffusion power. Rayleigh, Ricean, and log-normal distributions are usually used for underwater acoustic channel.",

Some preliminary channel measurements have been conducted in open space, hilly terrain, viaduct, tunnels, cutting, stations, and intra-wagon scenarios [326] . Vehicular network is a typical industry vertical application of 5G/6G for uRLLC scenario. V2V channel at sub-6 GHz band has been widely investigated, while mmWave V2V channel needs more measurements. A survey of current mmWave V2V channel measurements was given in [327] . In summary, V2V channels were measured at 28, 38, 60, 73, and 77 GHz bands. All of them are configured with single antenna at both sides of Tx and Rx, and either the Tx or the Rx can be fixed or moving. The measured environments include highway, urban street, open area, university campus, parking lot, etc. mmWave V2V MIMO or even massive MIMO channel measurements with high mobility are promising in the future. For HST and V2V channels, the high mobility and non-stationarity need to be considered. Ray tracing can be used to simulate the HST/V2V channel. Stochastic channel models include the GBSM, QuaDRiGa-based model, dynamic model, Markov model, and propagation graph model. Ultra-massive MIMO utilizes thousands of antennas to largely improve the spectral and energy efficiency, throughput, robustness, and DOF of wireless communication systems. It can be combined with other key technologies, such as mmWave/THz, V2V, and HST communications. Owing to the use of large antenna arrays, the channel shows spherical wavefront, spatial non-stationarity, and channel hardening properties, which have been validated by previous massive MIMO channel measurements at sub-6 GHz/mmWave bands in indoor and outdoor environments. At sub-6 GHz band, the dimension of the massive MIMO array can be several meters. At THz band, owing to the developments of plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, it is possible to realize ultra-massive MIMO up to 1024\u00d71024 [328] . For massive MIMO channel, the spherical wavefront, non-stationarity, and cluster appearance and disappearance properties need to be considered. In general, the spherical wavefront can be modeled in GBSM with accurate propagation distance calculation for each individual antenna element. The non-stationarity is usually modeled by the concept of the visible region and the cluster birth-death process.",

In addition, only 2D azimuth angle and time domain were considered with wide sense stationary assumption. In third generation, the channel model dealt with wideband SISO channel and evolved to time-delay domain. In 4G, the channel model extended to wideband MIMO and further evolved to 3D (azimuth and elevation angles) and spacetime-delay domain. In 5G, the channel model extended to ultra-wideband massive MIMO. The channel was fully characterized in 3D, non-stationary, and space-time-delay domain. The frequency bands also increased from sub-6 GHz to mmWave bands. Meanwhile, the scenarios have also been much more complicated. The standardized 5G channel models prefer to use a general channel model framework with different parameter sets for different scenarios. In [337] , a general 3D non-stationary 5G channel model was proposed to cover the four challenging scenarios, i.e., massive MIMO, HST, V2V, and mmWave. However, all of the existing standard channel models only concentrated on terrestrial communication networks and frequencies up to mmWave bands, while 6G channels should cover space-air-ground-sea integrated networks and frequencies up to optical frequency bands.

In contrast to the conventional model-driven approach that follows a non-interactive paradigm, the ILDP consists of communication model module and adaptive learning module, which work in an interactive manner, thus is able to extract useful information in real-time and sufficiently adapt to the ever-changing environments. The ILDP has been implemented to design efficient beam training and tracking for multi-user mmWave communications, fulfilled with DRL [363] and bandit learning [364] . The results show that they can capture dynamic spatial patterns and adjust beam training strategy intelligently, without knowing priori information about dynamic channel modeling. The ILDP is powerful in intelligently sensing the dynamic environment of wireless communications and has a wide application that is not limited to physical layer. In addition to physical layer modules, DL can also be applied to design end-to-end systems. In [363] , DL was used to generate an end-to-end system, which includes all signal-related functionalities. In [364] , a new algorithm was developed to design an end-to-end system even when the channel model is unknown. This functionality is achieved by iteratively training both the Tx and the Rx with true gradient and approximated gradient, respectively. As indicated in [350] , the DL-aided iterative Bayesian solver can also be employed for the end-to-end system. The resulting system has advantages in implementation efficiency because all physical layer functionalities can be uniformly implemented with the same hardware accelerator, which is reconfigurable and scalable for different applications. In order to deploy the DL-based approaches, efficient hardware implementation is essential to bridge the gap from theory to practice.",

In the beamspace domain, the geometrical information, e.g., user position, becomes significantly important for performance optimization. However, the large number of beams and adjacent cells, along with the complex relationship between beamspace channel and BS parameters, e.g., tilt angle, all make the interference modeling and consequent performance prediction/optimization very difficult. Therefore, by exploiting the large amount of historical beamspace channel information, ML tools can model an approximate function between the BS parameters and beamspace channel information at any geometrical location of an interested scenario or even the straightforward performance metric. Several learning frameworks have been proposed to solve the above problems. The common key problem is to compress beamspace channel information, which highly affects the complexity of learning network.",

Besides, to further improve the capacity of DRL, the framework introduces a reasonable 5G physical model based on careful analysis on measurement data and reasonable assumptions.

This helps the on-demand resource orchestration process to properly balance the resources, guarantee high resource efficiency, and reduce network cost by avoiding overision. For example, the processing resources of the central unit can be properly configured to achieve more pooling gain according to the predicted traffic fluctuation. In addition, some parts of access resources can be turned off if no traffic is predicted in the corresponding coverage area. AI has great potential in these areas. A general framework of DL-based resource management is illustrated in AI can help to allocate radio resources efficiently. An important example of AI application in resource allocation is the intelligent vehicular networks. The vehicular network brings unprecedented challenges unseen in traditional wireless communications systems owing to its strict and diverse QoS requirements as well as the inherent dynamics in vehicular environments, such as fast time-varying wireless channels and network topology. How to dynamically allocate the resources for ITS to maximize the QoS for end users with small provisioning overhead is a nontrivial task. AI provides a powerful tool to tackle these problems [372] . The key motivation of using AI for resource allocation in vehicular networks was discussed in [373] . According to [373] , DRL approach can address resource allocation problems in ITS that are difficult to handle in the traditional optimization framework.",

However, the distributed computing resource in edge cloud and energy dynamics in the battery of mobile devices make it challenging to offload tasks for users. To tackle the dilemma, a collaborative and on-demand DNN co-inference framework, named \"Edgent\" was developed in [374] . Its core ideas include: (i) DNN partitioning that adaptively divides DNN computation between device and edge to leverage hybrid computation resources in proximity for real-time DNN inference. (ii) DNN right-sizing that accelerates DNN inference through early-exit at a proper intermediate DNN layer in order to further decrease the computation latency. Furthermore, an intelligent offloading system was constructed in [375] for vehicular edge computing by utilizing DRL. Moreover, to design an efficient resource allocation policy, a DRL with the multi-timescale framework was proposed in [376] .",

In this active field of coded caching research, the placement delivery array (PDA) for characterizing the coded caching scheme has attracted vast attention. However, designing PDA has high computational complexity. In [380] , a deep neural architecture was proposed to learn the construction of PDAs to reduce the computational complexity. The problem of variable size of PDAs is solved using neural attention and reinforcement learning.

Facing the service requirements on supporting virtual and physical fusion, immersive, holographic, contextualized, personalized, ubiquitous communication, and the network requirements on the integrations of heterogeneous network technologies and space-air-ground-sea integrated networks [382] , the current networks' operation paradigms with rule-based algorithms, limited by rigid preset rules, are difficult to dynamically adapt to continuously changing user needs and network environments. Moreover, network operation experience cannot be effectively accumulated, which limits the continuous improvement of network capabilities. This means that under the present operating paradigms, networks do not have the ability to self-evolve.

With powerful data acquisition platforms of operators and over-the-top companies, almost all wireless data can be collected from users in core network, RAN, and the service providers. As have been demonstrated in various applications, with efficient storage management of the collected data, big data analytics [347, [391] [392] [393] [394] [395] [396] [397] is capable of processing these data and help obtain the key features of each type of data, and label them with sufficiently fine granularity. In contrast to traditional data processing at the BSs, big data platforms are capable of both predictive and prescriptive analytics with powerful ML techniques, such as support vector machine and DL. For example, reliable prediction on the user position, mobility behavior, and service type can be made. Also, the RAN characteristics can be obtained, such as the channel environment, user density and distribution, adjacent cell interference, spatial and temporal traffic variations. Such predictions enable flexible RAN configurations in stabilizing the wireless connections, making better utilization of the radio resources, proactive network control, or even designing AI enable wireless communication network with flexibly configured network functions, signaling, and processing.",

A study item on network data analytics (NWDA) was approved in 3GPP [398], which is a network entity defined to provide network analytics to the core network PCF. NWDA is envisioned to identify service characteristics to form a big data model that is then used to classify incoming traffic to allow for customized and improved service delivery. Furthermore, a study item on big data driven network architecture for 5G was already approved in 3GPP service and system aspects working group 2 (SA2). This study item aims to investigate solutions for a big data driven network architecture with information management across all technical domains for context mining. This is truly necessary because the wireless applications may not want to reveal their secrets to the operators, which complicates the operation and management of the wireless networks. However, this study focuses on the core network, thus inherently cannot handle some RAN enhancement efficiently owing to the interaction overhead and process delay. In addition to the overhead and process delay considerations, it worth noting that most of the RAN enhancement greatly depends on the RAN characteristics like the channel environment, user density and distribution, adjacent cell interference, radio resource availability. Thus, for RAN enhancement, it is more appropriate to also include the wireless big data analytics at the local RAN side. The core network may potentially provide some useful context information and base modeling. To support the wireless big data analytics for RAN, it is quite necessary to introduce a logical big data function in the RAN side and consider its interface with different layers of RAN and core network for data/model collection and policy/parameter distribution. This is actively being investigated in the O-RAN alliance.",

The emerging AI-enabled physical layer approaches could fundamentally break through the limitations of conventional module-by-module transceiver realizations. As proposed in [399, 400] , the physical layer transceivers could be implemented through the advanced ANNs. However, owing to the challenges in data collecting and data size, the current physical layer end-to-end learning results are trained based on simulated data generated by statistical channel models. In fact, it is very challenging for these statistical channel models to exactly characterize all channels in the real radio environments.

A secret key can be agreed by the communicating partners Tx and Rx over the insecure quantum channel by relying on an authenticated public channel. In somewhat simplistic manner one could argue that if an eavesdropper tries to observe the quantum-domain information, his/her tampering with the quantum information destroys the quantum state, which hence collapses back into the classical domain and the information becomes useless. Another benefit of QKD is that any malicious eavesdropping action can be detected. Once the Tx and Rx have agreed upon their choice of secret key, one-time pad based encryption may ensue, which is similar to that of the classic cryptosystems.

AI technology, especially ML and big data analytics technology, has been widely used to optimize the configurations of heterogeneous networks in specific scenarios [430] . However, the high complexity of AI technology limits its applications in wireless networks [195] . With the increase of the peak rate of 6G network, the processing capacity of 6G network elements will be greatly developed, which will promote the deep integration of AI and 6G network security design [431] , especially for encoding, authentication and anomaly detection [418] . The ML-based auto-encoder can effectively detect the abnormal traffic data in 6G network through reconstruction error [432] . To achieve highly reliable and robust authentication in 6G networks, ML based physical layer authentication has been proposed to mitigate the effect of channel time-varying characteristics on physical layer attributes [433] . Big data analytics can be used to process the exponential growth of 6G network data, and provide the detection application for abnormal user detection [434] .",

New performance metrics and application scenarios of 6G have been introduced, e.g., to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level, security and resilience, etc. In addition, example industry verticals of 6G wireless communication networks have been given, with cloud VR, IoT industry automation, C-V2X, digital twin body area network, and energy efficient wireless network control and federated learning systems as illustrations. The enabling technologies to meet the 6G requirements have been provided. Novel air interface and transmission technologies have been investigated, such as new waveforms, multiple access, channel coding, CF massive MIMO, dynamic and intelligent spectrum sharing and accessing, blockchain-based wireless accessing and networking, photonics defined radio, and MCo for uRLLC. Also, novel network architectures have been studied, including SDN/NFV, network slicing, SBA, CSA, DEN 2 , CF, and cloud/fog/edge computing. The four new paradigm shifts, i.e., global coverage (satellite, UAV, terrestrial, maritime communications), all spectra (sub-6 GHz, mmWave, THz, optical frequency bands), full applications (AI-enabled wireless communications), and strong network security, have been proposed to achieve a fully integrated 6G network. Future research directions have also been pointed out in each part. We believe that this survey review can provide academic researchers and industry experts with sufficient insightful thoughts on the developments of future 6G wireless communication networks.",
