Combination therapy is the cornerstone of malaria treatment primarily aimed to delay the development of resistance to the individual components. Although combinations including the anti-folate drugs proguanil and dapsone are effective, micro-encapsulation can be used to improve the bioavailability of these drugs. The objective of this study was the formulation and characterization of a proguanil hydrochloride and dapsone loaded trimethyl chitosan (TMC) microparticles to evaluate their in vivo bioavailability. TMC was synthesised by reductive methylation of chitosan accomplished by a chemical reaction between chitosan and iodomethane in the presence of sodium hydroxide. The TMC microparticles was synthesized by the ionic gellation technique from TMC. The in vivo bioavailability of the dapsone TMC formulation (3 mg/kg oral dose) relative to the normal dapsone formulation (3 mg/kg oral dose) was found to be 244% (n = 5). The dapsone TMC microparticles were absorbed faster, i.e. the maximum concentration was attained 1 h after the administration of the dose relative to that of the normal dapsone formulation which reached its maximum concentration after 2 h. For the proguanil TMC formulation (16 mg/kg oral dose) relative to the proguanil formulation (16 mg/kg oral dose) was found to be 123% (n = 5); whereas the bioavailability of cycloguanil obtained from 16 mg/kg of the proguanil TMC formulation oral dose was found to be 156%. Both proguanil formulations were absorbed quickly, and both attained the maximum formulation at 2 h after dose administration. Microencapsulating antimalarial drugs in TMC may increase the therapeutic potential of these drugs.",

Since 2006, the official recommended antimalarial treatment for uncomplicated malaria is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). In 2012, a malaria epidemic occurred in Ampandrakilandya rural commune within the health district of Antsohihy whilst local health facilities run out of ASAQ and RDTs. We suggested the use of the combination dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine phosphate + trimetoprime (DPT) commercially recorded in Madagascar. Following ethical clearance from the Ministry of Health, DPT was used in a tract and treat manner. Also, its therapeutic efficacy over 28 days was assessed. From May to June 2012, Plasmodium falciparum-infected patients aged >1 year with parasitemia \u2265500/ll were enrolled (n = 103). DPT was orally administered under medical supervision at the recommended dose over 2 days. Patients were followed up until day 28. Adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) was defined according to the standard WHO protocol. A 6 year old girl was dead on day 1 following convulsion. Her parasitemia on day 0 was 32 000/ll. Three patients (2.9%) were either excluded from follow-up. Among the 99 patients who completed the 28 day follow-up, 18.2% (18/99) were <5 years old. DPT was well tolerated. Per-protocol analysis on day 28 shows that the cure rate (ACPR) was 94.9% before PCR correction. On day 3, two children (2%) aged 2 and 6 years old had positive smears (respectively 94 and 63 trophozoits/ll). Five patients presented a late parasitological failure (5.1%). All recurrent parasitemia were re-infections and the PCR corrected efficacy rate was 100%. P. falciparum isolates examined were pfk13 wild-type. Our results demonstrate that DPT is highly efficacy. Given that piperaquine is providing post-treatment prophylaxis for re-infection thanks to its long half-life, we believe that piperaquine-containing ACT, different from the firstline treatment artesunate + amodiaquine, can be specifically used to control malaria epidemic in Madagascar.",

However, the implementation of this strategy is faced with challenges such as timing of SP administration and rising levels of parasite resistance to SP in the general population. SP resistance is associated with mutations in the genes of dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr). Three Pfdhfr mutations N51I, C59R and S108N, known as the triple mutation, and the Pfdhps mutations A437G and K540E, known as the double mutation, collectively form the quintuple mutations. The quintuple mutation and an additional mutation on the dhps (A581G) are known to confer high level of SP resistance. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that prior to implementation of IPT-SP in any region with moderate to high malaria transmission, the prevalence of these markers of resistance with special emphasis on K540E should be determined and IPT-SP commenced only in regions with a prevalence rate <50%. Recent data show growing concerns of SP resistance in Nigeria (Oguike et al., yet to be published) with emerging novel dhps haplotypes and the triple mutant (IRN) dhfr haplotypes but their effect on efficacy of IPT-SP is unknown. There is paucity of data on SP resistance markers in Nigeria. Therefore, there is need for continuous monitoring of these resistance markers over the years to provide comprehensive data that will guide implementation of IPT-SP in Nigeria.",

Whilst Lineage 2 and 4 are extensively studied, Lineage 1 and 3 remain unexplored. Lineage 2 and 4 are globally widespread thus considered the most successful. However, Lineage 1 and 3 are important drivers of TB epidemics along the rim of Indian Ocean. Further, evidence shows that the strain genetic background in MTBC has implications for clinical disease, treatment and diagnosis. Our aim is to define the global phylogenomic structure of Lineage 1 and 3 to infer their evolutionary history, and better understand their distribution and spread.

Ensuring this wholistic approach has improved acceptance by the community and impacted on the overall case load of EVD by reducing the number of chains of transmission. 1 More bodies are managed than recorded as Ebola deaths because all deaths at a community level are managed as suspected cases and are tested for Ebola using an oral swab test. Conclusions Mortality in HWs with EVD is similar to that seen in the general population. The disease evolves rapidly, with death in fatal cases just over 1 week of illness. The surprising finding of increased odds of death with earlier presentation may reflect the tendency of sicker patients with higher viral loads, and thus a poorer prognosis, being prompted to seek care earlier than those with milder disease and lower viral loads.

MSF was the main patient care provider in previous and current outbreak. Due to the contagiousness, Ebola patients have to be isolated and cared for using strict barrier nursing and infection control measures to protect staff and other patients. Patients are treated in the so-called Ebola treatment centers (ETC) where patient flow and layout ensure staff safety, patient and staff comfort, and community acceptance. In the previous outbreaks, the maximum size of an ETC was 40 beds. In this outbreak, the patient number demanded larger structures. Often the ETCs started in or next to existing health structures, and increased in size by addition of new tents or structures.

Introduction Much has been made of Nigeria's effectiveness in containing it's ebola outbreak; it was declared a success story across major international media. Less is however known about how the prevailing politics in the health sector in Nigeria influenced the course, containment efforts and impact of the outbreak. The outbreak occurred within the context of longrunning and deep seated inter-professional antagonism and supremacy battles within the health sector in Nigeria, with consequent perennial industrial disputes and frequent shutting down of public sector hospitals. The outbreak on 20th July 2014 took place when all doctors employed by the Federal Government, the largest employer of doctors in the country, were on strike. This has raised important questions about 1 the possible course of the outbreak should the infected passenger have been taken to one of the government owned tertiary hospitals in Lagos, with larger patient volumes and poorer infection control procedures in place; 2 the inter-relationship between the outbreak and the strike actions; and 3 lessons for dealing with deep-rooted inter-professional antagonism in relation to the potential impact of preparedness plans and effective management of future outbreaks.",

Despite technological advances, some problems have been reported with CVL serodiagnosis. The present study describes a sequential subtractive selection through phage display technology from polyclonal antibodies of negative and positive sera that resulted in the identification of potential bacteriophage-fused peptides that were highly sensitive and specific to antibodies of CVL. A negative selection was performed in which phage clones were adhered to purified IgGs from healthy and Trypanosoma cruzi infected dogs to eliminate cross-reactive phages. The remaining supernatant nonadhered phages were submitted to positive selection against IgG from the blood serum of dogs that were infected with Leishmania infantum. Phage clones that adhered to purified IgGs from the CVL-infected serum samples were selected. Eighteen clones were identified and their reactivities tested by a phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) against the serum samples from infected dogs (n = 31) compared to those from vaccinated dogs (n = 21), experimentally infected dogs with cross-reactive parasites (n = 23), and healthy controls (n = 17). Eight clones presented sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, and they showed no cross-reactivity with T. cruzi-or Ehrlichia canis infected dogs or with dogs vaccinated with two different commercial CVL vaccines in Brazil. Our study identified eight mimotopes of L. infantum antigens with 100% accuracy for CVL serodiagnosis.

Extended follow-up and multidisciplinary management is critical. Evidence from randomized clinical trials or larger prospective studies are essential to establish optimal treatment regimens. The neglected tropical disease visceral leishmaniasis (VL), transmitted by sand flies, is set for elimination as a public health problem on the Indian sub-continent (ISC) by 2017 (incidence of symptomatic cases <1/10 000 at (sub)district level). ISC-countries are committed to reaching this ambitious target and have set different intervention strategies, mainly focusing on early detection and treatment of symptomatic VL cases as well as vector control. We developed a mathematical model to investigate whether elimination may be achieved with current strategies, and what additional interventions might be required. Based on an existing model we created a deterministic compartmental model as well as a stochastic individual-based (IBM) variant. The IBM includes individual heterogeneities regarding exposure to the sand fly and health seeking behavior. Also, it allows for estimating elimination probabilities under the selected strategies. The model was fitted to the KALANET dataset from the highly endemic Bihar region (India) and was tuned to predict different transmission scenarios (degree of endemicity, and equilibrium or outbreak situation). Our model predictions suggest that the target incidence of <1/ 10 000 can be achieved with the selected strategies for districts that currently experience endemicity levels at or below 10/10 000. Settings with higher baseline endemicities require additional efforts such as increased screening. Further, our simulations suggest that patients with post Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, which occurs months to years after symptomatic VL, may serve as a reservoir of infection when nearing the elimination target. Our findings are robust against alternative assumptions about duration of immunity and infectiousness of different disease states (e.g. asymptomatic infection). We conclude that elimination of VL on the ISC is feasible for most regions with current strategies, but the duration of control and monitoring and evaluation of transmission will be pivotal to prevent recrudescence of infection.",

Treatment efficacies vary due to parasite drug resistance, patient tolerance to drug toxicity and co-morbidities such as HIV infection. It is therefore important to monitor treatment responsiveness to confirm cure and curtail relapse. Currently, microscopy of spleen, bone marrow or lymph node biopsies is the only definitive method to evaluate long term cure. A less invasive test for treatment success is a high priority for VL management. Along with InBios International, Seattle, we developed a prototype capture ELISA based on detecting Leishmania donovani antigens in the urine of VL patients. The Leishmania Antigen Detect TM ELISA demonstrated >90% sensitivity on VL patient samples from Sudan (n = 64), Bangladesh (n = 13) and Ethiopia (n = 46) and 88% on samples from Brazil (n = 43). The ELISA was also highly discriminatory for VL, based on results using samples from healthy individuals (n = 58) and patients with other diseases (n = 30), with a demonstrated specificity of 100%. To confirm utility in monitoring treatment, urine samples were collected from 42 VL patients in Ethiopia at days 0, 30 and 180 post-treatment. For the Leishmania Antigen Detect TM ELISA, positivity was high at day 0 at 95%, falling to 21% at day 30. At day 180, all samples were negative, corresponding well with clinical cure. The ELISA was much more sensitive than KAtex, the only existing urine Leishmania antigen detection test on the market, which had a sensitivity of 50-60% on the above samples at a specificity of 92%. It also has practical advantages over KAtex such as not requiring the boiling of urine, thus shortening the time of assay as well as improving convenience. The Leishmania Antigen Detect TM ELISA provides a standardized, user-friendly, quantitative and non-invasive test to detect Leishmania antigens during acute infection as well as to monitor its clearance upon cure and is a clear improvement over existing options. The Leishmania Antigen Detect TM ELISA is a valuable tool to fill current gaps in VL management. It is important to establish its impact in the field through Phase II studies and make it available to clinics as soon as possible.",

De Rycker Drug Discovery Unit, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK Visceral leishmaniasis is a significant health problem in several countries of the developing world, causing approximately 30 000 deaths annually. Treatments exist but are associated with many drawbacks ranging from high cost to resistance and toxic-ity. There is an urgent need for new drugs that are safe, affordable and can be administered orally. The Drug Discovery Unit at the University of Dundee is a fully integrated biotech style drug discovery operation. Over the last 6 years we have developed an innovative and efficient drug discovery engine for new antileishmanials which we present here. Our in vitro screening cascade combines the robustness and throughput required for screening large libraries with the physiological relevance required to have confidence that compounds will show efficacy in in vivo models. This cascade includes both axenic and intracellular Leishmania assays, as well as toxicity counterscreens. Unlike many standard axenic assays, our novel axenic amastigote assay differentiates between compounds with a cytocidal and a cytostatic effect and allows us to screen large compound collections in a relatively short time with good translation of activity in the gold-standard intracellular Leishmania assay. We aim to obtain proof of concept in animal efficacy studies as quickly as possible. To achieve this we assess the pharmacokinetic properties of hits at an early stage through a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. In order to swiftly progress promising series through lead-optimisation and pre-clinical development we actively collaborate with a pharmaceutical partner (GSK) and the product development partnership that will ultimately take on clinical development (DNDi).",

Afterwards, the disease was also confirmed in the western and southeastern regions of Par a State, as well as in Amap a, Acre and Rond\u00f4nia States, all in Amazonian Brazil, but also in the neighboring countries of Peru, Bolivia, French Guyana and Surinam. However, considering that the parasite transmission in nature is carried out by Lutzomyia ubiquitalis (Psychodidae: Phlebotominae), a poorly anthropophilic sand fly species, the disease seems to be little frequent in man. We demonstrate herein that ACL due to L. (V.) lainsoni can be intradomiciliarly transmitted in Amazonian Brazil. In the last 2 years, seven ACL patients due to L. (V.) lainsoni were attended in the ambulatory of Leishmaniasis Laboratory 'Prof. Dr. Ralph Lainsoni', in Ananindeua municipality, Par a State, Brazil, all from the 'Mosqueiro Island', an administrative district situated about 70 km from Bel em, capital of Par a State. The phenotypical characterization of L. (V.) lainsoni was based on isoenzyme electrophoresis. In order to confirm the transmission of disease, it was carried out a sand fly collection (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) using four CDC light traps in the interior of a home (two bedrooms) of an ACL patient. This sand fly capture revealed the identification of three female of Lu. trinidadensis and twelve of Lu. ubiquitalis. These results represent strong evidence on the sinanthropic capacity of the sand fly Lu. ubiquitalis, a proven vector of L.

Diagnosis of VL in patients presenting with suspected relapse is a challenge in resource-limited settings. Currently diagnosis of relapse necessitates invasive tissue aspirates of spleen, bone-marrow or lymph node, which requires skilled HR and the capacity to identify L. donovani amastigotes histologically. These skill sets are rare in the majority of the rural settings in areas endemic for VL. Splenic aspirate is the gold standard with high sensitivity (96%) however it is complex, carries risk of bleeding and is contraindicated in patients with very low hemoglobin or platelets, both of which are not uncommon in VL. Although safer, lymph node (50%) and bone-marrow (65%) have relatively low sensitivity. Recently a point-of-care rapid diagnostic test (RDT), the IgG1 K-SeT, was evaluated in India and Nepal. Though still in development phase, preliminary results showed sensitivity of 83-100% and a specificity of 80% of detecting VL relapse in symptomatic patients.",

Infections in mammals are acquired via sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus. The signaling pathways that control the differentiation processes from extracellular promastigotes in the sand fly host into intracellular amastigotes in the mammalian host have not been characterized so far. The PP1s are essential serine/threonine phosphatases in regulating diverse cellular functions in eukaryotic organisms and its role in Leishmania has not yet been described. The comparative sequence alignment of the PP1 of L. infantum codified by chromosome 34 showed relevant amino acid differences in the N-terminal regions and an invariable catalytic core. The predicted three-dimensional structure of LinJ34.0840 did not significantly differ from the widely studied mammalian orthologues. The gene expression of PP1 analyzed throughout the life cycle of L. infantum by qRT-PCR displayed a regular expression level of PP1 during the promastigotes 0 growth curve. However, several PP1 -LinJ15.0240, LinJ34.0820, LinJ34.0850were found to be up-regulated in the infective promastigotes obtained from the natural sand-fly environment. Inmunofluorescence studies of axenic promastigotes evidenced the subcellular localization of PP1 in the flagellar region (LinJ.15.0240) and flagellar pocket (LinJ34.0840). Stable transfectant promastigotes for the over-expression of genes LinJ15.0240 and LinJ34.0840 were generated in their full length and N-terminal truncated versions with the integrative vector pIR-mcs. First, growth kinetic was altered in the LinJ34.0840 and truncated LinJ15.0240 transfectants. Western blot analysis showed a sharp decrease of PP1 over-expression after 48 h of incubation. Furthermore, the expression profiles of PP1 transfectants analyzed by RNA-Seq revealed a different expression levels compared with wild type promastigotes being found down-regulated more than 500 genes in LinJ.34.0840 transfectant. Interestingly, significant over-expression of genes related with ribosomal protein was detected in the truncated LinJ.15.0240 and LinJ.34.0840 transfectants. Indeed, the over-expression of PP1 resulted in cellular stress and disturbance in the rate translation due to the essential inhibitory functions of PP1 in signaling pathways. These observations suggest that PP1 may play an essential role in the differentiation processes of L. infantum.",

There is a large gap in the knowledge of various aspects of the disease pathogenesis. Many of these manifestations and clinical changes in VL may be related in part to certain changes in the control of gene expression. Our group has shown results that suggest the presence of mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation in leishmaniasis, observing high mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in the liver in dogs naturally infected by L. infantum, but a decreased serum levels of this factor suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. The molecular pathogenic mechanisms involved in the infection with L. infantum have not yet been fully elucidated, so the aim of this study was to analyze a profile of global changes in the expression of mRNA in L. (L.) infatum under IGF-I stimulus. To achieve these objectives it was used next-generation sequencing techniques. L. infantum promastigotes were grown in M199 culture medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and incubated at 26\u00b0C. For the experiment promastigotes were maintained during culture period with IGFI stimulus or only for 5 min or without 50 ng/ml recombinant human IGF-I stimulus. When the parasites were in the stationary growth phase, they were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline 0.01 M pH 7.2 and the mRNA was extracted. mRNA was used to prepare cDNA library and was sequenced in GS Junior System Roche. Data analysis was performed using software package from GS Junior System and Blast program (NCBI). We observed 1025 different mRNA corresponding to 1035 different genes IGF-I stimulus maintained during all culture period, 780 different mRNA sequences corresponding to 780 different genes with 5 min IGF-I stimulus and 235 different mRNA sequences corresponding to 235 different genes when without IGF-I stimulus. These results suggest that different genes are transcribed or dynamically regulated under the stimulation of IGF-I. These changes identified at the molecular level can be used to understand the role of IGF-I during the infection and identify therapeutic targets in Leishmania infection.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG and IgM antibodies prevalence by IFAT and ELISA over the entire spectrum of infection. There were used 600 serum samples of individuals (both genders and \u22651 year old) living in Bujar u municipality, northeastern of Par a State, Brazil: 105 with previous diagnosis of infection [AI (60), SRI (16), III (13), SOI (6) and SI = AVL (10)], and 495 non infected individuals (IFAT-IgG \u00c0 /DTH \u00c0 ). IFAT and ELISA were based on speciesspecific L. (L.) i. chagasi-antigens, amastigote-antigen for IFAT (anti-IgM conjugate) and promastigote-soluble antigen for ELISA (anti-IgM and anti-IgG conjugates). The overall prevalence revealed an ELISA-IgG rate (25.2%) higher (P < 0.05) compared to that of IFAT-IgG (7.5%), as well as an ELISA-IgM rate (4%) also higher than that of IFAT-IgM (1.3%). The prevalence between infected (105) and non infected (495) individuals presented an ELISA-IgM rate (2.5%) higher compared to that of IFAT-IgM (1%), but no difference between IFAT (7.5%) and ELISA (9.3%) IgG rates. With regards to the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic profiles, it was found an ELISA-IgM rate in the AI profile (1.3%) higher (P < 0.05) than that by IFAT-IgM (0.0%), while in the other profiles, SRI (0.0 9 0.0%), III (0.3 9 0.0%), SOI (0.3 9 0.5%) and SI = AVL (0.5 9 0.5%), there was no difference (P > 0.05).

We have shown that extrinsic IGF-I favors the parasite proliferation and the infection development, but this factor is constitutively present in macrophages which effect is not known in leishmaniasis. To study the role of constitutively expressed macrophage intrinsic IGF-I in Leishmania infection, we evaluated the parasitism and IGF-I mRNA expression in Leishmania (Leishmania) major-infected RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line upon IGF-I mRNA silencing with 150 lM small interfering RNA (siRNA) and in some experiments with Th2 cytokine IL-4 (2 ng/ml) and IL-13 (5 ng/ml) stimuli. siRNA treatment of cells resulted in 70% reduction of IGF-I mRNA expression (qRT-PCR). The parasitism (by optical microscopy) in the control without IGF-I siRNA was 149 (median) parasites per 100 cells. With siRNA treatment it decreased to 93 (P < 0.05). Cells under IL-4 plus IL-13 stimuli had the parasitism increased to 160. In siRNA-treated cells with IL-4 and IL-13 stimuli instead of an increase we observed a decrease to 102. Using individual cytokine stimulus, IL-4 stimulus increased the parasitism to 171 but in siRNA-treated cells IL-4 stimulus did not induce an increase but a decrease to 87. Similarly IL-13 stimulus increased the parasitism to 157 but in siRNA-treated cells even with IL-13 stimulus it decreased to 76. Expression of IGF-I mRNA expression accompanied the increase or decrease of parasitism. By replacing the IGF-I with recombinant IGF-I (50 ng/ml) in the all cytokine-stimulated culture and in the cells treated with siRNA, an increase in the parasite number was observed that reached the level similar to the controls. These results suggest that IGF-I is directly related to parasitism and that even with the cytokine stimuli the presence of IGF-I is required to promote susceptibility, strongly suggesting the dependence of the presence of IGF-I for the effect of Th2 cytokines in Leishmania infection.",

Translated to human, these results suggest that the daily dosing of OlPC will be adjustable to avoid side effects while retaining maximum drug efficacy. In Brazil, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis and Leishmania (L.) amazonensis are the main pathogenic species causing American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL); they are implicated with the most frequent clinical form, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL DTH+/++ ), but also with the mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL DTH++++ ) and anergic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (ADCL DTH\u00c0 ), the more severe ACL clinical forms. Between the central LCL and the two polar MCL and ADCL, they can also produce the intermediary borderline disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (BDCL DTHAE ). This study evaluated the dermal dendritic cell (dDC) expression within the clinical-immunological spectrum of ACL; dDC [MHC + class II (Langerin \u00c0 ) and MHC + class I (Langerin + )] is regarded as the main presenting cell of species-specific parasite-antigens to T-cell immune response, being responsible for the activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. The sample examined consisted of 26 patients with ACL-clinical forms: ADCL and BDCL, both due to L. (L.) amazonensis and with negative DTH (\u00c0) , five cases of each; LCL due to L. (L.) amazonensis, divided into two groups: five cases with negative DTH (\u00c0) and three with positive DTH (+) ; and eight cases of LCL due to L. (V.) braziliensis, all with positive DTH (+) . Paraffin-embedded biopsies of cutaneous lesions were carried out for immunohistochemical analysis of immunostained cells (CD11c + ), using rabbit anti-human CD11c McAb (ab52632 Abcam). A Zeiss image analysis system was used to quantify dDCs + in 5-8 fields per histological section (4009). dDC expression was analyzed by Mann-Whitney test using Biostat 5.0 (P < 0.05). The dDC + cell density showed an increased expression from the central LCL ( A longitudinal entomological survey was carried out in four demographically different provinces at West of Alexandria governorate, Egypt from May to November 2010. Standardized sampling with oiled paper 'sticky traps' was employed during the breeding season to determine monthly trends in species composition, density and sex ratio. Temperature and relative humidity were recorded by manual thermo-hygrometer once per month in each province, during application of sticky traps. Plebotomus papatasi was the only anthropophagic species found. One hundred and 43 P. papatasi were collected; the highest prevalence was 44.8% in Al-Hawareya, followed by 29.4% in Al Agamy then 25.8% in old King Mariout while Marakya was free of sandflies, with male to female sex ratio 1:1.6 and two peaks of abundance in both July and September. Of the collected sandflies, 51.7% were from interior traps while 48.3% were from exterior traps. Adult sandflies showed increased activity during months of high humidity and relatively high temperature; the highest number of sandflies was recorded in both July and September at a temperature of 29-30\u00b0C and RH ranging from 60% to 73%, while the lowest monthly abundance of sandfly was in November at a temperature of 23-25\u00b0C and RH ranging from 55% to 60%. The monthly population densities of sandflies in west Alexandria were calculated; the average internal density was highest at 11% in July and lowest at 2% in November. The average external density was highest at 9% in July and lowest at 2% in October. The number of sandflies per trap was greatest (10) in July and lowest (2.75) in November; and the number of sandflies per square meter was highest with 83.3 in July and lowest with 22.9 in November.",

They are non-pathogenic to mammals and comparison with evolutionary close species of trypanosomatids that develop digenetic life cycles and cause chronic severe sickness to millions of people worldwide is of outstanding interest. First, the growth kinetics is slightly faster in C. fasciculata than in Leishmania spp. Second, as L. major and L. infantum promastigotes are able to agglutinate with peanut lectin (PNA) and non-agglutinating parasites are more infective, the PNA agglutination properties were evaluated in C. fasciculata, what revealed that choanomastigotes of C. fasciculata are able to agglutinate with PNA and a non-agglutinating subpopulation can also be isolated. Consequently, the behavior in the presence of the lectin is similar. Finally, proteome analysis has revealed substantial differences in abundance of proteins involved in catabolism, redox homeostasis, intracellular signalling, and gene expression regulation. Logarithmic phase choanomastigotes of C. fasciculata over-express CACK, enzymes involved in redox homeostasis (TDR1, TryP, catalase and Fe-SOD), the translation factors eIF5a, EF1b and EF2 and most of the glycolytic enzymes catalyzing irreversible reactions and the enzymes of the non-oxidative phase of the pentose-phosphate pathway. The abundance of the translation factors (EF1a instead of EF1b) and of the enzymes involved in redox homeostasis (TryR instead of TDR1) increases again in the PNA \u00c0 subpopulation, as a difference with L. infantum.

Recently, manuscripts have been published about spatial analysis of environmental risk factors of malaria, in order to explain why malaria varies from place to place. Our primary objective was to identify the environmental variables most used in the spatial analysis of risk factors of malaria. The secondary objective was to identify geo-analytic methods and techniques, as well as geo-analytic statistics commonly related to environmental risk factors and malaria. To assess the current state of knowledge, we conducted a systematized review of articles published from January 2004 to March 2015, within Web of Science, Pubmed and Scielo databases. Initially 676 articles were found in these databases, after inclusion and exclusion criteria, were selected 41 manuscripts. Among these selected studies, precipitation, vegetation and temperature were the most frequent variables related to malaria, among others. As for geo-analytic methods, Bayesian geostatistical models were the most applied. On the other hand, Kriging interpolations, as well as Kulldorff 0 s spatial scan, were the techniques more widely used. The main objective of many studies was to use these methods and techniques to create risk maps, showing their importance. In recent years, spatial analysis performed with satellite images and georeferenced data are increasing in relevance due to the use of remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). The combination of these new technologies identifies more accurately environmental risk factors, and the use of Bayesian geostatistical models allows a wide diffusion of malaria risk maps. It is known that precipitation, temperature and vegetation play a critical role in malaria transmission; however, other environmental risk factors have also been identified. Risk maps have a tremendous potential to enhance the effectiveness of malaria-control programs.",

The relevance of our work lies in its ability to describe quantitatively a geographic stratification of the disease burden capable of reproducing important spatial differences, and drivers/controls of disease spread. Among the latter, we consider specifically the development and management of water resources which have been singled out empirically as an important risk factor for schistosomiasis. The model includes remotely acquired and objectively manipulated information on the distributions of population, infrastructure, elevation and climatic drivers. It also includes a general description of human mobility and addresses a first-order characterization of the ecology of the intermediate host of the parasite causing the disease based on maximum entropy learning of relevant environmenal covariates. Spatial patterns of the disease were analyzed about their disease-free equilibrium by proper extraction and mapping of suitable eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix subsuming all stability properties of the system. Human mobility was found to be a primary control of both pathogen invasion success and of the overall distribution of disease burden. The effects of water resources development were studied by accounting for the (prior and posterior) average distances of human settlements from water bodies that may serve as suitable habitats to the intermediate host of the parasite. Water developments, in combination with human mobility, were quantitatively related to disease spread into regions previously nearly disease-free and to largescale empirical incidence patterns. We conclude that while the model still needs refinements based on field and epidemiological evidence, the framework proposed provides a powerful tool for large-scale, long-term public health planning and management of schistosomiasis.",

Moreover, pre-requisite for elimination planning is a long term political and budgetary commitment, which is often difficult to secure in developing countries. Moreover, policy makers need solid arguments to divert resources from other priorities to leprosy. Thus, an investment case is essential to assess the social cost and benefit of elimination for informed decision making. This paper attempts to summarize the considerations, approach and challenges in building an investment case for leprosy. Results A rich literature is available on epidemiology and socioeconomic burden of leprosy, describing epidemiological challenges and limitation of disability weights, while calculating disease burden. Next, results from several clinical trials suggests that post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is an effective and feasible strategy for elimination. The national leprosy programs of chief epidemic countries are slow in transitioning into elimination mode after achieving control.

As a start, we searched systematic reviews for eligible studies and we are building a pilot version of the database, using approximately 4700 individual data donated by the authors of 15 praziquantel trials. Based on those 3 reviews, we identified 52 studies (including trials and epidemiological studies) published after 2000, which correspond to~20 000 individual patient data.

We will present the review of eligible studies, the pilot database and the outcome of the ongoing stakeholders' consultation. Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease for which more than a billion people in 72 countries are thought to be at risk. At a global level, the efforts against LF are designed as an elimination programme. However, current efforts appear to aim for elimination in some but not all endemic areas. With the 2020 goal of elimination looming, we set out to develop plausible scale-up scenarios to reach elimination and eradication. We predict the duration of mass drug administration (MDA) necessary to reach local elimination for a variety of transmission archetypes using an existing model of lymphatic filariasis transmission, estimate the number of treatments required for each scenario, and consider implications of rapid scale-up. We have defined four scenarios that differ in their geographic coverage and rate of scale-up. For each scenario, country-specific simulations and calculations were performed that took into account the pre-intervention transmission intensity, the different vector genera, drug regimen, achieved level of population coverage, previous progress towards elimination, and programmatic delays due to mapping and administration. Our results indicate that eliminating LF by 2020 is uncertain. If MDA programmes are drastically scaled up and expanded, the final round of MDA for LF eradication could be delivered by 2029 after 4.159 billion treatments. However, if the current rate of scale up is maintained, the final round of MDA may not occur until 2050. While our analysis indicates that rapid scale up of MDA will decrease the amount of time and treatments required to reach eradication, it may also propel the programme towards success, as the risk of failure is likely to increase with increased programme duration.",

The main focus of this work was to understand in detail how and when the resistance of S. mansoni against host serum factors arises. We therefore employed an established in vitro assay in which cercariae are mechanically transformed into and cultivated as skin and lung schistosomulae (also called 'newly transformed schistosomulae' (NTS)). Up to now, the viability of NTS depended on media containing fetal-calf serum (FCS) and therefore serum factors. We advanced this system to serum-free condition allowing us to add different host-sera and serum components under well-defined conditions.",

In contrast serum of in-bred C57BL/6 and outbred NMRI mice efficiently killed the NTS within 5 days. Further, addition of mouse serum into survival-propagating conditions also induced NTS-killing which could point towards the presence of active component(s) within mouse serum. With sera from other species we could observe either the improved maturation (i.e. swine) or killing phenotype (i.e. rhesus monkey) in different degrees.",

Even greater expansion is required to achieve the coverage and morbidity reduction targets set for 2020. A crucial tool in this scale-up will be the ability to monitor the impact of control programmes. Specifically, being able to identify areas not responding to treatment as expected will allow adjustments to be made to the programme design and help ensure their longer-term success. However, to date, there are very few tools available that would allow the identification of such areas whilst at the same time being user-friendly. An STH Markov model developed at the World Health Organization (WHO) used data from Vietnam to predict changes in STH prevalence following successive rounds of deworming treatment. In addition, a user-friendly interface was also developed to help ensure the model is used as widely as possible by programme managers. Data collected by the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and its country partners from several countries in sub-Saharan Africa have enabled the validation of this model for STH infection, its extension to include schistosomiasis infection, and the addition of robust confidence intervals around the predicted changes in prevalence. It is hoped that the output of this model could potentially provide an early warning of where treatment campaigns are not achieving their aims (for example due to poor coverage, adherence, or putative resistance) and enable programme managers to make the necessary changes to meet the expected targets. The performance of the model will be discussed, with particular reference to the utility of stratifying the model outputs by parasite species, location, underlying endemicity, and host age. In addition, we will discuss the results of a model comparison exercise between the predictive capacity of the Markov model and other models currently available.",

Pathogenesis of BU is mediated primarily by the macrolide toxin mycolactone, which destroys the host tissues at the site of infection. While traditionally surgery has dominated the clinical management of BU, the introduction of the effective dual antibiotic therapy greatly improved treatment and reduced recurrence rates. However extensively ulcerated lesions often persist after successful therapy and wound management remains a challenge, in particular in rural areas of the African countries which carry the highest burden of disease. For reasons not fully understood, wound healing is delayed in a proportion of antibiotic treated BU patients. Therefore, we have performed immunohistochemical investigations to identify markers which may be suitable to monitor wound healing progression. Tissue specimens from BU plaque patients were collected before, during and after chemotherapy and were analysed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of a set of markers associated with connective tissue neo-formation, and epidermal activation. Several target proteins turned out to be suitable to monitor wound healing. a-SMA positive myofibroblasts only emerged during the healing process and were present in large quantities at the end of chemotherapy. These cells produced extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen-1 and tenascin and were present in fibronectin rich areas. After successful antibiotic treatment many cells, including myofibroblasts, revealed an activated phenotype as they showed ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation initiation. Increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermal skin layer indicated a stronger involvement of the epidermal layer than expected.Here we identified a set of marker that allow monitoring of wound healing in antibiotic treated BU lesions by immunohistochemistry [1] . Further studies with this marker panel may help to better understand disturbances responsible for wound healing delays observed in some BU patients. Background and Objective Toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide distributed parasite that can infect the central nervous system of warm-blooded animals, including humans. The infection is acquired mainly by eating food or water contaminated with oocysts excreted by cats, or tissue cysts of T. gondii in under-cooked meat. The most common clinical form of human toxoplasmosis is lymphadenitis but the major clinical problem of toxoplasmosis is congenital infection of fetuses, resulting from primary infection during pregnancy, as well as ocular toxoplasmosis and the reactivated form in immunocompromised patients. T. gondii is a main cause of abortion in TORCH syndrome and therefore, one of the most important infection agents causing the abortion and congenital abnormalities in the human. The aim of this study was determining the prevalence of T. gondii antibodies and oocyst shedding in a population of stray cats in Khorramabad city, capital of Lorestan province, west of Iran.",

Disease diagnosis on clinical basis alone can be misleading, requiring definitive diagnosis based on laboratory tests. Resource constraints in BU endemic areas make microscopy for the detection of acid fast bacilli (AFB) an important and useful method. It is rapid, user-friendly, convenient and cheap. Despite its usefulness, its performance is relatively low. This study investigated modifications of the current method aimed at improving its performance. Forty (IS) 2404 polymerase chain reactions (PCR) positive BU samples were processed by eight physical (centrifugation & overnight sedimentation) and chemical (phenol ammonium sulphate and sodium hypochlorite) modifications of the current direct method. Assessments were based on standard AFB evaluation coupled with in house criteria; positivity (P), clarity and contrast (C) release of bacilli from specimen (R). Overall AFB positivity rate was 64% (409/640). Each protocol had 80 smears. The percentage positivity (P) for the conventional method was 58% (46/80) smears. The highest positivity rate of 57/80 (%) was by protocol 7 (5% phenol in 4% ammonium sulphate (PhAS) and concentrated by overnight gravitational sedimentation. The least positivity rate at 35% (28/80) was by protocol 1 (smears from direct application of swab tips). Differences in performance between the two chemical tested; 5% phenol in 4% ammonium sulphate (PhAS) and 3.5% NaHOCl was significant (P < 0.05). The differences between the two physical methods were however not significant (P > 0.05). This study concluded that BU samples treated with a solution of 5% phenol in 4% ammonium sulphate and concentrated by either centrifugation or overnight sedimentation are useful for maximizing AFB detection by bright field microscopy. This can be useful in rural health facilities with resource constraints.",

Whereas lesions of 108/129 patients (83.7%) were completely healed, 22 patients (17.1%) had complications. 15 patients (11.6%) presented with various degrees of functional limitations (classified in\u00b0I, n = 8;\u00b0II, n = 4 and\u00b0III, n = 3); among these, two patients developed secondary lesions (1.6%,\u00b0I; one of them with initial multiple lesions). Seven patients (5.4%) with multiple [n = 3 (2.3%)] and secondary lesions [n = 4 (3.1%)] had no functional limitations, but healing disorders with prolonged healing times up to 26 months. Microbiological analysis of clinical samples from 6 patients with secondary lesions did not reveal M. ulcerans DNA. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from two patients (MRSA, n = 1), in 4 cases the etiology of secondary lesions remained unclear. In this study cohort, main risk factors for complications were category III lesions (especially ulcers affecting joints), duration of disease before initiation of treatment of >7 months, delayed healing times of >8 months as well as distance from the reference treatment center CHR.",

Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans; it can affect indiscriminately male and female of different ages and it is typically found in rural areas close to water bodies. Although risk factors for BU such as proximity to water, not wearing protective clothing and poor wound care have been identified, the mode of transmission and the natural reservoir of M. ulcerans remain under investigation.Following a district-wide survey for BU in the Bankim District of the Adamawa Region of Cameroon in early 2010, we locally established a disease surveillance system and continuously monitored the occurrence of new BU cases in the entire Map e Dam region over 5 years. The collection of clinical information and details regarding the origin of all the patients notified, allowed us to longitudinally study the epidemiology of BU in the area. From March 2010 until the end of 2014, 142 laboratory re-confirmed cases of BU were registered in the area. As previously reported from this and other BU endemic areas, the incidence of BU was highest in young teenagers and in adults above the age of 50 while in children below 5 years the incidence is low. Male and female were equally represented among the cases and the majority of the reported patients had ulcerative lesions on the lower limbs. Analysis of the geographic distribution of the households and farms where the patients lived and worked prior to the onset of the BU symptoms, revealed an evolution of the spatial distribution of BU cases over time with a decrease of cases in the proximity of the Map e Dam, while there was a continuous presence of BU cases along the Mbam river.The BU surveillance system we established in the Map e Dam has allowed us to continuously monitor the population living in that area, resulting in a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of BU in the area over the last 5 years.",

Requena-Mendez 2 1 Centre for Tropical Diseases, Hospital Sacro Cuore -Don Calabria, Negrar, Italy; 2 ISGlobal, Barcelona Centre for International Health, Barcelona, Spain Introduction In the last decades, Chagas disease (CD) has become a public health threat even outside Latin America, as a consequence of migration and travel. Around 8 million people are estimated to be affected around the world and Europe is the second continent after the Americas for CD burden. CD is considered 'emerging' because of the novelty of its recognition in non-endemic countries (NECs) where healthcare workers are generally unaware of it and also because it is a chronic disease, mainly a-or pauci-symptomatic, potentially life-threatening and diffusive. CD can be mainly transmitted in NECs through blood donation, transplants and vertically. Many efforts have been made in European countries to control CD. Our aim is to give a perspective of the current epidemiology of CD in Europe and to summarize the state-of-the-art of control strategies. Results In Europe, the response to CD has been late and inappropriate. This contributed to the current scenario (between 14 000 and 180 000 cases are estimated with an incidence per 100 000 inhabitants of 20-30 for Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland and 307 for Spain). In comparison with the past, some European countries have set up programs at different level to control CD. The WHO inspired this process through the 'NEC initiative'. Only six European countries have produced specific official directives to increase safety of blood transfusion. Concerning transplantation, no governmental legislation exists but in some countries recommendations of the national transplant agencies. Regarding congenital transmission, only a few regions in Spain and one in Italy have adopted systematic screening. Diagnostic tools and trypanocidal drugs are not universally available in Europe.",

Few studies highlighting the magnitude of NCD multimorbidity from secondary data sources have explored limited number of chronic diseases. We undertook a study to assess the prevalence, pattern, correlates and outcomes of multimorbidity in public and private primary care settings in India. The present abstract describes the process of development and validation of our data collection tool 'Multimorbidity Assessment Protocol (MAP)'. The MAP questionnaire included sections namelysocio-demographic information (age, sex, residence, ethnicity, religion, education, marital status, family income); multimorbidity assessment (information on whether the patient had ever been told by a physician or diagnosed with any of the listed chronic health problems; severity assessment comprising current use of treatment and functional limitation. For each of the reported chronic health problems patients were asked on how much the particular health problem gets in the way of daily activities (e.g.: not at all, a little, or a great deal), number of visits or outpatient consultations in last 1 year, past and current use of medication and inpatient admissions if any. Multimorbidity outcomes were assessed through self-rated physical and mental health and health related quality of life (using SF 12). We adopted iterative approach to prepare the contextualized list of chronic diseases. First, a free list of chronic diseases was prepared by extensive review of prevalence studies. This then further was revised with a chart review of both private and public hospitals. It was then shared with a panel of primary care physicians and refined. The translated instrument was then cognitively tested with 12 non-sampled patients for comprehensibility. Then the questionnaire was pretested with 80 non-study patients and test retest reliability coefficient was calculated. These patients were re-administered the questionnaire after 2 weeks. The validated questionnaire was administered to 1649 patients across 20 public and private primary care facilities.",

Currently, there is increasing interest in using the natural compounds for early prevention of osteoporosis. Thus, the natural compound that has beneficial effect to promote osteoblast formation and function is promising to be candidate using as an osteoporosis-preventing agent. Andrographolide, the major compound of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f) Nees, exhibits various pharmacological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulator which has been used extensively for the treatment of many inflammatory disorders. According to these biological effects, we therefore aimed to investigate the osteogenic effect of Andrographolide in osteoblast cells using mouse preosteoblastic (MC3T3-E1) cells. In growth medium, Andrographolide increased MC3T3-E1 proliferation, and it accelerated osteoblast differentiation in the differentiation medium, as indicated by the increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteoblastspecific (ALP) mRNA production at 7-21 days. Subsequently, Andrographolide accelerated production of bone structural genes, including collagen type I alpha I (COL1A1) and osteocalcin. It was supported by the increased bone mineralization of detected by alizarin red staining. In conclusion, Andrographolide effectively promotes osteoblast proliferation, differentiation and mineralization. In conclusion, the osteogenic effect of Andrographolide may have clinical relevance for prevention or treatment bone disease as well as osteoporosis.",

General and specific awareness campaigns lead to significant changes of social representations for both population and DH professionals. The start of MHPs activities inside DH coincided with ever increasing demand for MH care. The development of these new practices for DH' practitioners enhanced the recognition of the specific role of the MHPs. The joint training, the shared daily experiences and the regular meeting offered to the MHPs the basis to develop a strong professional identity as well as the feeling to belong to a same group with specific role and competences.

Therefore, motivation to change behavior towards a healthy lifestyle, and giving up risky behaviour is linked to selfassessment of the current state of health. For example smoking cessation occurred when one's health deteriorated significantly, as the satisfaction with health declined. Otherwise smoking was not given up, although the harmful impact of smoking on health was understood. It means that a healthy lifestyle is not associated in the perception of people with future health. It was found that risky behaviour does not only cause well-known harm to health, but may also have positive aspects specific to each individual. 51.9% of smokers relieve stress by smoking and 27.9% of respondents who want to change their diet still enjoy eating 'tasty' and 'unhealthy' food.",

The results suggest that hypertension control can be impacted at community level by the way in which health care services are operationalized at micro level (i.e. in specific health areas).",

Qualitative exploration showed that salt was thought to be integral part of all foods and any food where salt was added to was considered salty. There was no perception about naturally occurring salt in any food source. There was a prevalent perception that unrefined salt was more harmful compared to refined salt.

Throughout the world, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most popular material for packaging, accounting for >99% of all beverage bottles. Previous studies demonstrated that PET bottles can release harmful chemicals such as the diethyl ester of phthalic acid (DEP). This compound not used directly in the PET production, but as non-intentionally added substances during the manufacturing of PET, may come from a wide variety of sources. Adverse effects of exposure to DEP on fertility parameters and development are considered relevant to humans, especially within a critical window of development. Data from animal studies indicate that DEP is rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral or inhalation exposure, with 100% bioavailability by these routes. This contaminated food event caused shock and panic among the general public and bottled water safety becomes a controversial issue. So, the purpose of this study was: 1 to evaluate the intake of DEP from drinking bottled water and health risk assessment; and 2 to assess the contribution of the bottled water to the DEP intake against on tolerable daily intake values.",

But, when comparing the DEP concentration with the initial level, the results demonstrated that the release of phthalates were not substantial in all storage conditions especially at low temperatures (<25\u00b0C) and freezing conditions. The daily intake of DEP from bottled water was much lower than that reference value. However, the lowest MOE was estimated for high water consumers (children) but, the MOE was much higher than 1000, thus, low risk is implied.

Consumers are worried about the exposure to bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) as a carcinogen that can occur during consumer use of merchandises such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottled water. PET has become the plastic packaging of choice for many food products, particularly beverages like bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. Moreover, many questions have been raised about possible migration of chemicals from the bottles and exposure to contaminants through bottled water consumption. Many studies reported the presence of hazardous substance such as DEHP in bottled water that may pose health risk to consumers. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) divides DEHP as a probable human carcinogen (Group 2B). The present study aims at assessing DEHP concentration in six brands of bottled water consumed in common storage conditions [40\u00b0C, room temperature, refrigerator temperature, freezing conditions (0 and \u00c018\u00b0C) and outdoor]. Eventually, we associated potential carcinogenic health risks from PETbottled water consumption in pregnant and lactating women. The analytical procedure was based on gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). The excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) due to water consumption was calculated in all storage conditions. We found that high temperatures are likely to increase the release of DEHP from PET-bottles into the water but the levels of these compounds in bottled water were found to be very low. The estimated intake to DEHP in the worse condition was 0.05 and 0.08 lg/kg/day in pregnant and lactating women, respectively. Finally, a negligible carcinogenic risk of 1 9 10 \u00c06 for DEHP was observed in lactating women due to consumption bottled water stored in worst condition (40\u00b0C). Our results prove that the estimated exposure to DEHP via consumption of PET-bottled water was very low.

Although the involvement of genetic abnormalities in autism is well-accepted, recent studies point to an equal contribution by environmental factors, particularly environmental neurotoxic compounds. However, the identity of specific environmental chemicals such as phthalate esters that influence autism risk remains elusive. Phthalates are manmade chemicals used globally in production of commercial and industrial goods. Due to their widespread use, phthalates are ubiquitous in the environment. Exposure to phthalates can occur through ingestion, inhalation, intravenous, or dermal exposure over the life. This paper systematically reviews published evidence on associations between prenatal and/or childhood exposure to phthalate and autism. Studies were identified from a systematic literature search of Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science prior to February 2015. This comprehensive bibliographic search among the total of 2342 articles identified four independent studies which were deemed relevant for further review. Among the four retrieved human studies, from different countries, two were case-control in design, while the other two studies were cohort studies, with using different valid measure of autism diagnosis. In included studies, exposure was mainly measured by determining phthalate exposure biomarkers in urine while the main instruments used to determination the urinary concentration of phthalate metabolites were somewhat different. Through the four studies investigated in this review, we deemed that only one study illustrated high quality using the criteria outlined. The other studies were of medium methodological quality. All of this research has a number of methodological limitations regarding outcome-exposure assessment and confounding factors analysis and control. The paucity of evidence different timing of urine collection, measurement instruments and health endpoints across studies may account for different results.This survey demonstrates that there is insufficient research on the possible association of prenatal and postnatal phthalates exposure and autism. Therefore, there is a need to carry out large, well-designed prospective cohort studies which both taken into account relevant pre-, peri-and neonatal confounders and characterization of exposure.",

In the immediate future, reuse is expected to contribute significantly in the minimization of environmental problems arising from the disposal of wastewater effluents on land and in aquatic recipients. The monitoring of a series of factors, related to the disposal of outflows on land, e.g. the detailed determination of meteorological, geological, soil, and microbiological parameters, will allow the safe reuse of municipal wastewater in agriculture, in urban centers, and the restoration of marginal areas. The data obtained so far, reveal the necessity of treated municipal wastewater (TMWW) reuse in the Mediterranean region, due to the dominant xerothermic conditions. Nevertheless, the long-term application of TMWW reuse enhances the possibility of the accumulation of heavy metals, toxic compounds, pesticides, and other xenobiotics in soil and plants, inducing adverse effects on human health and the environment. Consequently, the reuse practice should be applied in a controlled manner. In Greece, TMWW and sewage sludge are reused in agriculture and in reforestation.",

In analyzes these policies in light of social determinants that have shaped 30 years of maternal outcomes including the prevalence of live births, maternal deaths, sterilizations, IUDs, and abortions at single district hospital in Ladakh. It considers why this hospital has witnessed both a steady increase in deliveries and abortions, as well as a more recent and precipitous decline in abortions in response to a climate of pronatalism among Buddhist and Muslim communities that perpetuates fear and intimidation around abortion in particular. It concludes that a broader definition of pregnancy-related death that includes maternal suicide and recognizes the role of access to abortion and family planning is critical to the analysis of maternal mortality in India today.",

The male factor is responsible for 23% of couple infertility. A relationship between the human papilloma viral infections and male reproductive health is of importance to both theoretical and practical medicine. Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the most frequently sexually transmitted viruses and etiological agents of several human cancers. This infection in men is also a problem for partners Controversial results of the role of HPV in infertile population on sperm parameters have been published. The aim of this study was to determine the role of HPV infection on sperm function and male infertility. Results HPVs are agents of the most common sexually transmitted disease and can lead to warts and cancers both in men and women. A high incidence of HPV infection has been demonstrated in sperm from sexually active men with and without risk factors for HPV and from infertile patients. Semen infection is associated to an impairment of sperm parameters suggesting a possible role in male infertility. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that when HPV is present in semen only a percentage of total cells are infected and the virus can be localized in sperm or in exfoliated cells with different impact on sperm motility. Moreover, infected sperm are able to penetrate the oocyte, to deliver HPV genome in the oocyte and HPV genes can be actively transcribed by the fertilized oocyte. Recently an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been demonstrated in couples undergoing in-vitro fertilization and particularly when HPV DNA was present in semen samples of male partners.",

Ecological research was considered to be in line with the countries' development priorities in agriculture and environment and there is available scientific technologies in the country for its implementation. Molecular nutrition research was regarded as very costly to implement, had ethical dilemmas and was therefore the least appraised. Malaria is a common disease among pregnant women and children. The pathological effect of malaria has been attributed to changes in the lipid profile and oxidative stress during the infection.This work studied the role of malaria infection on the lipid profile and oxidative stress in children. 240 children within the age range 0-5 years were enrolled for this study; 170 were malaria positive while 70 were malaria negative (Control). Those who were malaria positive were grouped into two based on the level of parasitaemia. Those who had more than 100 000 parasitaemia were grouped as severe infection, while those who had <100 000 parasitaemia were grouped under mild infection. Level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the control than in the severe and mild groups, while the HDL level was not significantly higher in the mild group than in the severe group. There was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the total protein in the control and mild group compared to the severe group. The low density lipoprotein, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly reduced in the control and mild group when compared with the severe group. The significant increase (P < 0.05) in MDA and decrease in SOD and GSPX levels were recorded in the severe and mild groups when compared with the control group.

The main objective of the study is to make a normative assessment of program management of acute malnutrition among children 6-59 months in this region. More specifically, the implementation of the activities, program coverage, the results for participants and populational prevalence of acute malnutrition have been documented and compared to national guidelines. Results Overall, the implementation of program activities is suboptimal. The main issues identified relate to shortages, lack of training and recognition of the various stakeholders, and a lack of coordination between the villages and the health center. Program coverage is alarming, with a rate of just 7.0% of participation and dropout rate of 71%. Outcomes for program participants are satisfactory, with a 73.9% cure rate excluding dropouts.

The increased pathogenic potential of these strains has been attributed to overproduction of toxins and fluoroquinolone resistance. During a C. difficile nosocomial outbreak in Costa Rica, a strain was found to induce a distinct cytopathic effect (CPE), different from the canonical arborizing CPE. The strain was further identified as a NAP1 isolate (NAP1 V ) of the hypervirulent clade II that harbored a silent mutation in the gyrA gene. After toxin purification, cells treated with TcdB of the NAP1 V strain (TcdB V ), displayed a rounded and surface detached phenotype, resembling that induced by C. difficile TcdB toxin A-negative strains. The effect mediated by the TcdB V was due to differences in substrate preferences that resulted in different glucosylation patterns of the various GTPases. Whereas TcdB from classical NAP1/027 strains glucosylated RhoA, Rac and Cdc42, TcdB V did not used RhoA as substrate and displayed less affinity for Cdc42. Sequence comparison of the functional domains of TcdBv with other C. difficile strains along with comparative genomic analysis revealed that TcdBv is a NAP1 toxin but with modifications within the enzymatic domain. The enzymatic domain is identical to that of a NAP9/017 strains (A-B+). We also provide evidence that the NAP1 strains glucosylate a broader spectrum of GTPases in vitro as both toxins glucosylated Rap and R-Ras. These findings provide insight into the role of the glucosyltranferase activity in the pathogenesis of C. difficile variant TcdB strains and the hypervirulent NAP1 strains.",

However, clinically diagnosed cases represent only a small proportion of the total number of real infected people. For these reasons, extended ultrasound (US) surveys on human populations are needed to quantify asymptomatic carriers and permit a global and a real estimation of the burden due to CE. Such efforts are crucial to assess, compare and prioritize interventions in limited resource settings. Conclusions Collection of accurate epidemiological and clinical data will give a reliable picture of the burden of this disease in Eastern Europe, providing a statistically supported case series for future evaluation of efficacy and effectiveness of interventions. This will be the largest US survey on CE from a single community-based study. Opisthorchiasis is caused by the food-borne trematode Opisthorchis viverrini and affects more than 8 million people in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam. The disease causes hepatomegaly, cholangitis and cholangocarcinoma. Praziquantel is the sole drug available to treat the disease. Tribendimidine is a novel anthelminthic, approved for human use by Chinese authorities since 2004. It displays an efficacy against O. viverrini comparable to praziquantel.

In the village of Mvolo 1 in 6 children presented with epilepsy and 1 in 2 families had at least one child with epilepsy. The NS epidemic in South Sudan started around 1990 and is ongoing. NS and other forms of epilepsy were frequently observed in the same families. Ivermectin coverage in South Sudan has always been very low. In northern Uganda the NS epidemic started around 2000. Before 2009 there was no access to ivermectin but in contrast with South Sudan today the NS epidemic has stopped. Since 2012 there has been a sharp decrease in the number of new NS cases following the biannual distribution of ivermectin and larviciding the main rivers in the affected area. In the DRC, a house to house survey conducted in Titule revealed 67 (2.3%) epilepsy cases among 2908 people interviewed. Epilepsy cases were clustered in families, persons with epilepsy were more likely to live close to a river and a history of ivermectin use protected against epilepsy. A case control study including 59 cases with epilepsy and 61 healthy controls showed that, daily bathing in local rivers was an important risk factor for epilepsy (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.19-7.93).",

This could indicate a knowledge gap in our understanding of the transmission dynamics including the importance of environmental contamination with T. solium eggs. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with porcine cysticercosis using a case-control study design, utilising known information on persistent or multiple infections of porcine cysticercosis. Questionnaire interviews and observational surveys were conducted in July 2014 in the two districts Mbeya and Mbozi, Tanzania. Study households were identified based on participation in a previous study investigating porcine cysticercosis prevalence at multiple time points, and allocated into cases or controls based on porcine cysticercosis presence or absence, respectively. This resulted in 43 farmers in the case group and 50 farmers in the control group from 20 villages. Potato peels were said to be given to pigs either raw or boiled by 46% of the farmers. Based on logistic regression porcine cysticercosis could be associated with absence or a completely open latrine (P = 0.035, OR 5.98, CI: 1.33-43.02) compared to an enclosed latrine, and feeding potato peels to pigs (P = 0.007, OR 3.45, CI: 1.43-8.79). Logistic analysis including management indicated pigs kept in elevated pens (P = 0.049, OR 5.33, CI: 1.08-32.27) and on earthen floors (P = 0.041, OR 9.87, CI: 1.29-114.55) compared to cemented floors, were more likely to be infected. Whether potato peels are contaminated with Taenia eggs, or whether the contamination is from the water used, or from dirty hands, in the process of peeling the potatoes, need to be confirmed. The results obtained in this study are strengthened by the case-control design, which is unique for porcine cysticercosis related surveys, and suggests that blocking transmission to pigs will require management and feeding addressed in greater detail.",

There was still no conclusion whether individual or pooled should be selected. Therefore, this study was aimed to compare an individual and pooled plasma based on the number of differential expressed plasma protein (potential biomarkers), cost effectiveness, and time consuming by using LC-MS/MS. The cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) plasma (20 Opisthorchis viverrini related cholangiocarcinoma) and non-CCA plasma (10 O. viverrini infected patients and 10 healthy volunteer) were analyzed by gel based LC-MS/MS (GelC-MS/MS). The pooled non-cholangiocarcinoma plasma (pNCCA) was prepared by mixing 1 lg of each 10 OV and 10 HV while the pooled cholangiocarcinoma plasma (pCCA) was prepared by mixing 1 lg of each 20 CCA. Either individual or pooled plasma was size separated by SDS-PAGE, sliced into 29 gel pieces. Among these, 20 of 29 gel pieces (9 pieces of albumin were removed) were subjected to GeLC-MS/ MS (800 gel pieces of individual and 40 gel pieces for pooled analysis). The results showed 4173 plasma proteins were identified from individual analysis (average 5.22 proteins/gel piece) and 1587 plasma proteins from pooled analysis (39.7 proteins/ gel piece). Among these identified plasma proteins based on three fold differential expression, 74 and 59 proteins were identified from individual and pool, respectively. For individual analysis, 6 and 21 proteins were specifically presented only in non-CCA and CCA, respectively while 21 and 33 proteins were specifically presented only in pNCCA and pCCA, respectively. The estimate cost/identified potential biomarker was 203 US dollar for individual plasma and 12 US dollar for pooled plasma. Pooled plasma was less time consuming than individual plasma by 190 h or nearly 8 days continuously analyzed by LC-MS/MS (15 min/shot or gel slice). In conclusion, pooled plasma is recommended for identifying a novel O. viverrini related CCA biomarker. According to this result, identification of other cancer biomarker from pooled plasma might also be recommended due to the cost effectiveness, shorter time and higher number of identified potential biomarker aspects.",

Multivariate regression models revealed significant higher odds of an infection with intestinal parasite for urban farmers compared to the other groups. Helminthiasis is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in low and middle-income countries. Helminth eggs adhere to different surfaces, e.g. soil particles, hands, particles in water, but also laboratory utensils. Despite these characteristics which have direct implications on egg transmission, little is known about the adhesion properties of helminth eggs. The aim of this study was to estimate the detachment of adhered Ascaris suum eggs from PVC plastic and glass surfaces by flushing the surfaces with different solutions. The experiments were performed with perfusion chambers mounted on a surface with adhering A. suum eggs (1000 eggs deposited with 10 ll of water), and then flushed with ddH 2 O at a flow velocity of 10 ml/min (shear stress of 0.67 Pa). Each experiment ran for 30 min, and the number of eggs removed was enumerated every 5 min. Different factors of importance to egg detachment was tested, such as drying time of eggs to the surface (0 and 1.5 h) and subsequent soaking time (0.5 and 1 h) of the eggs dried for 1 h inside the chamber with different solutions (ddH 2 O, Benzethonium chloride 1%, 0.5 M NaOH, and 5 M NaOH) before flushing. The preliminary results showed that all freshly deposited eggs (drying time 0) were detached from both PVC and glass surfaces already after 5 min of flushing. For eggs dried on a surface for 1.5 h (where all the water containing the eggs had just evaporated), only soaking in NaOH resulted in detachment of eggs after 30 min. After soaking in 5 M NaOH for 0.5 h the detachment of eggs from plastic was 76% and from glass 63%, whereas after soaking for 1 h the detachment of eggs from plastic was 100% and from glass 83%. In conclusion, A. suum eggs showed a very strong adherence towards the surfaces tested, and only freshly deposited eggs or eggs soaked in a strong NaOH solution resulted in complete detachment of eggs from surfaces after flushing for 30 min.",

Several Paragonimus species are ende-mic in Japan, e.g. P. westermani, P. miyazaki and P. ohirai. Intron sequence is proven to be the potential molecular marker for population genetics study in many organisms. Then this current study aims to characterize the third intron sequence in domain 1 (D1int3) of phosphagen kinase (PK) gene of Paragonimus spp. in Japan for implication of genetic diversity investigation. Ten individual adult worms of each three species of Paragonimus, i.e. P. westermani, P. miyazaki and P. ohirai were examined herein. Several intron domains of PK gene of Paragonimus were amplified and screened for the nucleotide variations. Of these, intron domain 3 (Intron 3) is successfully amplified in all three species. It showed high variations within P. westermani with 62 variable nucleotide sites, whereas low level of variation was observed within P. miyasaki and P. ohirai at 4 and 10 variable sites, respectively. Moreover, heterozygous locus was observed in P. westermani and P. ohirai. Haplotype analysis found that 15, 6, and 5 haplotypes were detected in P. westermani, P. miyazaki and P. ohirai, in total, respectively. However, the haplotype network and phylogenetic tree constructed by using the intron 3 sequences demonstrated that P. westermani was separated into two distinct lineages and closely clustered with a monophyletic group of P. miyazsaki. The finding in this study suggested that the intron 3 sequence of PK gene is suitable for the population genetic study in P. westermani and P. ohirai and it would also be a potential marker for phylogenetic study of the Paragonimus spp. in endemic areas including Japan. Introduction Taeniasis/Cysticercosis complex is endemic in many low-and middle-income countries of the world. Due to increased travels and immigration, cysticercosis may be diagnosed also in non-endemic areas as in Spain. In taeniasis, eggs identification allows the diagnosis of Taenia tapeworm carriers, and proglottids morphological analysis, if they are well preserved, permits the taeniid species-specifc determination. For treatment of taeniasis, it is relevant to detect unambiguously the Taenia solium patients. Since, PCR is a good alternative to ascertain between T. solium and T. saginata, we evaluated the limit of detection and usefulness of the two repetitive DNA sequences, HDP2 and pTsol9, using conventional and real time PCRs.",

Whereas the first GBD studies triggered fervent discussions about the accuracy of basic modelling input and output data, conceptual issues and project governance, the more recent GBD 2010 study evoked less controversy.

The presented work aims at revitalising some of these fundamental discussions, thereby promoting the search for future improvements. Results Mainly due to the scarcity of suitable input data, differences in estimation methods, conceptual flaws and communication problems, current global burden estimates for FBT vary from 0.7 to 3.6 million DALYs.

Intestinal parasites have been shown to be associated to leptin concentration and food intake in animal models; however information about this association in humans is lacking. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the association between intestinal parasite infections with serum leptin concentration in school-aged children from a rural area in Queretaro, Mexico. A total 291 children (8 AE 1.2 year) participated in the study. Body fat percentage was measured by DXA; high body fat for girls was considered above 30% and above 25% for boys. Serum leptin concentrations were determined by ELISA from a fasting blood sample. Infections with soil transmit-ted helminths and/or with protozoa were diagnosed by stool microscopy. ANCOVA was used to determine differences in leptin concentration between non-infected, infected and co-infected children. The prevalence of intestinal parasite infection was 62%; 14% of the children had co-infections (i.e. more than one parasite). Among girls with a normal percentage of body fat, those with parasitic co-infections had higher serum concentrations of leptin (2.10 AE 2.23 lg/l) than mono-infected (1.56 AE 1.51 lg/l) and non-infected girls (1.33 AE 1.45 lg/l) (P = 0.02). In contrast, co-infected girls with a high percentage of body fat had lower leptin concentrations (3.76 AE 1.53 lg/l) than mono-infected (4.12 AE 2.15 lg/l) and non-infected girls (5.6 AE 2.6 lg/l) (P = 0.03). No differences in leptin concentration were found between (co)parasitized and non-parasitized boys. In summary, we found an association between parasitic (co)-infections and serum leptin concentrations, and the results suggest that this association is gender-and body fat-dependent. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathways that may be involved and to assess a causal relationship.",

Cringoli Department of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Productions, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy Faecal egg count (FEC) techniques are common approaches for the diagnosis of soil transmitted helminths (hookworms, ascarids, trichurids). FEC are widely used to measure the prevalence and intensity of infections for epidemiological surveys, to quantify the efficacy of chemotherapy, and to detect anthelmintic resistance. Mini-FLOTAC combined with Fill-FLOTAC was tailored for epidemiological monitoring and surveillance, where large numbers of faecal samples must be rapidly, yet reliably examined. Mini-FLOTAC is based on two components (the base and the reading disc) and includes two 1-ml flotation chambers (total volume = 2 ml). Fill-FLOTAC is a disposable sampling kit, which consists of a container, a collector and a filter, thus facilitating the performance of the first four consecutive steps of the Mini-FLOTAC technique, i.e. sample collection and weighing, homogenisation, filtration and filling. Results of recent studies in different settings of Europe, Africa, Asia and southern America demonstrated that Mini-FLOTAC is a sensitive and accurate technique for detecting and counting STH eggs. Advantages and disadvantages of Mini-FLOTAC compared with standard methods recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the diagnosis of STHs are discussed including the strategies of preserving and pooling stool faecal samples.",

In pursue of these efforts, WHO created OCP in West Africa in 1974. Vector control was later combined with treatment of eligible populations with ivermectin when the drug was registered for onchocerciasis in 1987 and made available for the treatment of the people in endemic communities. In 1994, APOC was launched and adopted a strategy of Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI). APOC targeted CDTI to hyperendemic onchocerciasis areas in African countries not covered by the OCP. Assessments of ivermectine treatment coverage and disease prevalence were carried out to verify that coverage was at least 65% and to assess the decrease in community microfilarial load and the prevalence of onchocerciasis infection respectively.

Booth School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University, Thornaby, UK Geohelminth infections represent a significant threat to public health in countries of the tropics and sub-tropics. Co-infections of geohelminth species are common. Mass Drug Administration (MDA) programmes based on the principle of 'preventive chemotherapy' with broad-spectrum anthelmintics such as albendazole are widely used to reduce the burden of disease. Whilst treatment with a broad spectrum antelmintic may quickly reduce the faecal egg count of several co-infecting species, there may be a residual burden of infection of one or more species as assessed in short-term follow-up surveys. The underlying factors for lack of efficacy have not been comprehensively described. One issue that may play a role is co-infections with other species that are susceptible to the same medicine. In this analysis, data several studies were re-analysed to assess the degree of association between hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura pre-and post-treatment. The results suggest that the potential impact of MDA programmes that use a single treatment regimen in all circumstances may need re-evaluation.",

Indoplaborhis exustus is a freshwater snail found across India, central Asia through Southeast Asia as well as Arabia and Africa. It is medically and economically important, and could transmit several species of Schistosoma which infect cattle and cause reduced livestock productivity. In addition, other medically important parasitic trematodes, e.g. Echinostome, also use this snail as intermediate host. Then present study aims to explore the genetic diversity of I. exustus distributed throughout Southeast Asia. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) was used as molecular marker in this study. 413 specimens of I. exustus were naturally collected from 11 different localities in Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and the Philippines. Another 46 specimens from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were examined as outside region comparison. High genetic diversity was observed in Southeast Asian isolates. At least 42 haplotypes were detected in current investigation, of these 28 haplotypes were from Southeast Asian isolates. All Southeast Asian haplotypes were clustered as monophyletic group, except the four specimens collected from Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, which was huge genetically distinct from other specimens from Southeast Asia. In addition, they were aligned in between the specimens from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. This shows that cryptic species (morphological similar but genetically distinct) could exist in Southeast Asian isolates. However, to prove this hypothesis, greater sample sizes and more localities of I. exustus need to be examined throughout Southeast Asia.

V\u20ac olger R+D, NovaTec Immundiagnostica GmbH, Dietzenbach, Germany Chikungunya (also named breakbone fever) is a highly emerging disease in many tropical settings with great socioeconomic impact. Causative agent for this disease is a single-stranded, enveloped RNA-Virus that belongs to the genera Alphavirus of the togavirus family (Togaviridae). Chikungunya-Viruses are transmitted to humans by bloodsucking mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus). In general the viruses are not transmitted from human to human but transmissions from infected pregnant women to unborn children have been proved. The symptoms of Chikungunya include fever which can reach 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), a petechial or maculopapular rash usually involving the limbs and trunk, and arthralgia or arthritis affecting multiple joints which can be debilitating. The symptoms can also include headache, conjunctival injection and slight photophobia. The fever typically lasts for 2 days and abruptly comes down. However other symptoms, namely joint pain, intense headache, insomnia and an extreme degree of prostration last for a variable period, usually for about 5-7 days. But patients have complained of joint pain for much longer periods depending on age. The severity of the disease as well as its duration is less in younger patients and pregnant women. Heavy damage to somebody's health or death is rare. Alphaviruses rarely appear in Europe but can be noticed as import or travel associated infection.",

The enteric bacteria Xenorhabdus nematophila and Photorhabdus luminescens are highly pathogenic against a broad range of insects. They produce huge numbers of secondary metabolites, many with toxic effects on eukaryotic cells. Therefore, we tested if these bacteria are also toxic towards T. cruzi. We assessed the trypanocidal and immunomodulatory activity of the cell-free bacterial culture fluids on trypomastigotes and amastigotes forms of T. cruzi in vitro. To carry it on, trypomastigotes were incubated with the bacterial culture fluid in a concentration ranging from 0.5% to 25% (v/v) or only culture medium as control. To access the toxicity on amastigote forms, macrophages were overnight incubated with trypomastigotes (5 trypomastigotes:1 macrophage) to develop up to intracellular amastigotes form, then the plate was washed and the SN was added at concentrations 2.5; 5 e 10% (v/v). Parasite viability was accessed at 48 h. The toxicity of bacterial culture fluid on macrophages was also accessed in the same concentration range. Both bacterial culture fluids of P. luminescens and X. nematophila effectively killed the trypomastigote form in a concentration-dependent manner [IC 50 values of 3.02% and 0.72% (v/v), respectively]. Culture fluid start to kill trypomastigote as soon as 3 h (78% viability at 0.5% Xenorhabdus and 79% at 2.5% Photorhabdus fluid culture). Furthermore, P. luminescens culture fluid reduced the number of infected macrophages and the number of amastigote per macrophages after 48 h of incubation at low concentration. However, both bacterial fluids caused potent cytotoxicity only at the high concentrations of the culture fluids. The selective index values (macrophages CC 50 /amastigotes IC 50 ) for P. luminescens and X. nematophila were determined as 8.82 and 13.15, respectively, indicating that both bacteria displayed marked parasite selectivity. Moreover, both culture fluids stimulated the trypanocidal activity of macrophages by a mechanism independent of nitric oxide. Summarizing, our studies reveal that entomopathogenic bacteria are potential sources of putative novel drugs against Chagas Disease.",

However, when rapid diagnostics and fexinidazole were made available, transmission was reduced towards elimination targets. Over the next decade, is expected that human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) will be eliminated. The declining prevalence of infection will change the current reliance on vertical surveillance programs, to a paradigm where patients will be more likely to report symptoms at a local health centre. New diagnostics and interventions could change the future of service delivery of case detection and treatment and access to local services would reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures and the inconvenience of travelling long distances for patients needing treatment. It is proposed that the integration of programs into the local health centres (LHC) could be modelled to forecast outcomes related to service delivery, patient accessibility, time spent in the health system (HS) and resources used with current and new interventions A discrete-event simulation (DES) HS model was developed with SIMUL8 \u00e2 to simulate a patients' movement through the HS. Different health system structures of both integrated (new diagnostics and treatments) and non-integrated (current) approaches were constructed in the model. Data from current and emerging diagnostics and treatments were included in the model to measure the impact of switching from a non-integrated to integrated HS. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted.",

It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which due to it is high genetic variability has been classified into six different Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) associated with geographical distribution, transmission cycle and clinical manifestation. The pathogenesis mechanism is still unclear but the interaction macrophage-parasite has been implicated. In the case of the parasite, the cell surface is principally composed by glycoproteins as transialidases and mucins. These are involved in the parasite entry and associated with some molecules in macrophages, as Toll Like Receptors and recently the Signalling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule (Slam). Slam receptors are a family of pathogen adhesion molecules that are involved in signaling between immune cells regulating for instance T cell proliferation, antibody production, cytotoxic responses and Ifn, Tnf and Il6 production. One of these receptors, Slamf1 is a microbial sensor able to positively regulate NADPH oxidase (Nox2). In addition, the role of Slamf1 receptor in T. cruzi infection has been studied in Slamf1 receptor deficient mice where it has been associated with a more efficiently elimination of parasites and a high survival rate compared with the wild type control.",

After decades of chronic infection, 30% of the patients develop cardiac and/or digestive symptoms. The current standard drugs (benznidazole and nifurtimox) are not satisfying in regard to their efficacy and safety. Recently, two CYP51 inhibitors (posaconazole and ravuconazole) have been tested in drug trials. Although in vitro results had been promising, both drugs showed a low sustained efficacy, which rendered them unusable for treatment. Therefore, new methods in the drug discovery process are needed. Stage-specific assays are one in vitro tool to increase the predictability of preclinical data. T. cruzi has four morphologically distinct stages. The relevant stages for assay purposes are the two forms occurring in humans: the intracellular, proliferative amastigotes and the extracellular, infectious trypomastigotes. Depending on the action of a drug, its effects on parasite survival may be different on the two stages. In order to quantify these effects, the project aims at establishing an assay using a T. cruzi parasite that expresses reporter genes specific to the amastigote and trypomastigote stages. In order to create the transgenic parasite, we are combining comparative transcriptomics with reverse genetics in T. cruzi.",

In it we propose a model that takes into account the force of infection of the disease in the endemic country, which can either be a visited country (source of infection importation) or a country from where local residents export the infection when travel in the latent condition for disease-free countries. The model is deterministic but a preliminary stochastic formulation is presented in the appendix. It considers two countries: one is the host home-country and the other is the source country (with an endemic infectious disease). Susceptible individuals travel from their home-country to the endemic country and eventually return infected. The input of the model is the force of infection at the visited/source country which is assumed to be known and we assume that, in the case of disease importation, travelers are subject to the same risk of infection as local residents but do not contribute to it. In the case of disease exportation, the model calculates the probability that a latent individual travels from an endemic (or epidemic) country to a disease-free country. We exemplify the model with two distinct situation, namely, the risk of dengue importation from Thailand to Europe and the risk of Ebola exportation from Liberia to the USA.",

Overall, we find weak evidence that households accumulate livestock wealth in response to living in a drier environment, but find no evidence that households invest in either structural or cognitive social capital as insurance against climate risks. However, coping strategies vary across social groups. For example, while rainfall does not robustly affect our measure of cognitive social capital (trust)we do find that the sub-samples of poor and financially-integrated households (i.e., those who have relatively good access to credit and ability to save money) display greater mutual trust in drier environments.

Challenges and lessons learned from the Swiss Red Cross review Methods In 2014 the SRC commissioned the Swiss TPH to conduct a post-ex review of five country projects to assess the long-term impact of initiatives beyond project completion to improve the access of poor and vulnerable groups to health services. Levesque et al's (2013) framework of access to health care was used, which examines five dimensions of accessibility associated with services provided (approachability, acceptability, availability and accommodation, affordability and appropriateness) and five corresponding abilities of communities to interact with the dimensions of accessibility to generate access (ability to perceive; to seek, to reach, to pay and to engage). Fieldwork was conducted in Bolivia, Ghana, Nepal, Laos and Cambodia and from the individual country case-studies an overall qualitative analysis was conducted to determine elements that support sustained access.",

Human resources and their motivation and commitment, fostered by capacity building and loyalty, allow continuation of services and even rise in patient numbers.

When the virus was formally identified as Ebola, epidemiological investigations started while local people tried to understand the deaths in their communities.

Rabies can be controlled through mass dog vaccination. Effectiveness depends on accessibility of dogs and the ease of restraint for vaccination, which, in turn, is determined by factors such as the proportion of unowned dogs and the nature of dog-human relationships. Understanding these aspects -which may vary geographically or be affected by socio-cultural determinants -is helpful in guiding long-term rabies control. Awareness of the risk of rabies transmission from infected animals and the appropriate response after potential exposure are also essential to reduce human cases. To improve educational messages in rabies vaccination campaigns, this study assessed the community's knowledge and perceptions of dogs, rabies and the related risk behaviours in a recently-infected area of South Africa.",

The ignorance of the population of the causes and consequences of this disease often led to feelings of shame among parents of malnourished children.

Malaria was more prevalent among those with menial jobs (craft work, farming and petty traders) compared to those who were civil servants. Moreover, 43.4% of pregnant women who were malaria positive earn below N5000 per month while only 7.4% and 5% of those who earned between N6000 and N15 000, and N15 000 above respectively were malaria positive. Most of the people studied found it difficult to pay for the prophylactic and chemotherapeutic drugs and therefore they resorted to using herbs for the treatment of malaria. More than 50% of those who had stagnant water and bushes around their houses were malaria positive. Majority of people enrolled for this study complained about the negative effect of insecticide treated bed net (ITN) and decided not to use it.

Several factors and knowledge about the causation of disease and its curability have direct correlation with the treatment seeking behaviour. This study was aimed at identify factors associated with different malaria treatment behaviours among pregnant women and explore these factors to gain information to guide the planning of preventive strategies and treatment of malaria among pregnant women in Ondo West Local Government Area. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 240 pregnant women who presented with signs and symptoms of malaria. They were selected consecutively through purposive sampling methods across the four selected ANC centres. A set of interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, and major influencing factors of treatment-seeking behaviours for the study. Knowledge of malaria was assessed on a scale of 100 points with scores \u226575 rated as high level knowledge while score of 50-74 as average knowledge. The mean age of the respondents was 22 AE 1.1. One hundred and eighty three (76.3%) had high knowledge of malaria transmission, symptoms, and prevention, despite this; only 100 (41.7%) sought early malaria treatment. Those with high level of malaria knowledge were 4.55 times more likely than those with average knowledge to seek for early malaria treatment (OR = 4.55, CI = 2.17-9.55). Those with no formal education were 99.7% less likely than those with post tertiary education to seek early malaria treatment (OR = 0.003, C.I = 0.00-0.07). Also, those who have only primary education were 96% less likely than those with post tertiary education to seek for early malaria treatment (OR = 0.04, C.I = 0.05-0.30). The pregnant women within age group of 18-24 years were 82% less likely than those of 35 years and above to seek early for malaria treatment (OR = 0.18,C.I = 0.04-0.84). In conclusion, whereas the knowledge of pregnant women about malaria cause, transmission, signs and symptom was good, most of the pregnant women still sought late for malaria treatment. It was noticed from the result that level of education, age, religion and level of knowledge all have significant relationships with treatment seeking behaviour. Therefore we recommend education campaigns to encourage early treatment seeking, especially among younger women and uneducated pregnant women, in Ondo West.",

Especially in urban areas and among older people an increase of NCDs can be observed. States and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) wish to improve programs, design laws and policies that respond effectively to the different situations of older women, compared to men. These governmental and NGO actors would like to foster older peoples' participation in health promotion to reduce the burden of NCDs, but often lack 'key indicators and data disaggregated by age and sex' (UNFPA and HelpAge International 2012).

While for example men often adhered to recommendations of doing walking exercises to mitigate NCDs and their consequences, older women frequently disregarded the advice. Older women mostly agreed with the doctors that it was important to stay physically active but did not feel comfortable to go for a walk outside as it was recommendedsince many of them were not used to leave their house to walk alone in the streets.

Clinical parameters are important objective outcomes in PTB; however they often do not translate into meaningful patient outcomes, which can be assessed using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a specific PR of multi-dimensional nature including physical, mental and social health domains and can provide additional information beyond clinical parameters. It has been shown to be associated to medication adherence. The main objective of this research is to understand patient-reported HRQOL and its association to medication adherence in PTB patients in South Africa.",

This study identified factors related to smoking behaviour among [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] year-old children in Jakarta, Indonesia using a questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey to obtain smoking status and possible predictors towards smoking habit. The total sample size was 1097 students among 3rd-7th grade students from schools in Jakarta. Self-reported smoking status was defined as whether the child had smoked tobacco within the past 2 months prior to the interview. The prevalence of smoking was 13.4%. Logistic regression analysis showed that high parental approval of tobacco use (OR = 13.4; CI 95%: 5.1-35.1) was the strongest predictor on children smoking status, followed by low parental control (OR = 12.1; CI 95%: 6.9-21.2), being male (OR = 10.7; CI 95%: 5.3-21.7), mother (OR = 10.58; CI 95%: 3.96-28.28), father (OR = 7.69; CI 95%: 3.59-16.47), sibling (OR = 7.91; CI 95%: 4.41-14.17) smoking status.

In multivariate linear regression among the Thai general population higher education, higher income and knowing a person from the community with TB was significantly associated with level of TB knowledge. Across the different study populations 18.6% indicated that they had ever undergone a TB screening test. Multivariate logistic regression found that older age, lower education, being a migrant or belong to an ethnic minority group, residing in an area supported by the Global Fund, better TB knowledge, having a family member with TB, and knowing other people in the community with TB was associated having screened for TB. Malaria accounts for over 22% of the total morbidity in outpatients and about 51% of deaths in health facilities in Mauritania.. In Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania, malaria cases, mostly due to Plasmodium vivax, have dramatically increased in the recent years with more than 2000 laboratoryconfirmed cases in Teyarett health center in 2013. The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the household community in Nouakchott regarding malaria in order to provide information to plan community-oriented malaria control activities. A randomly selected sample of 1796 households in nine districts of Nouakchott was surveyed from May to June 2013 using a pre-tested survey instrument, which consisted of 95 questions on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic factors, educational status, knowledge and perceptions of malaria, burden and severity of disease, treatment-seeking behavior, and malaria prevention practices. The survey was performed by face-to-face interview of adults. Women represented 79% (1415/1794) of the interviewed individuals. Almost all individuals (99.6%; 1790/1796) were aware of malaria, and 91.8% (1650/1796) of them mentioned the radio (47.2%) and television (44.6%) as the main sources of information on malaria. Of 1796 interviewed persons, 1718 (95.5%) correctly associated malaria with mosquito bites. The main signs and symptoms of malaria mentioned were fever (85.6%), headache (73.7%), chills (70.1%), and vomiting (60%). Sixty percent of respondents reported having used antimalarial drugs prior to hospital attendance. Thirty nine percent (715 households) owned at least one insecticide-treated bednet, and 72.8% of bednets had been purchased by the owners themselves. However, concerning the prophylactic use of antimalarial drugs during travels to endemic areas, only three respondents were able to use the drugs correctly. The majority of persons interviewed for this study (84.6%) recommended the mass distribution of insecticide-treated bednets to control malaria. This assessment of knowledge, attitudes, and practices showed a broad awareness of malaria and also highlights the behaviors to target for limiting the flow of parasite strains, potentially responsible for epidemic, resurgence or spread of antimalarials resistance.",

Reduction of maternal mortality by half by the year of 2015 is one of the millennium development goals (MDG5). Maternal mortality, however, is still a problem of many developing countries including Ethiopia, where the maternal mortality rate was 676 per 100 000 live births.

Therefore, a legal auxiliary construction of German Armed Forces (GAF) acting as 'junior partner' of the GRC was implemented to allow for such an assignment. This was a hitherto unknown position to the military to which it needed to adapt gradually especially as it provided for the majority of volunteers and key logistics including an airlift to transport much needed relief supplies. The concept of volunteering was new to the GAF, still recruitment was facilitated by an existing network of experienced soldiers most of them working for specialized military departments of infectious diseases. Also common requirements like special, tailoredto-mission training before deployment, a routine in GAF, were met by military personnel. This thorough preparation was a solid basis for a successful and safe mission, however it had to be combined with a maximum of flexibility to fully respond to the ever changing epidemiological situation. Being embedded into inter-ministerial structures with a complex administration and a hierarchic decision-making process with differing perceptions in Liberia and in Germany, this was a challenge especially to GAF.

On the economic aspect, the increasing of elderly means increasing more budgets on social security. In the case of developing countries where social security functions have not been well established and performed optimally, the role of community and extended family is largely significant to maintain the quality of life of the elderly. Using the case of Indonesia, this study examines the role of Posyandu Lansia (Health Care Centre for the Elderly) on the quality of life of the aged.

The results show that education attainment and knowledge on health facility and service increases the probability of participation in the community health care centre. Participation varies across regions. In addition, the presence of health care centre for the elderly in the village has a significant role in enhancing quality of life of elderly people through maintaining physical and mental health of the elderly. Controlling for individual characteristics and socioeconomic variables such as education, income, and access to formal health care facilities, the elder people who participate in the health care centre for the elderly in the village have less sickness period and lower level of depression. Hence, it can be concluded that the health care centre for the elderly in the community might provide informal support for people who have no mean or lack of formal support. The establishment of health care centre for the elderly in Indonesia is an alternative strategy to promote the quality of life of elderly which can be applied in other Asian countries, particularly the developing countries which might experience elderly explosion in the future.",

In Dodoma Region, pharmacy-related tasks and supply management have informally been shifted to clinical health workers without policy guidance, explicit job descriptions, or the necessary support through systematic training. Implicit task shifting should be recognized and formalized. Job orientation, training and operational procedures may be useful to support the non-pharmaceutical health workers to effectively manage medicine supply. Mortality of children under 5 years has decreased dramatically in the last 20 years, from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011. However, even if sub-Saharan African countries have experienced this trend, Africa remains the part of the world with the highest rates of infant mortality. Burkina Faso, is still far from achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 (to reduce child mortality by two thirds between 1990 and 2015). It is a country with one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world (146 deaths/1000 live births). This mortality rate is especially high in rural areas, among the poorest including children with the least educated mothers. Poor access to health services related to financial, geographical and cultural barriers and poor quality of care are important factors influencing the high rate of infant and child mortality. The objective of this study is to evaluate quality of child health services and equity in access of child health services. Household surveys and facility surveys have been, from October 2013 to February 2014 in 565 health facilities in 24 different districts of Burkina Faso. The main data collected were at: household level: socio-economic status, barriers to use of child health services, household health expenditures, perceptions of child health service quality, anthropometric measures, at health facility level: facility assessment (staff, infrastructures, equipment. . .), under five consultation observation and patient exit interviews (satisfaction. . .). The data are currently analysed and will lead to analyses of quality of care for child health services and equity in utilization of health services.",

Shared risk factors for distinct pathogens may result in chronic co-infections. Around 3 million recently-arrived Latin American immigrants live in Western Europe. We aimed at assessing the prevalence and cooccurrence of imported chronic infections and the susceptibility to highly prevalent local infections in this group. Discussion Initial results in this sample of recently arrived Latin-American immigrants show a consequent proportion of them having one or more chronic infections, with Chagas disease and syphilis being most frequent. This entails putting emphasis on chronic infections detection among those communities with specific attention to tackle risks of congenital transmission. Results of S. stercoralis prevalence and factors for multiple infections will be presented at the congress. Susceptibilities to autochthonous infections such as measles and VZV are similar or lower than those of the local population and do not call for specific preventive measures. before drug-induced immune suppression from March 2013 to August 2014 and the rate of reactivation after specific treatment. We included all patients over 16 years old from low and middle income countries with an oncohaematological disease that requires immune suppression. Patients were screened for imported infections according to the country of origin. All patients were treated and followed up for 6 months to determine reactivation of imported infections. Methods We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of studies reporting prevalence of CD in European countries belonging to the European Union (EU) before 2004 in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and based on the database sources MEDLINE and Global Health. No restrictions were placed on study date, study design or language of publication. Prevalence studies based on community, antenatal care, blood banks or primary health care were included, whereas hospital-based studies were not included because of the high risk of selection bias.

Most were aware that vaccination of dogs can prevent rabies, but only a minority of dog-owners could answer correctly at what age the dog should get a first rabies vaccination. There was also strong consensus among dog-owners that it is better to protect their dog from becoming rabid by vaccinating it rather than needing to treat a bitten person.

To address these data gaps, we sampled blood from 147 slaughtered pigs in two provinces Hung Yen (North) and Nghe An (Center) and analyzed for S. suis using PCR (16S-S. suis and S. suis serotype 2). In addition, we surveyed 406 heads of household and 51 slaughterhouse workers in these areas to understand behaviors and attitudes toward consumption of raw pig blood. A total of 33.3% of 147 pig blood samples tested positive with S. suis, but only 1.4% (2/147) were positive to S. suis serotype 2, the serotype most frequently associated with severe human infections. Fifteen of 406 people interviewed (3.4%) reported eating 'Tiet canh', whereas this rate was significantly higher at 43.1% (21 of 51) for slaughterhouse workers.

The trematode parasites causing these two diseases share crucial aspects in their life cycles, such as the dependency on aquatic snails as intermediate hosts and the final-host infection at the host-water interface. The lives of humans and livestock are closely linked and both often share the same habitats, including water contact sites. Furthermore, different human population groups have different access to water and other resources. It follows that, next to classical parasitological approaches, the dynamics between different populations and their livestock need to be considered in a social-ecological context.",

Kutaish Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland This study aims at estimating the role of Brucellosis among fever patients in Syrian refugee camps to guide physicians in their differential diagnosis and treatment choices. The Middle East has traditionally been an endemic area and Syria is one of the countries with the highest incidence. Brucellosis is a bacterial infection, which spreads to humans by consuming infected animal milk or via direct contact with infected animals. It is a costly disease due to its chronic nature and the reduction of livestock production due to abortions, causing a major economic burden. Over 10 million people have been displaced in and out of Syria as because of the ongoing armed conflicts. According to the United Nations there are 6.5 million internally displaced people and almost 4 million Syrian refugees in the surrounding countries. We hypothesize that up to 5% of fever patients have acute brucellosis. Brucella infection may spilled over from Syria due to mass displacement. Alternatively the disease transmission might have collapsed as result of reduced commercial productivity. Approach: The study will take place in refugee camps along the Syrian border. A cross sectional case series of 300 fever patients will be clinically examined and tested for Brucellosis using the Rose Bengal test and a secondary serology test.The sample size assumes a standard error of 1% and a z-value of 1.96. An estimate of the health centre based acute brucellosis incidence will be made using an estimate the total number of population in the range of the health centre. We will compare local data on brucellosis in the host countries before and after the Syrian crises, in order to understand the health situation, the movement of the disease after the collapse of control and changes in the health priorities in the region to be able to give a quality assessment of the actuality of the disease and draw future control and elimination plan in collaboration with regional public and animal health authorities. To test further our secondary hypotheses we will compare observed incidences with disease data from Syria and host countries. This study will provide high quality data on the actual situation and the role of brucella infection in febrile cases among the Syrian refugees. The study results will be a starting point for further regional and more inclusive study to draw an updated brucellosis map of the Middle-East, to plan future elimination and control guide lines and working plans.",

The results help define the most cost-effective dog mass vaccination strategies for rabies elimination in Africa and Asia. Rabies is a zoonotic disease that is responsible for substantial human mortality in Asia and Africa, but recent studies have suggested that elimination is possible. We hypothesize that the population level aspects of vaccination coverage contribute more to the dynamics of dog rabies elimination than the kinetics of protective antibodies within individual dogs. In 2012 and 2013 we vaccinated 18 200 and 22 300 dogs in N'Djam ena, Chad, reaching both times a population coverage of more than 70%. Dog rabies incidence dropped from one rabid dog per week prior to the mass vaccination to less than one rabid dog 8 months afterwar the start of the campaign. Because of the multiple scales (between dogs and within dogs) in rabies transmission and immune dynamics, this unique data set will be used for comparative mathematical modeling approaches with individual based (contact networks and machine learning) and population-based models. Preliminary results have been obtained using coupled differential equations assuming a homogenous dog population. Results show that the respective contributions of the population dynamics and immunity loss are dynamic. The contribution of the population dynamics by birth and death processes is to the susceptible population is two to five times higher than the immunity loss of the immunized population between two vaccination campaigns. This project will generate new knowledge on dog rabies transmission dynamics and potential for elimination; provide advice on optimal vaccination strategies; and identify the most realistic and parsimonious models for the follow-up of forthcoming dog mass vaccination campaigns in Africa and Asia in the framework of the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC). a total of 40 smallholder dairy farmers were randomly selected for data collection. Structured questionnaire was used to collect information on gender with respect to interviewee role, age, education, main occupation; herd size per household and cow breed; factors affecting hygienic quality of milk, routine mastitis control practices; knowledge on health risks associated with consumption of milk; measures to control zoonotic diseases and overall management of the milking cow. During farm visits, housing and housing equipment, milking environment, milking equipment and manure disposal were verified through direct observation. 81 milking cows were ear tagged from a sampling frame consisting all cows in the selected villages basing on health status as explained by the owner. Tuberculin test was carried out by the single comparative intradermal tuberculin test using avian and bovine purified protein derivatives. California Mastitis Test (CMT) was carried by mixing equal amounts of milk from each of the udder teats and CMT reagent into the four cups of the CMT paddle. Four milk samples each 50 ml were aseptically drawn from all four quarters of the udder of each sampled cow using clean sterile falcon tubes; for this reason 324 samples of milk were collected from 81 dairy cows. Also, 81 samples of blood were drawn from jugular veins of those cows using clean sterile vacutainer tubes. The collected Milk and blood samples were examined for brucellosis in the laboratory. All cows (100%, n = 81) tested negative for TB and also all milk (n = 324) and blood (n = 81) samples tested negative for brucellosis. 14.8% of the teats were positive for subclinical mastitis and 0.3% clinical mastitis was diagnosed. Managerial factors related to poor milking hygiene and lack of training on milk handling were influencing (P \u02c2 0.05) prevalence of mastitis. Improvements in animal husbandry practices and training of farmers to increase their awareness on management of dairy cows and hygienic production and commercialization of milk are recommended. Also, placement of milk collection centres will influence appropriate milking and milk handling practices.",

The gold standard for estimating mosquitohuman contact rates is the human landing catch (HLC), where human volunteers catch mosquitoes that land on their exposed body parts.

Both overall and study-specific sampling efficiencies of LT compared with HLC were computed, and regression methods that allow for the substantial variations in mosquito counts made by either method were used to test whether the sampling efficacy varies with mosquito density. Conclusions LT are thus a crude tool at best, but are relatively easy to deploy on a large scale. Spatial and temporal variation in mosquito densities and human malaria transmission exposure span several orders of magnitude, compared to which the inconsistencies of LT are relatively small.

After a decade of progressively improving coverage with all these interventions, vector populations which remained pyrethroid-susceptible became sparse and lower malaria infection risk became evenly distributed across all ages but stable transmission persisted. High estimated proportion of potential vector exposure occurring indoors (p h,i ) was protective against malaria among the majority of residents (85.8%) living in houses with window screens (OR [95% CI] = 0.73 [0.60, 0.90], P = 0.0040 and 0.64 [0.49, 0.83], P = 0.00094 for highest and middle versus lowest terciles, respectively) but not in unscreened houses (P \u2265 0.51). Residents of houses with window screening who spent most night hours indoors (middle and high terciles of p h,i ) were protected against malaria infection (OR [95% CI] = 0.71 [0.59, 0.85], P = 0.00013) but not those spending even a few hours outdoors in the evening and early morning (P = 0.433). Malaria risk among residents with unscreened houses (14.2%) increased with vector density (P = 0.0093) and was reduced by larvicide application (OR [95% CI] = 0.42 [0.23, 0.74], P = 0.0033), but was unaffected by either factor among residents with screened houses (P = 0.23 and 0.19, respectively). Only small fractions of persisting malaria infections could be attributed to houses lacking window screens (4.1%), spending time outside screened houses (5.8%), or gaps in larviciding coverage, (15.8%), respectively. Despite high coverage of effective nets, screening and larviciding in this urban context with very sparse populations of pyrethroidsusceptible vectors, malaria transmission persists and further improving coverage and adherence of these interventions are therefore only likely to prevent a minority of remaining cases. New or improved transmission control measures are required to enable elimination of malaria from Dar es Salaam.",

Among these, sibling species B is considered to be as a poor vector of malaria. With regards to human malaria parasites P. falciparum and P. vivax, An. culicifacies sibling species B tend to be refractory, implying a relatively high degree of specificity in relationship between malaria parasites and mosquito vectors. This implied that the variation of certain genetic factors/ proteins in An. culicifacies species B that influence the vector competence which ultimately affects the ability of parasite to establish or to develop in the mosquito. Salivary proteins are directly involved in human-vector contact during biting and play a key role in pathogen transmission. Therefore, study of salivary gland proteins is essential first step towards understanding the refractory mechanisms and host-parasite relationships. Here we have identified and characterized the differentially expressed salivary proteins that are already present naturally in refractory An. culicifacies mosquito that may responsible for the mechanism of refractoriness or may block the development of parasite.",

We found seven upregulated and 20 downregulated proteins in refractory An. culicifacies sub species B. TRIO salivary gland protein, Serine-type endopeptidase, Glutathione-S-transferase and 5 0 nucleotidase are some important upregulated proteins in refractory sub species and we hypothesized that these proteins may have crucial role in imparting the refractoriness to the mosquito either by parasite killing or effecting its transmission. This comparative study and further investigation of these identified proteins will provide valuable insight to depict the vectorial capacity of the mosquito and perhaps suggest novel targets for control of malaria transmission blocking strategies. Just as forest workers or people practicing outdoor recreational activities, scouts are at high risk of tick bites and tick-borne infections. The risk of tick bite is shaped by environmental and climatic factors but also by land management. The aim of this study was to assess which environmental conditions favour scout-tick contacts, and thus to understand better how these factors and their interactions influence the two components of risk: hazard (related to vector and host ecology) and exposure of humans to disease vectors. A survey was conducted in the summer of 2009 on the incidence of tick bites in scout camps taking place in southern Belgium. Joint effects of landscape composition and configuration, weather, climate, forest and wildlife management were examined using multiple gamma regression with a log link. The landscape was characterized in various sizes of buffers around camps using a detailed land use map, climate and weather variables. Landscape composition and configuration had a significant influence on scout-tick contacts: the risk was high when the camp was surrounded by a low proportion of arable land and situated in a complex and fragmented landscape. The distance to the nearest forest patch, the composition of the forest ecotone and weather and climatic factors all were significantly associated with scout-tick contacts. Both hazard-and exposurerelated variables contributed significantly to the frequency of scout-tick contact. Our results show that environmental conditions favour scout-tick contacts. For example, we emphasize the impact of accessibility of environments suitable for ticks on the risk of contact. We also highlight the significant effect of both hazard and exposure. Our results are consistent with the current knowledge, but further investigations on the effect of forest management, e.g. through its impact on forest structure, on the tickhost-pathogen system, and on humans exposure, is required.",

Here we use some elements of the holistic conceptual risk and vulnerability framework to derive social vulnerability estimates to epidemics in several zones of Rome. The data used in the spatial modelling exercise were collected through a combination of 6-month quantitative surveys by means of sticky traps of Ae. albopictus in 24 sampling stations and ad-hoc designed surveys of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of general practitioners specific for CHIK and the general population (including sensitive sub-groups) specific for Aedes related nuisance, knowledge, practices and attitudes. Entomological results show a high spatial heterogeneity of Ae. albopictus density throughout the city, with peaks of 175 individuals/1 week of collection in the peripheral suburbs. Population KAP surveys (sample size: 1182 responders) indicated the large nuisance caused by mosquito bites (59% of responders) and low levels of knowledge (60% of responders) and incorrect attitudes and practices (51% of responders). Interestingly, only <10% of responders had concern about mosquito borne diseases. General practitioner KAP survey indicates a very poor knowledge about CHIK and capacity to correctly identify a CHIK case (<10% of responders). We conclude that the social vulnerability of the system to the unlikely event of the arrival of a viremic traveller in Rome during peak biting season of Ae. albopictus, warrants the implementation of preventive measures targeted at both general practitioners and population.",

The continued spread of A. albopictus in Ticino raises the questions as to how effective the current control efforts are and whether the mosquito will eventually make it across the Alps. Here, invasive mosquitoes were monitored with ovitraps and BG sentinel traps placed in sylvatic and forested areas across the Swiss-Italian border, five districts in Ticino and level along major traffic routes across Switzerland. Mosquito specimens caught were identified morphologically and proteomically by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In addition, the susceptibility of A. albopictus to current and other insecticides was assessed.

During nontransmission season, OHTs and curing tanks were the most preferred breeding containers followed by coolers, plastic containers. In LIG localities water storage containers (plastic) forms highest positive breeding containers (29%) for Aedes mosquitoes but in MIG localities solid waste (27%) and plastic containers (26%) were the most preferred for breeding. In HIG localities solid waste (27%) and curing tanks (21%) were the most preferred breeding containers and contributing maximum for the breeding of Aedes aegypti. The house index was higher in the transmission months August and September in LIG, June-July in MIG and June in HIG colony. Conclusion Containers found in low income groups are contributing more to Ae aegypti breeding than MIG and HIG localities. Overhead tanks and curing tanks are the key breeding sites in non transmission season, whereas solid waste and plastic containers are amongst preferred breeding sites in transmission season. The targeted intervention in the non transmission season can hence help to control the sudden upsurge of dengue in a densely populated city like Delhi.",

We investigated the age-dependent distribution of alleles or haplotypes of three P. falciparum malaria vaccine candidates, circumsporozoite protein (csp), erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (eba-175) and serine repeat antigen 5 (sera5) in a region of intense malaria transmission in Uganda. A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and November 2009. Blood samples were collected after informed consent from 250 individuals below 5 years, 5-10 years and above 10 years olds. P. falciparum DNA was extracted from all samples. Alleles of sera5 and eba-175 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by resolution of PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis and allele calling using photographs of ethidium bromide-stained gels. Haplotypes of CSP were identified by sequencing 63 PCR products and using P. falciparum 7G8 strain sequence as a reference. Both eba-175 FCR3 (48/178) and CAMP (16/178) alleles were observed with the FCR3 (24/ 67) allele being predominant among children aged below 5 years old while the CAMP (12/67) allele was predominant among older individuals. Both sera5 alleles ORI (6/204) and ORII (103/ 204) were observed in the population but ORII was more prevalent. SERA5 ORII allele was significantly associated with age (P values <0.0001), parasite density (P value <0.0001) and clinical outcomes (P value = 0.018). There was marked CSP diversity in the Th2/Th3 region. Out of 63 sequences, 16 conformed to the reference strain and one (1/16) was similar with a West African haplotype and the majority (14/16) of the haplotypes were unique to this study region. There was an age-dependent distribution of CSP haplotypes with more haplotypes being harbored by <5 year-olds, (10/16) compared to adults (2/16). Interestingly, the CSP haplotype corresponding to 3D7 whose prototypical sequence is identical to the sequence of the leading malaria vaccine candidate RTS, S was not observed.

Results Children from households with improved sanitation facilities and disposed children's feces had lower S. flexneri and Cryptosporidium diarrhea risk. Cryptosporidium diarrhea risk was higher when cow dung was used as fuel and mothers did not wash hands before eating. Children from households with toilets and that disposed children's feces had lower ETEC infection risk when no handwashing was practiced after cleaning a child following defecation and before cooking, respectively. Rotavirus diarrhea was lower among children from households with deep tube wells when no hand washing was practiced after handling of animals.

The parasitic nematode can therefore remain with the original host for many years/decades undetected. This parasite is found mainly in indigenous communities in northern and central Australia.",

Microscopic examination of direct smears and faecal concentration methods has low sensitivity. Although faecal cultures such as the Baemman, Harada mori and agar plate methods are more sensitive, they rely on live active worms to migrate away from the faecal matter. The logistics of receiving these specimens with live active parasites remains difficult, because of the distance between collection sites and the laboratory. New molecular methods have been developed to overcome the need for laboratory culture methods, but they have not been shown to be as sensitive as the traditional culture methods. We investigated some of the reasons for this lack of sensitivity.",

The MDR post-DOTS M.tb were found to have significantly higher expression of drug efflux pumps and DNA repair genes along with lower expression of metabolic genes as compared to the drug susceptible (DS) pre-DOTS M.tb. The MDR M.tb also induced faster and 7 fold higher levels of recA as compared to the DS strain in response to rifampicin. The genetically different longitudinal isolates may be due to initial mixed infection, or exogenous re-infection with a different strain. Patients with genetically identical longitudinal isolates, represent evolution of MDR during DOTS, and may be indicative of selection of MDR mutations under host and drug pressures. Conclusion Endpoint diagnosis and absence of periodic national surveys fail to provide crucial information about rapidly evolving M.tb drug resistance. Using WGS it is possible to accurately measure multiple facets including microevolution, novel drug resistance mutations, transmission dynamics and phylogeography of M.tb. An increase in phylogenetically linked MDR M.tb in a population will be indicative of a clonal expansion of a fit MDR M.tb strain and would warrant a greater focus on reducing transmission. An increase in phylogeneticaly unrelated MDR M.tb would indicate operational deviations of DOTS administration, directing greater focus in DOTS compliance. Such focused and real-time public health strategies will be key to the outcome of our battle against MDR TB and antimicrobial resistance in general.

Junghanss 2 1 Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Legon, Ghana; 2 Section Clinical Tropical Medicine, Heidelberg University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany; 3 Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland Introduction Buruli ulcer (BU), a necrotising skin disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is typically associated with large chronic ulcers and physical, psychological and social sequelae. Management has focused mainly on microbiological cure and surgical wound closure, neglecting the role of patient factors (such as underlying comorbid conditions), wound care practices and secondary bacterial infections in the wound healing process. Methods Between October 2013 and March 2015, 27 newly diagnosed (IS2404 PCR positive) BU cases presenting at Obom Health Centre, Greater Accra, Ghana were enrolled into the study and prospectively followed up. After an initial medical work-up including full medical and wound history, physical examination and baseline laboratory investigations, patients' wounds were clinically assessed and documented weekly. In patients with non-healing wounds, additional clinical, laboratory and radiological examinations were done and therapeutic interventions performed were documented. Results All 27 laboratory confirmed cases of BU received WHO-recommended treatment (Rifampicin plus Streptomycin). 25 patients completed treatment. 12 patients (44.4%) had Category 1, 4 (14.8%) Category 2 and 11 (40.7%) Category 3 lesions. Out of 30 BU lesions assessed, 27 (90%) were ulcers. Of these, 20 (74%) healed completely, 15 (55.5%) within 1-12 and 5 (18.5%) within 13-24 weeks. Out of 7 ulcers (26%) that did not heal, 2 had underlying chronic osteomyelitis and 2 chronic lymphoedema. In 2 ulcers (6.7%) secondary bacterial infections were observed, in one at first presentation. 3 patients (6.7%) had other forms of systemic comorbidity (arterial hypertension, sickle cell disease and HIV infection) in whom all wounds healed with the exception of the HIV infected patient. Conclusion The majority (74%) of BU lesions treated at health post level healed without the need of further surgical interventions. This provides a good perspective for successful wound management at the peripheral level of the health care system.

TW is known to cause classic Whipple's disease, acute and chronic infections, or asymptomatic carriage. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of TW in the stool of HIV positive patients and uninfected controls in Ghana, and the association with clinical, immunological and virologic parameters. Methods and Materials Consecutive adult HIV patients presenting to the HIV outpatient clinic, and blood donors of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, were recruited between November 2011 and November 2012. Stool samples for TW testing were available from 853 HIV-positive and 103 HIV-negative individuals.

Ascaris lumbricoides (20.9%) and Trichuris trichiura (1.7%) were the most prevalent helminths. Helminths caused significant reduction in IFN-c levels when co-infected with Plasmodium (P = 0.002) relative to Plasmodium infection only. However, the levels of TNF-a, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-1a werenon-significantly elevated in Plasmodium-helminth co-infection compared with Plasmodium only. Co-infection of helminths with HIV caused significant increase in the concentrations of IL-10 (P = 0.002) and IFN-c (P = 0.026) relative to those infected with HIV only. TNF-a and IL-6 were elevated among those infected with HIV only relative to those co-infected with helminths. Conclusion Helminth infection modulated cytokine profile in malaria and HIV co-infections. Helminth infection induced reduction of IFN-c when co-infected with malaria and so may reduce the risk of negative pregnancy outcome.

Infection by rotavirus and by Cryptosporidium spp. was more frequent in children aged under 12 months. No statistical association was observed between infectious agents and water sources, water treatment or latrine usage. Conclusions This study demonstrates high rates of infection, particularly in children aged under 12 months, enhancing the importance of taking action targeting this age group. Since the rotavirus vaccine was only recently introduced, further studies are needed to evaluate its impact on diarrheal disease.

Our work has demonstrated the added value of a One Health approach in populations highly interdependent with livestock. Vitamin A deficiency is a central health issue in developing countries, and livestock milk is the primary source of vitamin A in mobile populations. This study investigated seasonal dynamics of retinol status in Chadian mobile pastoralists.Methods A repeated cross-sectional study assessed human blood and cattle milk over three seasons (2012-2013) in 327 Fulani, Gorane and Arab mobile pastoralists in southeastern Lake Chad. Portable flourometery (iCheck TM ) was used to rapidly measure retinol levels in blood and milk. Linear regression models analyzed human retinol level as the outcome.Results Human seasonal means were 606 lg/l (95% CI 77-1786 lg/l) in rainy, 282 lg/l (95% CI 105-530 lg/l) in cold and 501 lg/l (95% CI 0-1126 lg/l) in dry seasons. Retinol level and deficiency varied according to season and ethnic group. Average values were highest in Gorane during rainy season and in Fulani in the cold and the dry season. Arabs had the lowest average values in all seasons. Retinol deficiency (<200 lg/l) was found in 15% of the study participants in the dry, 25% in the rainy and 32% in the cold season. Retinol levels varied according to age, sex, level of milk consumption and pooled cattle milk retinol level. Effect sizes varied and not all were statistically significantly different. Pooled cattle milk retinol levels varied seasonally and were positively associated to human retinol levels.",

Prevalence of co-existence of ESBLs, MBLs with AmpC-b-lactamases in bacteria is serious threat in the treatment of bacterial infections. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of AmpC-b-lactamases, VIM, TEM and SHV type of b-lactamases in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from hospitals of Khorram abad, Iran. Materials and Methods Resistance to different antibiotics was determined by using standard disk diffusion method. ESBLs, MBLs and AmpC-b-lactamases were detected by combined disk method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to determine bla TEM , bla SHV and bla VIM genes. Results Out of the 130 isolates, 41 (31.5%) and 37 (28.4%) isolates of producing ESBLs and AmpC-b-lactamases, respectively. The obtained results by PCR revealed that bla TEM and bla SHV among isolates were 24 (18.4) and 23 (17.6%) respectively. Conclusions b-lactam therapy can be failed when blactamases-hyper-producing organisms appear in an infection. Outbreak of isolates co-expressing AmpC-b-lactamases, MBLs and ESBLs can cause serious problems in future regarding the treatment of infections caused by these common enteric pathogens.

Korzeniewski Department of Epidemiology & Tropical Medicine, Military Institute of Medicine, Gdynia, Poland Background The Central African Republic (CAR) community, living in poor socioeconomic conditions is estimated to be a population with a high rate of intestinal parasitic infections. One of the ethnic groups living in CAR are Aka Pygmies, in whom the prevalence of infections with intestinal helminths and protozoa remains unknown. Similarly, non-Pygmy population residing in south-western CAR, in the same region as the Pygmy tribes, is treated on the basis of clinical symptoms rather than parasitological diagnostics. The aim of the study was to present the prevalence of intestinal parasites in the population of Pygmies and non-Pygmies inhabiting the Central African Republic. Material and methods In total, 3159 Pygmies and non-Pygmies (children 0-17 years 70.9%, females 55.6%) from the region of Bagandou (prefecture Lobaye) and Monassao (prefecture Sangho) were examined in the period December 2014-April 2015: 415 Aka Pygmies from Monassao, 537 Aka Pygmies and 2207 non-Pygmies from Bagandou. Single stool samples were collected from each patient, fixed in 10% formalin, and transported to the Military Institute of Medicine in Poland, where they were examined using one basic diagnostic method in light microscopy (direct smear in Lugol 0 s solution). Results Pathogenic intestinal parasite infections were detected in 76.6% of Pygmies from Monassao, 84.7% of Pygmies and 48.0% of non-Pygmies from Bagandou. The most common pathogens detected in the studied individuals were Ascaris lubricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale/Necator americanus, and Giardia intestinalis which were detected in 952 Pygmies from Monassao and Bagandou (57.0%, 39.7%, and 15.3% of infections respectively); Giardia intestinalis (21.0%), Ascaris lubricoides (17.0%), and Ancylostoma duodenale/Necator americanus (13.7%) detected in 2207 non-Pygmies from Bagandou. Conclusions The parasitological examination focused on the prevalence of intestinal parasites and revealed high rates of infections both in Pygmies and non-Pygmies in Central African Republic, which suggests a necessity of periodic deworming according to the results obtained in the local population.

Yet, resulting morbidity patterns due to multi-helminth infections are poorly understood. In Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Opisthorchis viverrini, Schistosoma mekongi and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are co-endemic and multiple-species helminth infections are common. We present findings from cross-sectional surveys examining the association of single and multiple species helminth infections of different intensities with hepatobiliary and intestinal morbidity, nutritional status and anemia.MethodsThe studies were carried out in Vientiane, Savannakhet and Champasack province where O. viverrini and STHs are endemic. S. mekongi is co-endemic in Champasack. Morbidity was assessed by questionnaire asking for self-reported signs and symptoms, coupled with clinical examination and assessment of nutritional status [i.e. body mass index (BMI)] and anemia (using a hemoglobinometer). Ultrasound examination was performed to assess liver morbidity. Stool samples were subjected to the Kato-Katz and formalin-ether concentration technique (FECT) for the diagnosis of helminth infections. Logistic regression analysis was employed to associate infection status with morbidity indicators and anemia.",

In the Republic of Guinea, there is evidence of ongoing LF transmission with the exception of the most densely populated parts of the country, including the capital Conakry. The aim of this study was to determine whether transmission of LF occurs in Conakry to foster LF control and elimination efforts. Methods The prevalence of circulating filarial antigen of Wuchereria bancrofti was assessed by Immunochromatography card test (ICT) in 611 people recruited from all five districts of Conakry. Mosquitoes were collected by means of exit traps and pyrethrum knock-down spray sheet collections monthly over a 1year period. A random sample of mosquitoes were dissected and examined for W. bancrofti larvae, while the remainder were analysed by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of W. bancrofti DNA. Interviews were conducted to establish migration status of elephantiasis patients. Results Circulating filarial antigen test revealed no infection in the 611 humans examined. A total of 14 334 mosquitoes were collected; mainly Culex (n = 14 135; 98.6%) and a small number of Anopheles (n = 161; 1.1%). Out of the 1312 Culex spp. (9.3%) and 51 A. gambiae (31.7%) dissected, none was infected with any stage of W. bancrofti. However, the LAMP assay revealed that 1.8% of A. gambiae and 0.3% of Culex spp. were positive, while PCR determined respective prevalences of nile and 0.2%. 23 subjects infected with elephantiasis of the leg were interviewed, of which 18 (78.3%) originated from regions other than Conakry. Conclusion This study revealed the presence of W. bancrofti DNA in mosquitoes, despite the apparent absence of infection in the human population. Even if the infection rate in A. gambiae determined by LAMP may be considered too high to completely rule out transmission, the number of samples analysed was quite low. To focus the study on areas where high infection rates were observed, in combination with increased sample size could provide more specific insight on the LF infection level in Conakry.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.PS2.041Critical appraisal of global burden of disease studies: experiences and findings from working on estimates for foodborne trematodiasesT.

No significant differences in pharmacokinetics parameters were observed among groups. POPPK model parameter estimates were as follows, expressed as median value and inter-individual variability(IIV): Ka (absorption): 0.9/h (84%), V central : 44.4 l (15.3%); Cl 0.89 l/h (24.8%); Q: 15.7 l/h. (27.5%); V periph : 239 l (42.4%). Residual error: 28.8%. Conclusions This study describes for the first time the POPPK of RAV after oral E1224 administration for treatment of patients with CD. POPPK parameters were consistent with the pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug in other populations. Systemic exposure reached expected concentrations in all three groups, steady state was reached after the third dose, and trough concentrations were stable during the weekly dosing period.

Molina 1 1 Infectious Diseases, Barcelona, Spain; 2 Microbiology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, PROSICS Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; 3 Immunology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, SpainIntroduction Helminth infections are highly prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, coexisting in Chagas disease (CD) endemic areas. It is known that helminth infections in humans may modulate the host immune system, changing the Th1/Th2 polarization. This immunological disturbance could modify the immune response to other infections, such as Trypanosoma cruzi infection. This study aims to evaluate the impact of helminth infection on clinical presentation and parasitaemia of CD patients.Material and Methods A prospective observational study was performed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital. Inclusion criteria: age over 18 years, diagnosis of CD, and not having received specific treatment for CD previously to the inclusion. The study protocol included: blood cell count, detection of T. cruzi parasitaemia measured by real time PCR (rt-PCR), detection of IgG anti-S. stercoralis by ELISA, 12-lead electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, barium enema, microscopic examination of stool samples from three different days using direct techniques and after concentration techniques (Ritchie's formalin-ether technique), and specific faecal culture for S. stercoralis larvae. Definition of helminth infection included:confirmed infections through direct observation, and probable infection (presence of eosinophilia and positive S. stercoralis serology in the absence of other causes of eosinophilia).Results Overall, 65 patients were included, the median age was 38 (range 18-67) years, 49 (75.4%) were women and most of them came from Bolivia (96.9%). Median time of residence in our country was 9 (1-14) years. Cardiac involvement was present in 12 (18.5%) patients and digestive involvement in 18 (27.7%). T. cruzi rt-PCR was positive in 28 (43.1%) patients. Helminth infection was diagnosed in 12 (18.5%) patients: 2 confirmed infections (Hymenolepis nana and S. stercoralis) and 10 probable infections. No differences were observed in cardiac and digestive involvement between patients with and without helminth infection. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients with positive T. cruzi rt-PCR was higher among patients with heminth infection compared with patients without helminth infection (75% vs. 35.8%, P = 0.022).Conclusions Helminth infection is frequent among patients with CD. The proportion of patients with positive T. cruzi rt-PCR is higher among patients with a coexisting helminth infection, probably due to the immunomodulatory effects of the helminths.",

Since then, cases have spread within the Kingdom and some cases were transmitted to other Middle Eastern countries, Europe and the United States. However, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) remains the epicenter of this serious respiratory infection that is associated with high mortality rates. This accentuates the public health concerns because Saudi Arabia receives millions of pilgrims from all over the world. Aims This study investigated the attitudes and degree of awareness about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-Cov) among Saudis of different ages. Patients and methods Structured anonymous closed ended dichometous questionnaires were distributed to a large population of Saudi men and women of different ages. The questionnaires included questions about modes of transmission of corona virus, clinical features, outcome of infection, the impact of infection on pilgrimage, methods of prevention, the governmental efforts to combat spread, the availability of information.",

However, the near eradication of this species resulted in a reduction of entomological surveillance and control programs. Several native triatomine species of epidemiological importance are now emerging in Brazil. Triatoma brasiliensis is currently of major concern in the Northeast because it readily infests human dwellings, even after all traditional control efforts. Searches for this vector were conducted in five rural municipalities (Cajazeiras-PB [CJ], Santa Terezinha-PB [ST], S.J.

In some districts of its urban area, native triatomine bugs are found in intradomiciles, often carrying high levels of infection of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. This work aims to analyze the spread and natural infection of triatomine species caught within the urban area of Sobral in recent years. Materials and Methods The study includes all available data from the routine surveillance at the Zoonosis Control Center (ZCC), from 2010 to 2014. We analyzed the site of capture, the number of triatomine individuals, and the species (data from Triatomine Information Stations -PITsinstalled in primary health care units). The triatomine natural T. cruzi infection was verified by abdominal compression and fresh examination of the insect feces by optical microscopy (160X). We calculate overall index of natural infection by the ratio between the number of infected and the number of examined triatomines. The sites of triatomine captures were georeferenced through Google Earth and database geoprocessed with ArcGIS software (version 10.3).",

Xpert MTB/RIF. Of the 918 inmates found out in the prison, we collected 350 sputum specimens. Among the 336 specimens tested, we retrieved 147 TB cases and 14 TB rifampicin resistant (TB-RR) cases. All TB and TB-RR have been put in treatment. However, these numbers are expected to change on the rise. With overcrowded conditions, poor ventilation, and malnutrition, the risk of ongoing spread is still very high.Methods An ethno-botanical survey was carried out among traditional healers and/or practitioners of Sahel region by using questionnaires. Vernacular and scientific names of plants used in the treatment of malaria and/or against mosquitoes were recorded by administering to the participants the questionnaires.Conclusion The Sahel showed a panel of plants locally used against the parasites but also against the vectors that can be investigated in the discovery and development of new drugs. Population-related variables and nets-related variables were assessed by direct observation of housing conditions and a survey to the householders. A previous insecticide treated nets distribution and malaria training was performed in June and September of 2012 by an international NGO.Conclusion For an effective distribution of mosquito nets, campaigns should incorporate training programs, both about malaria key facts and the proper placement and maintenance of nets. Distribution campaigns should also incorporate a subsequent monitoring in order to identify weaknesses that need to be strengthened and to ensure its durability over time.",

Although the WHO definition is often used in Guinea, a challenge of identifying EVD patients is that different clinical case definitions are used in the field. Utilizing the Guinea EVD dataset, an analysis of the CDC and WHO clinical case definitions was conducted to assess their ability to predict laboratory confirmed EVD cases.Conclusions The CDC clinical case definition performed better in identifying laboratory confirmed EVD cases but misclassified non-cases while the WHO definition, while missing many laboratory confirmed cases, identified more non-cases. Differences may reflect objectives of the case definitions such as identifying more cases (CDC) or identifying non-cases (WHO).

A new rapid test detecting Circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) of Schistosoma mansoni in urine was commercialized. CCA seems to have same sensibility as Kato-Katz method in affected areas. and Materials 45 Egyptian patients, with a known positive serology for Schistosoma and increased total IgE, were assessed for CCA (A&B rapid test schistosomiasis Ag, Lucca Italy) from February 2014 till March 2015 in San Raffaele Hospital, Milan.Five subjects never exposed to Schistosoma were identified as negative controls, while 10 patients with active schistosomiasis diagnosed in Saint Michel Centre (Central African Republic) were included as positive controls. Among 45 Subjects, 43 received specific treatment. As expected, 5/5 negative controls had negative CCA test, while all positive ones were CCA-positive. 45 patients were tested for CCA. All treated patients yield negative results. 2 untreated patients were positive to CCA test and were subsequently treated with praziquantel 40 mg/kg/die (2 doses for 3 days). Following treatment CCA test became negative in both patients. Schistosoma serology for one CCA-positive patient was tested, with discordant results, in 3 different hospital laboratories of Milan (S. Raffaele, Niguarda and Policlinico Hospitals). Total IgE measurements were in range for all laboratories. Finally, all patients who had already received one or more treatment courses with praziquantel tested negative for CCA, albeit with a serology still positive for Schistosoma. This preliminary data seems to confirm CCA test sensitivity and specificity for Schistosoma mansoni active infestation. In patients already treated for Schistosoma, a negative CCA-test associated with positive serology, regardless of total IgE values, may represent a sign of previous infection, with a long-lasting immunological memory. On the contrary, patients who never received treatment had both positive serology and CCA-test, suggesting an active infestation. Moreover, negativization of CCA test after specific treatment with praziquantel further supports these findings. Further studies are needed to better assess the role of rapid CCA test to avoid unnecessary treatment of patients with persistent positive Schistosoma serology.Development of a Markov transition probability model to predict changes in schistosomiasis infection following treatmentA.

HCAI definitions were adapted from those of Centers of Disease Control. No microbiology testing was used because of very limited availability and reliability of microbial culturing. Results HCAI prevalence among women was higher in CS versus vaginal birth (VB) -6.6 AE 6.2% vs. 2.4 AE 1.9% (OR 2.9, CI 0.8-10.7) in study I, and 8.0 AE 6.1% vs. 2.6 AE 2.1% (OR 3.2, CI 1.0-10.3) in study II.

Conclusions HCAI was numerically lower among newborns in 2014 vs. 2013, particularly in LBW babies (16.2% vs. 8.3%, P > 0.05) suggesting that changing practices may have had an impact on reduction of HCAI.

In Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) information on S. stercoralis infection is scarce. Most data on S. stercoralis stem from studies examining other intestinal helminths infections using diagnostic tests with a low sensitivity for S. stercoralis diagnosis. We assessed S. stercoralis infection by using a high sensitivity diagnostic test and examined associated risk factors and symptoms on the Mekong islands, Southern Lao PDR. Methods Baermann and Kato-Katz techniques were performed on two stool samples from each individual to detect S. stercoralis larvae and concomitant helminth infections. Exposure to potential risk factors was assessed with a questionnaire. Results Among 729 individuals, 41.0% were infected with S. stercoralis. Men were at higher risk than women (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.45-2.67). Urticaria and body itching was associated with S. stercoralis infection (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.42-4.05). Infection with Opisthorchis viverrini (72.2%), Schistosoma mekongi (12.8%), and hookworm (56.1%) were very common. Few infections with Trichuris trichiura (3.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.3%) and Taenia spp. (0.3%) were detected. The majority of helminth infections were of light intensity, with infection rates of 80.4%, 92.9%, 64.5%, 100% and 100%, for O. viverrini, hookworm, S. mekongi, T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides, respectively. Nevertheless, heavy infection intensities were observed for O. viverrini (1.0%), S. mekongi (14.0%) and hookworm (2.9%).

S. Katpattil Public Health Dentistry, Yenepoya University, Mangalore, India Background Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is the most serious type of viral hepatitis. About 400 million people have the virus, with most of these people living in Asia. Clearly, this is a significant public health and medical problem. With this background, the study was conducted to evaluate knowledge and attitude regarding HBV (Hepatitis B virus) infection and its vaccine among the patients attending tertiary care hospital.ResultsIn all, 856 patients (698 male and 158 female) were studied. 50% of those who were aware had no knowledge about route of transmission, infectivity, or importance of vaccination. Educated individuals were more aware about hepatitis B vaccine (P < 0.05). The percentage of vaccination was 25% among study subjects. Lack of awareness was the common reason for nonvaccination (50%); of them.Conclusions Knowledge of Hepatitis B disease and vaccine was low and misconceptions were common. About one third of the population are vaccinated for hepatitis B. Emphasis should especially be laid on awareness campaigns to educate the public that hepatitis B is vaccine preventable disease.

Ecuadorians, Colombians and Bolivians are commonest nationalities in Spain. Immigrants may carry some infectious disease as a result of higher prevalence in their country of origin, exposures and conditions during migration and resettlement. Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and intestinal parasitosis infections are endemic in most of the Latin American countries. Due to the worldwide population mobility from Latin American, these diseases are being diagnosed in non-endemic areas. The aim of this study is to describe epidemiological, clinical and intestinal parasitosis infections and their relationship with Chagas disease in Bolivian immigrants living in our area.Methodology This is a retrospective review of Bolivian people who visited the International Health Unit of Barcelona (IHUB), Hospital Vall Hebron-Spain, from January 2011 to December 2012. A descriptive analysis was done of the variables: sex, age, immigrants or VFR (immigrants visiting friends or relatives), attendance reason, length of stay in Europe, T.cruzi serology, and presence of intestinal parasites.",

Screening for blood-borne viral infections is crucial to prevent its transmission, and to diagnose and treat infected individuals. All different blood donors older than 15 years attending a General Hospital in Gambo, Ethiopia, from 2007 to 2012 were reviewed. Blood antibodies for HIV and HCV, and S antigen for HBV were determined by corresponding rapid tests in all instances.Results A total of 2789 patients had their blood tested before donation; mean age was 30 AE 10 years-old and 80.65% were male. A total of 19, 138 and 44 patients had positive HIV, HBV or HCV serology respectively. Overall prevalences were 0.73% (95% CI, 0.45-1.16) for HIV, 6.45% (95% CI, 5.46-7.59) for HBV and 1.98% (95% CI, 1.46-2.67) for HCV. Only HBV infection was more common among men as compared to women (7.01 vs. 4.33%, P = 0.04). The proportion of HIV patients with HBV and HCV positive serology was 21.05 and 5.26%. Screening of blood products before donation should be mandatory to prevent transmission of HIV, HBV and HCV. The high prevalence of HBV infection, particularly among otherwise healthy men and HIV patients, recommends better implementation of HBV vaccination programs and workup of viral and liver test to indicate anti-HBV therapy.",

Screening for HAT has been carried out with the card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) which is limited by its requirement for cold storage, electricity and its multi-test packaging format.Recently, Standard Diagnostics (SD)/Alere developed an individually formatted and thermostable rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Evaluation studies found that the SD BIOLINE HAT RDT prototype was less sensitive and specific than CATT. The prototype was optimized and we present a study to evaluate the performance of CATT and the optimized RDT in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The study followed a clinical trial format. Participants were enrolled actively by four mobile teams, and passively at four healthcare facilities in three provinces. Each participant was tested with the RDT and CATT and each test was read by two independent readers. Participants positive by CATT were retested with CATT on 1:8 diluted plasma (CATT 1:8) , and positives to CATT or RDT were tested by visual inspection for motile parasites in body fluids (on lymph node aspirate, on blood or cerebrospinal fluid). Cases were those with visible parasites and controls had no visible parasites or history of HAT. Results were analysed in four algorithms -RDT and CATT as standalone tests and each test followed by CATT 1:8.During 5 months 131 cases and 13 527 controls were enrolled. The sensitivity of the RDT was 92.0% [95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 86.1, 95.5], and was significantly higher than CATT, which was 69.1% (95% CIs = 60.7, 76.4). The sensitivity of all the algorithms decreased when followed by CATT 1:8, to 52.8% (95% CIs = 44.1, 61.3) for the RDT and 59.2% (95% CIs = 50.4, 67.4) for CATT. The specificity of the RDT was 97.1% (95% CIs = 96. 8-97.4) , significantly lower than CATT which was 98.0% (95% CIs = 97.8, 98.2). Specificity was over 99.5% when a positive screening test was retested with CATT 1:8. Sensitivity and specificity for both screening tests were non-significantly higher in passive than active screening. Agreement between readers was very good.This study has demonstrated that an algorithm in which the SD BIOLINE HAT RDT is used for screening is optimal for case detection in both passive and active screening settings. However, its lower specificity will increase the burden on screening teams by generating more false positives.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

The procurement of high-risk medical devices influences long-term clinical results. Quality of care can be influenced in terms of clinical practice of medical devices respectively underlying procurement process practices. The main research objective of this project was to understand the relationship between procurement processes for orthopaedic medical devices and clinical practice in three European countries as well as Mexico.Methods 59 interviews of different stakeholders were performed in four countries to assess procurement processes of orthopaedic devices. Interviews took place in Mexico (n = 24, 40.6%), Switzerland (n = 14, 23.8%), UK and Germany (each n = 10, 17.0%). One interviewee represented the EU. 23 (39.0%) participants were government officials, 19 (32.2%) were hospital staff or medical supplier, and 17 (28.8%) were surgeons. An analytical conceptual model was applied to determine differences across countries and across stakeholders.Results Respondents emphasized the close interrelationship between procurement process and clinical practice. If disconnected, it negatively impacts the quality of the rendered service, clinical use and clinical efficacy of medical devices. The four countries differed in their purchase strategy and in the way in which the procurement processes involved the surgeon in decision-making. In Mexico (tendering) and Germany (buying syndicates) price partially overrules important factors related to clinical practice. Surgeons' needs and participation in decisionmaking are disregarded and limited. In Switzerland and UK, selfregulating processes prevail. Surgeons, suppliers, and government officials shared similar opinions. Differences were derived from stakeholders with a focus on regulatory or strategic health care provision. This was peculiar for Mexico. Only government officials with advisory function emphasized findings on procurement strongly.Conclusions An understanding of opinions and experiences of stakeholders having certain powers to influence procurement process practices in Mexico based on programmes improving quality or increasing the use of clinical evidence is missing. The assessment of the relationship between procurement process interrelations and quality of care will help to improve the purchase of medical devices in general and the purchase of orthopaedic medical devices in particular.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

Therefore we interviewed 1130 people and 164 doctors in both Kocaeli and D\u20ac usseldorf.36.3% of the Turks living in D\u20ac usseldorf who participated in this research said that they preferred to converse with their doctors in German, 33.3% in Turkish and 27.2% stated no preference. This result appears to be a level indicator of the extent to which Turks are integrated in Germany and German health system. Getting medicine from a pharmacy, consulting a mosque hodja and trying a folk remedy are rare in both groups, but more frequent in D\u20ac usseldorf than in Kocaeli.One of the striking results in this study is that 11.5% of the Turks who live in D\u20ac usseldorf and 17.8% of those living in Kocaeli do not believe that the physicians can actually heal.30.4% of the Turks who live in D\u20ac usseldorf had never been to a physician for a general check-up; in Kocaeli, up to 70%.The results of this study and the data gathered show that the attitude of the Turks living in Kocaeli and D\u20ac usseldorf to the medical facilities is firstly affected by the health system itself.

Our results confirm a high rate of seroprevalence for T. cruzi and S. stercoralis antibodies among South America people. Our results suggest that blood banks and transplantations networks dealing with patients from Latin America should implement screening protocol for CD. Considering the high percentage of occult Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This is an endemic disease in the Americas, but increased migration to Europe has made it emerge in countries where it was previously unknown, being Spain the second non endemic country in number of patients. T.cruzi is a parasite with a wide genetic diversity, which has been grouped by consensus into six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), with a seventh emerging genotype called TcBat also affecting humans. Some authors have linked these DTUs either to a specific epidemiological context or to the different clinical presentations. Our main objective was to describe the T.cruzi DTUs isolated from a population of chronically infected Latin American migrants attending a reference clinic in Madrid. In addition we determined DTUs after treatment in a subset of patients. 149 patients meeting this condition were selected for the study. Molecular characterization was performed by an algorithm that combines PCR of the intergenic region of the mini exon-gene, the 24Sa and 18S regions of rDNA and the variable region of the satellite DNA. A descriptive analysis was performed and associations between geographical/clinical data and the different DTUs were tested. DTUs could be determined in 105 out of 149 patients, 93.3% were from Bolivia, 67.7% were women and median age was 35 years (IQR 29-44). The most common DTU found was TcV (58; 55.2%), followed by TcIV (17; 16.2%), TcII (10; 9.5%) and TcI (4; 3.8%). TcIII and TcVI were not isolated from any patient, and 15.2% patients presented mixed infections. Additionally, 57% patients had different DTUs before and after treatment. No relationship was found before geographical origin or clinical spectrum. DTUs distribution from this study indicate active transmission of T.cruzi is occurring in Bolivia, in both domestic and sylvatic cycles. TcIV was confirmed as a cause of chronic human disease. The current results indicate no correlation between DTU and any specific clinical presentation associated with Chagas disease. Treatment with benznidazole does not always clear T.cruzi's genetic material from blood, and DTUs detected in the same patient may vary over time indicating that polyparasitism is frequent.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

Thus, we analysed the potential risk of parasite transfer, regarding to serological result and the time of the last stay.Methods and Materials 377 individuals with previous stays in endemic areas of malaria, with or without malaria medical history were included in this study. We analysed serological reactivity against Plasmodium spp. in plasma samples using a serological test (MALARIA EIA TEST KIT \u00e2 , BioRad-USA). We compared the approval and rejection rates of potential blood donors.Results Blood donations are allowed in the following situations:1. Individuals who lived the first 5 years of life in an endemic country: 3 years after their return (clinical criterion -CC) or 4 months if serological test is negative (serological criterion -SC) (n = 65): 1.1) SC: 75% of the individuals were serological negative, allowing blood donation; 1.2) CC: 58.5% of individuals would be approved. However, from these, 15.4% presented a reactive result.2. Asymptomatic visitants of endemic areas (stays less than 1 year in endemic areas): 1 year after their return (CC) or 4 months if serological test is negative (SC) (n = 177): 2.1) SC: all individuals would be approved, due to their negative serological result; 2.2) CC: 62.1% of individuals would be approved.

It mainly affects the liver but may also involve other organs, such as the lungs. Isolated pulmonary echinococcosis is a rare condition and Introduction Up to 50% of short-stay travelers in developing countries will have health problems. Nearly 274 000 aid workers were deployed in 2010, around the world, but no data on the characteristics of the medical travel kit (TK) or its use we have.Methods and Materials A descriptive study using questionnaire designed for students of tropical medicine 2007-2014, in cooperation practices in the Oromia, Ethiopia. The questionnaire was structured into nine sections according to the item. Statistical analysis with SPSS version 21.0 software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA) and Epiinfo seven were conducted. TK composition was analyzed, using (own or another partner) and intend to repeat in the future TK.Results Eight courses, 159 individuals, 140 invitations to participate with 89 (64%) completed questionnaires were performed.Participant analysis: The most common age group was 30-34 years (43.8%) and female gender (76.4%). Participants were physicians (n = 65; 73%); laboratory professionals (n = 17; 19) and seven nurses (7.9%). The minimum stay was 15 days (75%), 1 month (n = 11) and 3 months (n = 11).TK analysis, carried/using articles: Sections more carried were analgesia (95.5%), prevention of bites (94.3%), dermatological compounds (94.3%) and antibiotics (93.2). The main items used were: Analgesia, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (55.3%) and paracetamol (44%); Dermatology, protective sun cream (70.6%); Digestive, inhibitors of proton pump (PPIs) (39.6%); Respiratory, inhaled corticosteroids (44.4%); Ophthalmology, contact lens products (78.1%); Antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (23.5%); Malaria prophylaxis, atovaquone-proguanil (45%); Bite protection: repellent (74.6%); Dressing materials, below 10%. TK analysis, repeat on another journey: The mean level of repetition was 87%. Only tramadol (50%), antihistaminic H2 (42.8), nasal corticosteroids (50%) and citronella (50%) get lower data. The intention of repeating is related to the fact of having carried an article on 15 items with P < 0.000, but only up seven related with the use of them. Brucella, a gram-negative bacterium, is classified as potential bio terrorism agent mainly due to the low infection dose needed and the ability to transmit the bacteria via aerosols. The six classical Brucella species are B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, B. canis, B. ovis and B. neotomae preferentially infecting goats and sheep, cattle, pigs, dogs, sheep and rodents, respectively, with B. melitensis and B. abortus causing most of the human cases. According to international bio defense regulations, immunological assays are required to complement molecular detection systems for potential bio terror agents. Our aim was to specifically detect Brucellae with 'smooth' lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through a highly sensitive monoclonal antibody (mAb) based immunological assay. Sets of mAbs specific for the LPS O antigen of Bru-cella spp. were generated by immunization of mice with inactivated B. melitensis or B. abortus cells. Both B. melitensis and B. abortus were recognized by most mAbs and antigen binding was not impeded by inactivation of the bacterial cells by c irradiation, formalin or heat treatment. The combination of mAbs most suitable for an antigen capture assay format was identified and an immunoassay using the Luminex xMAP technology was developed recognizing all tested Brucella species with 'smooth' LPS with detection limits of 2 9 10 2 to 8 9 10 4 cells/ ml depending on the tested species. Furthermore, Brucella spp. cells were identified successfully within spiked milk samples using the Luminex assay. In addition a simultaneous, rapid and precise detection of Brucella spp., Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis within a single sample could be allowed by integrating the bead-based immunoassay into a multiplex format. Overall, the developed robust Luminex assay should allow for the detection of Brucella spp. both in natural outbreak and in bio threat situations.",

However, pork may contain high levels of microbial contamination such as Salmonella and Escherichia coli which might cause harm to consumers. To determine microbial contamination along the pork value chain, we collected 216 samples from 72 pig farms (floor swab, drinking and waste water), 545 from 49 slaughterhouses (carcass swab, lymph node, rectal feces, floor swab and washing water) and 514 from 220 pork shops in the informal markets (pork cuts, ground pork and cutting board swab) in two provinces of Vietnam (Hung Yen and Nghe An). Samples were analyzed to detect qualitatively and quantitatively Salmonella and E. coli. Overall prevalence of Salmonella combined from all types of above mentioned samples at pig farms, slaughterhouses and pork shops were 35%, 30% and 37%, respectively. Salmonella contamination in the final product (pork at market) was 45% and an average concentration of 9 MPN/g was recorded. E. coli average load along different points of the chain was 5.3 AE 1.4 (farm floor swabs), 2.9 AE 0.9 (carcass swabs), 3.1 AE 1.0 (slaughterhouse floor swabs), and 3.3 AE 1.1 (market shop cutting board swabs) logCFU/cm 2 , whereas pork from the market had 3.4 AE 0.9 logCFU/g. Demonstrated high levels of Salmonella in the final product (pork at market) induces the potential health risks for the consumers. High values for E. coli indicates general poor hygiene along the chain. Appropriate hygiene practices and management are required to achieve better pork quality and reduce the risk for the consumer. These data will serve as inputs for health risk assessments related to pork consumption.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.This study was conducted to evaluate milk handling processes in smallholder dairy farms in Rombo district.

In the present study, an eco-friendly process for the synthesis of nanoparticle, using a plant (Argemone mexicana) has been attempted. The plant crude extract was used for the biosynthesis of Ag-NPs. The aqueous silver ions (Ag+) were reduced to silver metal nanoparticles (Ag m-NPs), when treated with the plant extract. After 24 h of treatment, silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) were obtained. These Ag-NPs were characterized by UV-Vis, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were used to identify these NPs. The nanoparticles exhibited maximum absorbance peak at 420 nm in UV-Vis spectroscopy. The NPs surface morphology revealed from SEM images shows formation of well-dispersed Ag-NPs of 50 nm, and the presence of silver was confirmed by EDX and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The efficacy of mycosynthesized AgNPs tested concentrations of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 ppm against L1 to L4 instar larvae and pupae of Aedes aegypti; LC50 (LC90) values are 7.29 (13.29);6.54 (14.28);5.47 (13.89);4.93 (15.93) and 4.43 (20.23) in larvae and LC50 (LC90) values was 4.64 (19.45) in pupae, respectively. The mortality rates were positively correlated with the concentration of AgNPs. The microbes selected for the present study for the antibacterial activity were E. coli, P. aeroginosa, B. cereus, Enterococci, E. aerogens.

NASA's current and planned satellite missions provide measurements of the critical environmental measures environmental state functions important to vector and disease life cycles such as precipitation, soil moisture, temperature, vapor pressure deficits, wet/dry edges, and solar radiation. Satellite data provide landscape scale process functions represented by land use/cover mapping and actual measurements of ecological functions/structure: canopy cover, species, phenology, and aquatic plant coverage. These measurements are taken in a spatial context and provide a time series of data to track changes in time.Global public health is entering a new informational age through the use of spatial models of disease vector/host ecologies driven by the use of remotely sensed data to measure environmental and structural factors critical in determining disease vector habitats, distributions, life cycles, and host interactions. The vector habitat microclimates can be quantified in terms of the surface energy budget measured by satellites. The epidemiological equations (processes) can be adapted and modified to explicitly incorporate environmental factors and interfaces required by a specific disease and its vector/host cycle. Remote sensing can be used to measure or evaluate or estimate both environment (state functions) and interface (process functions).

Dengue is a viral disease that is quite common in tropical countries. The diagnosis of Dengue is done by eliminating other possible causes of the observed symptoms, a direct antibody diagnosis becomes possible only after several days into the disease. Hence, for the first days, a patient is either not treated (not strong enough symptoms) or treated 'on suspicion'. A method for early identification of dengue is desired.The blood is the main means of transport inside the human body, not only for proteins (like antibodies), but also for small molecules. Due to changes in their metabolism, infected cells could be producing different secondary metabolites, which will show up in the blood plasma. These changes should appear quickly, faster than antibodies. Blood plasma has been extensively studied by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and many small molecules can be associated to certain NMR signals.In our study we analyzed blood plasma from healthy and infected subjects using proton NMR. The samples were all filtered with 3 kDa filters, freeze-dried and resuspended in D 2 O. The resulting 1D NOE spectra were then subjected to an extensive Principal Components Analysis (PCA), in order to obtain a differentiation. Signal ranges that showed significant changes within the same group were excluded for the PCA, as were glucose signals.Our PCA model was then applied to the classification of additional samples. With the exception of one all samples were correctly classified; the wrong one was actually marked as being 'out of the model', meaning that a proper classification was impossible. It turns out that Principal Component 2 (PC2) is the most important component for the differentiation between healthy and infected subjects, whereas PC1, PC3 and PC4 do not contribute to the differentiation. From the PCA model we can identify the most important regions responsible for that result, mainly around 1.92 ppm and 3.38 ppm, and then verify within the NMR spectra the responsible peaks.According to assignments published in the literature for blood plasma we can associate the varying signals to a series of compounds: proline, lysine, arginine, acetate, treonine, b-glucose, pyruvate, citroline, glutamine, isoleucine and other smaller ones. Currently we are trying to establish a connection between the observed signal changes and known body reactions.Disclosure Nothing to disclose. ",

Bates Capacity Research Unit, Department of International Public Health, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, UK Introduction In order to improve health in low-and middle-income countries, it is necessary to improve the local research capacity. Building doctoral training is a well-recognised way to do this so the Malaria Capacity Development Consortium has supported African universities, PhD students and postdocs to strengthen malaria research capacity in Africa.A team of researchers visited the five African MCDC partner universities in 2009 to assess their capacity for PhD programmes. An extensive literature search was undertaken to develop a comprehensive benchmark which included all the policies, processes and facilities needed to run doctoral programmes.Methods Capacity of the institutions was compared against the benchmark and recommendations provided to the institutions which they used to develop action plans to address the gaps and proactively manage institutional capacity strengthening. Follow up site visits to assess progress and update the recommendations were carried out in 2012. In 2014, indepth phone/Skype interviews with key stakeholders within each institution were conducted. Information was obtained about progress made since 2012, the processes which had enabled or prevented this progress to be made and the sustainability of any progress, as well as an evaluation of the methods utilised by the research team in guiding capacity strengthening.Results All the universities demonstrably built capacity in some areas, especially in the development of the PhD Handbook, IT/library access and development of student supervision. Least progress was made in establishing a PhD programme evaluation processes. Stakeholders felt that the evaluation process complemented and enhanced their own efforts in strengthening their doctoral programmes. Progress slowed down over time possibly because the easiest gaps to address were tackled first and because of infrequent formal reviews of progress.Conclusions In such complex programmes it is likely that some aspects will work better than others. By learning about what does not work well and why in research capacity strengthening programmes, and by focussing particularly on the areas which are hard to achieve, we can make such programmes more effective. The process for actively managing research capacity strengthening was highly effective and could be transferred to other contexts. However regular review, possibly in collaboration with external agencies, is likely to help to retain momentum.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

To be coherent with the values of Global Health (GH), we believe that there is a need for an interdisciplinary approach integrated in the different curriculums which targets all students.Introduction Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc dependent endopeptidases, which are essential in extracellular matrix disruption and tissue remodelling. MMPs also play an important role in initiating immune responses to diverse pathogens by the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Phagocytosis of malaria pigment (haemozoin) induces increased MMP-9 activity in monocytes. In the present study, we examined whether a common functional MMP-9 promoter polymorphism (rs3918242, C-1562T) affects Plasmodium falciparum infection and its manifestation in 304 primiparous pregnant women from Ghana.Methods The MMP-9 C-1562T allele was genotyped by PCR-RFLP, and P. falciparum infection was diagnosed in placental blood samples by microscopy and PCR assays. Present or past infection was defined as the detection of parasitaemia or haemozoin by microscopy, or a positive PCR result. Low birth weight was defined as birth weight <2500 g, and preterm delivery as gestational age <37 weeks. Conclusions These data suggest that a common functional MMP-9 polymorphism is associated with a reduced risk of placental malaria, and thereby indicate that the MMP-9 pathway is involved in susceptibility to P. falciparum. Introduction Polymorphisms of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) modify innate immune responses and susceptibility to various infectious agents including malaria parasites. For the Indian subcontinent and Plasmodium vivax, the role of TLR polymorphisms is largely obscure. TLR 1 or TLR6 form heterodimer with TLR2 and recognize wide variety of ligands. We examined the role of polymorphisms in two central TLRs, namely, TLR1 I602S (rs5743618) and TLR6 S249P (rs5743810) in a case-control study among 473 individuals in India.",

After mass spectrometry, proteins were identified using the proteomic informed by transcriptomic method which combines deep sequencing transcriptomics and MS/MS allowing protein identification in the absence of a reference proteome. Proteomic results validated transcriptomic analysis and, the combination of these two approaches, provided strong support for the identification of relevant pathways in ticks. Based on these achievements we were able to select several genes for functional analysis which provided more information regarding the identification of antigens. Vaccination trials with recombinant antigens were conducted in cattle. The results showed both reduced tick infestation and parasite infection, strongly suggesting the involvement of selected proteins in vector-pathogen interactions, recommending its inclusion in a vaccine targeting both arthropods from diverse locations and multiple pathogens.By developing new vaccine-based control measures it will be possible, having the 'OneHealth' concept in mind, to decrease not only the incidence of tick animal diseases, but also reduce tick diseases in humans.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

Since the end of the nineties, there has been a significant expansion of public-private partnerships that address the health problems of low-and middle-income countries 1,2 . Product development partnerships (PDPs) have been established to focus on the research and development of new technologies to address priority health needs in poor countries. Bridging the gap between product development and end users, PDPs have been formed in response to insufficient development and supply of new health products for those diseases prevalent in developing countries, due to a lack of financial incentives and abundance of commercial risks for companies 3 . The PDPs manage a portfolio of projects, and through this mechanism have been able to form strong partnerships with private companies that are governed by formal agreements dealing with issues, including intellectual property, regulatory pathways, markets, manufacture, and price 4 . These agreements facilitate to establish rules of collaboration that can meet the differing and complementary goals of the partners.In this context, intellectual property (IP) management is of great concern as there are public and private perspectives as well as investments involved. The PDPs are risk averse, as funding depends on the development of new and accessible health technologies. The private sector also bears the commercial risk of investing capital and other resources in this process and this means that the private sector is holding and exercising IP rights over new technologies, thus creating constraints on public access to new technologies. This study aimed to review the patent portfolios of PDPs, considering that this information is crucial for understanding how PDPs are protecting (or not) the results of their R&D activities.",

Full course treatment with quality-assured (QA) ACT is critical to ensure parasite clearance and to protect artemisinin efficacy. We examine contemporary challenges to ensuring malaria treatment with QA ACT using national antimalarial market survey trend data collected by the ACTwatch project.Repeat cross-sectional malaria medicine outlet surveys were conducted between 2009 and 2014 in Benin, the DRC, Kenya, Madagascar, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. A census of public and private outlets with potential to distribute antimalarials was conducted among a representative sample of administrative units. A drug audit documented product information, retail price and amount distributed to consumers in the past week for all antimalarials in stock.While the relative antimalarial market share for the public versus private sector varies across countries, relative public/private market share remained stable over time within countries. QA ACT availability increased significantly in recent years with the exception of persistent low availability in the DRC. Increases in QA ACT market share relative to nAT varied widely across countries. Availability and distribution of non-QA ACT has emerged in recent years to varying degrees across countries. In all contexts, the vast majority of antimalarial-stocking private sector outlets including pharmacies, drug shops, and retailers continue to stock and distribute the nAT sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) available from numerous manufacturers. Private sector QA ACT price remains higher than SP, although price differentials vary across countries despite exposure to similar large-scale ACT subsidy schemes.One decade after shifts in national malaria treatment guidelines to ACT across SSA, challenges to QA ACT uptake persist. These include recent emergence of numerous non-QA ACTs; availability and widespread use of SP for case management; and the relatively high cost of QA ACT treatment despite implementation of large-scale subsidies. The presence and extent of each of these challenges varies across national contexts highlighting the importance of national assessments and tailored strategies.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

Achieving health equity requires a global action in support of building the limited evidence on health and its determinants from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This intentionally demands building capacity for mobilizing research in these countries. The INDEPTH Training and Research Centres of Excellence (INTREC), an EU FP7 project was established with the aim of undertaking capacity-building activities to facilitate research on the social determinants of health (SDH) in LMICs. Therefore, a six members' consortium initiated this coordination action project in Jan 2012, which is due to conclude in June 2015.INTREC activities covered recruiting a social scientist from each participating country of INDEPTH network, three from Africa (Tanzania, Ghana, South Africa) and four from Asia (Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia) who were trained to produce a standardized-format country needs assessment. These reports provided the basis for the subsequent development of the INTREC training curriculum, including five individual training blocks developed to cover qualitative and quantitative research methods. These were delivered sequentially in five educational blocks over a 12 month period during 2014. The first block was an online course of video lectures and assignments. The second block was a two-week methods workshop, held in both Indonesia (16 students) and Ghana (15 students). A oneweek data analysis workshop held at Harvard University comprised the third block, translating research findings to policy and practice comprised Block 4 and the final block had the students share their papers on the course website.The main result of the INTREC action is the development of a conceptual framework detailing how to build a sustainable capacity for research on SDH in LMICs; currently being developed using documentation produced. Furthermore, a total of 31 young researchers are now trained in SDH, and they themselves constitute a network that is promising to develop into the future.The findings indicate a pressing need for mentors who are available to support young researchers in these countries. Also, such a research capacity development has the potential for identifying critical areas requiring policy attention; contributing to health equity in the future.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

One of the key challenges, subsequently, is to secure the implementation of consistent health care provision with proven international practice guidelines for maternal and child health. Checklists with decision support derived from evidence-based interventions in RMNCH consist of vital elements of existing guidelines in a user-friendly format of actionable items. Checklist-based programs in primary healthcare are considered potential tools in translating evidence into high quality clinical practices, but suffer from a lack of evidence base to inform their use.Methods This ERC funded study is a two-armed cluster randomized trial conducted in primary healthcare centers in the West Bank of Palestine. It aims at a comparative assessment of structured electronic checklists of care in RMNCH against paper-based case notes. The intervention tool is the eRegistries for maternal and child health implemented within the DHIS2 Tracker software, developed in collaboration with the University of Oslo. eRegistries consists of an adaptable electronic platform of a series of indicators and core data based on the WHO's Essential Interventions, Commodities and Guidelines for RMNCH. Checklists for antenatal, postnatal care and care at birth within the eRegistry will be customized for Palestine, thereby serving the dual purpose of patient management and data capture.",

Both have advantages and disadvantages, but it is generally acknowledged that both approaches have value in assessing the response of species in general to climate change. Here, we compare and combine a previously developed dynamic, temperature-driven model (agent-based) of the temperature-sensitive stages of the Schistosoma mansoni and intermediate host snail lifecycles, with a statistical model of snail habitat suitability for eastern Africa. Baseline model output compared to empirical prevalence data suggests that the combined model performs better than a temperature driven model alone, and highlights the importance of including snail habitat suitability when modeling schistosomiasis risk. There was general agreement among models in predicting changes in risk, with 24-36% of the eastern Africa region predicted to experience an increase in risk with up-to 20% over the next 50 years. Vice versa the models predicted a general decrease in risk in 30-37% of the study area. We discuss the implications of the differences in the model assumptions and outputs for predicting the changes in risk as a result of increasing temperatures over the next 50 years. Finally, as the snail habitat suitability models suggest that anthropogenically altered habitat, such as dam developments, play a vital role for the current distribution of the intermediate snail host; we stress the importance of accounting for land use changes in models of climate change impact on schistosomiasis.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",

In the Philippines, preschool-age children (PSAC) are dewormed biannually through Garantisadong Pambata (GP) Program although data on its outcomes remain limited. Thus, this study was conducted to provide baseline parasitological and hemoglobin assessment on PSAC from selected municipalities in Masbate, a province with one of the lowest human development index (HDI).A total of 1224 PSAC from 39 barangays in four selected municipalities were included in this cross-sectional study which involved stool examination using the Kato Katz technique and hemoglobin determination using HemoCue 201+ analyzer.Overall cumulative STH prevalence and prevalence of moderate-heavy STH infections, which were 72% and 41%, respectively, failed to meet the targets of the Department of Health (DOH) and WHO and were comparable to the national average at baseline in 2004 prior the implementation of Integrated Helminth Control Program. Prevalence of STH co-infection was high with Ascaris-Trichuris co-infection being the most common at 40%. The same parameters were also high in barangays where community-led total sanitation is implemented and those declared as open defecation free. On the other hand, fifty percent of the PSAC have anemia.The deworming coverage rates in the two municipalities with the highest burden of STH infections, at 65.91% and 66.92%, were below the WHO and DOH targets of 75% and 85%, respectively.Background The aetiology of persistent digestive disorders in the tropics is poorly understood. Differential diagnosis is hampered by unspecific clinical findings and a lack of quality data on the epidemiology of key pathogens. The European research consortium NIDIAG pursues a multi-country study to investigate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that may give rise to persistent digestive disorders. Here, first results from a casecontrol study in Mali are presented.Methods We conducted a prospective, non-interventional case-control study in Niono, central Mali from August 2014 to May 2015. Cases were defined as patients aged >1 year presenting with persistent diarrhoea (\u226514 days) and children/ adolescents aged 1-18 years with persistent abdominal pain (\u226514 days). Age-, sex-and location-matched controls were also enrolled. Stool and urine samples were subjected to a suite of microscopic parasitological tests for the diagnosis of helminths and intestinal protozoa (direct smear, Kato-Katz, formalin-ether concentration, Baermann funnel, Koga agar plate, acid-fast staining and mini-FLOTAC) and rapid antigen detection tests for detection of Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia intestinalis and Schistosoma mansoni.Results Eleven different parasite species were detected upon analysis of 200 patients and 200 controls. S. mansoni (prevalence, 33.0%) and G. intestinalis (prevalence, 22.0%) were the predominant parasites; both significantly more common in symptomatic patients than in healthy controls. For the detection of S. mansoni, mini-FLOTAC was the test with the highest positive predictive value (89%) and highest specificity (94%). Of note, a rapid diagnostic test for S. mansoni identified additional infections that were missed by stool microscopy. For the detection of G. intestinalis, a rapid diagnostic test had the highest positive predictive value (96%) and was most specific (99%).Conclusion NTDs account for a high proportion of persistent digestive disorders and remain a major public health problem in central Mali. The use of accurate point-of-care laboratory tests at the primary healthcare level will help to improve the clinical management of patients with persistent digestive disorders.Disclosure Nothing to disclose. We report a case of pulmonary schistosomiasis manifested clinically as an acute pulmonary form with schistosoma's eggs finding in lung biopsy occurred after a treatment with praziquantel for a S. haematobium urinary and liver infestation. A 21-yearold Malian male moved in Italy after rapid transit in Libya; 3 months after arriving started complaining end-urination bleeding and stinging abdominal pain. He reported similar episodes in childhood. A blood test showed normal kidney function and slightly increased of bilirubin and liver enzymes. An abdomen ultrasound examination showed homogeneous splenomegaly, normal kidneys, bladder walls thickened with the presence of exophytic roundish process. Urine examination showed erythrocytes and Schistosoma haematobium' s eggs. He received treatment for urinary schistosomiasis with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) with no apparently immediate complications. Five days later the patient complained of rapid onset of fever and thoracic pain exacerbated by deep breath. A total body TC scan showed numerous small pulmonary nodules ranged in size from 4 to 11 mm in random distribution, no head lesions, intense contrast enhancement of the bladder wall and inhomogeneous contrast enhancement of liver and spleen parenchyma in the absence of clear focal lesions. Perfusion alterations shown by CT scan were compatible with pre-existing hepatic localization of schistosomiasis. Urine exam still shows Schistosoma haematobium' eggs. Blood tests showed sharply increased eosinophils (up to 2290/ll, 36.4%) and IgE values (19 000 kUI/l).Hystological examination of a trans-bronchial biopsy of lung lesions described focal interstitial fibrosis, with ovoid formations with rare microcalcifications included, surrounded by thin fibrous rhyme and inflammatory histiocytic infiltrated including eosinophils; formations related to parasitic eggs.For these hepatic, urinary and pulmonary findings was decided to retreat the patient after a retreatment interval of 4 weeks from the initial treatment.

This disease, yearly, impose too much physical injury and financial damage on inhabitants of the region. Leishmaniasis is considered as a Endemic disease in south of Iran and Larestan, but; this disease has reached 549 cases in 2014 from 67 cases in 2010.The increase of sensitive and un-immune person, is considered as a factor of the outbreak. But the other point is the change of laboratorial diagnosis method of this disease in medical-hygienic centers of the city. The object of this research is the analyses the effect of this factor. This is a qualitative study which has been done with the use of answer -sheets and oral survey at all of the diagnosis center (including 10 centers). In this study, the quality of the test and diagnosis personnel 0 s knowledge has been considered.The results show; one of the most important diagnosis centers in the city, has changed the method of sampling. They have done sampling from the center of sore. Personnel 0 s taking part in retraining periods of the diagnosis and the increase of the individual knowledge are the result of this research.Although the increase in sensitive persons due to new births is an important factor in outbreak of cutaneous Leishmaniasis, but there are some other factors that will increase the statistic of this disease. Personnel 0 s care while watching the cases and the increase in people 0 s knowledge and efficiency have been probably effective to increase the diagnosed cases. In other words, the lack of correct laboratorial diagnosis of the disease can increase the amount of unknown ill persons, so this persons act as a source of disease in the region. Contagious disease in the region can be controlled by retraining personnel and the improvement of the diagnostic methods. Background There is a growing popularity among Japanese retirees in spending their retirement life in foreign countries, and Malaysia is one of the popular destination, due to a government program called Malaysia My Second Home. Although the number of Japanese retirees in Malaysia is increasing, the research about their healthcare is scarce. Especially, it is worth investigating the factors which are affecting the healthcare service utilization of Japanese retirees in Malaysia.Methodology Focus group discussions were conducted to 30 Japanese retirees who live in two cities in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh. Also, six in-depth interviews were conducted to government officials, travel agents as well as Japanese interpreters in the private hospitals. Combining these data from multiple perspective, transcripts were coded for analysis by content analysis method to identify what are the factors affecting healthcare service utilization of Japanese retirees in Malaysia. Andersen Healthcare Utilization Model was used to analyse as the conceptual framework, and emerging themes are grouped into three categories, predisposing, enabling and need factors.Results Analysis of the data shows that, having credible source of healthcare information is important factor in determining the healthcare beliefs among Japanese retirees. Also, Word-of-mouth information is the informal and easily accessed sources of information about healthcare utilization. However, sometimes, the information may be distorted which reflect the personal opinions of information providers and also may contain exaggeration, hence, sometime not appropriate information, as it may hinder the formulation of healthcare beliefs of Japanese retirees.Conclusion In this study, trust is the key concept to determine the decision-making process of healthcare utilization among Japanese retirees in Malaysia. Therefore, it is important to implement public health measures to maintain and improve the sense of trust of Japanese retirees towards the medical systems in Malaysia. There are various ways to gain trust, such as dissemination of information and empowerment program to educate Japanese retirees regarding healthcare systems and cultural aspects of medical care in Malaysia.

This insufficient involvement and participation of civil society runs counter to the goals of the Sustainable Development Goals and particularly runs in opposition of the SDGs principles which are inclusiveness, participation and transparency.The conclusion offers solutions to the current overemphasis of private sector-new public management approaches and suggests a more comprehensive but also a more sustainable approach consisting of an expansion of the PPP formula to a PPSP formula (Public-Private-Social-Partnership).Disclosure Nothing to disclose. The objective of this paper is to map and review the existing monitoring, transparency and accountability framework and mechanism used by the global partnerships in the global health sector. Comparative analysis will be made of the existing accountability framework and monitoring mechanism by the public-private actors of the health field and how these mechanisms are congruent or incongruent with the Post 2015 Sustainable Development Goals, especially concerning the Public Private Partnerships in the health sector.In general, the 'non-traditional' funding organizations, GAVI, Global Fund, and MMV are based on policies consisting of accountability frameworks, transparency policies, monitoring procedures and reporting requirements as well as conflict of interest policies. A Governance system and related governance instruments generally exist to ensure fairness, coverage and access to funding at the global level, yet insufficient to mitigate potential conflicts of interest at the country level.This main finding are not new but mirror similar challenges faced by other international organisations and some donor organisations. What is disturbing is the fact that global partnerships were set up to overcome the weak governance capacity of public administration in many developing countries. To prevent the bureaucratic complications and potential corruptions, global partnerships developed its own delivery mechanisms and processes which bypass whenever possible the national administration and corresponding processes. Implementation of the SDGs, due to its universality applicable to all countries, could potentially divert attention, if not resources, from the developing countries. Lack of organization, management and governance know-how transfer from the high performance partnership organization may point to a different organizational form for international development where imported capacity continues to substitute embedded institutional development.Disclosure Nothing to disclose.",
