The convention extended the ban to almost all production, storage, and transport of biological weapons. However, oddly enough, the convention did not prohibit the use of biological weapons.

Melioidosis is clinically and pathologically similar to glanders, but the ecology and the epidemiology of melioidosis are different from those of glanders. Melioidosis is predominately a disease of tropical climates, and the bacterium that causes melioidosis is found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with the contaminated source. Glanders is contracted by humans from infected domestic animals or by inhalation (176) (http://www.cdc. gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/melioidosis g.htm). B. pseudomallei is an organism that has been considered as a potential agent for biological warfare and bioterrorism. Melioidosis is endemic to Southeast Asia, with the highest concentration of cases in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), and northern Australia. In addition, it is also seen in the South Pacific, Africa, India, and the Middle East. The bacterium is so prevalent that it has been isolated from troops of all nationalities that have served in areas of endemic disease. A few isolated cases of melioidosis have occurred in the Western Hemisphere, in Mexico, Panama, Ecuador, Haiti, Peru, Guyana, and in the states of Hawaii and Georgia. In the United States, confirmed cases range from none to five each year and occur among travelers and immigrants. Since the infamous \"Affaire du Jardin des Plantes,\" in which a panda donated by Mao Ze Dong to French President Pompidou was the index case in an epidemic of melioidosis that decimated the large animals of the Paris zoological gardens (176, 177) , B. pseudomallei has also emerged as a major veterinary pathogen. Animals susceptible to melioidosis include sheep, goats, horses, swine, cattle, dogs, and cats. Transmission occurs by direct contact with contaminated soil and surface waters. In Southeast Asia, the pathogen has been repeatedly isolated from agricultural fields, with infection occurring primarily during the rainy season. Humans and animals are believed to acquire the infection by inhaling dust, ingesting contaminated water, and having contact with contaminated soil, especially through skin abrasions, and for military troops by contamination of war wounds. Personto-person transmission can also occur.

Concern over the use of smallpox (variola virus) as a biological weapon has prompted interest in the development of small-molecule therapeutics against the disease. Smallpox is highly transmissible and causes severe disease with high mortality rates. ST-246 has been shown to be highly active against a number of orthopoxviruses both in vitro and in animal models. Cowpox virus variants selected in cell culture for resistance to ST-246 were found to have a single amino acid change in the V061 gene. Re-engineering this change back into the wild-type cowpox virus genome conferred resistance to ST-246, suggesting that V061 is the target of ST-246 antiviral activity. The cowpox virus V061 gene is homologous to vaccinia virus F13L gene, which encodes a major envelope protein (p37) required for production of extracellular virus. In cell culture, ST-246 inhibited plaque formation and virus-induced cytopathic effects. In single-cycle growth assays, ST-246 reduced extracellular virus formation 10-fold relative to untreated controls, while having little effect on the production of intracellular virus. In vivo, oral administration of ST-246 protected BALB/c mice from lethal injection, after intranasal administration of 10\u00d750% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of vaccinia virus strain IHD-J. ST-246-treated mice that survived infection acquired protective immunity and were resistant to subsequent challenge with lethal dose (10 \u00d7 LD 50 ) of vaccinia virus. Furthermore, orally administered ST-246 also protected A/NCr mice from lethal infection, after intranasal inoculation with 40, 000 \u00d7 LD 50 of ectromelia virus.

A group of researchers at the University of Wisconsin found that BoNT/A enters neurons by binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 (isoforms A, B, and C) (527) . Synaptic vesicles served the role of transporting neural cell signaling molecules (transmitters) from the neural cell to the muscle cell to mediate movement. When these vesicles reach the junction between neural cells and muscle cells to release the transmitters, the toxin, which has been absorbed to the bloodstream, takes advantage of the temporary exposure of SV2 to the circulation by binding to SV2. As result, the toxin enters into the neural cell when the vesicle returns to the interior of the cell. Once within the neural cell, the toxin will act as an enzyme to disrupt further transport of transmitters by the vesicles. By dissecting the mechanism by which these toxins gain entry into target cells, new strategies for prophylaxes and therapeutics can be developed.

The objective of this study was to identify a levofloxacin treatment regimen that would serve as an effective therapy for Bacillus anthracis infections and as a postexposure prophylaxis (537) . An in vitro hollow-fiber infection model that replicates the pharmacokinetic profile of levofloxacin observed in humans [half-life (t 1/2 ), 7.5 hours] or in animals, such as the mouse or the rhesus monkey (t 1/2 , \u223c 2 hours), was used to evaluate a proposed indication for levofloxacin (500 mg, once daily) for treating Bacillus anthracis infections. The results obtained with the in vitro model served as the basis for the doses and the dose schedules that were evaluated in the mouse inhalational anthrax model. The effects of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin treatment were compared with those of no treatment (untreated controls). The main outcome measure in the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model was a persistent reduction of culture density (\u2265 4 log 10 reduction) and prevention of the emergence of levofloxacin-resistant organisms. In the mouse inhalational anthrax model, the main outcome measure was survival. The results indicated that levofloxacin given once daily with simulated human pharmacokinetics effectively sterilized Bacillus anthracis cultures. By using a simulated animal pharmacokinetic profile, a once-daily dosing regimen that provided a human-equivalent exposure failed to sterilize the cultures. Dosing regimens that \"partially humanized\" levofloxacin exposures within the constraints of animal pharmacokinetics reproduced the antimicrobial efficacy seen with human pharmacokinetics. In a mouse inhalational anthrax model, once-daily dosing was significantly inferior (survival end point) to regimens of dosing every 12 hours or every 6 hours with identical total daily levofloxacin doses. These results demonstrate the predictive value of the in vitro hollowfiber infection model with respect to the success or the failure of treatment regimens in animals. Furthermore, the model permits the evaluation of treatment regimens that \"humanize\" antibiotic exposures in animal models, enhancing the confidence with which animal models may be used to reliably predict the efficacies of proposed antibiotic treatments in humans in situations (e.g., the release of pathogens as agents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases) where human trials cannot be performed.

These antimicrobial peptides damage the bacterial cell membrane, thereby protecting the host from infection. The existence of a novel class of human bactericidal and bacteriostatic proteins that are present in the skin, eyes, salivary glands, throat, tongue, esophagus, stomach, and intestine has been recently discovered (539) . Thus, the peptidoglycan recognition proteins 3 and 4 (PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4) are secreted as 89-to 115-kDa disulfide-linked homo-and heterodimers and are bactericidal against several pathogenic and nonpathogenic transient but not normal flora, Grampositive bacteria.

The 3d mutant is defective in its response to foreign nucleic acids and cannot signal through the Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, and 9 of the innate immune system. Using mice with the 3d mutation, an additional function of this protein was discovered that affects the adaptive immune response, independent of TLR signaling. The 3d mutation led to defective presentation of exogenous antigen, abolished cross-priming for CD8 + T-cells, and inhibited CD4 + T-cell priming. Innate responses to nucleic acids and exogenous antigen presentation, both of which begin in the endosomes, seemed to depend on an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein, which is suggestive of communication between these organellar systems.

Although the innate immune system is absolutely required for host defenses, when uncontrolled it leads to inflammatory disease. This control is mediated, in part, by cytokines that are secreted by macrophages. Because the immune regulation is extraordinarily complex, it can be best investigated with systems approaches-that is, using computational tools to predict regulatory networks arising from global, highthroughput data sets. Using cluster analysis of a comprehensive set of transcriptomic data derived from Toll-like receptor (TLR)-activated macrophages, researchers have identified a prominent group of genes that appeared to be regulated by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors (541) . Network analysis predicted that ATF3 would be part of a transcriptional complex that also contained members of the nuclear factor NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors. Furthermore, promoter analysis of the putative ATF3-regulated gene cluster demonstrated an over-representation of closely apposed ATF3 and NF-\u03baB binding sites, which was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to a DNA microarray. In other studies, microarray analysis was used to identify gene transcription factors affected in macrophages at different time points after LPS activation through Toll-like receptor 4. Predictions resulting from the analysis were validated in a number of biochemical assays using LPS-activated macrophages. For example, at early time points, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was found to be a negative regulator of LPS-induced gene expression for IL-6 and IL-12 cytokine production. An in vivo model confirmed these findings, as mice deficient in ATF3 were much more susceptible to septic shock. A potential mechanism was described that involves ATF3 binding to histone deacetylase (HDAC) to alter chromatin structure, resulting in inhibition of IL-6 and IL-12 gene transcription. In addition, several useful software tools were developed by this group to predict which regulatory circuits operate under particular activation conditions. r Cytokine Milieu of Atopic Dermatitis Skin Subverts the Innate Immune Response to Vaccinia Virus. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is associated with eczema vaccinatum (EV), a disseminated viral skin infection that follows inoculation with vaccinia virus (VV). A recent study (542) examined whether atopic dermatitis skin can control the replication of vaccinia virus, as well as the role of IL-4 and IL-13 in modulating the human cathelicidin LL-37, an antimicrobial peptide that kills vaccinia virus. The results showed that AD skin exhibited increased VV replication and decreased LL-37 expression compared with that of normal or psoriatic skin. Furthermore, IL4/IL-13 enhanced VV replication while downregulating LL-37 in VV-stimulated keratinocytes. Neutralizing IL-4/IL-13 in AD skin augmented LL-37 and inhibited VV replication. Cathelicidins were induced via Toll-like receptor 3 and were inhibited by IL-4/IL-13 through STAT-6. Skin from cathelicidin-deficient mice exhibited reduced ability to control VV replication. Exogenous LL-37 controlled replication of vaccinia virus in infected keratinocytes and atopic dermatitis skin explants. The overall results from the study demonstrated that Th2 cytokines enhanced VV replication in AD skin by subverting the innate immune response against vaccinia virus in a STAT-6-dependent manner (542) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 828, "end": 833, "text": "(541)", "ref_id": "BIBREF551"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2475, "text": "(542)", "ref_id": "BIBREF552"}, {"start": 3537, "end": 3542, "text": "(542)", "ref_id": "BIBREF552"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "r Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus Protects Macaques"}, {"text": "r Immune Protection of Non-Human Primates Against Ebola Virus with Single Low-Dose Adenovirus Vectors Encoding Modified Glycoproteins.

Immunization with DNA and/or replication-defective adenoviral vectors (rAd) encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) has been previously shown to confer specific protective immunity in non-human primates. Furthermore, GP can exert cytopathic effects on transfected cells in vitro, and multiple GP forms have been identified in nature, raising the question of which would be optimal for a human vaccine. To address this question, VRC-led researchers have explored the efficacy of mutant GPs from multiple Ebola virus strains with reduced in vitro cytopathicity and analyzed their protective effects in the primate challenge model, with or without NP (543) . Deletion of the GP transmembrane domain eliminated in vitro cytopathicity but reduced its protective efficacy by at least one order of magnitude. In contrast, a point mutation was identified that abolished this cytopathicity but retained immunogenicity and conferred immune protection in the absence of NP. The minimal effective rAd dose was established at 10 10 particles, two logs lower than that used previously. Expression of specific GPs alone vectored by rAd were found sufficient to confer protection against lethal challenge in a relevant non-human primate model.

NIAID continues to support advanced development and manufacture of a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine for smallpox, with the intention of targeting MVA vaccine candidates that can be produced on a scale to support commercial manufacturing. Two pharmaceutical companies, Bavarian Nordic and Acambis, Inc., have played a key role in the development of MVA vaccine candidates under contracts awarded by NIAID. Clinical trials are under way in the United States to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVA in healthy adults, and in the United States and Europe to determine the safety and immunogenicity of MVA in adults with atopic dermatitis and HIV. A study is under way in the United States to compare routes of administration (intradermal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous) of MVA in healthy individuals (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/ Public/PDF/spox niaid invest.pdf). Smallpox Vaccines. In addition to work to advance MVA, NIAID continues to support the development of additional smallpox vaccines (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/ Biodefense/Public/PDF/spox niaid invest.pdf).Three new vaccines are currently supported: (i) a live-attenuated vaccinia virus vaccine that is attenuated by a different mechanism than that of MVA; (ii) a protein subunit vaccine that comprises four variola virus proteins that are known to be largely responsible for stimulating the protective immune response that occurs when the live virus vaccine is used, thereby limiting the adverse reactions that are usually caused by other components of the virus; and (iii) a subunit vaccine in which the homologous immunity-stimulating proteins from vaccinia are expressed in a disabled, nonreplicating Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector.NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) has tested MVA as an attenuated poxvirus with the potential to protect against vaccinia (the virus used to vaccinate against smallpox) or variola (the virus that causes smallpox). The vaccine has been provided by Therion Biologics Corporation as part of a collaboration agreement with the Vaccine Research Center. Two Phase I clinical trials testing MVA as a component of a safer smallpox vaccine in both vaccinia-na\u00efve and vacciniaimmune populations have concluded.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "r Ebola Vaccine. Building on their previous results that showed that the prime-boost vaccination strategy produced a strong, long-lasting immune response in vaccinated non-human primates, scientists at the VRC, in collaboration with researchers at the U.S.ArmyMedical Research Institute for Infectious Disease (USAM-RIID), have developed an Ebola vaccine. Testing was conducted to determine whether the immune response mounted against the boost component alone would be sufficient to protect monkeys against Ebola infection. Results have shown that monkeys vaccinated with only the boost survived, even those who received high doses of Ebola virus. In 2005, the VRC completed a 2-year study of the first human trial of a DNA vaccine designed to prevent the Ebola infection. The trial consisted of three vaccinations given over 3 months, and study participants were followed for 1 year. Results have demonstrated that this DNA vaccine was safe and well tolerated with no significant adverse events, and it was capable of inducing an immune response. In another project, VRC scientists have developed a fast-acting, single-shot experimental Ebola vaccine for humans based on previous studies showing protection in monkeys.

A Phase I open-label clinical study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune response was completed in 2006(387). In the study, healthy 18-to 50-year-old subjects received 4.0-mg DNA vaccinations at three 1-month intervals. Interim study results indicated that the vaccine is well tolerated; immunogenicity analysis of the stored samples is ongoing. West Nile Virus. The VRC is currently developing a DNA-based vaccine against West Nile virus (WNV) in collaboration with Vical, Inc. The vaccine is based on an existing codon-modified gene-based DNA plas-mid vaccine platform designed to express WNV proteins. In 2005, following preclinical safety studies and viral challenge studies, the Vaccine Research Center initiated a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune responses of this recombinant DNA vaccine in human volunteers. Also in collaboration with Vical, Inc., the VRC has developed a secondgeneration DNA vaccine using an improved expression vector expressing the same WNV proteins. Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV). NIAID is supporting the development of a novel inactivated vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus, using promising vaccine and adjuvant technologies. The Japanese encephalitis virus is the leading cause of encephalitis worldwide, and new vaccines against this disease are sorely needed. Influenza Therapeutics. In 2006, NIAID made grant awards using authorities granted by the Project BioShield Act of 2004 for the development of highthroughput assays to screen influenza therapeutics.r Immunity and Biodefense Immune Epitope Discovery. Several of the Immune Epitope Discovery contracts made significant progress in 2004-2005 in identifying antibody and T-cell epitopes to such pathogens as influenza, vaccinia virus, and Clostridium botulinum neurotoxins. Investigators at Scripps Research Institute identified three candidate neutralizing antibody Fab fragments with specificity toward Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin A. Further characterization of these antibodies and the epitopes recognized is ongoing. Researchers at the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason characterized 18 MHC class II epitopes recognized by human CD4 + T-cells. Finally, investigators at the La Jolla Institute of Allergy and Immunology identified 49 MHC class I epitopes recognized by CD8 + T-cells from individuals receiving Dryvax vaccine; nine of these epitopes were recognized by T-cells from several donors and may represent common epitopes for monitoring host responses to vaccination or for developing subunit vaccines.
