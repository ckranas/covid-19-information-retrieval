Authors of this SAP were still blind to all individual data, other than publicly disclosed results and that the statistical trigger for efficacy had been reached for tocilizumab. This SAP defines the specific prospective analyses presented in this manuscript. This SAP specified that if sarilumab were to meet a pre-defined statistical trigger then it would be added to this analysis. 6.2.1. Introduction The conceptual approach to pandemic preparedness has been influenced substantially by the occurrence of the 2009 Influenza A H1N1(2009)pdm pandemic, outbreaks of SARS and MERS-CoV, the Zika pandemic, and Ebola virus disease outbreaks in West Africa 8 . A broad conclusion from these outbreaks is that it is likely that high quality research can change the incidence and consequences of the epidemic but that such research is extremely difficult because planning of research only commences after the discovery of the epidemic. As a consequence, researchers and organizations interested in developing improved processes for research have identified three key elements to facilitate time-critical research about an epidemic. These elements are that the research must be pre-planned, pre-approved, and practiced 9, 10 . REMAP-CAP and, in particular, the PAtC, is an attempt to establish these prerequisites and to guide treatment for patients who may be critically ill with pneumonia as a consequence of infection with a pandemic organism.",

As outlined in the Core Protocol, RAR results in an increasing proportion of patients being allocated to any intervention within a domain that has a higher probability of being superior with that proportion increasing as statistical confidence accrues. Participants within REMAP-CAP during a pandemic may be able to benefit from information about the relative effectiveness of interventions that is not in the public domain and not available to patients who are not participants in REMAP-CAP. As outlined in the Core Protocol, any intervention confirmed to be superior within the REMAP is then implemented by application of a RAR proportion that is equal to 100%. RAR will be implemented for pandemic patients as soon as sufficient data have accrued and operational implementation is feasible. 6.2.4. Practiced REMAP-CAP will be recruiting during the interpandemic period in multiple countries in both Southern and Northern Hemispheres with the support of several Regional Coordinating Centers. This research activity, during the interpandemic period, ensures that sites, site training, project management, data management, analysis processes, and trial governance are functional and practiced. Furthermore, the eligibility process and delivery of trial interventions are optimized for embedding which allows study processes to occur within minimal disruption to the delivery of clinical care, which may well be under substantial strain during a pandemic.

Furthermore, as the trial progresses during a pandemic the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has access to information from adaptive analyses that may not achieve thresholds to allow reporting as a Platform Conclusion but may be relevant to public health which, under appropriate circumstances, can be shared with public health authorities and the DSMBs of other trials evaluating the same or similar interventions without threatening the scientific validity of the ongoing trial. 6.2.5.2 .",

This design feature contributes to efficiency and is also anticipated to result in more clinical evidence being generated more rapidly during a time-critical pandemic. Furthermore, where pre-specified, the statistical model utilized in REMAP-CAP will allow estimation of treatment effect of interventions that may be contingent on other treatment assignments within the pandemic component of the REMAP. For example, it is plausible that the effectiveness of an intervention for immune modulation is dependent on co-delivery of an agent that is effective at inhibiting growth or replication of the pathogen. Conventional trials, in which only a single domain of treatment is evaluated, are not capable of detecting this type of treatment-by-treatment interaction, and thereby unable to identify the best overall treatment strategy for these patients.

During a pandemic, there are several factors that may influence the relationship between admission to an ICU and severity of illness. Firstly, there may be insufficient ICU beds available to care for all critically ill patients. This may result in provision of advanced organ support occurring in locations that do not usually provide ICU-level care. During a pandemic, such a location is referred to as a re-purposed ICU. However, a re-purposed ICU needs to be distinguished from a usual hospital ward that is capable of providing some forms of organ support, such as noninvasive ventilation. During a pandemic, there may be substantial delays in transferring a patient from an emergency department to either a ward or an ICU (or a re-purposed ICU). Patients in an emergency department who have been accepted for admission to an ICU are regarded as being admitted to an ICU. Patients in an emergency department who have been accepted for admission to a ward are regarded as being admitted to a ward. Secondly, patients who are not critically ill may be treated on an ICU for reasons that are not related to severity of illness, such as access to single rooms to achieve objectives related to infection control and prevention. This can influence both admission as well as discharge practices. Thirdly, the threshold at which support for failed organs is provided may be influenced by infection control practices. For example, some forms of respiratory support may be withheld because of concerns related to the risk that staff who are caring for patients may acquire the infection.",

Determination of severity may also take into account a decision to withhold some form of organ failure support that would otherwise have be provided. Where a definition of an ICU is needed, at sites at which the pandemic stratum (see below) has been activated, an area within the hospital that is repurposed so as to be able to deliver one or more of the qualifying organ failure supports specified in the Core Protocol (non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, and vasopressor therapy) will meet the definition of an Intensive Care Unit. It is preferred in such circumstances that the patient is under the care of a specialist who is trained in the provision of critical care, but this is not an essential requirement. A respiratory or other ward that provides non-invasive ventilation (including oxygen therapy delivered by high flow nasal cannula) and continues to do so during a pandemic, will not, generally, meet the definition of an ICU, particularly if the patient is not under the care of a specialist who is trained in the provision of critical care.",

Relaxation of the requirement for community acquisition or organ failure criteria or both may be appropriate.

Introduction As outlined in the Core Protocol, a pre-specified stratum of the REMAP is the presence or absence of suspected or proven pandemic infection. This is maintained as a 'passive stratum' during the interpandemic period that can become active during a pandemic. It consists of two exclusive strata categories: pandemic infection is neither suspected nor proven (PINSNP) and pandemic infection is either suspected or proven (PISOP) at baseline. At times when the PAtC is not activated, i.e. during the interpandemic period, all participants are categorized as PINSNP.",

This allows variation in activity of the pandemic infection to be accommodated with sites only open for PISOP recruitment when there is active pandemic infection locally. Switching-on of the stratum can occur at any time and expected to always be available with less than 24 hours lead time. The capacity to enroll patients into the PISOP stratum can be switched-off on a site-by-site basis, but the ITSC can switch off the PISOP stratum for all sites if it is believed that a pandemic is no longer ongoing.

The provision of flexibility regarding limited aspects of trial design provides the capacity to tailor aspects of the trial to the characteristics of the pandemic. For these decisions, the ITSC has decision-making responsibility, with advice from the PWG.

It is reasonable to presume that any pandemic respiratory infection of major significance to public health will manifest as severe Community Acquired Pneumonia with concomitant admission to an Intensive Care Unit. Previous pandemics and more localized outbreaks of respiratory emerging infections have resulted in severe Community Acquired Pneumonia and admission to an Intensive Care Unit [1] [2] [3] . A pandemic of respiratory infection is much more likely to be caused by a virus than a bacterium. Differences in trial design may be required for influenza, viruses which are known to result in periodic but unpredictable pandemics, in comparison with other viruses, such as Coronaviruses that may also have pandemic potential. Previous pandemics and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have outlined the urgent need for evidence, preferably from Randomized Clinical Trials, to guide best treatment. However, there are substantial challenges associated with being able to organize such trials when the time of onset of a pandemic and its exact nature are unpredictable [4] [5] [6] . As an adaptive platform trial that enrolls patients during the interpandemic period, REMAP-CAP is ideally positioned to adapt, in the event of a respiratory pandemic, to evaluate existing potential as well as novel treatment approaches. The precise nature of a respiratory pandemic cannot be known in advance. The Pandemic Appendix to the Core Protocol lists potential adaptations to trial design and management that are generic, in that they will occur irrespective of the nature of the pandemic, as well as adaptations that are possible, depending on the nature of the pandemic, and the process for determining which adaptations will be applied. The objective of the Pandemic Appendix to the Core Protocol is to describe the adaptations to the Core Protocol that would apply during a pandemic, including how analyses of domains already operative during the interpandemic period as well as domains that are pandemic-specific, will be integrated during a pandemic. This includes scientific, as well as governance and logistic aspects. Aim: The primary objective of the REMAP during a pandemic is to identify the effect of a range of interventions to improve outcome for patients with severe Community Acquired Pneumonia, as defined by the pandemic primary end-point.",

The Core Protocol does not contain detailed information about the statistical analysis, because the analysis model will change over time in accordance with the domain and intervention trial adaptations, but this information is contained in the Statistical Analysis Appendix. These Appendices are anticipated to change over time, as trial adaptations occur. Each modification will be subject to approval from the International Trial Steering Committee (ITSC) in conjunction with advice from the International Statistics Interest Group (ISIG) and the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The Core Protocol also does not contain information that is specific to a particular region in which the trial is conducted, as the locations that participate in the trial are also anticipated to increase over time. Information that is specific to each region that conducts the trial is contained within an RSA. This includes information related to local management, governance, and ethical and regulatory aspects. It is planned that, within each region, only that region's RSA, and any subsequent modifications, will be submitted for ethical review in that region. ",

A pandemic of respiratory infection is much more likely to be caused by a virus than a bacterium and, among viruses a distinction should be drawn between influenza, which is known to result in periodic but unpredictable pandemics, and other viruses, such as Coronaviruses, that may have pandemic potential, as the features of trial design may be different. Previous pandemics and outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases have outlined the urgent need for evidence, preferably from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), to guide best treatment. However, there are substantial challenges associated with being able to organize such trials when the time of onset of a pandemic and its exact nature are unpredictable [4] [5] [6] .",

            "text": "As an adaptive platform trial that enrolls patients during the interpandemic period, REMAP-CAP is ideally positioned to adapt, in the event of a respiratory pandemic, to evaluate existing treatments as well as novel approaches. One of the challenges associated with planning clinical trials during a pandemic is that the precise nature of the infecting organism, clinical consequences, and suitable interventions (particularly those that are pathogen-specific) cannot be reliably known in advance. Nevertheless, a range of scenarios can be anticipated and used to provide direction and guidance regarding the most appropriate research response. The most likely organism responsible for a respiratory pandemic is a novel influenza virus that has undergone antigenic shift 7 ; the most recent influenza pandemic occurred during 2009-2010. In recent years, there have been outbreaks of severe Community Acquired Pneumonia due to novel Coronaviruses which resulted in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and the Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak that commenced in 2012. The pandemic potential of a novel Coronavirus that causes pneumonia is not known. The pre-specified adaptations to REMAP-CAP will need to be different for influenza in comparison to a non-influenza pandemic pathogen. 8.2.1. Introduction The conceptual approach to pandemic preparedness has been influenced substantially by the occurrence of the 2009 Influenza A H1N1(2009)pdm pandemic, outbreaks of SARS and MERS-CoV, the Zika pandemic, and Ebola virus disease outbreaks in West Africa 8 . A broad conclusion from these outbreaks is that it is likely that high quality research can change the incidence and consequences of the epidemic but that such research is extremely difficult because planning of research only commences after the discovery of the epidemic. As a consequence, researchers and organizations interested in developing improved processes for research have identified three key elements to facilitate time-critical research about an epidemic. These elements are that the research must be pre-planned, pre-approved, and practiced 9, 10 . REMAP-CAP and, in particular, the PAtC, is an attempt to establish these prerequisites and to guide treatment for patients who may be critically ill with pneumonia as a consequence of infection with a pandemic organism. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended establishing and strengthening outbreak-ready, multi-center clinical research networks in geographically diverse regions to facilitate research during pandemics. 11 It has also recommended testing of protocols during interpandemic periods and stressed the value of such clinical research consortia in collecting and distributing information during a future pandemic.",

The availability of this document allows ethics review boards, hospital research governance staff, existing and potential sites to understand and approve the study processes that would be implemented during a pandemic. Where different options need to exist, depending on the nature of the pandemic, these are pre-specified, as much as possible. Any unanticipated substantive deviation from this Appendix would be subject to an amendment, hopefully expedited, in the event of a pandemic. The PAtC, like the Core Protocol, does not specify any interventions that are evaluated within the REMAP. It is highly likely that one or more research questions (in domains already approved during the interpandemic period) will be relevant specifically in patients with CAP caused by the pandemic infection. The PAtC allows these questions to continue to be answered specifically in patients with pandemic infection, where appropriate, using Bayesian prior probabilities derived from patients already enrolled during the interpandemic period. It is proposed to develop 'sleeping domains', which could be activated if appropriate during a pandemic, as well as retain the option of developing one or more completely new domains following the emergence of pandemic, which would require separate ethical approval and contracts with participating sites. This strategy, as part of the study design, offers an ethically, clinically and legally acceptable mechanism for research in the context of a pandemic that can be initiated rapidly. There are two further aspects relevant to ethical approval of the PAtC. The first is that existing or pandemic-specific domains of REMAP-CAP may include an intervention that specifies no treatment within that domain (noting that the Core Protocol specifies that all additional standard care is provided with treatment decisions being made by the treating clinician). This is clinically and ethically appropriate as the response of critically ill patients to a range of different treatments has proven to be unpredictable. There are many examples of treatments that have resulted in harm 12 and situations in which surrogate outcome measures were not reliable indicators of improvement in patient-centered outcomes. As such, there should not be any presumption that it is better for patients to receive active interventions.",

This research activity, during the interpandemic period, ensures that sites, site training, project management, data management, analysis processes, and trial governance are functional and practiced. Furthermore, the eligibility process and delivery of trial interventions are optimized for embedding which allows study processes to occur within minimal disruption to the delivery of clinical care, which may well be under substantial strain during a pandemic. There is already extensive experience with the Case Report Form (CRF) that is used and will continue to be used during a pandemic. A pandemic will likely result in a large number of affected persons with cases occurring over a short period of time, perhaps as short as a few months. Conventional clinical trials that utilize frequentist statistical techniques require a fixed sample size with limited capacity to analyze the results of the trial until recruitment is completed. The setting of the sample size requires an estimate of the size of the treatment effect and it is known that the assumptions that are made in setting the size of the treatment effect are often incorrect 13, 14 . A frequentist trial that over-estimates the size of the treatment effect may conclude without reaching a valid conclusion, whereas one that under-estimates the size of the treatment effect is delayed in providing time-critical information that the treatment is even more effective than estimated. REMAP-CAP utilizes Bayesian statistical methods which allow frequent adaptive analyses to occur. This will ensure that time-critical information about the effectiveness of treatment interventions is not delayed unnecessarily. The REMAP design is particularly suited to pandemics because it requires no pre-trial assumptions about the size of the treatment effect and will allow dissemination of evidence as soon as possible. Furthermore, as the trial progresses during a pandemic the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) has access to information from adaptive analyses that may not achieve thresholds to allow reporting as a Platform Conclusion but may be relevant to public health which, under appropriate circumstances, can be shared with public health authorities without threatening the scientific validity of the ongoing trial.",

Furthermore, where pre-specified, the statistical model utilized in REMAP-CAP will allow estimation of treatment effect of interventions that may be contingent on other treatment assignments within the pandemic component of the REMAP. For example, it is plausible that the effectiveness of an intervention for immune modulation is dependent on co-delivery of an agent that is effective at inhibiting growth or replication of the pathogen. Conventional trials, in which only a single domain of treatment is evaluated, are not capable of detecting this type of treatment-by-treatment interaction, and thereby unable to identify the best overall treatment strategy for these patients.",

First there is a decision of the ITSC to open the PISOP stratum for the platform. The second step is site-by-site activation of the PISOP stratum, requiring agreement of both the site and the Regional Coordinating Centre (RCC). This allows variation in activity of the pandemic infection to be accommodated with sites only open for PISOP recruitment when there is active pandemic infection locally. Switching-on of the stratum can occur at any time and expected to always be available with less than 24 hours lead time. The capacity to enroll patients into the PISOP stratum can be switched-off on a site-by-site basis, but the ITSC can switch off the PISOP stratum for all sites if it is believed that a pandemic is no longer ongoing. The REMAP applies a new and separate statistical model for participants in the PISOP stratum which can utilize, where appropriate, informative priors derived from prepandemic PINSNP participants. It should be noted that for sites in which the pandemic stratum is open, that the REMAP allows for continued recruitment of patients into the REMAP who are in the PINSNP stratum. For example, during an influenza pandemic, PINSNP would include patients with infection that has been proven to be a non-pandemic strain of influenza. During a pandemic, patients who are in the PINSNP stratum continue to be analyzed using the interpandemic statistical model (see below). As such, there are two categories of PINSNP participantsthose included during the interpandemic phase and those included during a pandemic. Both categories of patients contribute to the interpandemic model for all active domains. The PAtC is activated and deactivated for a site at the same time as the PISOP stratum is opened and closed. If a pandemic commences prior to ethical and governance approval of the PAtC, the PISOP stratum can be activated using approvals for the Core Protocol, and the PAtC would be activated as soon as ethical approval is obtained. 9.4.1. Introduction The model that is active during the pandemic and includes only PISOP patients (for some or all domains) is referred to as the pandemic model. The model that is active before (and after) the pandemic, which includes PINSNP patients during the pandemic and may include some PISOP patients for some domains, is referred to as the interpandemic model (see Figure 2 ).",

For several parameters related to trial design and statistical analysis, this Appendix pre-specifies a range of options from which the actual modifications will be chosen at the commencement of a pandemic. The appendix provides guidance regarding the principles that would guide selection from within the available options and often provides the planned default option. The provision of flexibility regarding limited aspects of trial design provides the capacity to tailor aspects of the trial to the characteristics of the pandemic. For these decisions, the ITSC has decision-making responsibility, with advice from the PWG.

The decision to modify a statistical threshold will be made by the ITSC prior to the first adaptive analysis of the pandemic model. Different thresholds may be applied to different domains. Thresholds can also be specified that are asymmetric for example less stringent for inferiority than superiority. Factors that the ITSC will take into account in considering whether to modify a threshold include whether the interventions being evaluated are comparative effectiveness options (i.e. interventions that are available as part of standard care and available outside the platform) or experimental interventions with uncertain safety and risk profile that may be available only within the platform. All decisions regarding thresholds for Statistical Triggers will be communicated to participating sites and placed in the public domain on the study website. Once specified, thresholds cannot be modified unless recommended by the DSMB. The default thresholds are outlined in the following sections.",

For example, several antibiotics exist that are active against the microorganisms that cause pneumonia commonly but it is not known if one antibiotic strategy is best or whether all suitable antibiotic strategies have similar levels of effectiveness. Of all the treatments that clinicians use for patients with severe CAP, only a small minority have been tested in randomized controlled trials to determine their comparative effectiveness. As a consequence, the standard treatments that are administered vary between and within countries. Current conventional clinical trials methods to assess the efficacy of treatments for pneumonia generally compare two treatment options (either two options for the same treatment modality, where both are in common use; or a new treatment against no treatment or placebo where the effectiveness of the new treatment is not known). Using this approach, in a series of separate and sequential trials, it will take an inordinate length of time to study all the treatment options.

Although treatments will be allocated randomly, patients will preferentially be allocated to treatments that statistical models derived from trial data indicate are more likely to be the most effective treatments. The trial will \"adapt\" in multiple ways including answering questions as soon as sufficient data have accrued to answer the question of the effectiveness of each treatment and by changing the treatments that are being tested over-time so as to progressively determine the best package of treatments for pre-defined categories of patients with severe pneumonia. Once a treatment is identified as being optimal it is subsequently routinely provided to all eligible patients within the REMAP.

Severe CAP is defined as pneumonia of sufficient severity to be an immediate threat to life. In developed countries, patients with severe CAP are often admitted to an ICU or a High Dependency Unit (HDU). Throughout the remainder of this protocol, we will use the term ICU for units that provide specialized care for critically ill patients, including HDU, Critical Care Units, and Intensive Treatment Units.

It is recommended that antimicrobial treatment be initiated promptly and at the point of care where the diagnosis of pneumonia is first made. Examples of commonly used therapies that support failed organ systems or prevent the complications of critical illness and its treatment include oxygen therapy, invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluid resuscitation, vasoactive drugs, dialysis, provision of nutrition, sedation, physiotherapy including mobilization, diuretic medications, suppression of gastric acid production, and mechanical or pharmacological interventions to prevent venous thromboembolism. The exact combination of supportive therapies is influenced by the spectrum of organ failures that occurs in any individual patient. (Dellinger et al., 2013) (Eccles et al., 2014 , Wiersinga et al., 2012 , Wilkinson and Woodhead, 2004 These guidelines generally focus on recommendations related to assessment of severity, diagnostic evaluation, and empiric and guided antimicrobial therapy. Guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign are relevant to many aspects of the supportive care of the critically ill patients with CAP. (Dellinger et al., 2013) There is a stark contrast between the substantial public health impact of severe CAP and the low quality of evidence that guides therapy. The number of treatment recommendations in guidelines that are supported by high quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence is 4 of 44 for treatment recommendations in the European guidelines (Eccles et al., 2014 , 11 of 43 in the United States guidelines , and 7 of 93 in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines.

However, it remains unclear if adherence to guideline recommendations is due to a direct causal link, or whether it is a surrogate for better quality care generally. There is also widely reported variation in compliance with many supportive therapies for patients with severe CAP, such as use of low tidal volume ventilation, type of resuscitation fluid, and thresholds for the administration of transfusion for anemia. (Bellani et al., 2016 Many factors contribute to the substantial unmet need for better evidence to determine the optimal treatment for patients with severe CAP. Severe CAP is common, case-fatality is high, the strength of current evidence is limited, and there is evidence of substantial variation in existing standard care. The combination of these factors provides a strong rationale for the need for better quality evidence about the impact of the different treatment options that are in existing practice, the impact of different combinations of treatment options, and the timely and effective evaluation of new candidate interventions to improve outcomes.",

Naturally, there will be no evidence base for the medical management of such a disease at the time of its emergence, and medical decisions will be mostly based on expert opinion with extrapolation from evidence derived from the treatment of analogous clinical syndromes. There is substantial unmet need to generate evidence about the most effective treatment approaches during a pandemic or regional outbreak. Furthermore, to have impact on patient outcomes during an outbreak, evidence must be available during the pandemic.

(Angus, 2015) A REMAP provides a strategy to address many of these problems by gaining economies of scale from a common platform, which allows for broad enrollment but retaining the ability to examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects between defined subgroups. A REMAP focuses predominantly on the evaluation of treatment options for the disease of interest that are variations within the spectrum of standard care (although testing of novel or experimental therapies is not precluded) and does so by embedding the trial within routine healthcare delivery. In this regard the REMAP seeks to replace random variation in treatment with randomized variation in treatment allowing causal inference to be generated about the comparative effectiveness of different existing treatment options. The use of RAR, which allows the allocation ratios to change over time based on accruing outcomes data, maximizes the chance of good outcomes for trial participants. The embedding of such a platform within the day-to-day activities of ICUs facilitates the translation of outcomes to clinical practice as a \"self-learning\" system. As such, it also functions as an embedded and automated continuous quality-improvement program. A final advantage of a REMAP for pneumonia is the ability to rapidly adapt to generate evidence if new respiratory pathogens emerge, avoiding the inevitable delays associated with conventional trials in an outbreak of a new infectious diseases.

The design maximizes the efficiency with which available sample size is applied to evaluate treatment options as rapidly as possible. A REMAP has the capacity to identify differential treatment effects in defined sub-groups (termed strata), address multiple questions simultaneously, and can evaluate interactions among selected treatment options.

These assumptions include the plausible size of the treatment effect, the incidence of the primary outcome, the planned sample size, the (typically, small number of) treatments to be tested, and that treatment effects are not influenced by concomitant treatment options. These assumptions are held constant until the trial completes recruitment and is analyzed.

RAR utilizes random allocation with a weighted probability for each intervention, with the weighted probability being proportional to the extent to which similar participants recruited earlier in the trial benefited or not from each particular intervention.

At the initiation of a new domain or when a new intervention is added to a domain the randomization proportion of all new interventions is balanced and only changes, with the application of RAR, that takes into account uncertainty about treatment effect so as to avoid excessive variability in proportions generated by RAR until sufficient sample size has accrued.",

(Berry, 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 The platform \"learns\" more quickly about the treatments we ultimately care about, i.e. those that work best. Moreover, as data accrues, newly randomized participants are more likely to receive interventions from which they benefit. (Berry, 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 , Angus, 2015 , Carey and Winer, 2016 , Harrington and Parmigiani, 2016 , Park et al., 2016 , Rugo et al., 2016 This is a highly ethical fusion of trial science with continuous quality improvement and a learning healthcare system. Assuming at least some interventions are better than others, the total mortality within the trial population will be lower than would have occurred with a fixed randomization proportion. It is also particularly relevant to the ethical conduct of trials that enroll critically ill patients where unanticipated increases in mortality have been seen (Dellinger et al., 2013) and to the conduct of trials during a pandemic in which there is in-built implementation of the therapies that are more likely to be beneficial during the trial. The simulations underpinning REMAP-CAP demonstrate that, in instances where particular interventions are indeed superior to others, the use of RAR will, on average, increase the odds of discovering the superiority not only with lower sample size, but with fewer participants exposed to the less efficacious therapies and, thus, fewer deaths.",

One disadvantage is that, for interventions that are provided without blinding, the treating clinicians may be able to draw inference about the RAR proportions and, as a consequence, draw inference about the interim standing of interventions that are being tested in the REMAP. This could have adverse consequences including that clinicians are influenced to not enroll participants within a domain but rather directly prescribe the treatment that they believe to be doing better outside the trial. However, a number of factors mitigate this potential concern. First, it can be difficult to distinguish between patterns of sequential allocation status that are derived from fixed versus RAR. Second, extreme proportions will not be used (except where a Statistical Trigger but not a Platform Conclusion has been reached, see later). Finally, for many conditions, team-based management means that an individual clinician will directly observe only a small proportion of all participants enrolled within the trial at each participating site. Another disadvantage of RAR is that, under certain allocation rules, statistical power can be reduced. This concern is mitigated via pre-trial simulation to test the effects of different allocation rules. Furthermore, a REMAP that comprises multiple domains with multiple interventions within each domain will generally have higher, rather than lower, power as a consequence of the use of RAR. Finally, by deploying RAR rules to minimize the odds of exposure to inferior interventions, the design is intended to motivate embedding in clinical practice, thereby resulting in more rapid recruitment.",

A number of strategies will be utilized to very tightly \"nest\" or embed trial processes in daily clinical care operations. The effectiveness of strategies to achieve embedding will be evaluated, updated, and shared with sites, taking into account different clinical processes at different sites. Wherever possible trial treatment allocations will be integrated with electronic customized order sets, produced at the point of delivery of care that also includes each site's local care standards for concomitant therapies. This allows clinical staff to follow their typical workflow using protocolized order sheets to govern many aspects of patient care and serves to enhance compliance with the interventions allocated by the trial.

In a single REMAP, there is no need for the \"start-and-stop\" periods that would typically occur under the alternative approach of multiple separate trials. These \"downtime\" periods can be quite extensive and carry a number of disadvantages. First, there is a lot of duplicative effort every time a near-identical treatment protocol goes through the appropriate development and approval processes. Second, clinical investigation units must maintain a certain infrastructure, and that infrastructure can be expensive to maintain during periods when participants are not being enrolled or expensive to recreate if the infrastructure degrades. Third, downtime is simply one more contributor to delay in the production of scientific knowledge. Participants at large benefit from earlier production of knowledge regardless of whether new information demonstrates a therapy is effective or ineffective. Finally, the inevitable start up delay before a trial can \"go live\" can wipe out any possibility of conducting effective research during time-critical situations such as a pandemic.",

Frequent adaptive analyses will be performed to determine if an intervention is superior, inferior, or equivalent to one or more other interventions to which it is being compared, within a domain. A Bayesian analysis method will be used to evaluate superiority, inferiority, or equivalence, as well as to inform the adaptive randomization strategy within each domain. Where it is anticipated that interactions between interventions in different domains may be likely the statistical models will allow evaluation of such interactions. Where the statistical models evaluate such an interaction the models can incorporate the relative likelihood of such interactions, but with possibly low prior probability in cases where it is biologically implausible for interactions to occur. Each intervention within each domain will be evaluated within prospectively defined and mutually exclusive strata (sub-groups) of participants but information from one stratum may be used (via 'borrowing') to contribute to the analysis of the effect of that intervention in other strata. Interventions that are found to be inferior, for a specific stratum, are removed from use in that stratum, and will, typically, be removed from the REMAP allowing new interventions or domains or both to be introduced. An RAR algorithm will be used to preferentially randomize participants to interventions that appear to be performing better. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to define the type I error, power to detect specified differences, and demonstration of equivalence as well as a broad range of operating characteristics. It is planned that further simulation studies will be conducted in conjunction with consideration of the introduction of new interventions or domains or both into the REMAP. The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle will be used for all primary analyses.",

Individual participating sites will select the interventions within a domain that will be available at their site with the default position being all available interventions. The randomization program will only provide treatment allocations that are permitted at each participating site. This allows interventions that are not necessarily available in all regions, for example because of licensing reasons, to be included within the REMAP. Within the context of comparative effectiveness research, this also allows sites to determine the interventions that are within their usual or reasonable spectrum of care.

Decisions about transition through levels would be made by the site, in conjunction with the RCC, and would be influenced by factors including speed and accuracy of identification of eligible participants, accuracy of information provided at time of randomization, compliance with allocated treatment status, and timeliness of reporting of outcome variables that are used to determine RAR algorithms.

The case-fatality proportion for critically ill patients with CAP is likely to be in the order of 20 to 30% and high proportions of patients will have one or both of laboratory abnormalities or complications of critical illness and its treatment. Patients who are critically ill, irrespective of whether or not they are enrolled in a trial, will typically experience multiple events that would meet the conventional definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).",

However, it will often be difficult to distinguish, in real-time, between events that occur as a consequence of critical illness and treatments that are not specified by the trial, and interventions specified by the trial. Site investigators should exercise caution in attributing events to study interventions. However, the standard that should be applied to determine whether SAEs are attributable to study interventions in this trial is that it is possible, probable, or certain that there is a direct link between a trial intervention and the SAE or the SAE is not considered to be a normal feature of the evolution of critical illness and its treatment.",

Early in their course, reports indicate that those infected often experience fever and cough similar to a common cold. During this phase, these patients are highly contagious, capable of broadly spreading COVID-19 to others. Physical decline resulting in hospitalization is attributed to pneumonia, an infection involving the lungs, which is a common reason for admission to an ICU. Severe pneumonia is associated not only with failure of lungs supplying oxygen to the body, but also failure of other organ systems that is due to an uncontrolled immune response to infection.",

The trial will \"adapt\" in multiple ways including answering questions as soon as sufficient data have accrued to answer the question of the effectiveness of each treatment and by changing the treatments that are being tested over-time so as to progressively determine the best package of treatments for pre-defined categories of patients with severe pneumonia.

(Angus, 2015) A REMAP provides a strategy to address many of these problems by gaining economies of scale from a common platform, which allows for broad enrollment but retaining the ability to examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects between defined subgroups. A REMAP focuses predominantly on the evaluation of treatment options for the disease of interest that are variations within the spectrum of standard care (although testing of novel or experimental therapies is not precluded) and does so by embedding the trial within routine healthcare delivery. In this regard the REMAP seeks to replace random variation in treatment with randomized variation in treatment allowing causal inference to be generated about the comparative effectiveness of different existing treatment options. The use of RAR, which allows the allocation ratios to change over time based on accruing outcomes data, maximizes the chance of good outcomes for trial participants. The embedding of such a platform within the day-to-day activities of ICUs facilitates the translation of outcomes to clinical practice as a \"self-learning\" system. As such, it also functions as an embedded and automated continuous quality-improvement program. A final advantage of a REMAP for pandemic infections is the ability to rapidly adapt to generate evidence, avoiding the inevitable delays associated with conventional trials in an outbreak of a new infectious diseases.

The broad objective of a REMAP is, over time, to determine and continuously update the optimal set of treatments for the disease of interest. The set of treatments that may be tested within a REMAP comprise the set of all treatments that are used currently or may be developed in the future and used or considered for use in the disease of interest. The design maximizes the efficiency with which available sample size is applied to evaluate treatment options as rapidly as possible. A REMAP has the capacity to identify differential treatment effects in defined sub-groups (termed strata), address multiple questions simultaneously, and can evaluate interactions among selected treatment options. Throughout the platform, patients who are enrolled in the trial are treated as effectively as possible.

These assumptions include the plausible size of the treatment effect, the incidence of the primary outcome, the planned sample size, the (typically, small number of) treatments to be tested, and that treatment effects are not influenced by concomitant treatment options. These assumptions are held constant until the trial completes recruitment and is analyzed. (Barker et al., 2009 , Berry, 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 Participants who are enrolled in a conventional RCT are not able to benefit from knowledge accrued by the trial because no results are made available until the trial completes. A REMAP uses five approaches to minimize the impact of assumptions on trial efficiency and also maximizes the benefit of participation for individuals who are enrolled in the trial.

Second, therapies performing poorly can be quickly discarded, preserving most 'learning' for the evaluation of therapies that are most promising. Third, the design allows the testing of potential heterogeneity of treatment effect due to treatment-by-subgroup interactions and treatment-by-treatment interactions. Again, in a previously unencountered disease, such flexibility is crucial. Fourth, the use of multiple assignments with a common control, coupled with RAR, means that only a few patients are assigned control care, the control care can continually improve, and patients are preferentially assigned the best performing interventions. Thus, patients are being treated while therapies are being studied.",

RAR utilizes random allocation with a weighted probability for each intervention, with the weighted probability being proportional to the extent to which similar participants recruited earlier in the trial benefited or not from each particular intervention.

At the initiation of a new domain or when a new intervention is added to a domain the randomization proportion of all new interventions is balanced and only changes, with the application of RAR, that takes into account uncertainty about treatment effect so as to avoid excessive variability in proportions generated by RAR until sufficient sample size has accrued.",

(Berry, 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 The platform \"learns\" more quickly about the treatments we ultimately care about, i.e. those that work best. Moreover, as data accrues, newly randomized participants are more likely to receive interventions from which they benefit. (Berry, 2012 , Connor et al., 2013 , Angus, 2015 , Carey and Winer, 2016 , Harrington and Parmigiani, 2016 , Park et al., 2016 , Rugo et al., 2016 This is a highly ethical fusion of trial science with continuous quality improvement and a learning healthcare system. Assuming at least some interventions are better than others, the total mortality within the trial population will be lower than would have occurred with a fixed randomization proportion. It is also particularly relevant to the ethical conduct of trials that enroll critically ill patients where unanticipated increases in mortality have been seen (Dellinger et al., 2013) and to the conduct of trials during a pandemic in which there is in-built implementation of the therapies that are more likely to be beneficial during the trial. The simulations underpinning REMAP-COVID demonstrate that, in instances where particular interventions are indeed superior to others, the use of RAR will, on average, increase the odds of discovering the superiority not only with lower sample size, but with fewer participants exposed to the less efficacious therapies and, thus, fewer deaths or adverse outcomes.",

One disadvantage is that, for interventions that are provided without blinding, the treating clinicians may be able to draw inference about the RAR proportions and, as a consequence, draw inference about the interim standing of interventions that are being tested in the REMAP. This could have adverse consequences including that clinicians are influenced to not enroll participants within a domain but rather directly prescribe the treatment that they believe to be doing better outside the trial. However, a number of factors mitigate this potential concern. First, it can be difficult to distinguish between patterns of sequential allocation status that are derived from fixed versus RAR. Second, extreme proportions will not be used (except where a Statistical Trigger but not a Platform Conclusion has been reached, see later). Finally, for many conditions, team-based management means that an individual clinician will directly observe only a small proportion of all participants enrolled within the trial at each participating site. Another disadvantage of RAR is that, under certain allocation rules, statistical power can be reduced. This concern is mitigated via pre-trial simulation to test the effects of different allocation rules. Furthermore, a REMAP that comprises multiple domains with multiple interventions within each domain will generally have higher, rather than lower, power as a consequence of the use of RAR. Finally, by deploying RAR rules to minimize the odds of exposure to inferior interventions, the design is intended to motivate embedding in clinical practice, thereby resulting in more rapid recruitment.",

Achieving universal enrollment of eligible participants increases the speed with which new knowledge is generated, maximizes internal and external validity, and minimizes operational complexity at the bedside (there is no need to distinguish between trial and non-trial patients, because all patients are trial patients). A number of strategies will be utilized to very tightly \"nest\" or embed trial processes in daily clinical care operations. The effectiveness of strategies to achieve embedding will be evaluated, updated, and shared with sites, taking into account different clinical processes at different sites. Wherever possible trial treatment allocations will be integrated with electronic customized order sets, produced at the point of delivery of care that also includes each site's local care standards for concomitant therapies. This allows clinical staff to follow their typical workflow using protocolized order sheets to govern many aspects of patient care and serves to enhance compliance with the interventions allocated by the trial. The intention of embedding is that recruitment occurs 24/7 and is dependent on the usual medical staff who are responsible for patient care. Where possible electronic health records will be utilized to enhance screening and recruitment and specify the 'order set' for participants, including those orders that are determined by allocation status within the REMAP. While screening and recruitment for a REMAP can be conducted by research staff, it is not intended that recruitment should be dependent on research staff, particularly as such staff are typically only present during office hours and since limiting potential exposure of non-essential personnel given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 is preferred. In addition to the facilitation of recruitment and high-fidelity delivery of the intervention, a further advantage is that the results of the trial can be translated rapidly within the ongoing REMAP so that all appropriate participants receive a treatment declared to be superior with continued allocation to that treatment option within the REMAP used to ensure implementation.",

In a single REMAP, there is no need for the \"start-and-stop\" periods that would typically occur under the alternative approach of multiple separate trials. These \"downtime\" periods can be quite extensive and carry a number of disadvantages. First, there is a lot of duplicative effort every time a near-identical treatment protocol goes through the appropriate development and approval processes. Second, clinical investigation units must maintain a certain infrastructure, and that infrastructure can be expensive to maintain during periods when participants are not being enrolled or expensive to recreate if the infrastructure degrades. Third, downtime is simply one more contributor to delay in the production of scientific knowledge. Participants at large benefit from earlier production of knowledge regardless of whether new information demonstrates a therapy is effective or ineffective. Finally, the inevitable start up delay before a trial can \"go live\" can wipe out any possibility of conducting effective research during time-critical situations such as a pandemic.",

Frequent adaptive analyses will be performed to determine if an intervention is superior, inferior, or equivalent to one or more other interventions to which it is being compared, within a domain. A Bayesian analysis method will be used to evaluate superiority, inferiority, or equivalence, as well as to inform the adaptive randomization strategy within each domain. Where it is anticipated that interactions between interventions in different domains may be likely the statistical models will allow evaluation of such interactions. Where the statistical models evaluate such an interaction the models can incorporate the relative likelihood of such interactions, but with possibly low prior probability in cases where it is biologically implausible for interactions to occur. Each intervention within each domain will be evaluated within prospectively defined and mutually exclusive strata (sub-groups) of participants but information from one stratum may be used (via 'borrowing') to contribute to the analysis of the effect of that intervention in other strata. Interventions that are found to be inferior, for a specific stratum, are removed from use in that stratum, and will, typically, be removed from the REMAP allowing new interventions or domains or both to be introduced. An RAR algorithm will be used to preferentially randomize participants to interventions that appear to be performing better. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to define the type I error, power to detect specified differences, and demonstration of equivalence as well as a broad range of operating characteristics. It is planned that further simulation studies will be conducted in conjunction with consideration of the introduction of new interventions or domains or both into the REMAP. The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle will be used for all primary analyses.",

Thirdly, gamma may be set to a defined number between zero and infinity. This parameter value cannot be varied for different domain-strata pairs, a global REMAP value has been selected. This specified value for gamma places a constraint on the variance of the difference in treatment effect in different stratum but permits the model to estimate treatment effect in one stratum by borrowing from other stratum.

Participants in this category are analyzed within baseline stratum in an ITT fashion. As such, the model allows evaluation of interactions with treatments in other domains that share the same stratum.

A BHM is used for all treatment-by-treatment interactions. In the BHM, a hyperprior is used for the differing treatment-by-treatment interaction effects. The standard deviation of the hyperprior, lambda, is a modeling starting estimate for the variation in the magnitude of the difference in treatment effect dependent on an intervention assignment in another domain. By default, the starting estimate of the difference is zero (i.e. no interaction).

The case-fatality proportion for critically ill patients with CAP is likely to be in the order of 20 to 30% and high proportions of patients will have one or both of laboratory abnormalities or complications of critical illness and its treatment. Patients who are critically ill, irrespective of whether or not they are enrolled in a trial, will typically experience multiple events that would meet the conventional definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).",

On January 30 th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (https://www.who.int/newsroom/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)). Given past history with novel coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), public health agencies have responded aggressively to the urgent need to acquire knowledge regarding this emerging infection. An important component of this urgently needed knowledge includes understanding the effectiveness of alternative treatment strategies in patients with suspected or proven infection. It should also be noted that clinical guidance issued by the WHO indicates that unproven therapies should be administered preferably only as part of a clinical trial (https://www.who.int/docs/defaultsource/coronaviruse/clinical-management-of-novel-cov.pdf).",

This observation reinforces the importance of not necessarily relying on extrapolation of results (both positive and negative) from patients who are not critically ill. Secondly, it is likely that the immune response that drives transition from viral pneumonitis to ARDS occur only or predominantly in patients who are critically ill or becoming critically ill .

However, it is biologically plausible that there is interaction between antiviral and immune modulatory therapies or interaction among different immune modulatory therapies or both. For example, an immune modulation strategy that dampens the host immune or inflammatory response may also result in uncontrolled viral replication. As such, administration of immune modulation strategy may be harmful in the absence of co-administration of antiviral agent, an immune modulation strategy may be effective only in the presence of coadministration of an active antiviral agent, and an antiviral agent may be ineffective alone but effective when co-administered with an agent that modulates the immune response. Additionally, it is plausible that combinations of different immune modulation therapy may be synergistic or antagonistic. As noted below, this is particularly relevant for the combination of corticosteroids and IFN-\u03b21a. The importance of testing combinations of agents is reinforced by the observation of the widespread use of these agents, including in combination, in published case series , Guan et al., 2020 .",

WHO guidance notes the flexibility associated with REMAP-CAP as a platform for the testing of multiple agents, including serial testing of additional interventions (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330680/WHO-HEO-RDBlueprint%28nCoV%29-2020. 1-eng.pdf?ua=1) At the commencement of this domain, a control group is included, i.e. some patients will not receive an immune modulation agent, either in this domain or in the Corticosteroid Domain that is intended to be active during COVID-19 infection.

Firstly, there is relatively limited trial or clinical experience with the administration of these immune modulation agents in patients who are critically ill due to viral infection, and it is not reasonable to presume that such agents are not capable of causing net harm. Secondly, designs that included only active interventions are not able to ascertain if any option is better or worse than no treatment.

Through mechanistic studies, humans infected with coronaviruses have been shown to have blockade of the interferon response during critical illness. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attenuates the interferon response of the innate immune system, and this mechanism is thought to impair the antiviral adaptive type 1 T helper cell (Th-1) immune response (Lau et al., 2013 , Faure et al., 2014 , Zielecki et al., 2013 , Frieman et al., 2008 .

This is potentially relevant to REMAP-CAP because of the presence of a separate domain that includes administration of corticosteroids. However, the validity of this association and its relevance to patients with COVID-19 infection is uncertain. Firstly, the patient population enrolled in the INTEREST study enrolled patients with ARDS of any cause. It is likely that few if any patients will have had ARDS secondary to viral pneumonia. Secondly, the evaluation of the possible interaction between corticosteroids and IFN-\u03b21a is a post hoc observational analysis in which residual confounding, caused by severity of illness, may be responsible for some or all of the observed association. Thirdly, it is likely that there will be co-administration of these agents in routine patient care and occurrence of this has been reported by Chinese physicians on WHO COVID-19 Clinical Network conference calls as well as use of corticosteroids in reported case series , Guan et al., 2020 , Wu and McGoogan, 2020 .

The overall incidence of AEs considered related to study drug was higher in the active group (28.5%) compared with the placebo group (21.7%), with the difference explained mostly by difference in fever. The incidence of SAEs in the MR11A8-2 trial (fatal and non-fatal) was similar in the active (53.1%) and placebo (47.7%) groups, but none of the events were strongly suspected of being causally related to the study drug. These trials, conducted in critically ill patients provides evidence that the safety profile in this patient population is acceptable. In previous trials (Bellingan et al., 2014 , Ranieri et al., 2020 enrolling patients with ARDS, IFN-\u03b21a 10 \u00b5g has been administered by dilution 1 mL of sterile water which is then administered as an intravenous bolus injection via a central or peripheral line. The dose selected for this study is based on information from the previous studies, where the maximum tolerated dose was found to be 22 \u00b5g. In some regions IFN-\u03b21a is available in a preparation containing 22 \u00b5g in a 0.5mL syringe. Therefore the dose in this trial will be 10-11 \u00b5g, depending on the preparation available. A dose of 10 \u00b5g was shown to be the OTD based on information from dose-limiting toxicity and proven markers of IFN-\u03b21a biological activity. In these trials IFN-\u03b21a was administered once daily for 6 days or until ICU discharge, whichever occurred first. In the immune modulation domain of REMAP-CAP IFN-\u03b21a will be administered using the administration regimen used in the INTEREST trial (Ranieri et al., 2020) . The clinical pathway to critical illness and death in patients with viral pneumonitis, such as that caused by influenza or SARS, involves development of ARDS. It is likely that a similar pathway occurs in COVID-19. In patients with ARDS secondary to influenza and SARS there is evidence of cytophagocytosis on histopathological examination (Harms et al., 2010) . Cytophagocytosis is a hallmark of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is an inflammasome/Interleukin-1(IL-1)mediated disease . MAS refers to an acute overwhelming inflammation caused by a cytokine storm and is recognized as a life-threatening complication of various diseases, including infection , Shakoory et al., 2016 . The clinical and laboratory features of MAS include sustained fever, hyperferritinemia and high IL-18, pancytopenia, fibrinolytic consumptive coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction (Schulert and Grom, 2015 , Rigante et al., 2015 .",

            "text": "Anakinra is widely used in rheumatic diseases, but has also been evaluated previously for treatment of critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock (Fisher et al., 1994 , Knaus et al., 1996 , Opal et al., 1997 . In these trials, for patients with sepsis, with a combined sample size of almost 2000 patients, anakinra did not reduce overall all-cause mortality. However, a post-hoc analysis indicated that survival was improved in the subgroup of sepsis patients with features of MAS (ferritin elevation in excess of 2,000 ng/ml, coagulopathy, and liver enzyme elevations) (Shakoory et al., 2016) . Such a post hoc finding should only be regarded as hypothesis generating, but the finding does support a potential beneficial effect of anakinra, particularly in the treatment or prevention of development of ARDS in patients with viral pneumonitis due to its association with MAS. 15.2.5.2. Safety profile There is extensive experience with the use of anakinra in ambulatory patients with rheumatic and inflammatory diseases. In placebo-controlled trials that enroll patients with rheumatoid arthritis the adverse reactions reported most frequently were injection site reactions, which were mild to moderate in the majority of patients. This is not an issue when anakinra is administered intravenously as will occur in this trial. The incidence of SAEs with anakinra (100 mg/day) was comparable with placebo (7.1% compared with 6.5% in the placebo group) (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kineret). The incidence of serious infection was higher in anakinra-treated patients compared to patients receiving placebo (1.8% vs. 0.7%) (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kineret). Neutropenia occurred more frequently in patients receiving anakinra compared with placebo, 2.4% compared to 0.4%, respectively (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kineret). In clinical trials that recruited patients with septic shock or severe sepsis, anakinra was well tolerated with no difference in occurrence of AEs and SAEs between anakinra and placebo (Fisher et al., 1994 , Knaus et al., 1996 , Opal et al., 1997 . In these studies anakinra was administered at doses of up to 2 mg/kg/hour intravenously (which is 35 times the standard dose in rheumatoid arthritis over a 72-hour treatment period). 15.2.5.3. Anakinra dosing To neutralize IL-1 signaling completely, IL-1Ra must be present in at least a concentration 1000 times higher than IL-1 (Arend et al., 1990) . When this occurs, signaling is blocked for at least 4-6 hours. The trial will use a dose of 300 mg intravenously once initially to reach the amount of IL-1Ra that can completely block IL-1 signaling. It will then continue at a maintenance dose of 100 mg intravenously every 6 hours to maintain adequate drug levels to block IL-1. This is a much lower dose than 2 mg/kg per hour administered in previous clinical and pre-clinical studies that recruited patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, which did not report serious side effects.",

In SARS, high levels of interleukin (IL)-6 are released from monocytes and macrophages in response to interaction between the viral spike (S) protein and cell-surface TLR-2 (Jacques et al., 2009 ). In this model, the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 was mostly dependent on the activation of the ERK-1/2 MAPK and JNK pathways and, to a lesser extent, the p38 MAPK and NF-kB pathways. The pathology induced by in a mouse Coronavirus model, utilizing the Mouse Hepatitis Virus, was mediated by the release of intrahepatic IL-6 and TNF-a via the TLR2 receptor, as demonstrated in TLR2 knockout mice and by histopathological observations. In a mouse model of SARS, excessive secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 exacerbate pulmonary pathogenesis by modulating intrinsic functions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. These cytokines may also facilitate a mechanism for evading the host immune response by delaying and inhibiting the ability of dendritic cells to prime na\u00efve T cells. This provides a dual rationale for the potential benefit of IL-6 blockade in Coronavirus infection.",

IL-6, which is secreted by monocytes and macrophages, is one of the main drivers of immunologic response and symptoms in patients with cytokine-release syndrome (CRS). While tocilizumab was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, it has received additional approval for treatment of patients with giant cell arteritis, and systemic and juvenile forms of idiopathic arthritis. In 2017, Tocilizumab received additional approval for the treatment of severe or life-threatening CAR T-associated CRS due to its efficacy and safety profile. While criteria for grading CRS severity varies by cancer center, it has been proposed to administer tocilizumab to CRS patients with any of the following: oxygen requirement < 40%, hypotension responsive to fluids or a low dose of a single vasoactive agent, or Grade 2 organ toxicity as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. (Lee et al., 2018) Hyperinflammatory states and cytokine storming, including elevated IL-6, has been reported in patients with severe COVID-19 and were associated with increased mortality in patients in China (Zhou et al., 2020a) . A pre-print (non-peer reviewed) case series of 21 patients treated with tocilizumab between February 5-14, 2020 in China reported clinical success, with rapid resolution of fever and C-reactive protein, decreased oxygen requirements, and resolution of lung opacities on computerized tomography imaging. The authors state the patients all had \"routine treatment for a week\" before tocilizumab, which was described as \"standard care according to national treatment guidelines\" including lopinavir, methylprednisolone, and other supportive care. All patients had IL-6 analyzed prior to tocilizumab administration with a mean value of 132.38 \u00b1 278.54 pg/mL (normal < 7 pg/mL). No adverse events were described in this case-series although no assessment of long-term outcomes was reported. If effective, there is uncertainty regarding optimal timing of administration or of possible differential treatment effect depending on stage of disease.",

The trial design is built prospectively to be flexible. These flexible aspects are designed and planned and are part of the protocol. In this report, we describe the details of the prospective statistical design. In contrast to many clinical trial designs, where there is a single intervention or a small number of interventions, this REMAP is designed generically so that it may incorporate a flexible number of interventions, with the possibility of these numbers evolving as the science evolves. This statistical analysis plan describes the statistical design in the most general way possible, and thus applies for all imaginable trial design states. The current trial design state is described a separate document, Current Statistical Modeling. Similar interventions are grouped within domains. Each patient is randomized to a single intervention from each domain. This set of randomized interventions across the domains is the patient's regimen. Patients are also grouped into strata and into disease states. The efficacy of the interventions may vary by strata. Optimal interventions will be identified by strata. Some interventions may only be administered to patients in certain disease states. The specific domains, interventions, strata, and states being investigated in REMAP are allowed to evolve throughout the perpetual nature of this trial. These evolutionary aspects are described. The adaptations in the design are controlled by a statistical model. This statistical model is described in the section entitled \"Statistical Modeling\" (Section 5). The modeling can expand and contract to accommodate the number of domains, interventions, strata, and states being evaluated at any time. The section entitled \"Trial adaptation and stopping criteria and guidelines for interventions\" (Section 9) describes the adaptations in this REMAP. These include the timing of adaptive analyses, the Response Adaptive Randomization (RAR), and the requirements for declaration of superiority, inferiority, or equivalence of interventions. A separate document, The Current Statistical Modeling document, describes the current domains, interventions, strata, states and specifies the current statistical modeling. Another separate document, the Simulations Appendix, presents a range of simulation-based operating characteristics based on the current state of the trial. This includes simulating from various assumptions of treatment effects and observing the behavior of the trial design: for example, the number of patients assigned to each intervention and the probability of declaring interventions superior, inferior, or equivalent by strata.",

The goals of the trial are to both treat patients effectively while also investigating the relative benefit of different interventions, within different groups of patients. The design is adaptive in that the key aspects of the trial will evolve in a pre-planned way based on accruing data. First, there will be a starting status with regard to strata, domains, and the interventions within a domain. These aspects are expected to change during the course of the REMAP trial. Strata can be added or removed. Similarly, domains can be added or removed, and interventions within the domains can be added or removed based on internal or external information. The trial design is generic in terms of the number of strata, domains, and interventions within a domain, so that the trial functions seamlessly, based on predefined rules, as the questions being evaluated within the trial evolve.

Firstly, some aspects of the Appendix were updated to reflect accumulated knowledge and experience of how the Appendix applies to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondly, in some regions of the world a separate and new Core Protocol had been developed, termed REMAP-COVID, which combines elements of the REMAP-CAP Core Protocol with the Pandemic Appendix to the Core Protocol, has been developed, approved and implemented. The REMAP-COVID Core Protocol is used in countries and locations that were not participating in REMAP-CAP prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and where the only objective of the platform was to evaluate treatments in patients with proven or suspected COVID-19 infection. Patients enrolled at locations in which REMAP-COVID Core Protocol is approved, as well as patients enrolled at locations in which the REMAP-CAP Core Protocol and Pandemic Appendix to the Core Protocol is approved, are all analyzed in the same pandemic statistical model. This version of the Pandemic Appendix achieves alignment between both sets of core documents. CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 411",

Data derived from sites using either set of documents is analyzed in the same pandemic statistical model. A single site must use either REMAP-COVID Core Protocol or REMAP-CAP Core Protocol with this associated pandemic appendix.The objective of the Pandemic Appendix to the Core Protocol (PAtC) is to describe the adaptations to the Core Protocol that would apply during a pandemic, including how analyses of domains already operative during the interpandemic period as well as domains that are pandemic-specific, will be integrated during a pandemic. with acute illness due to suspected or proven pandemic infection, as defined by the pandemic primary end-point. substantial delays in transferring a patient from an emergency department to either a ward or an ICU (or a re-purposed ICU). Patients in an emergency department who have been accepted for admission to an ICU are regarded as being admitted to an ICU. Patients in an emergency department who have been accepted for admission to a ward are regarded as being admitted to a ward. Secondly, patients who are not critically ill may be treated on an ICU for reasons that are not related to withhold some form of organ failure support that would otherwise have be provided. Where a definition of an ICU is needed, at sites at which the pandemic stratum (see below) has been activated, an area within the hospital that is repurposed so as to be able to deliver one or more of the qualifying organ failure supports specified in the Core Protocol (non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, and vasopressor therapy) will meet the definition of an Intensive Care Unit. It is preferred in such circumstances that the patient is under the care of a specialist who is trained in the provision of critical care, but this is not an essential requirement. A respiratory or other ward that provides non-invasive ventilation(including oxygen therapy delivered by high flow nasal cannula) and continues to do so during a pandemic, will not, generally, meet the definition of an ICU, particularly if the patient is not under the care of a specialist who is trained in the provision of critical care. Platform-level eligibility criteria may be modified if necessary to accommodate a published case definition, to align with criteria specified in guidelines, such as the ATS/IDSA guidelines on CAP16, or to accommodate necessary modifications to the online eligibility system used for enrolment. In previous epidemics of communitybased infection, nosocomial acquisition has been well described. Relaxation of the requirement for community acquisition or organ failure criteria or both may be appropriate. All changes to eligibility criteria would apply A PISOP patient can contribute to both the pandemic and interpandemic model in different domains but each patient's contribution to a model is mutually exclusive with respect to each domain. The ITSC will select the domains to be included in the pandemic model where a differential treatment effect is postulated in the presence of pandemic infection or the need exists to learn about the outcome quickly, or both. A PISOP patient can contribute to both the pandemic and interpandemic model in different domains but each patient's contribution to a model is mutually exclusive with respect to each domain. The ITSC will select the domains to be included in the pandemic model where a differential treatment effect is postulated in the presence of pandemic infection or the need exists to learn about bodies prior to the first adaptive analysis of the PISOP stratum. These parameters are set out in a document termed Operating Characteristics and this document applies to both REMAP-CAP core protocol documents as well as the REMAP-COVID Core Protocol, to the extent that is necessary. It is also acknowledged that specification in a new domain, may influence a preexisting domain, such as specification of evaluation of an interaction between domains. In this situation, the DSA for the pre-existing domain will not necessarily be both, but is not receiving either of those therapies at time of assessment is deemed to be in the Moderate State. A patient who has been in the Severe State, as a consequence of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation in an ICU, cannot re-enter the Moderate State for the purposes of assessment of eligibility. A patient who receives an assignment in the REMAP while in the Severe State cannot receive any subsequent assignments in the Moderate State. Where trial related processes, such as reveal of assignment or obtaining consent, create a time gap between initial assessment of eligibility and awareness of the patient's assignment, the state in which the patient is analyzed is that which occurred at the time of assessment, not the time of reveal of the assignment. State and is not eligible for enrolment in new domains in the Severe State (including domains evaluated in the interpandemic model). It is also noted that, for a patient who is enrolled in both states, that other time-varying baseline variables may have changed between each enrolment. For such patients, potential time-varying baseline variables will be collected in reference to enrolment in the Moderate State and again in reference to enrolment in the Severe State.",

Allocation to the regimens will be allowed to vary across the patient groups defined by the strata. Patients will be enrolled in the trial and randomized to a regimen according the group they belong to within each strata. The randomization for each patient is based on the probability that each regimen is the optimal regimen for a patient within that patient strata, but balanced by the sample size already allocated to that regimen. This balancing creates better learning about the optimal regimen by allowing a less aggressive randomization to regimens that already have a larger number of patients allocated. We refer to this scheme as maximizing the information about the optimal regimen within a stratum.The randomization for a patient in group g within strata k is proportional toWhere ( ) is the probability that regimen r is optimal for patients in group g of strata kand , is the total number of patients in group g of strata k who have already been allocated to regimen r. Multiple normalizations are done to create the final randomization probabilities. The following steps are carried out.1. Each randomization probability is normalized to sum to 1 by dividing by the sum of quantities over all regimens. 2. Any single intervention with a sum of probabilities across all regimens within a stratum less than 10% will be increased to sum to the floor randomization per intervention of 0.10. Note that a minimum randomization of 10% implies a maximum randomization probability of 90% a. A nuisance parameter (\uf06a) will be added to the odds ratio for each intervention that does not achieve at least a 10% randomization probability.

If there are Jd interventions in a domain after the new intervention is started, then a fixed allocation of 1/Jd will be used to allocate patients to the new intervention. The remaining 1 \u2212 1 probability will be allocated to the other interventions using the RAR. This burn-in for each intervention will last until 25 patients have been allocated to the new intervention. At that communicated to the ITSC and they will take the appropriate action (Public Disclosure, removal of one intervention, no action). There is no automatic adaptation when this occurs.",

Simpler models will be constructed and evaluated determining any root cause issues, data issues, or inappropriate model fit. If any numeric instabilities can be fit in statistical numeric methods, these will be done by the SAC and the adjustments recorded and noted. If the model is deemed to provide an inappropriate fit then the SAC will inform the DSMB of appropriate adjustments which will be reported to the ITSC in a way that does not risk unblinding trial results. Possible adjustments could include:1. If there are issues within an intervention for limited data the parameter for that intervention can be fixed for model stability. 2. If there is missing data on whether there were revelations of delayed reveals and/or state values then an ITT Model ignoring the changing states will be fit to explore the effects 3. A reasonable solution should technology fail or data issues arise would be to keep the randomization unchanged, fix the randomization for an intervention, or create equal randomization for all interventions/regimens.",
