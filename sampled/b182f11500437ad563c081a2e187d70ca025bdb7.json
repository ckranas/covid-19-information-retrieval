We address how these global environmental changes affect the atmosphere and air quality; human health; terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; biogeochemical cycles; and materials used in outdoor construction, solar energy technologies, and fabrics. In many cases, there is a growing influence from changes in seasonality and extreme events due to climate change. Additionally, we assess the transmission and environmental effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of linkages with solar UV radiation and the Montreal Protocol.",

Due to the Montreal Protocol, large increases in UV-B (280-315 nm) radiation have been avoided and global warming reduced through regulation of the ozone depleting substances, most of which are also potent greenhouse gases. The resulting changes in stratospheric ozone, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and climate are evaluated regarding the effects on humans and the environment. Some of the potential consequences are assessed of recent unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Sect. 9), and unprecedented increases in UV radiation over the Arctic in 2020 due to stratospheric ozone depletion (Sect. 2).",

            "text": "This section provides an update since our last assessments [1, 2] on recent findings of the interactions between stratospheric ozone, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and climate, and discusses the impact of the Montreal Protocol on these processes. In addition to protecting life on Earth from harmful UV radiation, the Montreal Protocol is also highly effective in mitigating global warming because most of the ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) regulated by the Montreal Protocol are also potent greenhouse gases (GHGs). According to new quantitative estimates, the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has prevented between a quarter and a third of the global mean increases in air temperature, depending on the time period considered. The stratospheric ozone hole over Antarctica continues to recover, with 2019 being one of the years with the lowest spring-time UV index measured at the South Pole since the start of measurements in 1991. In the Arctic, springtime episodes of stratospheric ozone depletion, identified first in the early 2010s, continue to occur. The last episode in the spring of 2020 led to the largest ozone loss measured to date and resulted in UV indices that were twice as high as typical at several Arctic locations. Additional topics discussed include: trends in measured surface UV radiation from ground-based and satellite data that are driven by changes in total ozone, aerosols and clouds; effects of Antarctic ozone depletion on the climate in the Southern Hemisphere and linkages to Australian wildfires; and projections of surface UV-B radiation for the second half of the twenty-first century. This section contributes to SDG 11.5, 12.4, 13.2, and 17.14 by providing further evidence that the Montreal Protocol has protected the climate and the stratospheric ozone layer.",

As much as 1.1 \u00b0C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. In addition to quantifying benefits from the Montreal Protocol that have already been realised, Goyal et al. [10] also assessed the Montreal Protocol's effect on the future climate for the RCP 8.5 scenario. Projected temperature increases that are likely to be averted by 2050 are on the order of 1.5 \u00b0C to 2 \u00b0C over most extrapolar land areas, and between 3 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C over the Arctic. Averaged over the globe (including the oceans), about 1 \u00b0C warming would be avoided by 2050, which corresponds to about 25% mitigation of global warming expected from all GHGs.

When all known forcings (GHGs, ODSs) were taken into account, the simulated global-mean air temperature at the surface increased by 0. 59 \u00b0C between 1955 and 2005 . When the concentrations of ODSs and atmospheric ozone were fixed at 1955 levels, the resulting temperature change was only 0.39 \u00b0C. Hence, ODSs were responsible for about one-third of global warming over this period. Similar calculations for the Arctic (60-90\u00b0 N) resulted in temperature changes of 1.59 \u00b0C and 0.82 \u00b0C for the two scenarios, respectively, suggesting that ODSs contributed about one-half to the warming at the Arctic surface.

Depletion of stratospheric ozone resulting from ODSs has therefore led to a small radiative cooling at the surface. However, both studies concluded that the magnitude of surface warming by ODSs far outweighs the cooling effect from ozone depletion. In a more recent multi-model study, Morgenstern et al. [12] estimated a larger cooling effect from ozone depletion than modelled by Goyal et al. [10] and Polvani et al. [3] . While these new calculations are consistent within error bars with previously published values [5] , the larger cooling effect determined by Morgenstern et al. [12] means that the effect from phasing out ODSs would be smaller than summarised above. The effect of ODSs on climate is an area of active research and it is expected that refinements to climate chemistry models, e.g., by including compounding factors such as tropospheric ozone pollution, will further reduce uncertainties in estimating the effect of the Montreal Protocol on surface temperature.",

After adjusting for the effect of stratospheric temperature on ozone depletion, trends in all four metrics over the 2001-2017 period are statistically significant (95% confidence level (CL)) and point in the direction of increasing ozone. These results are supported by Kramarova et al. [19] who calculated significant positive trends in TOC over a slightly longer period (1999-2019) for two metrics: the mean TOC for September averaged over the 60\u00b0-90\u00b0 S latitude range (trend of 22.3 Dobson Units (DU) per decade, 94% CL) and the Antarctic minimum TOC (trend of 17.9 DU per decade, > 99% CL).

Figure 2 shows the measured UV index at the two sites for 1 September through 31 December 2019 compared with the mean and range calculated from measurements of the years 1991-2018. Between October and mid-November 2019, the UV index at the South Pole was at the minimum of the historical (1991-2018) range, and remained close to this minimum between mid-November and January. At Arrival Heights, the UV index in 2019 was close to the minimum between September and mid-November, and stayed below the long-term mean until mid-December, with the exception of two short periods. Similarly, reduced UV indices compared to the observational record, which began in 2007 [24] , were observed from September to December at the Australian Antarctic research stations of Casey (66\u00b0 S), Mawson (68\u00b0 S) and Davis (69\u00b0 S).

Recent work has further highlighted these links, and has shown evidence of changes due to stratospheric ozone recovery. Banerjee et al. [37] used meteorological reanalyses and simulations with a single climate model to show that circulation changes induced by stratospheric ozone loss in the 1980s and 1990s halted or partly reversed around the end of the twentieth century. Furthermore, they find that these changes are primarily the result of the reversal in the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion due to actions prompted by the Montreal Protocol to decrease emissions of ODSs. Hence, the Montreal Protocol has contributed to SDG 11.5 by returning circulation patterns to their natural state.",

While they point out that the amount of Antarctic ozone loss in any given year relates to the strength of downward coupling from the stratosphere to the surface, they find that the increase in stratospheric ozone depletion led to a tendency towards drier conditions in Chile and more precipitation in parts of Australia, and to a lesser extent in South America. Hence, springtime ozone anomalies in Antarctica can be used as a predictor The UV indices were calculated from spectra measured by SUV-100 spectroradiometers. Up to 2009, the instruments were part of the NSF UV monitoring network [25] and they are now a node in the NOAA Antarctic UV Monitoring Network (https ://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/antuv /).

            "text": "According to a recent study, weakening and warming of the stratospheric polar vortex over Antarctica substantially increased the likelihood of hot and dry weather extremes across subtropical eastern Australia from austral spring to early summer [39] . The unusual warming of the Antarctic stratosphere in September 2019 (Sect. 2.3) may have exacerbated the extremely dry conditions observed during the summer of 2019/20 in the Southern Hemisphere [23, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , leading to devastating wildfires in Australia [45] . Specifically, the stratospheric warming event influenced the troposphere from mid-October 2019 by forcing the SAM from a positive phase to a negative phase, which enhanced anomalously hot and dry conditions in eastern Australia [44] . We emphasise that the stratospheric warming event, the change in the phase of the SAM, and the small ozone hole in the spring of 2019 are all attributable to unusually strong planetary-scale wave activity in 2019. There have been no specific studies for this event addressing the question of whether the presence of ODSs in the atmosphere contributed to the properties of these waves or influenced the coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. Hence, the role of the Montreal Protocol in this extreme weather event is still undetermined. The fires that occurred in eastern Australia in December 2019 and January in 2020 affected over 10 million hectares and caused unprecedented atmospheric effects throughout the Southern Hemisphere [46] [47] [48] [49] . Superheated air from the fires produced large-scale pyrocumulonimbus clouds, forcing smoke into the lower stratosphere, from where it rose to heights up to 35 km [49] . The rising plumes carried ozonepoor tropospheric air into the stratosphere, which produced localised depletion of ozone, with the TOC reduced by up to 100 DU or in excess of one third of the typical TOC [46, 49] . The rising air also locally increased the water vapour mixing ratio in the lower stratosphere at southern mid-latitudes [49] where it might be expected to deplete ozone through enhanced heterogeneous reactions [50] . The smoke also increased aerosol absorption in isolated areas [48, 49] . It can be anticipated that the plume-induced ozone dilution and depletion increased UV radiation at the surface while smoke and aerosols resulting from the fires led to decreased UV radiation. However, the combined effects of these two opposing mechanisms on UV radiation in the affected areas",

In the first half of the twenty-first century, stratospheric ozone recovery will shift the westerly jet equatorward, but this shift will be partially cancelled depending on the GHG scenario (defined by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP 3 ) [53] ) that eventuates: for low emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5) there is no significant change, but for high emissions scenarios (e.g., SSP5-8.5), there is a tendency for further poleward progression and strengthening of the jet. During the second half of the twenty-first century, ozone forcing is expected to weaken while forcing by GHG will strengthen, resulting in a general southward shift of the westerly jet for all scenarios.

The low TOCs in 2020 were partially caused by a strong and long-lived polar vortex, which provided ideal conditions for chemical ozone destruction to take place.

The occurrence of a small ozone hole with little ozone depletion over Antarctica (Sect. 2.3) and large ozone depletion over the Arctic within a 6-month period is a coincidence and cannot be attributed to a common cause. The low TOC led to record-breaking anomalies in solar UV-B radiation over the Arctic measured by ground-based instruments at ten Arctic and subarctic locations and observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite [59] . UV radiation anomalies were particularly large between early March and mid-April 2020. The UV indices measured in 2020 exceeded the historical (2005-2019) mean by up to 100%. At several locations in northern Canada and Scandinavia, historical means were surpassed by more than six standard deviations.

These new studies generally confirmed the conclusions from our last update assessment [1] , i.e., changes in UV radiation during the last 20 years have been small (generally less than ca. 4% per decade) because the Montreal Protocol has prevented large decreases in TOC. For most locations outside the polar regions, long-term changes in UV-B radiation are mainly governed by variations in clouds, aerosols, and surface reflectivity, while changes in TOC are less important. Results from these ground-based measurements are corroborated by satellite data. Using observations from OMI, Herman et al. [63] showed that noon-time erythemal irradiance at 191 cities located between 60\u00b0 N and 60\u00b0 S has not significantly (95% CL) changed over the period 2005-2018. However, when data are averaged over 15\u00b0 latitude bands, there are strong correlations between erythemal UV radiation and short-and long-term changes in clouds and absorbing aerosols, as well as inverse correlations with TOC. The largest changes in erythemal irradiance between 60\u00b0 N and 60\u00b0 S are caused by changes in cloud and aerosol transmission, and range between \u2212 4 and 4% per decade.",

At the South Pole (a site representative of the Antarctic Polar Plateau), significant (95% CL) decadal trends of \u2212 3.9% and \u2212 3.1% over the period 1996-2018 were calculated for January and February, respectively, which can mostly be explained by concomitant positive trends in TOC. At Arrival Heights, a significant (90% CL) trend in the UV index of \u2212 3.3% per decade was calculated for summer and was attributed to a significant upward trend in TOC of 1.5% per decade for January plus the effect of changes in fast ice (i.e., sea ice fixed in place by land, grounded icebergs, or ice shelves) covering the sea adjacent to the instrument site. Thus, this study provides evidence that the UV index in Antarctica is starting to decrease during summer months. However, statistically significant reductions for spring (October and November), when the ozone hole leads to large UV index variability, were not detected. Trends for spring were also not apparent even when data from 2019-the year when an unusually small ozone hole was observed (Sect. 2.3)-were included.",

DNA-damaging irradiance averaged over the five locations is projected to increase by 1.3% per decade between 2050 and 2100. To isolate the effect of GHGs on climate, one simulation assumed increasing GHGs according to RCP 6.0 and the second adopted constant GHGs at 1960 levels. No trend in total ozone was detected by the model after 2050, and the trend in DNA-damaging irradiance was attributed to a statistically significant (95% CL) decrease in cloud cover of \u2212 1.4 per decade resulting from increasing GHGs. The study suggests that changes in UV-B irradiance at low-and mid-latitudes during the second half of the twenty-first century will be dominated by factors other than changes in stratospheric ozone [65] .

OMI measurements on the Aura satellite started in 2004 [67] and will likely be discontinued in a few years [1] . The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite will provide space-based estimates of UV radiation for the future. TROPOMI observations of UV radiation have recently been compared with ground-based measurements at 25 sites [68] . For snow-free surface conditions, the median relative difference between measurements of the UV index by TROPOMI and these ground stations agreed within \u00b1 10% and \u00b1 5% at 18 and 10 sites, respectively. These differences are comparable to those reported for OMI [69, 70] . Larger differences were observed at locations with challenging conditions, such as mountainous areas or sites in the Arctic and Antarctic with variable snow cover. TRO-POMI and OMI data agree with ground-based measurements within a similar range. A comprehensive comparison between OMI and TROPOMI surface UV products is planned [67] to ensure that there is no step-change in the time series of UV radiation measurements when transitioning from OMI to TROPOMI.",

Total melanoma incidence was higher in men than women in 'new world' populations (those more recently populated by people of European descent; United States whites, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) but not in 'old world' countries (United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) [76] . The male to female incidence rate ratio varied with age. In all populations cutaneous melanomas were more common in women than in men in those aged < 45 years, mostly due to higher rates of melanoma on the lower limb in women. The opposite was true for people aged \u2265 70 years due to the higher incidence on the head and neck in men. These sexand site-specific patterns most likely indicate combinations of sex differences in the anatomic distribution of naevi [77] and patterns of sun exposure. These differences may need to be considered in models to predict future melanoma risk.",

New information on melanoma mortality was reported for 31 countries, using data from the WHO Mortality Database, covering the time period from 1985 to 2015. An overall increase in mortality was reported for men in all countries, in contrast with stable or declining rates in women [78] . For the most recent time period (2013-2015), the median mortality rate was 2.6 deaths per 100,000 for men and 1.55 per 100,000 for women; the highest mortality rates were recorded for Australia and Norway for men, and Norway and Slovenia for women. The increase in most countries reflected increasing mortality rates in people aged 50 years or older; mortality rates were generally stable or declining in younger age groups. A separate report for Spain over the period 1982-2016 showed a similar trend, with mortality rates stabilising in men and women younger than 64 years from the mid-90s, while rates continued to rise in older age groups [79] . An analysis of data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [80] suggests that in Australia the mortality rates in men and women are declining, although this appears much more marked in men (Fig. 4) . Improved treatments for metastatic melanoma over the past decade are partly responsible for the declining mortality. Data from the United States (restricted to whites) have shown that the introduction of new systemic therapies was associated with a significant reduction in the melanoma mortality rate over the period 2013-2016 (AAPC \u2212 6.2, 95% CI \u2212 8.7 to \u2212 3.7) [81] .",

The lifetime risk increased from 3.2 to 10.1% in women and from 2.8% to 7.3% in men. The increase in incidence was highest for BCC on the trunk and legs; between 1981 and 1990 72% of BCCs were located on the head and neck in both men and women, whereas in 2009-2017 period this percentage had decreased to 57% for men and 49% for women. Given the observed incidence patterns, and the very low ambient UV radiation in Iceland, it is most likely that these changes are due to increased use of tanning beds and/or more frequent travel to sunny locations.",

An analysis of blood samples from 6433 adults (aged 40-69 years) of South-Asian descent from the UK Biobank cohort (samples collected between 2006 and 2010) found a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; 92% had 25(OH)D concentration < 50 nmol/L, 55% were < 25 nmol/L and 20% had very severe deficiency (25(OH)D < 15 nmol/L). When an additional 843 participants with undetectable 25(OH)D concentration were included the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency rose to 29%. While these data are now at least a decade old, and new recommendations that residents of the United Kingdom should routinely take a 400 international unit supplement may have reduced the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, they highlight the high risk borne by dark-skinned people living at high latitudes [101] . One of the main consequences of vitamin D deficiency in children is rickets, and over 80% of children with rickets in the United Kingdom are of South Asian or black ethnicity [102] .",

            "text": "Exposing the skin to UV radiation affects the local and systemic immune system through both vitamin D and nonvitamin D pathways. Depending on the wavelength, dose, and frequency of exposure to UV radiation, adaptive (i.e., acquired) immune responses are often suppressed [103, 104] . Exposure to UV radiation induces alterations to cutaneous cells, molecules [105] , the transcriptome [106] , and commensal bacteria [107] , leading to the downstream , respond to nitric oxide (NO) and UV radiation by releasing immune-modulatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). These events lead to the recruitment from blood of innate immune cells including IL-4-producing neutrophils (neut) and macrophages (M\u03a6). This recruitment and activation of the innate immune system is reinforced by (3) local production of vitamin D 3 and its metabolites which, together with UV radiation, can induce the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These events are likely to influence the cutaneous microbiome which may increase skin irritation and rashes, and also alter immune responses to pathogens. Exposure to UV radiation also increases the diversity of the gut microbiome which has potential benefits for health. (4) In response to high and prolonged doses of UV radiation, regulatory T and B cells (T Reg and B Reg , respectively) are activated in lymph nodes that drain from local skin. The subsequent suppression of adaptive immune responses increases the risk of skin cancer but may explain why exposure to UV radiation may reduce the risk of autoimmune disease such as multiple sclerosis. Figure designed by S. Byrne \u25b8 activation of regulatory T and B cells. These exert their suppressive effects for sustained periods of time, both locally at the site of exposure to UV radiation and distantly at unirradiated sites (Fig. 5 ) [108] . Other immune cells, including recently described GATA3+ T cells [109] , may also be involved. Suppression of the cutaneous immune response is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of skin cancer [104] . This is particularly the case when the amount of UV radiation received is high (i.e., sunburning) and/or prolonged (i.e., chronic). The distant effects of UV radiation on the immune response may drive melanoma development at nonskin sites such as the eye [110] .",

In addition, we address how UV-B radiation, together with changes in other environmental factors associated with climate change (e.g., temperature, moisture availability), affects plant growth, pathogen and pest defence, and food crop quality.

Shifts in the ranges of distribution can disrupt ecosystem functioning and lead to further species migration. Ultimately, if dispersal fails to keep pace with changing habitats, biodiversity loss will occur. Species distribution models are applied to determine how climate change will affect future habitat suitability of valuable species through changes in key abiotic drivers. These models account for landscape-level processes; they do not account for fine-scale effects on microhabitats, including topographic, canopylevel and biotic factors, which are also important in determining where species can live [126, 127]. These species distribution models can be used to inform efforts to conserve species (SDG 2.5), as well as management plans for improving plant production in agriculture and forestry [128] . Several studies have shown that the inclusion of UV-B radiation in models that forecast future distribution ranges of ecologically and agriculturally important species can improve their predictive power [75, [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] . These models are based on RCP scenarios (Sect. 2.1) driving future climate change, and suggest that the range of some native species from open, dry habitats will expand to higher elevations [75, [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] , while the ranges of willows and other related species from wetter habitats will shrink [129] .",

Of these, cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes and algae) are best adapted to survive under these conditions and they dominate the Antarctic flora. In comparison, the two native vascular plant species are restricted to the Antarctica peninsula [136] . Despite their taxonomic differences, there are parallels in the adaptive responses of Antarctic bryophytes and vascular plants to UV-B radiation. Adaptive strategies to survive exposure to UV-B radiation in the moss, Pohlia nutans, include antioxidant enzymes, flavonoid synthesis and photolyases [137-139], whereas in Ceratodon purpureus various flavonoids confer photoprotection [140] along with yet to be identified red cell wall pigments [141] . The equivalent protection response of the vascular plant, Colobanthus quitensis, to UV radiation is enhanced by forming mutually beneficial relationships between plant roots and soil fungi (i.e., mycorrhizae). These associations rely on a stable ecosystem and support the plant's floral development and growth, also reducing oxidative stress and membrane damage, protecting photosynthesis and maintaining photoprotection through UV-screening flavonoids [142] [143] [144] . In the native Antarctic grass, Deschampsia antarctica, a key enzyme in the synthesis of flavonoids (chalcone synthase) matches that present in temperate grasses, including the cereal grains rice and barley [145], indicating a common regulatory role in UV-photoprotection across these species. An understanding of how these organisms tolerate UV-B radiation and the harsh conditions of Antarctica will improve our ability to assess the vulnerability of polar biodiversity to ongoing changes in stratospheric ozone and climate. Ozone depletion has partially masked the impact of climate change in Antarctica, primarily during summer, by promoting cooler conditions than would otherwise have occurred.",

These conditions were associated with a strong negative state of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which has been linked with anomalous tropical convection [41] . Model projections indicate that persistence and variability of the SAM are enhanced by stratospheric ozone depletion, leading to longer lasting coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere [152] .

While it is too early to know the full extent of biological changes resulting from the Antarctic summer of heatwaves, we would expect flooding to alter soil invertebrate and cyanobacterial communities in the coming decade as reported following flooding of the Dry Valleys in 2001-2002 [155] . Accelerated snow melt can also lead to depletion of water reserves late in the season, causing ecosystem water deficits in late summer [136] . Antarctic organisms are able to survive in the normally cold air by absorption of solar radiation and passive heating to create microhabitats where plants are often 10-20 \u02daC warmer than the ambient temperature [153] . We, therefore, would expect that temperatures like the 20.75 \u00b0C reported at Marambio Base on Seymour Island last summer would lead to heat stress in Antarctic organisms [43] . In general, we anticipate that these recent extreme conditions pose significant threats to the survival of some terrestrial and coastal marine plants and animals from Antarctica as well as other high southern latitudes, since their adaptive capacity may be reduced under rapidly changing conditions in these already harsh environments. However, scientific reports on the ecosystem effects of these heatwaves, floods and/or droughts on native Antarctic species will likely take several years to appear.",

            "text": "Changes in climate and stratospheric ozone are altering the exposures of plants to UV-B radiation and this is occurring in concert with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, extreme air temperatures and more variable precipitation patterns [156] . Because of these environmental changes, some crop plants in tropical and temperate mountain regions are likely to be exposed to increasing UV-B radiation as their most suitable habitat is displaced to higher elevations [149] . Multiple environmental factors interact to affect plant growth and agricultural crop quality, but effects are variable depending on species and growing conditions. In particular, ambient UV radiation combined with other environmental stressors, such as changes in temperature, can drive flavonoid production. These compounds have multiple functions in plants including as UV radiation screening pigments, antioxidants and signalling molecules, and changes in plant flavonoids can carry forward to affect a number of ecosystem processes [157, 158] . Flavonoids occur in agricultural and wild plant species and their concentration in leaves and fruit varies with seasonal weather patterns and herbivory [159] [160] [161] . Studies of organisms that live at very high elevations are relevant for understanding how species acclimate and adapt to high UV irradiances under extreme environmental conditions. For example, Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is a crop from the high Andes in Peru that can quickly recover from stress induced by acute high solar UV radiation [162, 163] . Similarly, Chinese tallow trees (Triadica sebifera), growing in Fig. 6 In recent decades, Antarctica has been shielded from some of the effects of global warming by shifts in the climate of the Southern Hemisphere that are related to stratospheric ozone depletion. The Antarctic summer of 2019/20 provides a recent example where the moderating effect of stratospheric ozone depletion on regional climate was likely diminished. An anomalously high total column ozone in the austral spring of 2019 (linked primarily to meteorological factors and not to significantly reduced stratospheric ODS concentrations) resulted from a weak and strongly disturbed polar vortex. Throughout the 2019/20 summer, high temperatures were recorded across Antarctica, which led to melting of ice and exposure of new ice-free areas. a Images of Eagle Island showing extensive melt associated with surface warming on 4th and 13th February 2020 (https ://earth obser vator y.nasa.gov/image s/14632 2/antar ctica -melts -under -its-hotte st-days-on-recor d. b Monthly mean anomaly (the difference from climatological monthly mean) of 2 m air temperature from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 data [154] for February 2020.

[43] for other summer months) \u25c2 southern China, accumulate more UV-absorbing flavonoids in their leaves with increasing elevation (100 to 1000 m above sea level) [161] . Populations of plants and animals can also genetically adapt to tolerate high UV irradiances. These adaptations are evident in increases in melanin pigment of bird skin with decreasing latitudes [164] , and latitudinal changes in flavonoids of crop plants such as broad bean (Vicia faba). In this latter example, a field experiment using UV filters showed that the flavonoid profile of a cultivar native to high elevations in Ecuador and Columbia differed from that of a cultivar from Sweden at low elevation [165] . In these cultivars, flavonoids increased in response to the UV radiation they received during growth and there is some evidence that these effects persisted into the next generation [166] . These studies imply that, in environments where high UV-B irradiances are common (e.g., low latitudes and high elevations), it may be possible for farmers to select crop species and cultivars that are well suited to these local UV radiation conditions just as growers do for other climatic factors. These activities would contribute to meeting the SDG target 2.3 of improving the productivity and incomes of small-scale producers.",

These changes in UV-B radiation are often accompanied by changes in other wavelengths of sunlight (i.e., spectral quality) that then interact with UV-B radiation to modify plant function and the composition and diversity of ecological communities. Progress continues to be made in identifying the molecular mechanisms that underpin plant responses to UV-B radiation, and how these responses differentiate and interact with responses to the adjacent spectral regions of radiation, such as UV-A radiation and blue light. The eventual goal of this research is to establish the links from perception by the photoreceptor to the functional response of plants within an ecological context [168, 169] . Recent studies report how responses at the genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level are expressed in plant phenotypes. This research confirms that different photoreceptors trigger responses governed by UV radiation shorter than 350 nm and responses mediated by UV radiation longer than 350 nm and blue light. However, these two sets of responses interact with each other to coordinate acclimation to high light vs shade conditions [170] [171] [172] [173] . These findings imply that perception and response to UV-B radiation not only protects against the deleterious effects of very high solar radiation but that many of these photoprotective responses can also be induced by UV-A radiation and blue light.",

Recent analyses using plant functional traits, show that shade-intolerant species (i.e., those adapted to grow in fully sunlit environments) acclimate more effectively to shifts in the spectral composition of solar radiation involving changes in UV-B radiation than shade-tolerant species (i.e., those adapted to grow in shaded environments) [175] . For example, shade-intolerant species effectively adjust their leaf epidermal flavonoids, which are important for UV protection, in response to seasonal changes in exposure to solar radiation across both deciduous and evergreen forest stands [174] . These compounds have been found to improve canopy-level photosynthesis (measured as light-use efficiency) of plants during transient periods of high irradiance, sunflecks, and in canopy gaps, by ameliorating photoinhibition and DNA damage [176] [177] [178] [179] . By comparison, shade-tolerant species are better at adjusting to other regions of the solar spectrum (UV-A radiation, blue, and green light) but not to UV-B radiation, in traits linked to both photosynthetic efficiency (e.g., chlorophyll fluorescence) and stress tolerance (e.g., total phenolics, principally flavonoids and anthocyanins) [175] (Fig. 7) .",

Light blue and orange bars indicate shade-tolerant (Mean \u00b1 1SE, n = 9-11) and -intolerant (Mean \u00b1 1SE, n = 3-12) plants growing in a filter experiment. Multiple spectral regions are UV radiation, blue-green light (BG), and UV and blue-green light (UV-BG). Plasticity index was calculated based on the response of 25 functional traits categorised into five groups: biochemistry, physiology, leaf morphology, the whole-plant morphology, and growth and allocation. Figure modified from Q-W. Wang et al. [175] light use (i.e., shade-tolerance and shade-intolerance) vary among species [180, 181] . Changes in community composition, in turn, can reduce biodiversity. Dramatic alterations in forest understorey light environments (especially UV-B radiation) that result from changes in land use and climate could thus lead to the decline of a high diversity of shadeadapted species, which are critical for healthy forests and the services they provide (SDG target 15.1).",

The accumulation of phenolic compounds protects pollen from the deleterious effects of solar UV radiation and these compounds, which are deposited in sporopollenin (the outer structure of the pollen that is preserved in the fossil record), are stable over long time periods [182] . Thus, changes in the concentration of these UV-absorbing compounds in the fossilised pollen of specific plant species may serve as a proxy for global changes in surface UV-B irradiances over geological timescales [183] . The expected stabilisation of global UV-B irradiances following the recovery from contemporary stratospheric ozone depletion reduces the risk that exposure to UV-B radiation will exceed plants' capacity to protect the DNA in pollen in the future [149] . By comparison, some studies have linked abnormalities in fossilised pollen to mass extinction events in the geologic record, although further evidence is needed to confirm that the observed changes in fossil pollen structure and chemistry are specific to UV-B radiation effects and not the result of other changes in the environment.",

Several studies also report pollen abnormalities from sediments spanning other time periods in Earth's history, including the Late Triassic [185] , the Triassic-Jurassic transition [186] , and the end-Devonian mass extinction [187] . Such abnormalities in pollen morphology can be caused when a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the pollen grain produces DNA dimers and introduces mutations that reduce pollen viability, or through direct damage to pollen during its development [188] . Increased occurrence of malformations has been found in pollen from Pinus mugo under treatments of high UV-B irradiance [189] . Thus, it is conceivable that the deformations seen in fossil pollen could be the result of an increase in UV-B irradiance due to severe stratospheric ozone depletion in the geological past. However, care is needed in attributing these abnormalities to UV-B radiation, since similar damage can also be caused by metal toxicities, nutrient limitations, heat stress, drought stress, and pathogens, also polyploidy and hybridisation [190, 191] . Likewise, the timescales and geographic ranges of deformation of pollen in the fossil record should match the expected scales of ozone depletion and associated climatic changes [192] .",

The increase in this kind of innovative research and development has been one of the important indirect benefits of the Montreal Protocol and contributes to meeting the SDG target 2.4 of ensuring sustainable food production. As a consequence of these activities, we have a better understanding of the appropriate amounts of UV-B radiation required to promote regulatory responses in crops without inducing damage. This knowledge is being applied to produce food crops in a manner that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable (SDG 17.14). For practical reasons, the precision application of UV-B radiation is easier in controlled environment facilities [193] [194] [195] [196] , although supplemental UV-B radiation has also been applied under field conditions (e.g., using UV-emitting lamps mounted on a tractor in vineyards [197] ) and where UV-B radiation is manipulated for the control of pests through the use of novel UV-transmitting cladding materials [198] . The role of UV radiation has been studied in the production of about 50 different food crop species, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, pseudocereals, herbs, and spices, as well as turfgrasses, ornamental plants, and many medicinal plants [199] . In most studies where UV-B radiation has been manipulated, it has been applied prior to harvest (i.e., preharvest), or following harvest (i.e., postharvest). Species studied in this context include beetroot [200] , broccoli [201] , ginseng [202] , prickly pear [203] , blueberry [204] , and even mushrooms [205] . In certain varieties of peach, these treatments have helped maintain the weight, firmness, and vitamin C content of the fruit, which increases its quality, value, and shelf-life [206] [207] [208] .",

UV-B radiation is also emerging as an environmental cue that can upregulate plant defences against herbivorous arthropods.

The most important factors determining the transmission of UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems are the amounts of particulate and dissolved material in the water column. Inland and coastal waters are generally less transparent to UV radiation than oceans and large lakes, primarily due to terrestrial run-off carrying decayed plant material [217] . Climate change is predicted to affect penetration of UV radiation by altering the amount of runoff, and thus water clarity (transparency), as well as depth of mixing and the duration of ice-free conditions. Seasonal variations in exposure to UV radiation are modulated by the timing of runoff and the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Aquatic micro-organisms, macroalgae, plants, and animals (floating, swimming and attached) respond to these changes in UV irradiance, with the response also dependent on other effects of climate change including warming and ocean acidification (SDG 14.3). Substances released into the environment by humans, such as oil pollutants, are also modified by UV radiation, which in turn can affect aquatic organisms.",

As the stratospheric ozone layer continues to recover, changes in the quality and quantity of UV-absorbing terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM) are increasingly controlling exposure to UV-B radiation in inland and coastal waters [218, 219] . Prior studies focused on sub-tropical, temperate, and Arctic regions of North America. Now, trends in incident and underwater UV radiation in lakes have also been compared for China. For three lakes between 1988 and 2014, the penetration of UV-B radiation at 1 m depth relative to incident has decreased by 12 to 45% [220] . Incident UV-B radiation also decreased during this period, so that overall UV-B radiation at 1 m depth decreased by 14 to 46%. This decreased water transparency, mostly from higher concentrations of tDOM, apparently accounted for most of the decline in UV-B radiation, with decreased incident radiation, mainly due to increased aerosol pollution, playing a minor role [220] . This study supports the key role of tDOM in controlling underwater exposure to UV-B radiation compared to factors controlling incident radiation, including aerosols and ozone.",

            "text": "Seasonal cycles in incident solar UV-B radiation, hydrology, and photobleaching (reduction in the UV-absorbing capacity) of tDOM alter underwater exposure to UV-B radiation. Changes in the seasonal timing of both maximum and minimum water temperatures relative to the timing of peak exposure to UV-B radiation may have deleterious consequences for some aquatic organisms. For example, as spring progresses to summer and temperatures warm and increase evapotranspiration, the transport of UV-absorbing compounds in tDOM to inland and coastal waters decreases [221] . Biodegradation and photodegradation of tDOM additionally changes the chemical composition, decreasing the UV-protective capacity of tDOM [222] . In the shallow waters of coral reefs, high temperatures together with high UV-B irradiance threaten coral health [223] . The seasonality of photodegradation of DOM, which increases transparency of water to UV-B radiation, can shift the timing of peak exposure to the UV-B radiation by a month or more after the summer solstice. As surface temperatures continue to rise during this period, the most stressful periods of high temperatures and high UV-B radiation coincide [223] . In contrast, in higher latitude or high elevation lakes, water temperatures warm more slowly than daily increases in incident solar radiation, leading to a seasonal time lag that creates seasonal periods when exposure to damaging UV-B radiation is high, but water temperatures remain low [224] . These lower temperatures are likely to reduce the potential for organisms to effectively repair UV-B-induced DNA damage due to the temperature-dependence of the enzymes that drive photoenzymatic repair [225, 226] . Thus, seasonality of the hydrologic cycle and bio-and photodegradation of tDOM play a major role in regulating underwater exposure to UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems, while the seasonality of temperature in relation to the timing of peak incident solar UV-B radiation can determine how effectively aquatic organisms can respond to UV-B radiation. All of these factors are being affected by ongoing climate change.",

The average exposure level depends on the depth of the circulation, the mixed layer depth (MLD), which is an important variable to consider when assessing the effects of UV-B radiation in pelagic systems. This depth differs depending on physical factors, including gradients in temperature and salinity, water clarity, and wind speed. The effects of climate change on these factors vary among different parts of the ocean [227] . Contrary to earlier projections that climate change should lead to uniformly shallower MLDs in the ocean (e.g., [228] ), more recent data show that trends are not always towards shallower depths and that MLDs are, in some locations, deepening [229] .",

Studies of transmittance through ice in the Arctic Ocean found that monthly average transparency in the 400-550 nm band varied between 1 and 17% [239] . Surface melt ponds and scattering layers (mainly snow) were the main determinants of transmittance. The thickness of the ice was less important, explaining only 16% of the variation in transmittance. Based on these results, pond presence would be expected to also strongly affect transmittance of UV radiation. Confirming this, the transmittance for all wavelengths (UV radiation and PAR) was strongly enhanced by the presence of ponds on the ice in Baffin Bay [240, 241] . When ponds developed, there was a tenfold increase in transmittance for PAR and UV-A radiation (325, 340 and 379 nm). Twice as much UV-B (305 nm) radiation was transmitted in ponded ice compared to that in white ice, reaching values between 11 and 14%, at 2 m depth. For short UV-A wavelengths (e.g., 325 nm) transmission was much higher, reaching 22-35% when ponds were present. One can assume that for the longest UV-B radiation wavelengths (e.g., 315 nm), transmission would be somewhere between those values. This effect on transmission should be considered in projecting the future trend of UV-B radiation exposure underneath the sea ice, as increased pond formation is correlated with the faster melting of seasonal sea ice increasingly seen for the Arctic [242] .",

The marine dinoflagellate, Karenia mikimotoi, causes HABs in coastal waters around the globe and accumulates a toxin that kills fish by damaging red blood cells (hemolytic toxicity). The growth rate of this species in culture was unaffected by solar UV-B + UV-A radiation or ocean acidification (or the two in combination) [244] , but both conditions enhanced hemolytic toxicity. In freshwaters, the photosynthetic bacterium (cyanobacterium), Microcystis aeruginosa, forms HABs in surface waters where it is exposed to high UV radiation. These surface blooms prevent light and oxygen from entering deeper waters and some strains produce another powerful toxin, microcystin. Ren et al. [245] measured growth and photosynthetic potential (F v /F m ) of a toxic strain of M. aeruginosa exposed to a combination of UV-B and UV-A narrowband lamps. The weighted exposure approximated summer midday surface irradiance. When supplied with ample phosphorus (P) as would occur in a eutrophic lake, photosynthesis and growth of M. aeruginosa were little affected by UV radiation compared to moderate or severe inhibition under low or depleted P conditions, respectively. This is consistent with the general pattern shown in earlier studies of higher resistance to UV (including UV-B) radiation when algae are nutrient sufficient [246] . When exposed to high UV-B+UV-A+PAR irradiance from a solar simulator, photosynthetic potential was more inhibited in toxic vs non-toxic strains of M. aeruginosa [247] . However, the toxic strain recovered faster after exposure to UV radiation. Thus, the net effect over a daily time scale was less on the toxic strain, which was further confirmed by its higher growth rate than the non-toxic strain over a 7-day period with daily exposure to UV radiation. Moreover, exposure to UV radiation enhanced the accumulation of microcystin in the toxic strain [247] . Thus, exposure to UV radiation enhances toxicity in both freshwater and marine HABs. These results could help inform when toxicity is more likely to occur in a HAB outbreak (SDG 3.9, 6.1, 6.6).",

            "text": "Zooplankton are key links in aquatic food webs; they feed on primary producers and are themselves key prey for fish. Hence, a reduction in the abundance of zooplankton due to UV radiation can lead to reduced fish production and the development of phytoplankton blooms. Evidence continues to accumulate that excessive solar and laboratory exposure to UV-B radiation leads to DNA damage and, ultimately, mortality in zooplankton. This evidence now extends to less studied taxa such as ciliates (single celled organisms with hair-like structures, cilia, for movement), crab larvae, and under-represented systems such as marine and tropical systems (Fig. 8 ) [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] . Apart from mortality, UV radiation also affects zooplankton at a sub-lethal level leading to reduced fitness. Recent studies have demonstrated reduced feeding rates in small crustaceans such as copepods, reduced growth in Daphnia and morphological changes in structures used for swimming and feeding in Fig. 8 Effect of UV irradiation on mortality of the mixotrophic ciliate, Pelagodileptus trachelioides. Laboratory exposures to a UV-B + UV-A lamp, either unfiltered (UVR) or filtered to block wavelengths shorter than indicated. Data points: average mortality \u00b1 standard deviation (n = 12). Line: predicted mortality as a function of spectral irradiance weighted by the Daphnia survivorship biological weighting function (inset, [257] ). Only treatments with UV-B radiation caused significant mortality. Redrawn from [253] using author-provided spectral irradiance data ciliates when exposed to PAR, UV-A and UV-B radiation compared to PAR-only treatments [251, 253, 255, 256] . Zooplankton use defenses against UV radiation such as the accumulation of photo-protective compounds through diet, enzymatic defenses, cell repair systems and changes in behaviour to mitigate UV-induced damage [258] [259] [260] [261] . However, changes in stratospheric ozone and climate change affect radiation exposure, challenging the limits of these natural defenses [147] . Recent examples show that pigmentation makes crab larvae more resistant to solar UV-A and UV-B radiation. However, this defense comes at the cost of increased predation risk, since the strategy to avoid predation includes both low pigmentation and induction of a defensive spine [249, 250, 262] . Furthermore, melanin pigments reduce DNA damage (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers) in pigmented Daphnia and increase survival compared to more transparent Daphnia when exposed to combined UV-A and UV-B radiation treatments [254] . The differential photo-protective function of melanin is even present within clones that periodically have lower tolerance to UV radiation when the melanin carapace (outer shell) is exchanged during molting [254] . To summarise, zooplankton can adapt to some changes in UV radiation, but exposure to excess UV-B radiation, as would likely have occurred without the Montreal Protocol, leads to DNA damage, reduced fitness, changes in behaviour, and ultimately mortality.",

Negative effects range from developmental abnormalities, to decreases in growth and body condition, to lesions in skin, eyes, as well as in many other organs, and even death [263] . Often, the more transparent, younger life-history stages are vulnerable to UV-induced damage, in particular because they typically inhabit shallow, warmer surface waters to increase developmental rates. The skin and gills are the most highly exposed and most likely sites of damage by UV-B radiation, although immune suppression, visual impairment, and other damage is commonly reported in both natural populations and hatchery-raised fish [263] .

In contrast, recent research has indicated that interactions between key stress factors modify the response to individual stressors (reviewed by [264] ). Increasing temperatures due to climate change, acidification by enhanced CO 2 concentrations, variation in upper mixed layer depth (MLD) (Sect. 5.3) and changes in nutrient availability modify the effects of exposure to solar UV-B radiation in primary producers. A metaanalysis based on 1139 assessments of terrestrial, freshwater and marine biota showed that, in general, the two stressors (UV-B radiation and temperature) acted antagonistically with elevated temperature (below lethality) enhancing resistance to increased UV-B radiation [265] . In the macroalga, Porphyra yeozensis, higher temperatures strongly decreased the inhibition by UV radiation and reduced the stress by high PAR [266] . Ocean acidification can have synergistic, neutral or antagonistic effects on the response of marine photosynthetic organisms to UV radiation [267] . The interaction between UV radiation and nutrient availability was studied in an in situ freshwater food web using high and low concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (C) and inorganic phosphorus (P) under UV irradiation. High organic C and P concentrations resulted in stronger resistance to UV radiation [268] . This field experiment showed that lower sensitivity to UV radiation alone or UV radiation combined with another stress factor gives an organism an advantage over other members in the ecosystem and thus changes the composition of the biota and the structure of the microbial food web [268] .",

Jurisdictions have banned some sunscreen compounds, including oxybenzone (also known as benzophenone-3), octinoxate, and octocrylene, based, in part, on measured environmental concentrations in coastal zones and on laboratory experiments, indicative of their potential toxicity and contributions to coral bleaching [273] . This has motivated research on the use of natural sunscreens called mycosporine-like amino acids [274] , which Agusti 2020 [263] are synthesised, for example, by many species of macroalgae and cyanobacteria [275, 276] . Some active ingredients in UV sunscreens are toxic to corals, such as ethylhexylmethoxy-cinnamate (also known as octinoxate), octocrylene and benzophenones. Effects include mortality and bleaching (loss of symbiotic algae) in adult corals [277] and arrested development or mortality in their larvae [278] . These compounds also accumulated in coral tissues, but exposure concentrations (~ 0.5-3.5 parts per million) were substantially higher than found in most natural systems. By comparison, sunscreen compounds such as oxybenzone (a benzophenone) have been found in coral tissues and at concentrations of 0.1-136 parts per trillion (ng/L) in coastal waters near Oahu, Hawaii [279] and 114, 11, and 118 parts per trillion in Chesapeake Bay water, sediments, and oyster tissues, respectively [280] . These concentrations are substantially (up to ~ 1000x) below lethal thresholds for aquatic organisms such as some algae, zooplankton, and fish [281] . Across a large study of benzophenones, over 90% of sites had concentrations below predicted no-effect concentrations [282] . While these results suggest that lethality risk is low in most locations, continued evaluation of sub-lethal effects at lower doses is warranted given the detection of sunscreens in many organisms.",

The impacts of oil pollution on coral reef taxa can be exacerbated by environmental conditions commonly encountered in tropical reef environments. Shallow coral reefs are routinely exposed to high levels of UV radiation, which can substantially increase the toxicity of some oil components through phototoxicity. Many oil components strongly absorb UV-B radiation [285] . Exposure to UV radiation represents the most likely and harmful environmental co-factor, leading to an average toxicity increase of 7.2-fold across all tests carried out. Elevated temperature and low pH increased the toxicity of oil exposed to UV radiation by 3.0-and 1.3-fold, respectively. These studies point to the value of including UV radiation, and in particular UV-B radiation, in future oil toxicity studies to identify realistic hazard thresholds.",

Here we focus on naturally occurring pathogens in aquatic ecosystems. These aquatic pathogens are sensitive to UV-B radiationinduced DNA damage and to reactive oxygen species produced by both UV-B and UV-A radiation [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] . Comparing the sensitivity to natural sunlight (including visible and UV radiation) of the Daphnia parasite, Pasteuria ramose from different lakes, revealed that strains derived from lakes with high transparency to UV-B radiation had a higher tolerance to full solar radiation compared to strains coming from less transparent lakes [290] . It has been hypothesised that pathogens generally have lower tolerance to UV radiation compared to their aquatic hosts [291, 292] and many parasite-host relationships are known to structure communities and ecosystems [293] . Recent advances in our understanding of the effects of solar radiation on pathogen-host relationships have shown that zooplankton parasites, such as Pasteuria ramose, are most sensitive to UV-B radiation, more sensitive to UV-A radiation than visible light, and finally more sensitive to UV radiation compared to its host [292] . Hence, zooplankton can potentially have a parasite-free refuge at depths where most of the detrimental UV-B radiation has been attenuated and where they are only exposed to moderate UV radiation [292] . With the knowledge available regarding host-parasite-UV interactions one can speculate that decreases in exposure to UV radiation, such as those fueled by climate change (Sect. 5.1), have the potential to enhance epidemics among aquatic organisms [291, 292] .",

It is well established that a wide range of synthetic chemicals such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other controlled substances are intentionally or accidentally released into the environment by human activities. Solar radiation contributes to the degradation of many of these contaminants and plays a significant role in reducing their concentrations in the environment. Direct photodegradation of these contaminants is mainly driven by UV radiation. Both UV (UV-B and UV-A) and visible radiation are responsible for driving indirect photodegradation processes, with UV radiation being the more important of the two. Climate change, which influences temperature and precipitation levels, also leads to changes in the chemical composition of surface waters, namely dissolved organic matter and oxygen concentrations, which in turn will affect indirect photochemical processes.",

Since our last assessment [1] , additional studies have provided more details about the significance of photodegradation in dry systems including an arid grassland [295] , the Sonoran Desert [296] , a semi-arid scrub system [297] , and a semi-arid woodland ecosystem [298, 299] (contributing towards SDG targets 15.1, 15.3). Other studies since our last assessment have shown that photodegradation is also associated with plant litter (dead plant material) decomposition in wetter ecosystems located in temperate and boreal forests [300] [301] [302] . Furthermore, solar radiation drives photodecomposition of litter in tropical [303] and subtropical monsoon forests [304] . These studies provide added evidence that direct photodegradation, and indirect photochemical changes in quality of litter through photo-facilitation, which increases biological degradation, contribute to increases in emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere (Fig. 10) . Litter chemistry can also influence direct (abiotic) and indirect (biotic, i.e., photo-facilitation by microbes) decomposition processes [1] . For example, lignin fractions have been thought to be preferentially photodegraded because they strongly absorb solar radiation. However, hemicellulose and cellulose were found to be the plant constituents primarily affected by solar radiation in a mid-latitude semiarid ecosystem [297, 305] , rather than lignin as previously thought.",

However, recent field studies have found evidence that photodegradation contributes to carbon loss in forests of tropical regions [303] as well as those at temperate mid- [300] and even high latitudes [302] . Some studies have suggested that photodegradation can partly explain the missing carbon loss in these systems, leading to underestimation of terrestrial emissions of the carbon [298, 306] . A recent experimental study attributed much of this missing carbon to atmospheric greenhouse gas emission during photomineralisation [299] . However, changes in solar UV radiation resulting from interactions between stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change can potentially affect the emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from decomposition in an array of terrestrial ecosystems occupying a wide range of latitudes [2, 167] .",

In terrestrial ecosystems, spectral weighting functions developed for photodecomposition of litter from the Sonoran Desert [296] showed that UV-A radiation was the most effective region of the solar spectrum in the photodegradation of (Fig. 11) . The weighting functions for emission from three litter types were very similar with effectiveness declining with wavelength but extending well into the visible waveband. Multiplying the weighting function by the average solar irradiance at noon provided the weighted spectral solar irradiance. UV-B, UV-A, and visible wavebands were computed to be responsible for 9, 61 and 30%, respectively, of the observed photochemical emission. This result is generally consistent with earlier findings of the effectiveness of different solar wavebands on the loss of terrestrial litter. Also, the results show that the reductions in stratospheric ozone depletion by the Montreal Protocol and related decreases in UV-B radiation, cause a reduction in photoproduction of CO 2 from the plant litter. Research has continued to quantify the permafrost carbon feedback that involves release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost in the Arctic [1] . Experiments on the wavelength dependence of the photodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in permafrost indicated that also UV-A radiation was most efficient [314] . Laboratory manipulations indicated that variability in the photodegradation may be attributable to iron catalysed photoreactions of old DOC derived from soil lignin and tannin in the melted permafrost. Rates of CO 2 photoproduction from permafrost DOC were twofold higher than for modern DOC [314] . Model predictions of future net loss of ecosystem carbon from thawing permafrost do not include the loss of CO 2 to the atmosphere from DOC photodegradation. Therefore, current estimates of additional global warming from the permafrost carbon feedback are too low.

Climate change models predict enhanced precipitation in many places across the globe, which leads to increased loading of the coloured component of DOM (CDOM) into lakes and rivers, a phenomenon referred to as browning (Sect. 5.1) [147, 167] . Runoff can be a major source of organic matter in aquatic environments. Solar UV radiation drives the photodegradation of terrestrially derived DOM and particulate matter that is present in aquatic ecosystems [167, 222, 309, 315, 316] . As in terrestrial ecosystems, photodegradation of aquatic organic matter occurs by direct (abiotic) and indirect (biotic, i.e., photo-facilitation by microbes) decomposition processes; reactive oxygen species are key intermediates in indirect photodegradation [222] . One of the major sources of DOM involves release by melting of the permafrost in the Arctic [167, 314, 317, 318] . Current research on photodegradation by UV radiation of Arctic dissolved organic matter [318] shows that formation of CO 2 is accompanied by buildup of a pool of partially photooxidised DOM that likely plays a role in photo-facilitated microbial degradation [167] . This partially photooxidised DOM forms via indirect photodegradation involving the intermediacy of singlet oxygen [318] , a widespread reactive oxygen species that is produced by a UV-initiated photoreaction between the Arctic organic matter and oxygen [167] . This result further indicates that exposure to UV radiation initiates indirect photoreactions that photo-facilitate conversion of DOM in the melting cryosphere into CO 2 (contributes to SDGs 6.3, 6.6, 14.1).

Predictions of this amplification strength are imprecise and likely are understated because they ignore the photodegradation of permafrost carbon to CO 2 in surface waters by solar radiation. Moreover, although the permafrost zone is expected to be a substantial carbon source to the atmosphere [1] , yet large-scale models currently only simulate gradual changes in seasonally thawed soil. Abrupt thaw will probably occur in < 20% of the permafrost zone but could affect half of permafrost carbon through collapsing ground, rapid erosion and landslides. After taking account of abrupt thaw stabilisation, lake drainage and soil carbon uptake by vegetation regrowth, Turetsky et al. (2020) concluded that models considering only gradual permafrost thaw are substantially underestimating carbon emissions from thawing permafrost [319] .",

Gaseous carbon release from Arctic soils due to permafrost thawing is substantial [1] , and growing evidence suggests that Arctic soils may also be relevant sources of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) [317, [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] . Nitrous oxide is a source gas for stratospheric nitrogen oxides and an ozone depleting substance (contributes to SDGs 13.1, 15.1); it has an almost 300 times stronger global warming potential than CO 2 on a 100-year time horizon [322] . Oxidation by ammonia-oxidising archaea (single-celled micro-organisms) is one important source of N 2 O in Arctic peatlands [321] . Singlet oxygen, an ROS that is produced by UV interactions with Arctic DOM (Sect. 6.3), photoinhibits archaea and thus may reduce production of N 2 O [325] . Peatlands are affected by thermokarst, a marshy land surface characterised by very irregular surfaces formed as permafrost thaws; these land features are the most probable Arctic N 2 O hot spots. They cover more than 10% of the Arctic, corresponding to an area of 1.9 million km 2 . N 2 O emissions from bare soils in permafrost peatlands have been estimated to account for as much as 0.1 Tg nitrogen year \u22121 [322, 323] . This is in the range of emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and biomass burning, and therefore the second largest anthropogenic N 2 O sources after agriculture [322] . Measurements of Arctic N 2 O fluxes and estimates of N 2 O releases at landscape and regional scales exhibit much spatial variability so current estimates of source strengths are highly uncertain [324] .",

Microplastics are an important type of contaminant that derive from UV-initiated photoreactions of macroplastics (see assessments of interactive effects of UV radiation with materials in previous UNEP assessments [327] ). Occasionally, the interactions of UV radiation with contaminants result in formation of harmful photoproducts. For example, the antimicrobial agent, triclosan, is converted by UV irradiation to toxic and carcinogenic compounds including dioxins, chloroform, and chlorinated anilines [328, 329] ; and \"phototoxic\" contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, become toxic on absorption of UV radiation [285, 330] . Photoreactions of contaminants occur through two general mechanisms: in the first (direct photoreaction), solar radiation directly absorbed by the contaminant results in changes in its chemical structure that can affect its persistence and fate in the environment; in the second mechanism (indirect photoreaction), the contaminant is transformed by reaction with photochemically produced reactive intermediates that are produced through absorption of solar radiation by substances such as CDOM [167, 331] . These processes usually include reactive oxygen species [332] and excited triplets of CDOM [333] . The triplets accelerate, i.e., \"sensitise\" photodegradation of contaminants mainly by redox reactions in which the contaminant is oxidised.",

First, the thermocline is shifted to shallower depths, making the well-mixed surface layer (the epilimnion) shallower. Next, the higher concentrations of CDOM lead to lower average light intensities. Finally, the higher CDOM concentrations lead to formation of higher concentrations of photochemically produced reactive intermediates. As these three effects do not all point in the same direction with respect to contaminant degradation, the authors used a modelling approach to resolve the net effect. The results indicate that direct photodegradation processes would be slowed by browning, while reactions with triplet state organic matter and singlet oxygen would be enhanced. Vertical hydrodynamic mixing also was shown to affect photomineralisation of dissolved organic carbon in arctic waters [344] . The overall effect of lake browning on contaminant degradation is therefore not expected to be uniform, but rather dependent on the specific molecule of interest and its dominant photochemical pathways.",

POPs are chemicals that are resistant to environmental degradation, accumulating through food chains and are harmful/ toxic to humans and wildlife [347] (contributes to SDGs 6.3, 6.6, 14.1). The indirect pathway for the photolysis of POPs is particularly relevant, since some of these contaminants (e.g., perfluorinated octanoic acid (PFOA) and some pesticides) do not absorb significantly within the UV region of the solar spectrum and therefore undergo direct photoreaction very slowly. In natural waters, they may be potentially transformed/degraded via indirect photolysis mediated by natural sensitisers (e.g., DOM, nitrate or nitrite) that absorb solar radiation to form photochemically produced reactive intermediates [329, 334, 348, 349] . The effects of the naturally occurring substances such as CDOM on degradation of POPs are complex and can either accelerate or inhibit photolysis of these contaminants. Also, other contaminants enter the aquatic environment, such as engineered nanomaterials and their composites with polymers [350] , which are a rapidly growing class of emerging contaminants that can be transformed by photoreactions [167] . Models have been developed to simulate the environmental fate of these nanomaterials in aquatic systems [351] .",

Sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed directly from this UV photochemistry. Air pollution has been identified as a critical issue in human health. According to the World Health Organization, ambient air pollution contributed to 7.6% of all deaths in 2016 [358] . The importance of improving air quality is recognised in the SDGs 3.9 and 11.6. Air quality is dependent on solar UV radiation in the troposphere and thus on stratospheric ozone. It is also influenced by atmospheric circulation, including transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere, which can be altered by changes in climate and as a result of ODS [37] . Understanding how air quality depends on changes in UV radiation, whether from depletion of ozone or other causes (e.g., aerosols), remains a fundamental challenge to the prediction of air quality.",

Besides controlling the amount of UV radiation reaching the troposphere, stratospheric ozone (O 3 ) is also a major source of tropospheric ozone via Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange (STE). The rate of removal of many tropospheric pollutants [including volatile organic compounds (VOCs)] is determined by reaction with OH of UV-B radiation by ozone (Fig. 12 ) and the concentration of OH determines the persistence of many pollutants in the atmosphere. OH is usually destroyed when it reacts with pollutants, so that the actual concentration of OH is a balance between UV-B-driven production and its reaction with pollutants. Climate change may enhance the emission of tropospheric pollutants, like CO, from natural sources and this would reduce the concentration of OH and increase the persistence of other chemicals, including the greenhouse gas (GHG), methane (CH 4 ), and very short-lived halogen compounds (VSLS), such as bromoform (CHBr 3 ) that could increase destruction of stratospheric ozone and change concentrations of tropospheric ozone [359] (Fig. 12) .

Reductions in stratospheric ozone have decreased the amount of ozone transported to the troposphere in the last 30 years [361] . As the climate warms, the removal of ozone from the atmosphere at Earth's surface may diminish. However, the dominant processes for removal of ozone (e.g., uptake by leaves and/or the soil, or reaction with volatile organic compounds [VOCs] such as terpenes released by plants into the atmosphere) appear to differ between locations [362, 363] . Dissolution into the ocean is a significant process for removing ozone from the atmosphere but has probably been overestimated by a factor of 2 [364] . Correcting this overestimate increases model estimates of concentrations of surface ozone by 10% or more for a third of the surface of Earth. Tropospheric ozone is an important marker for air pollution that is not just a national issue, since ozone from ground-based sources circulates around the globe [365] .",

These so-called secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are formed in the atmosphere through the oxidation of VOCs that form low volatility products (Fig. 12) . New research indicates that UV radiation also plays a role in the destruction of some of these particles. Measurements in the laboratory show that many SOA are photodegraded by UV irradiation [366] , making UV radiation an essential factor in both their production and removal from the atmosphere. According to model calculations [367] , these complex UV-driven processes could represent the largest global sink for SOA, exceeding removal by rain-out (Fig. 12) . However, a fraction of SOA appears not to be degraded by UV radiation [366, 368, 369] , with the overall effect of the UV radiation depending on the chemical composition of the many different aerosols present in the atmosphere. No attempt has yet been made to quantify the sensitivity of the lifetimes of different SOA to changes in UV radiation as would occur with changes in stratospheric ozone.",

Recently, laboratory studies showed that SOA exposed to UV radiation can act as photo-sensitisers for the oxidation of gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) to condensable sulfate [372] , thus potentially accelerating the formation of sulfate aerosols. This occurs when UV radiation is absorbed by organic particles and produces highly reactive intermediate molecules that rapidly oxidise SO 2 gas associated with the particles. The importance of these reactions to the Earth's atmosphere remains to be established. Similar UV-induced excited-state chemistry in organic aerosols was also found to lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as peroxides [373] , which are postulated to cause significant damage to the respiratory tract upon inhalation [374] [375] [376] . Thus, UV radiation may modify the impact of organic aerosols on human health and would represent an additional pathway for changes in stratospheric ozone to influence human health.",

Observations show worsening ozone pollution between 2013 and 2017 at urban locations in China [379, 381, 382] and in the North China Plain from 2013 to 2019 [383] . Possible reasons include: fewer ozone-destroying chemical reactions occurring on aerosol particles [383, 384] ; lower NO x /VOC ratios leading to higher ozone production efficiencies [382, 383] ; increase in emissions of VOCs due to changes in temperature [384] ; and increases in UV radiation due to less haze [378, 380, [383] [384] [385] [386] [387] .

However, climate change may enhance emissions of CO from natural sources. For example, a major biogenic source of CO to the atmosphere is the emission of volatile organic compounds, such as isoprene from plants, with CO being formed in chemical reactions in the atmosphere. These biogenic emissions account for about 18% of the global burden of atmospheric CO [391] . Wildfires are another natural source of CO to the atmosphere, particularly in boreal forests [392] that occur as a consequence of climate change-driven extreme hot and dry conditions in some parts of the Earth. For example, satellite-derived rates of CO emissions during the Horse River wildfire in 2016 were ~ 50-300 ktonne/ day and exceeded the total annual anthropogenic emissions of CO in Alberta that year [392] . Overall, although total CO emissions have declined since 2000, climate change may enhance emissions of CO from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The prediction of atmospheric trends in CO is important, since CO is not only a tropospheric pollutant, but also a sink of OH and thus affects the lifetime of the GHG, methane [1, [393] [394] [395] . It has been estimated that, during the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event, the global atmospheric concentration of CO increased by more than 40%, caused by wildfires, concomitant with a decrease in global massweighted tropospheric concentration of OH up to 9% and, as a consequence, a 4% increase in the lifetime of atmospheric CH 4 [396] .",

Natural sources of CH 4 are likely to increase in the future because of climate change. Among other natural sources, Arctic ecosystems are large, yet poorly understood sources of CH 4 and are undergoing rapid change, including melting of sea-ice, thawing of sub-sea permafrost, methane-hydrates, and permafrost soils with the formation of thermokast lakes [399] [400] [401] [402] [403] [404] (Sect. 6.4). As a consequence of thawing of permafrost, centuries-old carbon deposits become bioavailable and undergo microbial mineralisation [404] .

The maximum measured concentration was 57 \u03bcg/L. The authors reported a seasonal variation in flux of TFA with greater deposition in the summer than winter. The flux was significantly correlated with global intensity of solar radiation, indicating that the sunlight-produced OH contributed to the degradation of the precursors of TFA, most likely refrigerants released to the atmosphere. Another recent paper reported TFA [and other perfluoroalkyl substances with > 2 carbons (PFASs) 4 ] in precipitation in the low \u03bcg/L range across 28 cities in mainland China [415] . The spatial and temporal variation in concentrations of TFA was large (0.0091-1.8 \u03bcg/L) but these results are consistent with earlier observations included in the EEAP's quadrennial assessments [416] [417] [418] [419] [420] [421] .",

Ice cores were collected from two high-altitude locations in Nunavut: the Devon ice cap and the Mt. Oxford icefield. These cores were dated from 1977 to 2015 and 1967 to 2017, respectively, and provided a good historical record of deposition of TFA in relation to the switch from hydrochlorofluorocarbons, which do not break down to form TFA, to HFC and HFOs, which do. Trends of concentrations with depth in the cores were similar in the two locations. The maximum concentrations of TFA in the ice cores were less than the average concentration reported in marine waters [423] . Thus, even the complete melting of the upper 15 m of the Arctic ice cap would not increase concentrations of TFA in marine waters. Instead, it would dilute the concentration of TFA in the oceans after complete mixing. Seasonal distribution of TFA and other PFASs in the ice-cores were not reported but might be expected to be greater in summer than winter as reported above for rainfall [414] .",

            "text": "Fugitive emissions of TFA have been reported from landfills, transfer stations, and incinerators in locations where manufacturing facilities produce fluorinated chemicals [1] . In a study by Wang and colleagues [424] , air samples and water leaching from a location that received municipal solid waste near the city of Tianjin in China were analysed for PFAS. Air samples contained 20 longer chain PFAS, but dominant compounds were those with 8, 10 and 12 carbons in the chain. TFA, which is not volatile, was not detected in air. Leachates contained 19 PFAS with carbon chains from 2 to 10 in length with the dominant compound being TFA. Whether the compounds with shorter chain lengths were breakdown products of longer chain compounds is not known. Concentrations of TFA in leachates and effluents from waste disposal sites were large; no TFA was detected at one site but the median concentration of TFA in the other ten sites was 17 \u03bcg/L with a range across sites of 2-59 \u03bcg/L [424] . In another study, the distribution of TFA was measured in the surroundings of Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, China, which is a region with three fluorochemical manufacturing facilities [425] . Concentrations in river water ranged from 0.5 to 1.1 \u03bcg/L, spring water had a mean concentration of 1.8 \u03bcg/L, lake water 2.7 \u03bcg/L, and tap and well water, 0.25 \u03bcg/L. These large concentrations are indicative of a local source and these industrial sources are not tracked in the same way as for those compounds controlled by the Montreal Protocol. Presently it is not possible to even estimate their contribution to the global amount. However, if concentrations of TFA in oceans begin to increase, the total emissions could be estimated and hence the contribution of these other sources could be better estimated in relation to the refrigerants and propellants.",

The measured concentration of TFA in the shoots of wheat (116 mg/kg, estimated to be equivalent to 116 \u00d7 10 3 \u03bcg/L) [427] , is ten-times greater than the NOEC for aquatic plants measured under field conditions [428] . This indicates that terrestrial plants are likely less sensitive to TFA than aquatic plants. The median concentrations of TFA reported in ice cores from the Devon and Mt. Oxford ice caps were 0.021 \u03bcg/L and 0.009 \u03bcg/L, respectively, and the maximum measured in both sites was 0.15 \u03bcg/L [422] . Compared to the NOEC for aquatic plants, this provides a margin of exposure of 570,000 for the greater median and 80,000 for the maximum value.

[413] ). However, TFA has been found in the blood of humans [430] . In this study, serum samples were collected from 252 participants from the staff and support workers at Nankai University in Tianjin, China, a location close to chemical plants manufacturing fluorinated chemicals. Twenty-one PFASs, including TFA were quantified in serum. Two markers of glycemia were also measured in these participants to examine potential linkages between exposures to PFASs and disease. TFA was detected in 97% of samples with a median concentration of 8.46 \u03bcg/L. Concentrations were significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in participants > 40 years old and TFA accounted for 17.2% (w/w) of the total PFASs. When data were adjusted for potential confounders, no association (P = 0.09) was observed for concentration of TFA in serum and fasting glucose levels or HbA1C (a marker for diabetes) in serum (P = 0.1). However, significant associations were observed for several other longer-chain PFASs. This study appears to have been the first to measure TFA in the blood of humans in relation to environmental exposures, so it is not possible to compare these results with those from other locations. The source of exposure to TFA was not identified but others have reported the presence of PFASs in the area but did not include TFA as an analyte [431] . It is possible that the TFA observed in human blood was not only due to direct exposure to TFA, but also the result of the metabolic breakdown of one or more of the longerchain PFASs. As discussed above, measurements of TFA in leachates and effluents from waste disposal sites in Tainjin reported concentrations of TFA of 2-59 \u03bcg/L [424] , suggesting possible sources of contamination from ground and surface water. The concentrations in serum are greater than one would expect for a polar compound that is readily excreted by mammals. TFA is also formed from the metabolism of the anaesthetics halothane and desfluorane in humans. The half-life for excretion of TFA from the metabolism of anaesthetics in humans was reported to be 16 h [432] . Others have shown similar rates of excretion in adults [433] and children [434] where half-lives of TFA ranged from 10-59 h. In the study on metabolism of desfluorane in humans [433] , the mean maximum concentration of TFA in serum was 43 \u00b1 19 \u03bcg/L, which is ca fivefold greater than the median concentration reported in the Duan et al. study [430] . Further studies in Tianjin and other locations would help illuminate the unexpected finding of large environmental exposures and/or apparent accumulation of TFA in humans.",

Often, the outdoor service lives of systems and components that incorporate these materials (e.g., photovoltaic panels, building materials, and outdoor furniture) are determined by their rate of degradation under solar UV radiation exposure. Solar UV-induced damage can generally be controlled by the judicious selection of UV-resistant materials for outdoor use, using high-efficiency light stabilisers in plastics and employing surface coatings on wood that absorb or scatter the UV radiation. Emerging technologies suggest the use of nanoscale UV-absorbing fillers to be particularly effective additives in this regard. An important application of these nanoscale fillers is in textile fibres to obtain fabrics with very high ultraviolet protection factors for use in protective apparel.",

The use of bark and wood extracts as well as lignins as UV stabilisers is a trend that has been recently reported [436] [437] [438] [439] . New research confirms the general phenomenon and extends the finding to several additional wood species. Wood bark extracts are rich in polyphenols that include condensed tannins and flavonoids, which are particularly good absorbers of UV radiation and free radical scavengers. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood was successfully stabilised with bark extracts from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata), used at 2 wt% level in polyurethane-acrylate wood coatings [440] . Upon accelerated exposure with UV radiation of up to 960 h, coatings with bark extractives using ethanol reduced the discolouration to about 65% of that for the control wood surfaces. A 1 wt % solution of the extractives of Phoebe zhennan wood with polar solvents completely absorbed solar UV-A and UV-B radiation in laboratory studies [441] . UVshielding films of poly(lactic acid) with 24 wt% of wood extract screened out all of UV-B and 80% of UV-A radiation. Several bark extract stabilisers of alder and pine species at a concentration of 5% in alkyd-based coatings on Scotts pine were compared with commercial UV stabilisers including triazine UV stabilisers and hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS) [442] . At over 2000 h of laboratory weathering the best protection was afforded by the natural stabilisers. These stabilisers can also be used with wood-plastic composites that undergo similar UV-induced discolouration and loss of mechanical integrity on exposure to solar UV radiation [443] . Bark extracts from western red cedar at 2 wt% mixed into the wood-plastic composite yielded about 20% less discolouration along with less severe surface cracking and chemical degradation as indicated by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy after 1200 h of accelerated weathering [444] . In both wood and wood-plastic composites, the trend towards switching to sustainable 'green' UV stabilisers has significant environmental value if also economically feasible.",

This increase in the [O:C] ratio linearly correlates with a higher surface free energy of thermally modified wood species including alder, dark alder, ash, and aspen [455] . Because of increased polarity, APP treatment results in better adhesion properties of water-based coatings, for instance, on beech wood [456] and functional glaze or lacquer coating on larch, Douglas fir, and Scots pine wood [457] . Wood exposed to solar UV radiation typically undergoes surface discolouration and degradation that reduces its adhesive strength for coatings [458, 459] . A novel variant of the APP technology was shown to successfully reverse moderate effects of surface degradation due to exposure to UV radiation of Fagus sylvatica (beech wood) [460] . Beech wood weathered under exposure to a xenon source in the laboratory, when subsequently treated by the novel variant of APP, showed an increase of adhesion strength by up to 20%. Treated, pre-weathered sample surfaces showed faster spreading kinetics and a doubling of the spreading area for water, due to increased surface free energy from the plasma treatment. However, the success of the technique is dependent on the variety of wood and for instance, did not work with spruce wood. Also, with plasma treatment of wood the consequent hydrophilicity may encourage surface biofilm formation [461] , which in some varieties of wood leads to premature biodegradation. Being an emerging technology the efficacy of modified APP has yet to be validated in a large number of common wood species and the trade-off in terms of any contribution for biodegradation has still to be assessed. This is a significant development if the approach can cost-effectively improve weathered wood and thereby reduce the impact of solar UV radiation on the lifetimes of wood products used in the building industry.",

Graphene oxide [476] and multi-walled carbon nanotubes [477] have also been investigated in this regard. The optical bandgap of ZnO nanoparticles (26 nm) is particle-geometry dependent and rod-shaped-particles show the highest value compared to spherical or star-shaped nanoparticles. Nanorods of ZnO absorb incident solar UV-A as well as UV-B radiation [464] . For cotton and polyester, coating the fibre with the nanorods resulted in UPF values of 247. Increased attention needs to be paid to the shape factor to optimise resultant UV-protection, especially at lower nanoparticle concentrations. Rather than decorating the surface of fibres with particles of ZnO, the nanoparticles were uniquely grown in situ on cotton fibres after polymer brushes were grafted onto the cotton [478] . This yielded nanoparticles on both the outer and inner surface of the hollow cotton fibres. The nanoparticles provided very good protection from UV radiation, with the value of UPF for the corresponding fabric reaching > 350. While UPF values as low as 50 are regarded as providing excellent UV-shielding, high values are still desirable, since the UPF values of fabrics tend to drop with laundering cycles.",

In a crosssectional study of a weathered adhered laminate sandwich construction of a PV module (glass/encapsulate/back sheet), using spatially resolved fluorescence imaging, damage from UV radiation to the adhesive layers was disproportionately high [480] . Copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate (EVA) are popularly used as encapsulants in solar PV modules. Accelerated weathering studies on several different EVA copolymers found those with 18-33% by weight in copolymer vinyl acetate to be the most stable to solar UV radiation [481] . The encapsulant degradation of EVA by solar UV radiation, as assessed by FTIR, was found to be inhomogeneous, suggesting that intrusion of oxygen and moisture from the edges into the interior of laminates governed their degradation process [482] . Advances in PV technology can benefit from more stable adhesives and encapsulants (SDG 7.A). The use of thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) as an alternative to EVA as the encapsulant has been evaluated [483, 484] and was found to have superior thermal stability, adhesive strength and resistance to discolouration. For instance, discolouration on exposure to UV radiation was ca nine times slower in TPO relative to EVA, and may also be easier to process. While the initial research on TPO is promising, developmental work needs to further validate this approach prior to commercialisation.",

These weathering procedures rely on elevated temperature and higher light intensity relative to natural exposures. However, with several other variables such as humidity, air pollutants and abrasion by sand acting in concert to also influence degradation rates in the field, data from laboratory tests do not always correlate well with outdoor exposure data. In such studies, photo-damage is assumed to be a linear function of the dose of radiation (or the product of intensity and duration of exposure). Where higher levels of UV radiation are used for shorter durations in laboratory-accelerated exposures, ensuring that this linearity holds is important.",

However, acceleration of photo-damage in the laboratory has to ensure that wavelengths and intensities of radiation used, attain the same degradative mechanisms as solar exposure [489, 493] . Recent work has focused on two modelling approaches: (1) A model that consists of a series of terms, typically one for each environmental stressor, usually following the observed behaviour for that stressor (e.g., temperature with the Arrhenius model; see recent versions in e.g., [489, 490, 493, 494] . The challenge with this approach is in interpreting the interacting effects between different environmental stressors (e.g., temperature and moisture may have a synergistic effect). (2) A second approach is to use Bayesian statistics along with a database of rate constants obtained under specific multiple stress conditions (e.g., a controlled temperature, humidity, as a function of UV radiation dose) to construct the model. The advantage of the latter method is that it allows for the interacting effects between different environmental stressors to be taken into account. While this approach can predict the outdoor behaviour with a known degree of uncertainty, it lacks any physico-chemical insight into the behaviour of the material. This approach was successfully demonstrated with stabiliser-free (no additives to obtain rapid degradation) polyethylene (PE), the highest volume plastic used globally. The study in question was based on laboratory-accelerated weathering simulating field exposure conditions of Florida, United States [495, 496] . Both of these approaches are relevant and will be required to fully realise the potential of prediction modelling for service life of materials used outdoors.",

It was first identified in December 2019 in China and has resulted in a pandemic affecting the entire world, forcing governments to take measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. This section contributes to SDG 3 and assesses the linkages between COVID-19, solar UV radiation, and the Montreal Protocol. The focus is on the extent to which solar UV radiation can deactivate SARS-CoV-2 particles that are contaminating outdoor surfaces. This is the most relevant transmission path that is potentially affected by the Montreal Protocol: by preventing large increases in harmful UV-B radiation (Sect. 2.7), the Montreal Protocol has also modified the available germicidal UV-B radiation from the sun. According to assessments by the World Health Organization [497] , the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [498] , and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [499] , COVID-19 is mainly transmitted from person to person through large respiratory droplets and aerosols (small droplets with diameters \u2264 5 \u03bcm [500] ) generated by breathing, sneezing, and coughing. The relative role of large droplets vs aerosols is still unclear, but virus-containing aerosols can penetrate more deeply into the lungs [500] . Indirect transmission through fomites (defined as inanimate objects carrying pathogens) that have been contaminated by respiratory secretions is considered possible [501] , although, so far, has not been conclusively documented [498] .",

The distinction between transmission via respiratory droplets and fomites is difficult to discern because persons who come into contact with potentially infectious surfaces often also have close contact with an infectious individual. Still, fomite transmission is considered a possible mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, given consistent findings about environmental contamination in the vicinity of infected cases [501] and the fact that other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses can transmit this way [497, 503] . As of this writing (September 2020), it is not possible to provide exact numbers on the prevalence of the different transmission pathways.

For example, in an analysis of COVID-19 outbreaks in China involving 1245 confirmed cases and 318 outbreaks only a single outbreak with two cases could be traced to outdoor transmission [505] .

As COVID-19 emerged less than 10 months ago at the time of writing, research into the germicidal effect of solar radiation on SARS-CoV-2 viruses is still incomplete. We assess the current state of knowledge on this matter, which is rapidly evolving. The theoretical background is provided in the Online Resource (Supplementary Material 2). To date, there are four studies that have estimated the inactivation time t 10 , which is defined as the time that reduces the number of viable SARS-CoV-2 viruses to 10% of its initial number upon exposure to solar UV radiation [502, [524] [525] [526] . Ratnesar-Shumate et al. [524] used a solar simulator to determine t 10 for SARS-CoV-2 virus particles that were first suspended in either simulated saliva or a culture medium and then dried on stainless steel surfaces. The solar simulator produced spectral irradiance resembling noon-time solar spectra at 40\u00b0 N latitude (e.g., Philadelphia, Ankara, Beijing) for three seasons: 21 June (solar zenith angle, SZA of 16.5\u00b0), 21 February (SZA = 50.6\u00b0) and 21 December (SZA = 63.4\u00b0). Inactivation times t 10 for virus particles embedded in saliva were 6.8, 8.0 and 12.8 min for the three spectra, respectively. For viruses enclosed in the culture medium, t 10 was about twice as long: 14.3 and 17.6 min for the spectra simulated for 21 June and 21 February, respectively.",

Hence, both studies assume that wavelengths in the UV-A region do not inactivate SARS-CoV-2. This assumption is consistent with the work by Darnell et al. [527] who demonstrated that UV-A radiation does not damage SARS-CoV-1 (a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2), but contradicts more recent work [511] , suggesting that UV-A does contribute to the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown that the viruses can be damaged by peroxides and other reactive oxygen species, which are created by UV-A radiation [528] . Whether a similar mechanism also affects SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been determined. If SARS-CoV-2 were indeed sensitive to UV-A radiation, inactivation times would increase more slowly with SZA as summarised above. Hence, solar radiation would be efficient in deactivating SARS-CoV-2 also at latitudes higher than 60\u00b0 where the studies discussed above indicate inactivation times in excess of two hours. Until the action spectrum for deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 is available, activation times at large SZAs or high latitudes remain uncertain.",

In practice, the time difference between t 10 and t 1 can be considerably longer [526, 529, 530] because viruses in a real-world setting are embedded in a matrix of body fluids (e.g., saliva and mucus) or foreign objects, which partially shield viruses from exposure. Clustered populations of viruses can also protect each other from exposure to radiation [531] . Hence, there are large uncertainties in extrapolating t 10 to t 1 and beyond (e.g., 0.1% and 0.0001% survival for disinfection and sterilisation levels, respectively).

These times will become considerably larger for SZA > 40\u00b0, during cloudy conditions, if surfaces are not directly irradiated by sunlight, or if virus particles are shielded from solar exposure by other means (absorption by matrix material, deposition on a porous material, shade). Hence, while solar radiation helps to disinfect surfaces or exhaled aerosol contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 particles, one cannot rely on the sun's germicidal effect in general and, in particular, early and late in the day, during winter, or at high latitudes during all seasons.",

According to McKenzie et al. [64] , the Montreal Protocol has averted increases of erythemal (sunburning) irradiances by approximately 20% between the early 1990s and 2018 at mid-latitudes. This conclusion may imply that inactivation times of SARS-CoV-2 viruses would be about 20% shorter today if the MP had not been implemented, i.e., in the \"World Avoided\" scenario [8] . However, the effect from changes in stratospheric ozone avoided by the Montreal Protocol is about a factor of 1.75 larger for damage to DNA [533] than it is for sunburn. (The radiation amplification factor (RAF), which is defined as the relative fractional change in effective UV irradiance with fractional change in TOC, is about 2.1 for DNA damage and 1.2 for erythema [534] ; the ratio of 2.1 and 1.2 is 1.75). In turn, this factor may imply that the Montreal Protocol has reduced the germicidal effectiveness of solar UV radiation by as much as 35% (1.75 times 20%). The actual percentage is still unknown, as the RAF for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 (which has a RNA rather than a DNA genome) has not yet been established. Since relevant information is still lacking for making an exact assessment, we estimate that due to the Montreal Protocol inactivation times for SARS-CoV-2 are 20% to 35% today compared to the early 1990s. However, it is unlikely that this effect has any tangible consequences on COVID-19 infections, as transmissions through fomites have not been conclusively documented [498] and outdoor infections are the exception [504, 505] . We conclude, based on the information currently available, that the effect of actions prompted by the Montreal Protocol on the progression of COVID-19 via its effect in modifying the germicidal properties of solar UV radiation is either small or negligible. The far-reaching, positive outcomes of the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol for life on Earth (Sects. 2-7) outweigh any potential advantage for disinfection by higher amounts of solar UV radiation.",

In most people, the cells of the immune system coordinate their response to eliminate the virus and limit damage to the host. White blood cells (specifically B cells) will also be activated to produce neutralising SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that would ideally provide long-lived protection from COVID-19. Although it is too early to know if this normal immune response is occurring in those infected with SARS-CoV-2, a recent Icelandic study showed that over 90% of people who tested positive to the virus had antibodies, which were still present for at least 120 days after diagnosis, with no decrease in levels [536] .",

Observational studies provide only limited support for a role of vitamin D. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) reviewed the available evidence in June 2020, at which time five studies had been published. While four studies suggested an association between concentrations of 25(OH)D concentration in serum and risk of COVID-19, all five studies were found to be at high risk of bias [545] . Several studies have been published since this review, but these mostly have similar limitations, notably a lack of simultaneous testing for 25(OH)D and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several studies have identified a possible association between low vitamin D status and increased risk of COVID-19 [546] [547] [548] . A study using anonymised electronic health records from the University of Chicago health system found that vitamin D deficiency in the year prior to testing was associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity [546] . An analysis of data from the UK Biobank cohort found no association between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and concentration of 25(OH)D in serum, but 25(OH)D was measured much earlier than the time that the infection with SARS-CoV occurred. A large study using pathology records from the United States observed that 25(OH)D concentration measured in the year prior to SARS-CoV-2 testing was inversely associated with virus positivity, but there was no control for potential confounders such as body mass index or co-morbidities [546] [547] [548] . A study using genetically determined, rather than measured 25(OH)D, found no link with SARS-CoV-2 positivity, or severe COVID-19 disease, suggesting that associations with vitamin D may not be causal [549] .",

Exposure to UV-B radiation suppresses both the cell-mediated and humoral (antibody-driven) immune response, both of which are the indirect targets of new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, this area is complex; the nature of the immune response being provoked and the amount and timing of exposure to UV radiation may influence any impacts on vaccine effectiveness [553] . Studies of vaccination against other viruses may be informative, but there are few randomised controlled trials. In a study of hepatitis B vaccination in British army recruits, low vitamin D status at the time of vaccination was associated with poorer vaccine response [554] . However, neither vitamin D supplementation nor exposure to solarsimulated UV radiation influenced immune response [554] . This lack of effect is in line with the conclusions from an earlier meta-analysis of the link between vitamin D and response to influenza vaccine, in which no overall association was identified [555] . Given the current pandemic, and indeed the influence of infectious diseases and population health and mortality in general, more information is needed.",

Air quality can also be related to changes in UV radiation resulting from the pandemic (Sect. 7.4). The correlation between air quality and health outcomes is consistent with the notion of respiratory damage from both COVID-19 and air pollution, but the methods used in these studies have weaknesses [559, 564] , which prevent a quantitative assessment of the link between air pollution and mortality from COVID-19.",

Reductions in emissions due to the COVID-19 pandemic show similar effects on air quality to those observed due to pollution control measures in the last decade. For example, data on air quality were analysed from ca. 1600 locations in China. Comparing data from January and February 2020 with the same period in 2019 showed a general decrease in the concentrations of CO, SO 2 , NO 2 , and PM2.5, while ambient ozone, which is produced photochemically, has increased [565] . The mechanisms behind this increase in ozone are probably like those invoked for the long-term observations and are, in part, related to changes in UV radiation.

It is also conceivable that this increase in UV-B radiation could have caused negative effects by inducing cellular damage and reducing reproductive performance [169] . The overall net effect on crops and terrestrial ecosystems of the increased solar UV and visible radiation due to the temporary improvement in air pollution prompted by the pandemic is not yet known. On the other hand, exposure to more intense UV-B radiation, as would have occurred in the absence of the Montreal Protocol, would have had negative effects on crops by exceeding their UV-B-protective responses, and this effect would have been further magnified by decreases in air pollution as a consequence of COVID-19 restrictions.",

This increase in UV radiation has benefits in reducing aquatic pathogens, including viruses, given their sensitivity to inactivation by both UV-B radiation and reactive oxygen species produced by UV-A radiation [286] [287] [288] [289] [290] [291] . While there is evidence that other coronaviruses can survive in water for days to weeks [589] , there are currently few reports on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in sewage, surface waters, groundwater, or drinking water supplies [590, 591] . The risk of contamination through these means is therefore considered low [592] . This may be a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus being an enveloped virus with a delicate outer membrane that makes it more susceptible to environmental degradation by solar UV-B radiation and other factors such as chlorination or ozonation of drinking water. There is currently also no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 through human sewage. Conventional sewage treatment plants are designed to inactivate viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, particularly when sewage has long residence times in outdoor treatment tanks with prolonged (several weeks) exposure to solar UV-B radiation [592] . For further information on how variations in exposure to UV radiation may affect pathogens in the aquatic environment, see Sect. 5.12. Fig. 1 ).",
