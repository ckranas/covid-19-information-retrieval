The earliest inhabitants of the north American continent can be traced back to Palaeolithic times. The Pueblo culture in modern-day Colorado and New Mexico flourished from the 11th to the 14th century AD. In the 12th century permanent settlements appeared in the east where cultivation and fishing supported major fortified towns. The first Europeans to make their presence felt were the Spanish, who based themselves in Florida before venturing north and west. Santa Fe in New Mexico was founded in 1610. But by the mid-17th century there was competition centred on Quebec from the French who colonized the banks of the St Lawrence River.",

This was at Jamestown in what is now southern Virginia. After a perilous start when disease and malnutrition carried off most of the settlers, Virginia's population grew rapidly to meet the European demand for tobacco. Maryland, originally a refuge for persecuted Catholics, also thrived on the tobacco trade. To make up for the shortage of labour, slaves were imported from Africa.",

Other settlements soon followed, accommodating a broad range of Christian radicals fleeing persecution. Not all were tolerant of beliefs that differed from their own. Pennsylvania, the colony named after the Quaker William Penn, was exceptional in offering freedom of worship to 'all persons who confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal God'. In 1664 the British took control of neighbouring Dutch colonies. New Amsterdam became New York. Almost all of the eastern seaboard was now claimed by British settlers who were also venturing inland.",

            "text": "Their main European rivals were the French who claimed a vast area around and to the southwest of the Great Lakes. With American Indian tribes allied to both sides, there was heavy fighting in 1744 and 1748. But within a decade British forces had captured most of the French strongholds. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Britain commanded the whole of North America east of the Mississippi while Spain, having surrendered Florida, gained Louisiana from France. For a brief period colonization was restricted to the area east of the Appalachians, the rest of the territory being reserved for American Indian tribes. This soon became a point of issue between the settlers who were intent on expansion and the government in London, which wanted a settled, selfsupporting community benefiting British trade. Having disposed of the French threat, the colonists felt confident enough to defy orders that ignored their interests. In particular, they objected to the Navigation Acts which required goods to be carried in British vessels and to various taxes imposed without consultation. 'No taxation without representation' became a rallying cry for disaffected colonists. The centre of opposition was Boston, scene of the infamous 'tea party' when, in 1773, militants destroyed a cargo of East India tea. In 1775 the arrest of rebel ringleaders served only to provoke the 13 colonies to co-operate in further acts of rebellion, including the setting up of a de facto government which appointed George Washington commander of American forces.",

British forces, never more than 50,000 strong, were supported by a powerful body of colonists who remained loyal to the Crown. The war lasted for seven years from 1776 with both sides often getting close to a conclusive victory. The decisive moment came at last with the surrender of Gen. Burgoyne and his 8,000 troops in upper New York state in Oct. 1777, a defeat that persuaded a cautious France to enter the war. Under the peace terms secured in 1783 Britain kept Canada, leaving the new United States with territory stretching from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. A constitution based on democratic principles buttressed by inalienable rights including the ownership of property came into force in 1789. It allowed for a federal government headed by a president and executive, a legislature with a House of Representatives and a Senate, and a judiciary with ultimate authority on constitutional matters exercised by a Supreme Court. The first president was George Washington, who was elected in 1789. In 1800 Washington, D.C. was declared the national capital.",

Most of the fighting took place on the Canadian border where an attempted invasion was decisively repulsed. But Louisiana, having reverted to French rule and subsequently sold to the USA, was secured for the Union. With the exception of Louisiana, other American territories that had once been part of the Spanish empire fell to Mexico. But not for long. In 1836 Texas broke away from Mexico, surviving as an independent republic until 1845 when it was annexed by the USA. This provoked war with Mexico which ended in 1848 with the USA taking over what are now the states of California, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and New Mexico. Any temptation there might have been for European involvement in the struggle was removed by the Monroe Doctrine, a declaration by President Monroe that interference from the Old World in matters concerning the western hemisphere would not be tolerated. It was a measure of the growing military and economic selfconfidence of the USA that such a warning, delivered in 1823, was taken seriously.",

            "text": "The transition from a rural society to an industrial power of world importance created tensions, not least between the slave-owning southern states and the rest of the Union which favoured the abolition of slavery. Economic as well as humanitarian factors were in play since the North resented the advantage cheap labour gave to the South. The opposing view held that the South, by now the world's largest cotton producer, depended on slavery for its commercial survival. Mutual antagonism came to a head with the secession of the southern states from the Union in 1860-61 and their formation as a Confederacy. Despite sporadic outbreaks of violence, civil war was not in prospect until Confederate troops fired on the US flag at Fort Sumter. President Abraham Lincoln ordered a blockade of the South. The recruitment of rival armies followed within weeks. The war turned out to be much bloodier than anyone had expected. More American lives were lost in the Civil War than in the two world wars combined. The military balance was maintained until 1863 when the North secured a crushing victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. However, the war continued until April 1865 when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. A few days later Lincoln was assassinated, a loss that the southern states had subsequent cause to regret. Contrary to Lincoln's hopes, a generous settlement was now out of the question. Instead of a gradual transition to a new society, the South was rushed into a social revolution. This in turn led to terrorist violence and acts of vengeance against freed slaves. From this carnage emerged the notorious Ku Klux Klan as the standard bearer of lynch law. While the 13th amendment (1865) prohibited slavery, political freedom was denied to the Black community by state-imposed literacy tests and discriminatory property taxes.",

The beginning of the end to the agony came with the election to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pushed through Congress a series of radical measures known collectively as the New Deal, aimed at revitalizing the nation. The abandonment of the gold standard, cheap loans to restart factories and farms and huge investment in public works proved to be the key to recovery. Nonetheless, unemployment remained high until production was boosted by the demands of another world war.

Roosevelt compromised by supplying Britain with much needed armaments on favourable terms. But it was events in Asia rather than in Europe that eventually persuaded America of the need for direct action. Opposition to Japanese expansion into China and southeast Asia, including an oil embargo and a freezing of Japanese assets in the USA, brought a savage retaliation at Pearl Harbor in 1941, when much of the US fleet was destroyed. America declared war on Japan while Germany declared war on America. The US military effort focused initially on the Pacific but after 1942 American forces were also committed to the campaign in north Africa and Europe. With the D-Day landings in June 1944, US troops led the attack on Germany and in May 1945, within a month of Roosevelt's death, Germany surrendered. By then Vice-President Harry Truman had been confirmed as Roosevelt's successor and forced a Japanese surrender by sacrificing Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the atomic bomb.",

In addition, the Truman doctrine provided a $400m. aid package for the Turkish and Greek governments. The risk of a return to isolationism receded still further when China fell to communism in 1949. In 1950 American troops went to the aid of South Korea when it was invaded by the communist North. Though technically under the aegis of the UN, the campaign was an almost entirely American affair led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.

One of the consequences of the economic downturn of the late 2000s is that immigration from Mexico declined considerably and the net migration flow also slowed. In 2013 for the first time Mexico was overtaken as the leading sending country for immigrants to the USA, with more coming from both China and India. Illegal immigration remains a concern. In the 2013 fiscal year the USA deported some 370,000 undocumented immigrants. In the 2014 fiscal year 67,339 unaccompanied children were detained crossing the US-Mexico border (of which more came from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador than Mexico itself), up from 38,045 in the previous fiscal year and 24,120 in the 2012 fiscal year. The number of immigrants admitted for legal permanent residence in the United States in fiscal year 2017 was 1,127,627. Included in this total were 578,081 new arrivals who entered the country with legal permanent resident status. The remaining 549,546 were status adjusters, who had arrived earlier as non-immigrants (including students and temporary workers).

In 1978 the Senate approved a constitutional amendment giving the District full voting representation in Congress but it was not ratified by the requisite three-quarters of the states within seven years and so expired in 1985.",

In March 2010 the then President Obama signed into law a health care reform measure-the Affordable Care Act (ACA)-to extend health insurance to an additional 32m. Americans, impose new taxes on the wealthy and outlaw restrictive insurance practices. According to the Congressional Budget Office, efficiencies contained in the reform were expected to cut the federal deficit by $138bn. over ten years. The US Department of Health and Human Services reported in March 2016 that approximately 20m. Americans had gained health coverage under the Act since 2010. However, after several unsuccessful attempts in 2017 to repeal and replace the ACA (with a programme based around refundable tax credits to support insurance purchases), the new populist president, Donald Trump, signed an executive order in Oct. scaling back some of the Act's provisions.",

Annual GDP growth averaged 2\u00c14% in the period 2013-15, rendering the economy 10% larger than its 2007 pre-crisis level. In the third quarter of 2017, GDP increased at an annual rate of 2\u00c18% despite the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Aug. and Sept. respectively. Stock and asset prices had also improved following the recession, while unemployment fell by around 0\u00c18% each year between 2010 and 2016. The more optimistic economic outlook resulted from a combination of the hydraulic fracturing energy boom, a rebound in the housing market, robust real consumer spending (which reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2016) and an improved fiscal situation. By March 2019 the jobless rate had dropped to 3\u00c18%, although the Labor Department indicated that it might not be as favourable as it appeared, pointing to an increase in the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits over the previous ten months. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate, which had been raised by a quarter percentage point in Dec. 2015 (for the first time since 2006 and from a record low level), was increased by the same amount again in Dec. 2016, three times in 2017 and four times in 2018. In its March 2019 meeting the Federal Reserve agreed to keep interest rates unchanged, pointing toward low inflation, among other factors. Uncertainty remained as to whether interest rates would be increased later in the year, ultimately depending on inflation. In mid-2018 the government passed a bill aimed at loosening the banking rules implemented after the financial crisis and assisting small-to medium-sized banks.",

Each state and the District of Columbia has a system of free public schools, established by law, with courses covering 12 years plus kindergarten. There are three structural patterns in common use; the K8-4 plan, meaning kindergarten plus eight elementary grades followed by four high school grades; the K6-3-3 plan, or kindergarten plus six elementary grades followed by a threeyear junior high school and a three-year senior high school; and the K5-3-4 plan, kindergarten plus five elementary grades followed by a three-year middle school and a four-year high school. All plans lead to high-school graduation, usually at age 17 or 18. Vocational education is an optional part of secondary education. Each state has delegated some degree of control of the educational programme to local school districts (numbering 13,567 in school year 2011-12), each with a board of education (usually three to nine members) selected locally and serving mostly without pay. The policies of the local school districts must be in accord with the laws and the regulations of their state departments of education.

Alabama seceded from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War (1861) and joined the Confederate States of America; its capital Montgomery became the Confederate capital. After the defeat of the Confederacy the state was readmitted to the Union in 1878. Attempts made during the reconstruction period to find a role for the newly freed black slaves-who made up about 50% of the populationlargely failed, and when whites regained political control in the 1870s a strict policy of segregation came into force. At the same time Birmingham began to develop as an important centre of iron-and steel-making. Most of the state was still rural. In 1915 a boll-weevil epidemic attacked the cotton and forced diversification into other farm produce. More industries developed from the power schemes of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s. The black population remained mainly rural, poor and without political power, until the 1960s when confrontations on the issue of civil rights produced reforms.",

In Nov. 2017 there were 35 adult prisons. As of Dec. 2016 there were 6,919 adult inmates serving 'three strikes' sentences.

In 1783 Indiana became part of the North West Territory of the USA; it became a separate territory in 1800 and a state in 1816. Until 1811 there was continuing conflict with the American Indian inhabitants, who were then defeated at Tippecanoe. Early farming settlement was by families of British and German descent, including Amish and Mennonite communities. Later industrial development offered an incentive for more immigration from Europe, and, subsequently, from the southern states. In 1906 the town of Gary was laid out by the United States Steel Corporation and named after its chairman, Elbert H. Gary. The industry benefited from navigable water to supplies of iron ore and of coal.

After passing under the nominal control of France, Britain and Spain, the area became part of the Louisiana Purchase and was sold to the USA in 1803. Fort Snelling was founded in 1819. Early settlers came from other states, especially New England, to exploit the great forests. Lumbering gave way to homesteading, and the American settlers were joined by Germans, Scandinavians and Poles. Agriculture, mining and forest industries became the mainstays of the economy. Minneapolis, founded as a village in 1856, grew first as a lumber centre, processing the logs floated down the Minnesota River, and then as a centre of flour-milling and grain marketing. St Paul, its twin city across the river, became Territorial capital in 1849 and state capital in 1858. St Paul also stands at the head of navigation on the Mississippi which rises in Minnesota.",

Trappers and fur-traders were the first immigrants, and the fortified trading post at Fort Benton (1846) became the first permanent settlement. Colonization increased when gold was found in 1862. Montana was created a separate Territory (out of Idaho and Dakota Territories) in 1864. In 1866 large-scale grazing of sheep and cattle provoked violent confrontation with the indigenous people whose hunting lands were invaded. American Indian wars led to the defeat of federal forces at Little Bighorn in 1876 and at Big Hole Basin in 1877, but by 1880 the American Indians had been moved to reservations. Montana became a state in 1889.",

Settlement began in 1849 and the area was separated from California and joined with Utah Territory in 1850. In 1859 a rich deposit of silver was found in the Comstock Lode. Virginia City was founded as a mining town and immigration increased rapidly. Nevada Territory was formed in 1861. During the Civil War the Federal government, allegedly in order to obtain the wealth of silver for the Union cause, agreed to admit Nevada to the Union as the 36th state. This was in 1864. Areas of Arizona and Utah Territories were added in 1866-67. The mining boom lasted until 1882, by which time cattle ranching in the valleys, where the climate is less arid, had become equally important. Carson City, the capital, developed in association with the nearby mining industry. The largest cities, Las Vegas and Reno, grew in the 20th century with the building of the Hoover dam, the introduction of legal gambling and of easy divorce.",

In 1691 the north was put under a deputy governor who ruled from Charleston in the south. The colony was formally separated into North and South Carolina in 1712. In 1729 control was taken from the private proprietors and vested in the Crown, whereupon settlement grew, and the boundary between north and south was finally fixed (1735). After the War of Independence, North Carolina became one of the original 13 states of the Union. The city of Raleigh was laid out as the new capital. Having been a plantation colony North Carolina continued to develop as a plantation state, growing tobacco with black slave labour.

Idaho Key Historical Events Kutenai, Kalispel, Nez Perc\u00e9 and other tribes lived on the Pacific watershed of the northern Rocky Mountains. European exploration began in 1805, and after 1809 there were trading posts and small settlements, with fur-trapping as the primary activity. The area was disputed between Britain and the USA until 1846 when British claims were dropped. In 1860 the discovery of gold and silver brought a rush of immigrant prospectors. An area including present-day Montana was created a Territory in March 1863. Montana was separated from it in 1864. Population growth was stimulated by refugees from the Confederate states after the Civil War and by settlements of Mormons from Utah.",

In May 2001 then President Bush called for the development of an anti-missile shield to move beyond the constraints of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In Dec. 2001 he announced that the USA was unilaterally abandoning the Treaty. On 24 May 2002 the USA and Russia signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (or Moscow Treaty) to reduce the number of US and Russian warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 each. The treaty was in force from June 2003 until Feb. 2011. It was then superseded by the Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (known as New START), signed by the US and Russian presidents in April 2010 and ratified by the US Senate in Dec. 2010 and the Russian Federal Assembly in Jan. 2011. It laid out terms for the number of warheads on each side to be limited to 1,550 by Feb. 2018, a 30% drop on previous levels. Both nations met their obligations by the deadline but, with the agreement due to end in 2021, no extension had been agreed as of March 2019.

French trading posts were set up, but there were few other settlements. In 1803 the French sold their claim to Iowa to the USA as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The land was still occupied by Indians but, in the 1830s, the tribes sold their land to the US government and migrated to reservations. Iowa became a US Territory in 1838 and a state in 1846.The state was settled by immigrants drawn mainly from neighbouring states to the east. Later there was more immigration from Protestant states of northern Europe. The land was extremely fertile and most immigrants came to farm. Not all the American Indian population had accepted the cession and there were some violent confrontations, notably the murder of settlers at Spirit Lake in 1857. The capital, Des Moines, was founded in 1843 as a fort to protect American Indian rights. It expanded rapidly along with coal mining after 1910.Territory and PopulationIowa is bounded east by the Mississippi River (forming the boundary with Wisconsin and Illinois), south by Missouri, west by the Missouri River (forming the boundary with Nebraska), northwest by the Big Sioux River (forming the boundary with South Dakota) and north by Minnesota.

The French founded Ste Genevieve in 1735, partly as a lead-mining community. St Louis was founded as a fur-trading base in 1764. The area was nominally under Spanish rule from 1770 until 1800 when it passed back to France. In 1803 the USA bought it as part of the Louisiana Purchase.St Louis was made the capital of the whole Louisiana Territory in 1805, and of a new Missouri Territory in 1812. In that year American immigration increased markedly. The Territory became a state in 1821. Bitter disputes between slave-owning and anti-slavery factions led to the former obtaining statehood without the prohibition of slavery required of all other new states north of latitude 36 30 0 . This was achieved by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. The Compromise was repealed in 1854 and declared unconstitutional in 1857. During the Civil War the state held to the Union side, although St Louis was placed under martial law.With the development of steamboat traffic on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and the expansion of railways, the state became the transport hub of all western movement. Lead and other mining remained important, as did livestock farming. European settlers came from Germany, Britain and Ireland.Territory and PopulationMissouri is bounded north by Iowa, east by the Mississippi River forming the boundary with Illinois and Kentucky, south by Arkansas, southeast by Tennessee, southwest by Oklahoma, west by Kansas and Nebraska, with the Missouri River forming the boundary in the northwest. years old or older.

They came to farm in the Willamette Valley and to exploit the western forests. Portland developed as a port for ocean-going traffic, although it was 100 miles inland at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers. Industries followed when the railways came and the rivers were exploited for hydro-electricity.

In 1763 French claims were surrendered to Britain. In 1783 Britain ceded the area to the USA which designated the Northwest Territory, of which Wisconsin was part. In 1836 a separate Territory of Wisconsin included the present Iowa, Minnesota and parts of the Dakotas. In 1836 James Duane Doty founded Madison and, even before it was inhabited, successfully pressed its claim to be the capital of the Territory. In 1848 Wisconsin became a state, with its present boundaries.The city of Milwaukee was founded on Lake Michigan when American Indian tribes gave up their claims to the land in 1831-33. It grew rapidly as a port and industrial town, attracting German settlers in the 1840s and Poles and Italians 50 years later. The Lake Michigan shore was developed as an industrial area; the rest of the south proved suitable for dairy farming; the north, mainly forests and lakes, has remained sparsely settled except for tourist bases.Since the Second World War there has been black immigration from the southern states to the industrial lake-shore cities.",
