            "text": "High-throughput screening (HTS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe large regions of chemical space and identify therapeutic agents with new biological properties. Because HTS is generally based on a rapid, simple, and binary cellular or biochemical phenotype, it does not require a priori knowledge of a precise cellular target. The strategy has proven particularly well suited for diseases with complex cellular physiology such as cystic fibrosis in which inherited mutations disrupt intracellular trafficking and target CFTR for rapid degradation. A potential weakness of HTS, however, is that active compounds often lack a known mechanism of action. This limits the ability to predict potential long-term toxicities and more importantly, frustrates attempts to identify and rationally develop alternate molecular scaffolds that act via different cellular pathways. Here we report on the results of an international consortium established to augment HTS efforts aimed at correcting intracellular trafficking of the F508del variant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Our strategy was to identify intracellular pathway(s) affected by compounds or conditions that correct CFTR trafficking using a diverse array of cell-based and in vitro assays that query distinct aspects of CFTR biology. The assays employed are hierarchically overlaid on a modified scheme of the secretory pathway, which we refer to as the CFTR roadmap. Central nodes of the scheme were designed to direct consortium efforts and define global effects on CFTR function, structure, surface expression/stability, ER associated degradation, intracellular trafficking, and biophysical properties of CFTR folding. Within each major node, specific assays were also developed to more precisely interrogate the corresponding cellular machinery involved. This empirical, data-driven analysis yields a complex cellular \"fingerprint\" or \"signature\" that provides valuable insight into mechanism and can be used to compare different correction strategies. The approach and assay panel are intended for collaborative access by members of the CF research community and provide a complementary and novel platform to HTS efforts for genetic and acquired disease states.",

These models are useful to understand the molecular basis of the CFTR function, as well as to evaluate the impact of mutations on the CFTR 3D structure and function. The Sav1866 structure in an outward-facing conformation was first used to model the open form of the CFTR channel (1) , whereas a MsbA structure in an inward-facing conformation (called \"closed apo\") was afterwards considered to construct a plausible 3D model of the closed form of the channel (2) . Despite the large reorganization of the membrane-spanning domains and movements of the nucleotide-binding domains, the coupling interfaces linking these domains are relatively well conserved, suggesting that these act as pivots around which the CFTR channel dynamics occur.",

            "text": "We have further considered our previous models of the CFTR channel, based on the Sav1866 and MsbA 3D structures, as well as new ones constructed on the basis of the recent P-gp 3D structure, in order to highlight new structural features, which may account for specific functional features. The models especially support the hypothesis that CFTR may consist of a \"broken\" ABC transporter, having an \"atrophied\" gate at the cytoplasmic side (3) . According to our models, this gate would be located at the level of the bundle formed by the four intracellular loops (ICLs). Moreover, a careful analysis of the 3D structure models revealed several potential ligand binding sites at the interface between the domains (NBDs heterodimer interface, but also MSDs:NBDs), suggesting that these could be privileged targets for therapeutic strategies. Biosynthetic misprocessing of the CFTR, a plasma membrane chloride channel, is the hallmark of the CF cellular phenotype. Deletion of Phe508 (\u2206F508) in the NBD1, the most common CF mutation, compromises the membrane spanning domains (MSD1-2) and the NBD2 conformation, while it has marginal effect on the isolated NBD1 biochemical, biophysical and structural characteristics. In the \u2206F508-NBD1 crystal structure, the conformational difference was limited to the F508 containing loop that could be attributed to solubilizing and revertant mutations incorporated in the domain. In contrast, more recent data and molecular modeling suggest that \u2206F508 reduces the conformational stability of the NBD1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . In the context of CFTR the \u2206F508 manifests in a temperature-sensitive folding and stability defect of the channel, consistent with the notion that the F508 loop is involved in stabilization of the NBD1 as well as the NBD1-CL4 (MSD2) and the NBD1-CL1/2 (MSD1) interface, confirmed by Cys-crosslinking. Whether the conformational defect of multiple CFTR domains could be attributed to the \u2206F508-NBD1 localized topological perturbation and/or its thermodynamic defect (1) (2) (3) (4) in concert with cooperative domain misfolding (6) remains incompletely understood. To assess the contribution of the \u2206F508-NBD1 folding defect to CFTR misprocessing, the conformational stability of isolated NBD1 variants were established and correlated with the cell surface expression and biosynthetic processing efficiency of the CD4-NBD1 chimera and CFTR, respectively. The CD4-NBD1 chimera was implemented to probe the NBD1 recognition by the cellular quality control mechanism in comparison with CFTR, where extensive domain-domain interaction may compound the downstream effect of the mutation. Thermal and chemical unfolding in concert with global hydrogen-deuterium exchange revealed that the \u2206F508-NBD1 was energetically destabilized, rendering the domain susceptible to proteolytic quality control both in vitro and in vivo, probed by a panel of biochemical and biophysical assays. While second site mutations improved the wt-, \u2206F508-NBD1 and the wt-CFTR processing, they had modest effect on the \u2206F508-CFTR. Ongoing experiments suggest that this is likely due to persistent domain misassembly. Thus restoring the \u2206F508-NBD1 stability and domain-assembly defect are both required for efficient therapy in CF.",

The pattern of internal and external MTS modification that we observe allows us to divide the pore into distinct \"regions\" that we refer to as the outer vestibule, narrow region and inner vestibule. The outer vestibule (accessible to external but not internal MTS reagents) contains R104 (TM1) and R334 and K335 (TM6).

The narrow region (accessible to both internal and external MTS reagents) contains the TM6 residues T338 and S341, however, no TM1 side chains were identified as being in this central region. In fact, TM1 appears to change from internal (L102) to external (R104) over a very short distance, suggesting that these two TMs are arranged differently around the CFTR channel pore. Prior to channel activation, internally applied MTS reagents are restricted to the inner vestibule, whereas following channel activation they are able to penetrate more deeply into the pore, reaching the narrow pore region. We therefore propose that channel activation involves removal of a restriction that prevents access from the cytoplasm to the pore narrow region, and suggest that the mechanism of activation involves opening of a channel \"gate\" in the pore inner vestibule.",

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein in that it functions as a chloride channel. Binding and hydrolysis of ATP in the nucleotide binding domains lead to gating conformational changes in the transmembrane domains (TMDs). To study the functional role of the cytoplasmic side of the sixth transmembrane segment (TM6) of TMDs, we mutated all 18 endogenous cysteines, introduced one cysteine at each position of into this cysless CFTR, and examined their reactivity to intracellularly applied thiol-specific methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. The effects of differently charged reagents indicate that the cytoplasmic part (341-354) of TM6 assumes a secondary structure of an \u03b1-helix. Interestingly, modification by positively charged reagents of cysteine residues at one face (344, 348 and 352) of the helix can affect gating. In the cases of I344C and M348C, after modification, gating behavior is profoundly altered whereas the singlechannel amplitude is only slightly changed. The open time is prolonged and the closed time is shortened, suggesting that depositions of positive charges at these positions stabilize the open state but destabilize the closed state. For R352C, which exhibits reduced single-channel amplitude, modifications by two positively charged MTS reagents of different size completely restore the single-channel amplitude but have distinct effects on both the open time and the closed time, indicating that the arginine residue not only regulates anion permeation but is also involved in gating motion. These results are consistent with the idea that a helix rotation of TM6, which has been proposed to be part of the molecular motions during transport cycles in other ABC transporters, is associated with gating of the CFTR pore.",

Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA; 2. Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Iowa City, IA, USA CFTR \u2206F508 is the most common mutation in cystic fibrosis. It has at least three defects: it disrupts biosynthetic processing, it reduces the channel opening rate, and it decreases the protein lifetime on the cell membrane. Mouse CFTR \u2206F508 exhibits a similar gating defect as human CFTR \u2206F508, however, its processing defect is less severe than hCFTR\u2206F508. We found that the C-terminal portion of mouse nucleotide binding domain 1 (the Regulatory Extension (RE) of mNBD1) was critical for the species-specific difference in CFTR \u2206F508 processing. However, the RE region did not affect the \u2206F508-induced gating defect. Models of CFTR structure suggest interactions between NBD1 and the intracellular loops (ICLs) of membrane spanning domain 2 (MSD2). We found that substituting mMSD2 into hCFTR (hmMSD2) did not rescue the CFTR \u2206F508 processing defect, but it prevented the \u2206F508-induced gating defect. To better understand which regions of MSD2 are important for the CFTR\u2206F508 gating defects, we designed a series of mutations in the ICLs of MSD2. We found that like the hmMSD2 chimera, mutating residues from the human to the mouse sequence at either ICL3 or ICL4 region prevented the \u2206F508-induced gating defect. This was a surprise because both mCFTR \u2206F508 and hCFTR \u2206F508 exhibit similar gating defects. An explanation for these apparently paradoxical findings came when we compared chimeras with a human backbone but mouse ICLs and/or mouse NBDs. We found that a hmNBD1 chimera with a mICL4 mutation and a hmNBD2 chimera with a mICL3 mutation retained the \u2206F508-induced gating defect (prolonged closed time). However hmNBD1 chimera with a mICL3 mutation and hmNBD2 chimera with a mICL4 mutation prevented the \u2206F508-induced gating defect. These results suggest that CFTR channel gating involves interactons between ICL4 and NBD1 and between ICL3 and NBD2. By pointing to specific regions of CFTR that alter gating of CFTR\u2206F508, the data may suggest novel strategies for correcting the defects caused by this mutation.",

However, the structural changes in the channel pore that are triggered by these cytoplasmic factors to cause channel opening are not known. To gain information on the conformational changes in the pore associated with channel opening, we have used patch clamp recording to investigate the accessibility of cysteine reactive reagents to cysteines introduced at different sites in the pore. Individual cysteines were engineered into the first (TM1) and sixth (TM6) transmembrane helices of a cysteine-less variant of CFTR using site-directed mutagenesis. Cysteine reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents were then applied to the extracellular or intracellular side of the membrane. When applied to the cytoplasmic side of open CFTR channels, the MTS reagents [2-sulfonatoethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) were able to modify irreversibly cysteines substituted for (from outside to inside) L102, P99, Q98 and K95 in TM1, and F337, T338, S341, I344, V345, M348, A349, R352 and Q353 in TM6, leading to increases or decreases in macroscopic current amplitude. External MTSET was able to modify R104C but not L102C, Q98C or K95C (in TM1), and T338C and S341C but not I344C, V345C or M348C (in TM6), confirming that MTS reagents are not permeant in CFTR. When used to pretreat excised membrane patches, the pattern of modification by cytoplasmic MTSES was dependent on the activation state of the channels. Thus, while cysteines located relatively superficially into the pore from the inside The most common mutation in CF patients, F508del, disrupts CFTR folding in the endoplasmic reticulum and targets the newly synthesized pro-tein for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Phe 508 is located in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR where it facilitates the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to transmembrane helix movement during channel gating. Importantly, F508del increases local dynamics of the domain near residues 507-511, but does not significantly alter native NBD1 structure. It has therefore been proposed that the mutation primarily disrupts the pathway of NBD1 folding, although how this occurs remains unknown. NBD1 exhibits a particularly complex topography consisting of three canonical subdomains: an antiparallel ABC beta-subdomain, an alpha-helical subdomain, and an F1-like ATPase beta-sheet core, as well as an unstructured regulatory insertion (RI; residues 405-436) and C-terminal helical extension (RE; residues 656-673). To understand how nascent NBD1 acquires its native structure, we developed a novel method using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to characterize the cotranslational compaction of nascent polypeptides as they are synthesized and emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel. This strategy is based on the principle that the distance between incorporated donor and acceptor dyes should decrease, and hence the FRET should increase, as the polypeptide transitions from an extended to a folded conformation.",

Truncated mRNAs were then synthesized in vitro to generate nascent NBD1 polypeptides that retain a covalent peptidyl-tRNA bond and mimic kinetically trapped translation intermediates. FRET efficiencies obtained for multiple surface-exposed residues indicated that ribosome bound NBD1 (truncated at residue 744) acquires a native-like fold. Translation intermediates truncated between residues 460 and 744 further identified an N-terminal subdomain (residues 389-500) that folds autonomously as residues 490-510 emerge from the ribosome exit tunnel. This region contains the ABC beta-subdomain, the RI, and key elements that stabilize ATP binding, including the Walker A motif (Lys464), Trp401, and other residues that contact the ribose and adenine ring. Remarkably, real-time folding kinetics of ribosome released nascent polypeptides demonstrated that that ATP serves as a critical ligand that facilitates rapid, de novo folding of this subdomain. Thus, we predict that NBD1 folding in cells is a vectorial, multi-state process initiated by rapid cotranslational compaction of an N-terminal ATP-binding sub-domain. Because Phe508 is still in the ribosome tunnel during these early folding events, we predict that the F508del mutation affects later stages of folding that involve the ABC alpha-sub-domain and/or formation of the F1-type ATPase betasheet core.",

            "text": "In our previous study we have shown that the ubiquitin ligase, c-Cbl facilitates endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of wild type (WT)-CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. To focus on the role of c-Cbl in cystic fibrosis, we examined whether c-Cbl regulates trafficking of \u2206F508-CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. Further, we investigated whether protein adaptors and phosphorylation regulate the c-Cbl-CFTR interaction. Studies were conducted in the primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from the University of Pittsburgh Human Airway Cell Core (HBE cells; homozygous WT-CFTR or \u2206F508-CFTR) and in polarized human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) stably expressing WT-CFTR or \u2206F508-CFTR. Decreased temperature (27 \u03bf C) was used to increase the trafficking and expression of \u2206F508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. Endogenous c-Cbl co-immunoprecipitated with \u2206F508-CFTR in HBE and CFBE41o-cells and silencing the c-Cbl expression in CFBE41o-cells increased the plasma membrane abundance of \u2206F508-CFTR. These data suggest that c-Cbl regulates the endocytosis and post-endocytic trafficking of \u2206508-CFTR in human airway epithelial cells. The role of c-Cbl in endocytic trafficking depends on spatially and temporally regulated interactions with protein adaptors. CIN85 (c-Cbl interacting protein of 85 kDa) recruits the c-Cbl-target protein complex to the clathrin-coated vesicles in nonepithelial cells. We examined the role of CIN85 in human airway epithelial cells. Endogenous CIN85 formed a complex with c-Cbl and CFTR and silencing the CIN85 expression increased CFTR abundance in the plasma membrane in CFBE41o-cells expressing WT-CFTR or \u2206F508-CFTR. These data indicate that CIN85 facilitates the c-Cbl mediated CFTR endocytosis. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in protein-protein interactions. We investigated whether phosphorylation regulates the interaction between c-Cbl and CFTR. c-Cbl is known to be regulated by phosphorylation on its serine-rich 30 amino acid region (residue 615-644) and on tyrosine residues (674-774) in its distal C-terminus. Treatment of HBE and CFBE41o-cells with pervanadate (Tyr-phosphatase inhibitor) and calyculin A (Ser/Thrphosphatase inhibitor) increased the amount and mobility of c-Cbl in an additive manner indicating that c-Cbl is regulated by Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation in human airway epithelial cells. Endogenous c-Cbl was not found in complex with CFTR immunoprecipitated with the phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody in the presence of pervanadate and calyculin A. These data suggest that c-Cbl does not interact with the PKA activated, (Ser/Thr)-phosphorylated CFTR. Overall, calyculin A together with pervanadate augmented the c-Cbl-CFTR interaction and the Tyr-774 phosphorylated c-Cbl was found in complex with CFTR in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Taken together, our data indicate that in human airway epithelial cells the PKA activated CFTR is not targeted by c-Cbl and that the complex formation between c-Cbl and CFTR is augmented by phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr and Tyr residues on c-Cbl and/or its adaptor(s).",

We further investigated the role of the molecular chaperone in CFTR degradation and maturation. We found that Hsp70 and its cochaperone Hdj-2 interacted significantly with \u2206F508 CFTR and wt-CFTR in airway epithelial cells. Hsp70 interacted with the immature form of CFTR while Hdj-2 associated with both immature form and ubiquitylated CFTR. Immunoprecipitation and GST-fusion protein pull-down experiments revealed that Hdj-2 interacted with ubiquitin. In steady-state, over-expression of Hdj-2 increased both immature and mature forms of wt-CFTR, but it decreased immature form of \u2206F508CFTR. Pulse-chase studies showed that co-expression of Hdj-2 promoted \u2206F508 CFTR degradation, reducing its half-life from 85 to 50 min. In contrast, Hdj-2 expression did not significantly affect wt-CFTR biogenesis. These data are consistent with our finding that Hdj-2 shows a selective physical interaction with \u2206F508 CFTR, which translates into a functional discrimination between the mutant and its wt counterpart. A role for Hsp70 in Hdj-2 mediated \u2206F508CFTR degradation was tested in which Hsp70 knockdown increased \u2206F508CFTR expression 3-4 fold. Hjd-2 regulates \u2206F508CFTR maturation and knockdown of endogenous Hdj-2 promoted \u2206F508CFTR and its cAMP-dependent anion conductance in airway epithelial cells. In contrast, we were unable to detect maturation of \u2206F508 CFTR in Hsp70 knockdown experiments, indicating that the maturation of \u2206F508 CFTR mediated by reduced Hdj-2 expression may be independent of Hsp70 function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Hdj-2 is a molecular sensor that can detect differences in the folding related to the \u2206F508CFTR maturation. These data also highlight a novel pathway for Hdj-2 mediated, ubiquitin-dependent degradation of \u2206F508 CFTR.

NBD1 sumoylation was detected either by the molecular mass shift observed upon blotting with an NBD1 antibody or from blots performed using anti-SUMO-1. SUMO modification of NBD1 increased as a function of time over a 0-120 min assay period, with significantly greater modification observed for \u2206F508 vs. WT NBD1. Reactions run at different ATP concentrations demonstrated the expected ATP dependence of NBD1 modification, and showed also that WT NBD1 sumoylation increased at low ATP whereas the \u2206F508 NBD was less posed to act in a dominant negative manner, its mechanism of inhibiting the Hsc70-CHIP degradation pathway remains poorly understood.",

This system lacks transcriptional activity and therefore allows manipulation of ER-associated degradation components without activating cellular compensatory mechanisms. Exogenous addition of wild-type CHIP had minimal effect on CFTR stability, whereas addition of P269A CHIP strongly inhibited CFTR ubiquitination, and blocked degradation in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence of P269A CHIP, addition of recombinant wild-type CHIP and/or Hsc70 partially restored CFTR degradation. The apparent concentration of P269A CHIP required for 50% inhibition of CFTR degradation was ~2.5 \u00b5M, which was much higher than the predicted endogenous CHIP level and comparable to endogenous Hsc70 concentration (~2 \u00b5M). Thus, it is unlikely that P269A CHIP simply competes with wild-type CHIP for Hsc70 binding. Surprisingly, pull down experiments revealed that P269A CHIP associated much more efficiently with CFTR than wild-type CHIP, suggesting that the mutant may stabilize chaperone (presumably Hsc70) binding to substrate. To better understand how P269A CHIP inhibits CFTR degradation, cytosolic CHIP binding proteins were isolated using Histagged affinity purification. Preliminary studies have isolated several proteins that selectively bind to P269A CHIP; identification by mass spectrometry analysis is in progress.",

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) operates as a macromolecular complex at the apical membranes of epithelial cells. Complex formation is facilitated by interaction with the scaffolding protein EBP50/NHERF1 via a C-terminal PDZ binding motif in CFTR. To elucidate the relationship between complex formation and CFTR localization in vivo, we have been investigating the consequences of S1455X mutation that truncates the C-terminus of CFTR but does not cause cystic fibrosis. It has been previously demonstrated that localization of CFTR is not fully dependent on the PDZ binding motif (Swiatecka-Urban et al., 2002; Ostedgaard et al., 2003) and that the C-terminus upstream of the PDZ binding motif contains sequences capable of directing apical localization (Milewski et al., 2001 (Milewski et al., , 2005 . Using protein overlay experiments, we discovered that a peptide encompassing the last 111 residues of the CFTR Cterminus enhanced EBP50 multimerization. Deletion analysis and alanine scanning mutagenesis mapped the region conferring enhanced multimerization to an internal sequence in the C-terminus (1417EENKVR1422). Full-length wild-type CFTR stably expressed in polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells enhanced interaction of HA-and c-myc tagged EBP50 and facilitated complex formation with actin. Full-length CFTR with the EENKVR region substituted with alanines was processed to mature, fully glycosylated protein but was unable to promote EBP50 multimerization. Furthermore, confocal microscopy and cell surface biotinylation demonstrated that CFTR with the EENKVR substitution was not localized to apical membranes of polarized MDCK cells. On the other hand, CFTR bearing the S1455X mutation could enhance EBP50 multimerization and localize to apical membranes, thereby providing an explanation for the moderate phenotype associated with this mutation. Together, these results suggest that CFTR and EBP50 have a dynamic interaction mediated by an internal C-terminal sequence that promotes multiprotein complex formation and apical membrane localization.",

Hdj-2 is a membrane-localized Hsp40 that is farnesylated at its C-terminus. Together with Hsc70, Hdj-2 binds CFTR NBD1 and is proposed to facilitate early steps in CFTR folding and maturation. Consistent with this, overexpression of Hdj-2 in cells increases the steady-state levels of both mature and immature CFTR.

When added to a reconstituted degradation system, addition of wild-type Hdj-2 or a mutant that lacks the C-terminal three amino acids required for farnesylation (\u2206QTS), both markedly inhibited CFTR degradation with an apparent IC 50 of ~6 \u00b5M and ~4 \u00b5M, respectively. Interestingly, inhibitory concentrations of Hdj-2 were approximately 50 fold higher than endogenous cytosolic Hdj-2 levels (0.1 \u00b5M) and 2 to 3 times higher than Hsc70 (~2 \u00b5M). Contrary to the current view that Hsp40 primarily stimulates Hsp/c70 binding to substrate, we found that addition of \u2206QTS Hdj-2 at concentrations that block degradation, strongly inhibited CFTR-Hsc70 co-immunoprecipitation. Similarly, overexpression of wildtype or \u2206QTS Hdj-2 in HEK293 cells increased both band B and C of wildtype CFTR and band B of \u2206F508 CFTR. Therefore, excess Hdj-2 prevents CFTR degradation regardless of its farnesylation status. Based on these results, we predict that Hdj-2 stabilizes newly synthesized CFTR by competition with cytosolic proteins. (Supported by CFFT, NIH, and the Manpei Suzuki Diabetes Foundation.)

We used FRET to determine spatial relationships between A2BR, \u03b2 2 AR, and CFTR. There was an adenosine (ADO) dose dependent increase (4-16%) in FRET between yfpA2BR and cfpCFTR (EC 50 = 1.7 \u00b5M). FRET between \u03b2 2 AR and CFTR (~4% basal FRET) was insensitive to isoproterenol (ISO) stimulation. ADO stimulated increases in yfpA2BR-cfpCFTR FRET was abolished with CD. Post synaptic density, Disc large, and ZO-1 protein (PDZ) motifs have been previously implicated in organization and location of membrane proteins. A2BR and \u03b2 2 AR have PDZ motifs that differ from one another, A2BR having a type 2 motif (GVGL) and \u03b2 2 AR having a type 1 motif (DSLL), each located on the c-terminus. To investigate the possibility that PDZ binding was involved in the specific interactions of A2BR and \u03b2 2 AR with CFTR we made A2BR and \u03b2 2 AR constructs where the c-terminal PDZ binding motifs were switched (i.e. A2BRpdz1 was switched from type 2 \u00c7 type 1 and the reverse for the \u03b2 2 ARpdz2). In yfpA2BRpdz1 cells the FRET response was now insensitive to ADO stimulation. Conversely, by switching PDZ motifs, the yfp\u03b2 2 ARpdz2 FRET response was now increased by ISO stimulation. cAMP measurements performed using the PDZ motif mutants reflected the results we saw in the FRET assays and \u03b2 2 AR became CFTR \"sensitive.\" Immunofluorescence in HBECs indicates that proteins involved in PDZ membrane binding such as actin, ezrin, and NHERF2 were increased in normal compared to CF HBECs suggesting that CFTR organizes its protein environment to facilitate preferential insertion of proteins with type 2 PDZ binding motifs (such as A2BR). In summary, we demonstrate that A2BR and \u03b2 2 AR interact with CFTR in a similar, yet different manner. The differences appear to be, at least in part, due to the c-terminal PDZ motifs on these proteins.

In airway epithelia inhibition of ENaC by CFTR prevents excessive sodium absorption. The absence of functional CFTR in cystic fibrosis results in hyperactive ENaC channels and consequently dehydration of the airway surface. In the past several years it has become obvious that limited proteolysis of ENaC's extracellular domains regulates its open probability. In addition, several studies have indicated that CFTR physically associates with ENaC (Kunzelmann et al. 1997 FEBS Lett. 400: 341-4; Ji et al. 2000 J Biol Chem. 275: 27947-56; Berdiev et al. 2007 J Biol Chem. 282: 36481-8) . In this study we have investigated the interaction of ENaC and CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and airway epithelial cultures and assessed its impact on ENaC regulation by proteolysis. We demonstrate for the first time that CFTR markedly impedes proteolytic processing of ENaC's extracellular domains. Further, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that CFTR interacts mainly with \u03b1 and \u03b3 subunits of ENaC. Proteolytic cleavage of both \u03b1 and \u03b3 ENaC by a channel activating protease was drastically diminished in the presence of CFTR. Defined proteolysis of these subunits is central to the regulation of ENaC and thus inhibition of proteolytic cleavage by CFTR provides a means to regulate ENaC activity. While proteolytic processing of ENaC was drastically inhibited by wild-type CFTR, it was not significantly altered by \u2206F508 CFTR, which is the most common mutant protein in cystic fibrosis patients. To verify a role of CFTR in ENaC proteolysis in human airway epithelia, we analyzed the proteolytic state of ENaC in normal and cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cultures that lack functional CFTR. In primary cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells that were homozygous for \u2206F508 CFTR the amount of proteolytically cleaved \u03b1 ENaC was significantly increased when compared to normal cultures.

Our previously published work demonstrated that Dab2 and CFTR co-immunoprecipitated in human airway epithelial cells. Thus, the goals of the study were: (1) to determine the effects of TGF\u03b21 on CFTR in human airway epithelial cells; and (2) to examine whether Dab2 mediates signal transduction from the TGF\u03b2 receptor I (TGF\u03b2-RI) to the downstream transcription factor, Smad2. Studies were conducted in primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells obtained from the University of Pittsburgh Human Airway Cell Core (HBE cells; homozygous WT-CFTR) and in polarized human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-) stably expressing WT-CFTR or \u2206F508-CFTR. Our studies demonstrate that TGF\u03b21 treatment induced transcriptional responses, including Smad2 phosphorylation in the HBE and CFBE41o-cells. Treatment with TGF\u03b21 significantly decreased CFTR expression in cell lysates and apical plasma membrane in a concentration and time-dependent man-that CFTR protects ENaC from proteolytic processing by proteases in airway epithelia. The lack of this control mechanism in cystic fibrosis may account for hyperactive sodium channels that have been implicated in dehydration of the airway surface liquid and subsequent inefficient mucociliary clearance.",

Malfunction or loss of CFTR at the plasma membrane disrupts chloride transport across epithelia, resulting in the lethal genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR contains two transmembrane spanning domains (TMDs), two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and one regulatory region (R) that are translated in the order: TMD1-NBD1-R-TMD2-NBD2. Each domain folds cotranslationally, and can then associate with previously folded domains to form the final, functional CFTR structure. The most common CF mutation, \u2206F508, and other CF mutations, disrupt multiple steps in this folding pathway. Translation of individual domains provides insight into cotranslational formation of CFTR folding intermediates. We have used in vitro translation to probe folding and association of TMD1 and NBD1 using both wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems. System specific differences in domain translation were observed that highlight the relationship between TMD1 and NBD1 translation.

We found that wild-type and S122A mutant NDPK-A showed significant autophosphorylation in the absence of AMPK, which was enhanced by AMPK. However, the H118F mutant showed very little 32 P labeling with or without AMPK present. These results suggest that AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of NDPK-A requires NDPK-A catalytic function and occurs at a site distinct from Ser-122. To test the potential requirement of NDPK-A in the regulation of CFTR by AMPK, either the H118F mutant or wild-type NDPK-A were co-expressed with CFTR in Xenopus oocytes, and two-electrode voltage clamp (TEV) studies were performed. Oocytes were injected with either K-gluconate (control) or ZMP (AMPK activator) 2-4 h prior to recording, and CFTR conductance was measured after stimulation with 1 \u00b5M forskolin and 100 \u00b5M IBMX. AMPK activation significantly inhibited CFTR conductance in the presence of wild-type NDPK-A, but this inhibition was blocked with expression of the NDPK-A H118F mutant. This result suggests that functional NDPK-A is required for the regulation of CFTR by AMPK. To test whether AMPK binding to CFTR is functionally important for the regulation, we generated a purified peptide corresponding to the AMPK-interacting region in the CFTR tail (CFTR-1420 (CFTR- -1457 . This peptide, when injected into CFTR-and AMPK-\u03b11-expressing Xenopus oocytes or HEK-293T cells, inhibited the binding of AMPK to CFTR as detected by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Electrophysiological experiments to test whether this blocking peptide interferes with the ability of AMPK to regulate CFTR are underway. In conclusion, our studies highlight the importance of NDPK-A in the AMPK-dependent regulation of CFTR and support the substrate channeling hypothesis. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of NDPK-A and AMPK interregulation and their role in the regulation of CFTR could suggest novel therapeutic targets for CF.

The objective of the present investigation is to further characterize the role of luminal and cytosolic MCC on cAMP and glutamate dependent regulation of CFTR in the native human sweat duct. After \u03b1-toxin permeabilization of the basolateral membrane as previously described (Reddy and Quinton, 2003) , we measured the effect of changing Na + and K + concentrations in the cytosol and in the lumen on the apical CFTR-Clconductance (CFTR-gCl). We found that in the cytosol, substituting K + with Na + completely inhibited cAMP-activated CFTR-gCl regardless of the luminal MCC. In contrast, the effect of substituting cytosolic Na + for K + on glutamate activation of CFTR-gCl is a function of luminal MCC. That is, glutamate-activated CFTR-gCl is stimulated by the presence of luminal Na + and inhibited by its absence (K + substitution). Preliminary results suggested that this inhibition of glutamate-activated CFTR-gCl was due to lowered luminal Na + and not due to increased [K + ] since luminal Na + substitution with Li + or NMDG had similar inhibitory effects.",

Our data support the concept that stimulation of calcium induced anion secretion could be a therapeutic strategy to prevent or mitigate the CF phenotype. CFTR bearing F508del, the most common CF-causing mutation, is retained intracellularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to ineffective folding and sent to premature degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). Accordingly, most mutant protein fails to reach its proper location at the plasma membrane. Several approaches have been used in the recent years to rescue the misfolding and trafficking defects of the F508del-CFTR mutant and to understand the underlying mechanisms. These strategies either improve folding or circumvent the ER quality control (ERQC) that targets F508del-CFTR to UPP, or both. They include: 1) low temperature incubation (26\u00b0C); 2) presence of genetic revertants (second-site mutations that either remove ERQC retention signals or stabilize its folded conformation); and 3) small molecules which either interact directly with F508del-CFTR to favour correct folding and/or indirectly promote its membrane trafficking. Understanding how F508del-CFTR is rescued to the cell surface by distinct agents enables us to mimic such effects by small molecules. Moreover, identifying distinct rescuing mechanisms will possibly allow usage of different therapeutic molecules for enhanced results.",

The 14-3-3 proteins are a family of conserved regulatory molecules that generally interact with phosphopeptide consensus sequences (e.g., the canonical motifs, RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP) within their protein targets, although binding at varied related sequences is observed. Several potential non-canonical 14-3-3 binding motifs appear in the CFTR sequence, particularly in the R domain. Therefore, we are evaluating the hypothesis that 14-3-3 proteins participate in the regulation of CFTR through association with its phosphorylated binding motifs. First, we found that the 14-3-3 \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b5 isoforms are expressed in Calu-3 cells and HEK293 cells using RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis. Physical interactions between CFTR and the \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b5 isoforms of 14-3-3 were identified using co-IP experiments. Using in vitro pairwise binding studies, we found that 14-3-3\u03b2 interacted significantly with the CFTR N-terminus and R-domain. The dependence of 14-3-3 binding on CFTR phosphorylation was examined by treating HEK293 cells for 15 min with forskolin (10 \u00b5M), followed by 14-3-3\u03b2/CFTR co-IP; the results showed that forskolin increased the interaction between 14-3-3\u03b2 and CFTR. In co-IP experiments, we used extracts from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with CFTR. 14-3-3\u03b2 was found to associate with both the mature (band C) and immature (band B) forms of CFTR, and this interaction was significantly increased by prior forskolin treatment. Over-expression of 14-3-3\u03b2 in HEK293 cells increased the expression of CFTR (bands B and C). We employed 14-3-3\u03b2 targeted siRNAs to knock down 14-3-3\u03b2 in HEK293 cells transfected with or without CFTR. Decreased 14-3-3\u03b2 reduced the expression of both immature and mature CFTR (bands B and C) by ~90% and ~65%, respectively. We also found that altered 14-3-3 protein expression produces parallel changes in CFTR channel function in mammalian cells, as detected by SPQ fluorescence dequenching when bath solution is Misfolding and degradation of CFTR is the cause of disease in patients with the most prevalent CFTR mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (F508del), which is located in the first nucleotide-binding domain of human CFTR (hNBD1). While (F508del) CFTR cellular folding is impaired, the structure and chemical unfolding transition of isolated (F508del)hNBD1 is not. We therefore studied the in vitro thermal unfolding of hNBD1 constructs \u00b1F508del to shed light on the defective folding mechanism and thermal instability of (F508del)CFTR. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism were used to study 7 sequence-matched hNBD1 pairs (with and without the F508del mutation), some pairs of which also contained suppressor mutations. The results show that regardless of the sequence, the F508del uniformly lowers the unfolding transition temperature (Tm) by 6-7 o C. A thermal unfolding mechanism derived from nonlinear least squares fitting of comprehensive DSC data sets indicates that hNBD1 unfolds as an isolated monomer. All data are consistent with a simple three-state thermal unfolding mechanism for hNBD1\u00b1F508del: N(\u00b1MgATP) \u00c4 I T (\u00b1MgATP) \u00c7 A T --> (A T ) n . The partially unfolded intermediate, I T , is in equilibrium with native hNBD1 and further unfolding leads to the formation of species A T , via a kinetically-controlled, irreversible transition. A T is a partially folded, aggregation-prone monomer. Its formation represents the rate-determining step leading to the aggregated product, (A T ) n . Fitted parameters indicate that F508del thermodynamically destabilizes the native state, N, i.e., \u2206\u2206G o = 1.1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the F508del mutation accelerates the formation of A T and aggregation of hNBD1. In summary, the studies reported here represent the first thermodynamic description of hNBD1 thermal unfolding. Temperature rescue of the defective in vivo processing of (F508del)CFTR is likely due, in part, to the inhibition of this unfolding pathway of the hNBD1 domain. It is possible that \"solubilizing\" mutations act by inhibiting formation of A T , rather than altering the physical properties of the folded domain; i.e., aggregation is initiated from the partially unfolded A T state, not the folded state, and solubilizing mutations act by inhibiting the formation of A T . Further, the inclusion of high MgATP concentration or osmolytes like glycerol and other so-called \"stabilizing\" additives lead to improved solubility by inhibiting the formation of A T .",

Physiology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada Essential to development of effective therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) are animal models that recapitulate the human disease phenotype. To this end, ferret and pig CF models have been developed and their phenotypes are now being characterized. Differences in CFTR biology have been reported to exist across species. For example, murine and porcine \u2206F508-CFTR proteins are more effectively processed to the apical membrane of airway epithelia than human \u2206F508-CFTR. Understanding such species-specific differences is imperative to evaluation of CF animal models, developing and testing therapeutic agents, and elucidating mechanisms of CFTR processing, function, and regulation. In the present study we have compared protein changed from iodide to nitrate buffer. Based on these findings, we conclude that CFTR interacts physically with the 14-3-3\u03b2, and perhaps other isoforms and it associates with both mature and immature CFTR in vivo. Their interaction was increased significantly by cAMP/PKA stimulation and 14-3-3\u03b2 directly interacted with CFTR's N-terminus and R-domain. We also propose that 14-3-3 protein interactions with CFTR regulate its biogenesis, providing what may be a late checkpoint in CFTR quality control.",

To this end, wild type and \u2206F508 CFTR proteins, with and without an extracellular HA-tag in ECL-4, were used to study the processing, maturation, membrane stability, and function of CFTR across species. Heterologous expression of wild type CFTR in human cell lines (HT1080 and HEK293) demonstrate elevated total fCFTR protein levels relative to hCFTR by Western blot and in vitro phosphorylation assays. By 35 S-methionine metabolic pulse chase, we demonstrate that significant differences exist in the membrane stability of the fully processed band C forms of fCFTR and hCFTR (fCFTR is several fold more stable than hCFTR). No significant differences were observed in the initial amount of incorporated label, band B stability, and rate of band B to C conversion between the CFTR orthologs. The observation of increased fCFTR membrane stability relative to hCFTR has also been characterized by surface labeling HA immunofluorescence (IF) in non-permeabilized BHK21 cells. Expressing the \u2206F508-CFTR orthologs in HT1080 and HEK293 cells results in some band C formation in the ferret protein with little or no processing of the human mutant, as determined by in vitro phosphorylation assays and metabolic pulse chase experiments. This data is similar to that reported in the literature of pig and mouse \u2206F508-CFTR proteins suggesting that the \u2206F508 band B processing block may be specific to human CFTR. Despite some processing of the \u2206F508-ferret band B to C, surface HA IF staining of nonpermeabilized BHK21 cells was not observed relative to its wild type counterpart. Furthermore, \u2206F508-fCFTR produced no detectable Clcurrents when expressed in polarized human airway epithelia. Comparative electrophysiologic and immunolocalization studies in ferret CFTR null tracheal xenografts transduced with human or ferret CFTR (wild type and \u2206F508) are ongoing to determine if the species of the cell influences \u2206F508 processing. Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for increased membrane stability of fCFTR and the species differences in \u2206F508 processing will enhance our understanding of the CFTR biosynthetic pathway, lead to additional therapeutic targets, and aid in the interpretation of the phenotypes seen in the newly generated pig and ferret CF animal models. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lethal genetic diseases worldwide that is a consequence of failure of the proteostasis network (PN) to promote proper protein folding. CF is caused by mutations in the apical chloride channel CFTR, leading to impairment of function and disease. The majority of patients carry at least one allele of the \u2206F508 mutation. \u2206F508 CFTR is characterized by a folding/trafficking defect in which it fails to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is subsequently targeted for proteasomal degradation. We have previously shown that wild type (WT) and \u2206F508 CFTR interact with distinct cellular partners during CFTR biogenesis, and that the \u2206F508 is found in complex with Hsp70/Hsp90 and its co-chaperones, suggesting that it accumulates in on-pathway folding intermediates in the ER. Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones found in the PN control cell homeostasis either promoting folding or degradation of misfolded proteins. However the regulatory mechanisms in the PN that direct proteins towards folding or degradation and the precise role of the co-chaperones involved in such processes are not well understood. Herein we have examined the role of co-chaperones in \u2206F508 CFTR stability and trafficking, using human bronchial epithelial cells expressing either WT or \u2206F508 CFTR. We now demonstrate that modulation of the PN can significantly promote \u2206F508 CFTR stability/trafficking and a concomitant increase in channel activity, suggesting that co-chaperones can redirect \u2206F508 CFTR biogenesis to a more functional state. Our results emphasize the importance of the PN in CF therapeutics through protein folding and trafficking pathways essential for its correction and proper function at the cell membrane.",

Genetica Molecolare, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genoa, Italy Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated Clchannel whose gating is controlled by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP at two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). CFTR activity is pharmacologically modulated by potentiators, small molecules having dual effect. At lower concentration they increase the activity of CFTR, whereas at higher concentrations they inhibit it. The binding site for potentiators is hypothesized to be located in the interface of the dimer formed by the two nucleotide binding domains, interacting mostly with NBD1 and to a lesser extent with NBD2. From previous studies, the binding site seems to involve protonable residues, cysteines and histidines. We have reasoned that if the binding of potentiators to the NBDs relies on electrostatic interaction with any of these amino acids, then modifications of cytosolic pH would alter the binding affinity. To test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the effect of intracellular pH (pHi) on apical membrane currents of Fisher Rat Thyroid cells stably expressing CFTR. Currents were activated by using the membrane permeable cAMP analogue CPTcAMP. To study the role of pHi on potentiators binding we have employed genistein, a classical CFTR potentiator. We found that the activity of CFTR was sensitive to shifts in pHi, with the current significantly lower at pH 6. Also the concentration of CPTcAMP necessary to obtain half of the maximal current diminished at pHi 6. Addition of increasing concentration of genistein to partially phosphorylated channels showed that at pHi 8 the apparent dissociation constant from the activating site was shifted towards higher values relative to pH 7.3, with no effect on this parameter at pH 6. The affinity of genistein for the inhibitory site was instead less sensitive to pHi. These results indicate that cysteines, but not histidines, are involved in the activating binding site. Accordingly, we mutated to alanine two cysteine residues: Cys491 in NBD1, predicted by molecular docking to make contacts with CFTR potentiators, and Cys1344, located in NBD2 outside the putative binding site. We found that the mutation C491A, but not C1344A, abolishes the effect of alkaline pH on genistein binding. Our results confirm and extend the modulatory effect of pHi on CFTR activity, and demonstrate that binding of potentiators to CFTR depends on electrostatic interactions with amino acid residues of NBD1 including Cys491.",

To address our aim, we studied CFTR Clchannels in inside-out membrane patches excised from BHK cells expressing wild-type (wt), G551D-, G550E-G551D-and 4RK-G551D-CFTR. The pipette (external) solution contained 10 mM Cland the bath (internal) solution contained 147 mM Cl -, 1 mM ATP and 75 nM PKA at 37\u00b0C; voltage was -50 mV. When compared with wt-CFTR, the gating behaviour of G551D-CFTR is characterised by infrequent channel openings separated by very prolonged channel closures (wt, open probability (P o ) = 0.47 \u00b1 0.04, mean burst duration (MBD) = 149 \u00b1 14 ms, interburst interval (IBI) = 166 \u00b1 26 ms, means \u00b1 SEM, n = 7; G551D, P o = 0.007 \u00b1 0.001, MBD = 39 \u00b1 7 ms, IBI = 5,452 \u00b1 599 ms, n = 8). Although, neither G550E nor 4RK rescued the gating defects of G551D-CFTR, 4RK caused a small, but significant increase in P o (G550E-G551D-, P o = 0.010 \u00b1 0.001, n = 13; 4RK-G551D-, P o = 0.027 \u00b1 0.005, n = 14; p < 0.05, Student's t-test). However, both revertants reduced dramatically the duration of G551D channel openings. Therefore, G550E-and 4RK-G551D-CFTR channels were characterised by frequent, very flickery channel openings (G550E-G551D-, MBD = 27 \u00b1 4 ms, IBI = 2,772 \u00b1 301 ms, n = 13; 4RK-G551D-, MBD = 11 \u00b1 1 ms, IBI = 535 \u00b1 113 ms, n = 14; p < 0.05). Because G551D-CFTR channel gating is ATP-independent, unlike that of wt-CFTR, we investigated whether revertant mutations restore ATP-dependence to G551D-CFTR. G550E had modest effects on the ATP-dependence of G551D-CFTR. By contrast, the ATP-dependence of 4RK-G551D-CFTR was similar to that of wt-CFTR (wt, dissociation constant (K d ) = 210 \u00b1 47 \u00b5M, n \u2265 5; 4RK-G551D, K d = 209 \u00b1 108 \u00b5M, n \u2265 6). In summary, the revertants G550E and 4RK altered the pattern of CFTR channel gating without rescuing channel activity. However, 4RK, but not G550E, restored the ATP-dependence of G551D-CFTR, suggesting that G550E and 4RK act by different mechanisms. Structural models of the nucleotide-binding domains predict that changes to local electrostatic potentials may partially explain the observed differences in channel gating.",

The ATPase specific activity was >4 nmol/\u00b5g protein released per hour with a Km of 0.64 mM, comparable to CFTR isolated in more time-consuming purification procedures. The protein also possesses single channel conductance and PKA and MgATP-dependent gating typical of the CFTR protein.

Our novel ELISA-based assay allows detection and quantitation of sub-nanomolar concentrations of CFTR in a sample. We are developing a sensitive fluorescence-based non-radioactive ATPase activity assay suitable for medium throughput of purified CFTR samples, to study their interaction with small molecule potentiators.

            "text": "The most common cystic fibrosis (CF)-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is deletion of Phe508 (F508del) in the first of two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). The F508del mutation leads to defects in cellular processing and folding, as well as channel gating. As a potential therapy for CF, small-molecule compounds have been identified that correct the processing/folding defects (correctors) and/or channel gating defects (potentiators) of F508del. Compounds having dual corrector/potentiator activity have been assumed to interact directly with CFTR, possibly at the NBD1, the site of the F508del mutation. Our goal is to determine how these small molecule modulators act. We report NMR studies of the interactions of a representative dual corrector/potentiator with human F508del NBD1 and have mapped the compound-affected residues onto the structure of NBD1. In order to obtain appropriate solubility and yields required for NMR, our constructs lack the regulatory insert (\u2206RI) and regulatory extension (\u2206RE) normally contained within NBD1. The compounds interact with a hydrophobic patch comprising residues in \u03b2-strands S3, S9 and S10, located within the ATP-binding core near the C-terminus of the molecule. Binding of the compounds disrupts an interaction between the C-terminal helices (H8,9) of NBD1 and this hydrophobic patch leading to a shift in a pre-existing conformational equilibrium from helix to coil. Disruption of the interaction between Helix 8, 9 and the NBD1 core by a mutation within \u03b2-strand S9, H620Q, shown to increase the open probability of the channel (Wei et al. FEBS Letters 439(1998) :121), partially mimics the effect of the compounds by promoting the coil state. A comparison of Helix 8 and 9 between F508del and wild-type show that the wild-type favours the coil conformation, suggesting that perturbations that shift the helices toward the coil state coincide with conditions that promote channel opening. Addition of compound to constructs in which Helix 9 has been deleted indicate a broader area of interaction within the hydrophobic patch. We hypothesize that the compounds compete with the The non-hydrolytic N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of CFTR contains a segment of ~ 30 amino acids in length near its N-terminus not present in NBD2 or NBDs of other ABC proteins. Structural studies (Lewis et al, EMBO J 23, 282-93, 2004; Kanelis et al, EMBO J 29, 263-77, 2010) indicate that this insertion (RI) is not highly ordered and strongly affects the thermal stability of the NBD1 folded state (Atwell et al., Protein Eng Des Sel. 23, 375-384, 2010) . Although RI contains a site phosphorylated by protein kinase A, its removal left the channel activity largely unaltered (Csanady et al, J Gen Physiol 125, 171-86, 2005 ).",

We found that deletion of all, but not portions, of RI restored \u2206F508 CFTR maturation and traffic to the cell surface where it had a life-time similar to the wild-type and was fully functional. RI deletion restored the ability of \u2206F508 CFTR to occlude ATP at NBD1. Most striking was the observation that robust and stable channel gating was maintained by \u2206RI/\u2206F508 CFTR for hours at physiological temperature where channel activity of temperature and/or corrector rescued \u2206F508 CFTR was lost in minutes. Thus we assume that the inclusion of RI in NBD1, while normally contributing to some aspect of CFTR structural dynamics also promotes thermodynamic instability, an effect that is amplified by the presence of the \u2206F508 mutation. One may speculate that it might be possible to mimic the stabilizing effect of RI removal by its restriction to one particular conformation.",

Current model systems to bridge preclinical studies of CFTR modulators to clinical trials are limited to studies in cell lines, polarized primary CF airway epithelia, and transgenic CF mice. Each of these model systems has well described advantages and limitations, including variable behavior of mutant CFTR in heterologous expression systems, scarcity of primary human airway cells from CF patients with specific genotypes, and symptoms in CF mice that do not fully recapitulate disease manifestations in CF patients. Examination of CFTR outcome measures in human tissue (including rectal tissue) may complement the current model systems for several reasons, including high CFTR expression, ease of tissue acquisition, minimal organ damage, and several endpoints to monitor modulator effects on CFTR ex vivo (such as intestinal current measurements -ICM, Western blot -WB, and real time RT-PCR). The goal of the current study is to optimize rectal tissue survival and CFTR detection, characterizing CFTRdependent Clconductance, CFTR protein and RNA levels over time. After obtaining informed consent, biopsied rectal tissue from non-CF and CF subjects (Olympus \"endojaw\") was placed immediately in iced RPMI-1640 media (+25 mM HCO 3 -, pH 7.0), dissected to remove the muscularis mucosa, and mounted in recirculating Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Tissue was bubbled with 95%O 2 :5%CO 2 in RPMI-1640 + HCO 3 - at 37 o C.

Data for related compounds suggest that the primary corrector effect is not via a CFTR-dependent mechanism, but the compound may contribute to the corrector effect in one of two possible ways, one by binding to the core of NBD1 and shifting the equilibrium to a folded state, the other by promoting NBD dimerization that could stabilize the folding of full-length CFTR.",

Supported by CFFT and KPRI. The two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and the R region of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are responsible for regulating the chloride pore formed by the membrane spanning domains of CFTR. The most common cystic fibrosis causing mutation, deletion of F508 (F508del), is a mutation in the first NBD (NBD1). F508del has deleterious effects on the folding and stability of CFTR and also severely reduces channel function. Unexpectedly, F508del was shown to have a minimal effect on the crystal structures of NBD1. Rather, F508del is thought to disrupt NBD1 surfaces required for interdomain interactions and/or the thermodynamics of NBD1 folding and interactions. We used NMR to measure fast time scale (ns-ps) motions for WT and F508del mutant NBD1 at residue level resolution. These studies identify flexible regions in WT NBD1 and uncover F508del induced differences in fast time scale motions. These changes are not restricted to the vicinity of the mutation, but propagate through the NBD1 structure. Broadening of NMR resonances and NMR dispersion measurements indicate that NBD1 is highly dynamic and that it samples one or more excited state conformations on an intermediate time scale (\u00b5s -ms) . Deletion of F508 appears to enhance sampling of higher energy conformations as indicated by increased resonance broadening and chemical shift dispersion. We hypothesize that these higher energy NBD1 conformations lead to unproductive folding intermediates during CFTR processing. Further we posit that the dynamic nature of NBD1 ensures that phosphorylation status and interactions with NBD2, ICLs and nucleotide have effects that propagate through NBD1 connecting these events to enable proper regulation of the channel. Subtle changes in the thermodynamics of these interactions are caused by deletion of F508 and may provide a mechanism for disruption of channel gating.",

More recently, an attempt has been made to model CFTR in an inward (or closed) conformation by using the low-resolution 3D structure of prokaryotic MsbA as a template, although this requires significant template readjustment to provide a fully closed state (Mornon et al., 2009) . Here, we model the full length closed conformation of CFTR on the higher resolution eukaryotic 3D structure of P-glycoprotein, as well as the 3D structures of CFTR nucleotide binding domains: NBD1 and NBD2. This results in the NBDs adopting a fully separated state and the membranespanning domains (MSDs) significantly rearranged in relation to the open conformation. However, despite the large conformational shift involved, the connections between the NBDs and MSDs of CFTR remain principally unaltered, although flexibility in critical side-chains is apparent. In addition, one half of the regulatory domain of CFTR has been modeled upon a prokaryotic ABC-transporter TOBE domain, which despite very low sequence similarity, shows similar secondary structure to the regulatory region of CFTR, predicted by NMR (Baker et al., 2007) . The second half of the regulatory region has been modeled ab initio, to permit biologically feasible movement between different conformations, whilst also taking into account relevant amphipathic helical elements.",

            "text": "References We have established a simple, non-radioactive assay for monitoring enzymatic activity of phosphodiesterases relevant to CFTR activation, including PDE1 and PDE4. This assay tracks cAMP metabolism via malachite green and can be used to quantify effects of various small-molecules on PDEs, including identification of novel pharmacologic inhibitors. We investigated CFTR potentiators from the CFFT modulator library identified previously by high-throughput compound library screening. Our findings demonstrate that none of the available compounds tested to date (including VRT-532, UCCF-152, and UCCF-029) inhibit either PDE1 or PDE4, two phosphodiesterases potentially relevant to CFTR regulation within the local plasma membrane environment. These data are congruent with earlier findings that neither VRT-532, UCCF-152, or UCCF-029 increase cellular cAMP. In particular, UCCF-152 was previously demonstrated to activate CFTR, and phosphorylate isolated regulatory domain (R-D), but not augment PP2A activity (a phosphatase important for CFTR modulation through local cAMP regulation). We then validated the CFTR R-D phosphorylation assay for two CFTR activating mechanisms involving cAMP. In this assay, an HA-tagged regulatory domain of CFTR (amino acids 635-836) was expressed in HEK293 cells and phosphorylation monitored by a gel shift of 2-3 kDa. \u03b22-selective adrenergic agonists such as salmeterol and salbuterol bind to the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor and thereby augment adenylyl cyclase. These compounds, as well as selective PDE4 inhibitors such as rolipram (also a CFTR activator), were found to enhance R-D phosphorylation. For example, rolipram stimulated CFTR phosphorylation with an IC50 of approximately 5 nM, strongly suggesting that effects of this compound are mediated by selective inhibition of PDE4, rather than blocking other members of the PDE superfamily. Immunoblotting of epithelia used in the assay demonstrated two known PDE4D isoforms, as well as several other PDE4s that await further characterization. The results are concordant with high level PDE4 expression noted previously by our laboratory (and others) in airway epithelial cells, and help clarify PDE4D subtypes responsible for effects on CFTR gating. In summary, these experiments provide a means by which novel CFTR potentiators can be efficiently tested for their effects on PDEs, R-D phosphorylation, and CFTR function. The experiments also implicate PDE4D as a specific phosphodesterase class that enhances CFTR function in airway and other epithelia.",

Based on these results, we have focused efforts on identifying how the F508del mutation affects co-translational NBD1 folding. Because Phe508 is located in the alpha-helical subdomain (residue 501-564) and has not yet emerged from the ribosome when the N-terminal subdomain has folded, FRET was measured in full length NBD1 (truncated at residue 744) containing the acceptor dye at residues 487 and 567. Preliminary data indicate that F508del NBD1 domain folds less efficiently than wild-type as evidenced by a lower FRET in ribosome bound nascent chains. This suggests that F508del affects primarily alpha-helical subdomain folding and/or formation of the F1-type ATPase beta-sheet core. Further studies are underway to confirm these findings and compare both the folding efficiency and the kinetics of wild-type and F508del-subdomains. It is anticipated that these results will define the impact of F508del on co-translational NBD1 folding and provide a means to assess small molecule correction of this basic defect.",

            "text": "Supported by the NIH and CFFT. Gating of the CFTR chloride channel is regulated by ATP-binding and hydrolysis by the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis are mediated by multiple canonical sequences, including the Walker A and B sequences and the ABC-transporter signature motif (LSGGQ). Mutations within these sequences, which putatively disrupt ATP-binding and hydrolysis, and within the putative NBD1-NBD2 dimer interface have been associated with CF. Structures of the human and mouse NBD1 and NBD2 proteins provide structural insight on the isolated domains. However, detailed functional and structural details of the putative CFTR NBD heterodimer have not been fully elucidated in vitro. Confounding our understanding of the NBD dimerization events that regulate channel gating, the canonical ATP-associated sequences are not strictly conserved in CFTR. Changes in the canonical ATP sequences are associated with the NBD1 ATP-binding site (Walker B, catalytic histidine, and LSGGQ). Further characterization of the functional and structural states associated with CFTR NBD dimerization is critical to our understanding of the NBD reaction cycle and its coupling to channel gating. To characterize the interactions between the CFTR NBDs and the effects of these noncanonical NBD sequences, we have purified and characterized NBDs from two highly related ABC-transporters: CFTR (ABCC7) and ABCC6. Native NBD1 and NBD2 proteins from murine CFTR have been expressed and purified for functional analyses. Consistent with prior studies, the isolated, purified NBDs have negligible ATPase activity alone. Combining the NBD1 and NBD2 proteins in vitro fails to stimulate significant changes in ATPase activity and biochemical studies fail to identify significant in vitro dimerization. Functional characterization of the individual ABCC6 NBDs (NBD1 or NBD2) demonstrates that both NBDs are capable of ATP hydrolysis, likely mediated via homodimerization. Significant differences in NBD1 and NBD2 ATPase rates are observed and may be attributed to conservative substitutions within the Walker B motif. Further, co-incubation of NBD1 and NBD2 in varying stoichiometries stimulates ATPase activity, consistent with NBD1-NBD2 heterodimerization. To better understand how the non-canonical ATP-associated sequences impact NBD activity, chimeric proteins were produced; the non-canonical sequences in CFTR were introduced into ABCC6 NBD proteins and the canonical sequences were introduced into the CFTR NBD proteins. Changes in protein expression and activity were observed in both systems. The introduction of the non-canonical CFTR sequences into ABCC6 significantly reduced the ATPase activity of NBD1 independent of NBD2. Further, ATPase stimulation by co-incubation of NBD1 and NBD2 was significantly reduced in the presence of the noncanonical (CFTR) sequences. The loss of ATPase activity in NBD1, and stimulation by co-incubation of NBD1 and NBD2, are consistent with current models of ATP binding and hydrolysis in CFTR. Further characterization of these NBD-NBD interactions is critical to understanding CFTR channel regulation and its disruption by CF-causing mutations.",

            "text": "Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a crucial role during biogenesis of many transmembrane proteins, including both ion channels and ABC transporters. Previously, studies evaluating PTMs in CFTR have been limited by difficulty obtaining sufficient amounts of purified protein for analysis. We recently developed a recombinant over expression system that yields large amounts of highly purified CFTR using a lentivirus-based system in mammalian HEK293 cells. The vector, designated L2231/TRE-CFTR.TEV.His-IRES-GFP, was packaged and pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein and used to transduce a recombinant cell line (293HEK.m2) constitutively expressing the M2 reverse transcriptional transactivator (rtTA). Using GFP expressed from a bicistronic mRNA, clonal cell cultures were selected and tested for inducible CFTR expression, multiplication kinetics, and stability. Expression was induced in 10 liter bioreactor cultures near peak density of ~3x10 6 cells/ml, generating CFTR protein yields >1 pg/cell. Using this technique followed by nickel affinity chromatography, we obtained purified protein samples that represent both properly folded and unfolded configurations of CFTR and examined sites of PTM by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Purified, full-length CFTR was subjected to enzymatic digestion using a variety of proteases singly or in combination (trypsin, chymotrypsin, Lys-C, Glu-C, Asp-N, among others). Resulting peptides were passed into an ionspray interface of a 4000 Q TRAP LC/MS/MS system (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Concorde, Ontario, Canada), and resulting data processed with an in-house MASCOT search engine. Our proteomic analysis identified numerous and specific CFTR modifications, including novel sites for CFTR phosphorylation and potential residues for ubiquitination, methylation, and palmitoylation, a modification never before reported for CFTR. Side chain attachments such as these are likely to play a role in channel maturation and activity, and may also account mechanistically for certain CFTR mutations associated with disease. Identification of novel PTMs could also lead to new therapeutic targets for cystic fibrosis.",

Analyzing co-translational folding therefore provides valuable insight into CFTR biogenesis and represents a novel method to decipher the effects of Phe508 deletion (F508del) on the CFTR folding pathway. To understand this process, our laboratory developed methodologies for using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to examine cotranslational NBD1 folding. This strategy utilized a donor fluorophore (CFP) attached as in-frame N-terminal fusion to CFTR NBD1 and a small acceptor dye NBD (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole) incorporated at engineered amber (UAG) stop codons using a modified synthetic suppressor tRNA (\u03b5-NBD-lysine-tRNA amb ). When translated in vitro, truncated mRNA templates generate a uniform cohort of nascent chains that mimic folding intermediates kinetically trapped at a specific stage of synthesis. FRET analyses of fluorescently labeled ribosome nascent chain complexes with the acceptor probe located at CFTR residue 450 revealed that: 1) NBD1 achieves a native-like conformation on the ribosome, 2) NBD1 folding",

Adenylate kinases have distinct binding-sites for ATP and AMP. Pyrophosphate (PP i ) markedly increases the opening rate and open time of CFTR if ATP is present.

Third, PP i increased ATP-dependent CFTR current even when ATPbinding to either one of the two ATP-sites was abolished (A462F and S1248F mutations): PP i increased the ATP-dependent opening rate in both mutants; however, channel open time was increased only in CFTR A462F. These results indicate that PP i influenced gating by interacting with a site different from the ATP-sites and that its effect on open time required ATP to interact with the ATP-site of NBD2. We then investigated how the interaction of AMP with CFTR was influenced by PP i and vice versa. When we labeled CFTR with [\u03b1 32 P]8-N 3 -AMP in the presence of ATP, we found that PP i increased labeling. In addition, when we studied the influence of different nucleotides on PP i -induced CFTR current stimulation we found that AMP reduced the on-rate of PP i in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither ATP nor GMP, which does not bind to the AMP binding-site, had this effect. These findings indicate that AMP influenced the interaction of PP i with CFTR. In summary the data suggest that PP i , ATP and AMP bind to non-identical sites but mutually influence their interactions with CFTR. Because PP i produces a large increase in chloride current through CFTR, our data suggest that the mechanisms of its interaction with CFTR may be of interest for developing new therapeutics for cystic fibrosis and other diseases involving ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters.",

            "text": "Supported by NIH/NHLBI, CFF, Francis Family Foundation, and HHMI. The majority of cystic fibrosis is caused by CFTR trafficking defects at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or plasma membrane. Disease causing mutations in the amino-terminal tail (N-tail) of CFTR, from amino acids 1-78, have been implicated in altered CFTR biogenesis and reduced cell surface stability. Lysine residues are the site of several post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, sumoylation, neddylation, and acetylation. We hypothesized that one or more lysines in the N-tail are subject to post-translational modifications that modulate the intracellular trafficking or cell surface stability of CFTR. We created a series of CFTR lysine mutants in which each lysine in the N-tail was mutated to arginine (K8R, K14R, K26R, K52R, K64/K65R, K68R) and an additional mutant with all lysines mutated (N-tail-lysineless) . Productive trafficking of the CFTR mutants was monitored by pulse-chase analysis, and cell surface stability was examined by biotinylation and cycloheximide chase. We observed an increased rate of disappearance of the N-tail-lysineless CFTR mutant from the plasma membrane, supporting a role for N-tail lysine residues in the cell surface stability of CFTR. Furthermore, we found no difference in the degree of ubiquitination between wild type and N-tail-lysineless CFTR, indicating that N-tail posttranslational modifications other than ubiquitination influence CFTR trafficking. These studies highlight the importance of the N-tail in CFTR fate determination and suggest novel mechanisms that regulate CFTR trafficking. Grove, D.; Fan, C.; Ren, H.; Cyr, D. Cell and Developmental Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Protein quality control networks impact the folding efficiency of cellular proteins and the fate of mutant disease proteins. However, mechanisms for the partitioning of non-native proteins between folding and degradation pathways remain unclear. The fatal disease cystic fibrosis is caused by misfolding and premature degradation of CFTR \u2206F508. To date two distinct endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ER QC) complexes have been identified which monitor the folding progression of CFTR. The membrane-associated RMA1 E3/Derlin-1 complex appears to act co-translationally to recognize folding defects in CFTR that involve the misassembly of its aminoterminal regions (1, 2) . Whereas, the CHIP E3/Hsp70 complex may act post-translationally to recognize misfolded regions of CFTR that include NBD2 (1) . Yet, it is unclear how these complexes recognize CFTR as misfolded as well as what other proteins are necessary for this recognition.",

            "text": "Herein, we characterized the human Hsp40 DNAJB12 (JB12) and defined its role in the life span of CFTR and CFTR\u2206 F508. JB12 spans the ER with a single transmembrane domain and utilizes a cytosolic J-domain to interact with Hsp70. Surprisingly, we found that JB12 forms complexes with the RMA1 E3 machinery, but a functional interaction between JB12 and the CHIP E3/Hsp70 complex was not detected. The RMA1 QC complex monitors the folding status of N-terminal regions of CFTR and we observed that JB12 interacts within this area of CFTR. Modest elevation of JB12 levels increases Hsp70 association with Derlin-1 and consequently CFTR degradation is accelerated. Conversely, depletion of endogenous JB12 by siRNA results in a dramatic 3-fold increase in the folding efficiency of CFTR and permits some CFTR \u2206F508 to fold and escape the ER. Collectively, it appears that the Hsp40 JB12 recruits Hsp70 to function as a component of the RMA1 E3 ligase complex to select misfolded CFTR for proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, attenuation of JB12 along with introduction of the V510D suppressor mutation restored CFTR \u2206F508 folding efficiency to 50% of wild-type. Thus, down regulation of JB12 activity combined with use of a small molecule chemical corrector that mimics the action of the V510D suppressor mutation has the potential for use as a combination therapy to treat CF.",

The involvement of the metabolism of SLs on the biological effect of miglustat was tested through the comparative analysis of the inhibitor amitriptyline. In agreement with the anti-inflammatory effect demonstrated in vivo in CF mice (Teichgraber, 2008 , Becker, 2009 , we observed that amitriptyline significantly inhibited the expression of IL-8 mRNA by about 50 % in IB3-1 and CuFi-1 cells (Dechecchi, NACFC 2009 ). To gain insights into how miglustat and amitriptyline modulate the inflammatory response to P.aeruginosa, RNA macroarrays by TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) custom designed of 93 genes, were conducted. Of the 93 genes analysed 53 were detectable in IB3-1 cells. P.aeruginosa (4 hours) up-modulated the expression of 16 genes, mainly chemokines (IL-8, Gro-\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3, GCP, IP-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, and the transcripts of ICAM-1, NFKB1, TLR-2, HBD-4 genes. Both miglustat and amitriptyline decreased the expression of almost all the up-regulated genes, indicating that these drugs are effective in reducing neutrophil chemotaxis, likely by decreasing ceramide expression dependent on P.aeruginosa, as we previously observed. The effect of miglustat was also studied in murine models of lung infection and inflammation in C57BL/6 mice challenged with intranasal instillation of LPS or with intratracheal inoculum of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1. Miglustat (100mg/Kg at 72, 48, 24 hr before LPS pro-inflammatory challenge or 400 mg/Kg 1 hr before PAO1 infection) significantly reduced the amount of neutrophils recruited in BALF and MPO activity in both LPS stimulated and PAO1 infected mice.

These responses serve to amplify the IL-8 response to HRV and could act as a potent trigger for neutrophilic inflammation in early life. Agents that enhance anti-viral innate immunity could be useful to slow the onset of structural lung disease. There is compelling evidence that TMEM16A (ANO1) functions as a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) . Recent studies suggest that TMEM16A is an important CaCC in airway epithelium. Here, we used pharmacological tools to investigate the contribution of TMEM16A to CaCC current in human airway and intestinal epithelial cells. A highthroughput screen of ~100,000 compounds revealed 6 chemical classes of TMEM16A inhibitors that fully blocked TMEM16A chloride current with IC50 < 10 \u00b5M. The inhibitors did not affect cytoplasmic calcium signaling, suggesting that they target TMEM16A directly. There were two distinct groups of inhibitors. Group A inhibitors fully inhibited CaCC current in multiple types of human epithelia, including primary bronchial cell cultures and T84 intestinal cells. Group B inhibitors poorly inhibited CaCC current in the same cell types, with maximum inhibition in the range 10-40 %. However, both group A and B inhibitors completely blocked CaCC current in salivary gland cells. Group A and B inhibitors strongly inhibited another TMEM16 isoform (TMEM16B) that has been associated with calcium-activated chloride channel activity. Together with knockdown and overexpression studies, these data show that TMEM16A carries most CaCC current in salivary gland epithelium, but is a minor contributor to CaCC current in airway and intestinal epithelium. The small-molecule modulators identified here permit pharmacological dissection of TMEM16A/CaCC function, and some are potential development candidates for drug therapy of hypertension, pain, diarrhea and excessive mucus production. This work was supported by the CFF and NIH. Objective: With the ability to inhibit protein expression, antisense oligonucleotides (AON) offer new perspectives for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). This disease is characterised by a defective chloride secretion mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and excessively increased Na + -absorption via the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na + channel (ENaC). It was shown in a mouse model, that Na + hyperabsorption by ENaC is sufficient to evoke typical symptoms of cystic fibrosis-like lung disease that is found in CF patients [1] . Therefore, by downregulation of the ENaC mediated Na + hyperabsorption in CF, AON could circumvent one of the basic problems of this severe disease. AON are short synthetic DNA molecules (15-18 bases) which are complementary to specific mRNA sequences and created in order to prevent the functional expression of the target protein. Thus, the objective of this investigation was to find effective AON against human ENaC with respect to improving therapy for CF patients. For that reason, we selected specific AON that efficiently suppress Na + hyperabsorption by inhibiting the expression of the \u03b1-ENaC subunit.",

However, with the exception of tannic acid, the remaining TMEM16A inhibitors showed partial or weak inhibition of native CaCC chloride current in T84 cells. Tannic acid was further studied because of its high inhibition potency and efficacy, and because tannic acid and related gallotannins are present in a number of widely consumed food products. IC50 of tannic acid inhibition of TMEM16A was 6 \u00b5M. Tannic acid inhibited CaCCs in multiple cell types, including primary bronchial cell cultures and T84 cells, and did not inhibit CFTR chloride conductance. Structure-activity analysis indicated the requirement of gallic or digallic acid substituents on a macromolecular scaffold (gallotannins), as are present in green tea and red wine. Other polyphenolic components of teas and wines, including epicatechin, catechin, and malvidin-3-glucoside, poorly inhibited CaCCs. Remarkably, a 1000-fold dilution of red wine and 100-fold dilution of green tea inhibited CaCCs by > 50% in T84 cells. Tannic acid, red wine and green tea inhibited arterial smooth muscle contraction and intestinal chloride secretion. Gallotannins are thus potent CaCC inhibitors whose biological activity provides a potential molecular basis for the cardio-protective and antidiarrheal benefits of red wine and green tea.",

From these data we conclude that the CFTR-mRNA transfection was successful in these cells. Since there is no risk of insertional mutagenesis and/or vector-induced immunogenicity, in vivo manipulation of cells with mRNA is considered to be a valuable and safe alternative and could be a novel tool to restore impaired CFTR function in CF. CFTR function is required for efficient airway epithelial cell migration and wound repair. Blocking channel activity or silencing expression by RNA interference produces a significant delay in wound healing by impeding lamellipodia protrusion and reducing the rate of cell migration into the wound. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms responsible for Cland HCO 3 dependence of migration mediated by putative functional interactions between CFTR and anion transporters in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells and Calu-3 cells. Cell migration and wound closure was continuously measured by time-lapse video imaging and cellsubstrate impedance sensing. HBE cells or Calu-3 cells were grown to confluence on impedance sensing chamber arrays, each containing a circular 250 \u00b5m diameter electrode. Wound repair was monitored by applying alternating current (1 \u00b5A, 15 kHz) and measuring increases in impedance as cells migrated onto the electrode surface. As wound closure proceeded and more cells covered the electrode, impedance increased until reaching a plateau when wound closure was complete. Replacement of extracellular Clwith methanesulfonate produced a significant (3 fold) delay in the time required for complete wound closure in HBE cells, similar to the effects of the CFTR blocker, CFTR inh -172 (20 \u00b5M) and the anion exchange inhibitor, DIDS (30 \u00b5M). However, no effect of CFTR inh -172 was detected in HBE cells in the absence of Cland no effect of DIDS occurred after CFTR inhibition. In contrast, Clreplacement did not significantly affect Calu-3 cell wound closure. Lowering extracellular ] from 26 to 5 mM (with continuous 5% CO 2 gassing) did not significantly affect intracellular pH as determined by single cell ratio imaging using the pH sensitive dye, BCECF. However, 5 mM extracellular HCO 3 produced a significant (2 fold) delay in the time required for complete wound closure of Calu-3 cells. Interestingly when CFTR inh -172 was added to Calu-3 cells bathed in 5 mM HCO 3 media, wound closure was completely inhibited. In contrast, 5 mM HCO 3 media produced a minor delay in HBE cell restitution. Analysis of anion transporter expression revealed that HBE and Calu-3 cells express relatively high levels of SLC26A6 and SLC4A2 anion exchange mRNAs whereas the electrogenic Na + -HCO 3 cotransporters (SLC4A4 and SLC4A5) exhibited significantly (64 and 8 fold respectively) higher levels of expression in Calu-3 compared to HBE cells. These findings indicate that HBE and Calu-3 cells exhibit distinct anion dependencies with respect to cell migration and wound closure and that CFTR interacts with different anion transporters in these airway epithelia to facilitate wound repair. In HBE cells the data suggest that CFTR collaborates with SLC26A6 and/or SLC4A2 anion exchangers to sustain HCO 3 efflux, providing a pathway for Clrecycling across the membrane. However, in Calu-3 cells wound closure is HCO 3 dependent but Clindependent, suggesting that CFTR functions in parallel with electrogenic Na + -HCO 3 - A method for measuring liquid absorption in the airways would be useful for screening new corrective therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF). We hypothesize that changes in liquid absorption rate in the airways can be measured in vivo using imaging methods after a radiolabeled surrogate (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, DTPA) is delivered by inhalation. The objective of these studies was to characterize the absorption rate of Technetium 99m labeled DTPA (Tc-DTPA) in CF and non-CF human bronchial epithelial cell cultures (HBEs) in order to determine whether DTPA absorption is driven by liquid absorption.",

Stimulation with the cAMP-elevating agonist vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 1\u00b5M) elicited serous cell shrinkage (16\u00b11%) that was indicative of the activation of Cl -/fluid secretion. VIP-evoked shrinkage was blocked by the CFTR inhibitor CFTR inh 172 but not by the Ca 2+ -activated Clchannel (CaCC) inhibitor niflumic acid (NFA). VIP-activated shrinkage was temporally correlated with a small increase in [Ca 2+ ] i (from 46\u00b13nM at rest to 129\u00b16nM peak). Both shrinkage and Ca 2+ responses were downstream of cAMP/PKA, as they were mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase-activating compound forskolin and inhibited by the PKA inhibitor H89. Similar small [Ca 2+ ] i elevations (130\u00b15nM) observed during stimulation with a low concentration (100nM) of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh; an IP 3 -generating cAMP-independent agonist) failed to activate shrinkage, suggesting these Ca 2+ signals are insufficient to activate secretion. Nonetheless, [Ca 2+ ] i elevation was required for VIP/cAMP-evoked secretion, as abolishing the Ca 2+ signal inhibited shrinkage. However, Ca 2+ was not required for CFTR activation; in SPQ-loaded serous cells, a NO 3 substitution protocol revealed that VIP activated a PKA-dependent, Ca 2+ -independent plasma membrane Clpermeability that was inhibited by CFTR inh 172. These data suggest that CFTR is the secretory Clchannel during cAMP-evoked Clsecretion, while [Ca 2+ ] i elevation is required for activation of K + channels mediating counter-ion current. We also observed important synergistic interactions between cAMP-and cholinergic stimulation in human serous cells. The success of airway gene transfer that can correct the bioelectrical defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) mice has not been studied in the same animals over long time periods. We have examined the sustainability of lentiviral (LV) CFTR gene transfer success via repeated nasal potential difference (PD) measures in individual CF mice over their lifetimes.",

Physiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA Serous acinar cells of submucosal glands are major sites of fluid secretion and CFTR expression in the lung. When stimulated with intracellular [cAMP] ([cAMP] i )-elevating agonists (VIP or forskolin), human and porcine serous cells exhibit cell shrinkage responses due to cellular KCl solute loss, reflective of the activation of fluid secretion. cAMP-evoked secretion requires Clefflux through CFTR and K + efflux through channels activated by PKA-dependent Ca 2+ signals. In contrast, murine nasal gland serous cells stimulated with 3\u00b5M VIP or 5\u00b5M forskolin exhibited neither shrinkage (secretion) nor Ca 2+ responses. Optical techniques were used to examine murine serous cells in more detail to determine if [cAMP] i -elevating agonists activate CFTR and whether or not CFTR plays a role in murine serous cell secretion. In Wt murine serous cells loaded with the Cl --sensitive fluorophore SPQ, NO 3 substitution revealed that stimulation with 1\u00b5M VIP or 3\u00b5M forskolin increased plasma membrane Clpermeability by >10-fold. This was blocked by the PKA-inhibitor H89 or the CFTR-inhibitor CFTR inh 172. Resting Clpermeability was identical in cells from Wt and cftr tm1Unc-/knockout (cftr -/-) mice, but, in contrast to Wt cells, cAMP stimulation did not increase Clpermeability in cftr -/cells. We hypothesized that, despite robust CFTR activation, murine serous cells secrete poorly during cAMP stimulation because absence of cAMP-evoked Ca 2+ signals results in responses, as VIP activated CFTR and CCh activated Ca 2+ -senstive K + channels. Stronger cAMP stimulation (1\u00b5M VIP, 3\u00b5M forskolin, or 100\u00b5M IBMX) markedly potentiated the 100nM CCh-evoked peak [Ca 2+ ] i responses (~350 nM), activating CaCC-dependent CFTR-independent secretion. Our data identify molecular mechanisms of human serous cell secretion and suggest that therapeutic targeting of crosstalk between cAMP and Ca 2+ signaling could allow restoration of secretion in CF serous cells. Goblet cell metaplasia and mucin hypersecretion leading to mucus accumulation and plaque formation are features of CF lung disease. Thus, identifying therapies to efficiently reduce mucus plaque production in the lung by controlling the secretion of mucins would be highly beneficial for CF patients. However, there is an incomplete understanding of the complex molecular machinery involved in mucin granule exocytosis. For example, the identity of the SNARE proteins that form the core of the exocytotic machine remain unidentified in airway goblet cells. We discovered that the vesicle SNARE VAMP-8 is expressed in lung tissues and airway epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that VAMP-8 was localized mainly in goblet cells of human lung tissues. Moreover, VAMP-8 was associated with mucin granules isolated from airway goblet cells, and redistributed into the cytoplasm upon agonist-stimulation of airway epithelial cell cultures. Importantly, silencing VAMP-8 mRNA expression by siRNA oligonucleotides drastically decreased basal and agonist-stimulated mucin secretion in airway epithelial cells. Thus, our data suggest that VAMP-8 is a major regulator of airway mucin granule exocytosis. Reduction of VAMP-8 activity / expression may provide a novel therapeutic target to ameliorate airway mucus obstruction in CF lung disease.",

Mucus obstruction of airways is one of the most vicious agents of morbidity and mortality in the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Over the past three decades, great emphasis has been placed on abnormal transport of Cland Na + ions in CF, but no clear link between these defects and mucus obstruction has been established in all affected tissues. However, CFTR mutations also disrupt the transport of another biologically vital ion, HCO 3 -. The role of HCO 3 - in CF pathogenesis has received little consideration compared to other electrolytes affected in this disease. We examined the HCO 3 conductance of the porcine native small airway tissue ex vivo with a micro-Ussing chamber that we developed to monitor electrolyte transport functions in bronchioles. By replacing 150 mM Clin the apical solution with 150 mM HCO 3 or 150 mM gluconate in the presence of amiloride and forskolin+IBMX to block ENaC and activate CFTR, we determined that the permeability to HCO 3 is about 1/5th as that of Clfrom changes in transepithelial potential (V t ) and conductance (G t ). Since 150 mM HCO 3 may not be physiological in the airway, we reduced the concentration of both HCO 3 and Clto 25 mM and repeated the substitutions. These maneuvers also resulted in changes in V t and G t that were qualitatively similar to those above. These results show that the native porcine small airway exhibits a significant HCO 3 conductance, although notably less than that of Clwhich is consistent with previous findings for CFTR. The imminent question that remains is whether secretory agonists can effect changes in this conductance and whether anion conductance inhibitors will effectively block it. Answers to these questions may help define the role of HCO 3 in abnormal mucus clearance in CF affected organs in general. Defective expression or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in airway epithelial cells results in abnormal regulation of Na + and Clmovement across epithelial cell surface leading to disruption of airway salt economy. The subsequent mucus plugging of the bronchial airways in CF may result in impaired ventilation/perfusion relationships and subsequent localized hypoxia/anoxia. We compared the ability of cell lines with defective CFTR and those with corrected CFTR to secrete certain cytokines (such as IL-8) under anoxic conditions. Two cell lines; IB3-1 (with F508del and W1282X mutations in the CFTR gene) and C38 (with corrected CFTR gene) were cultured in the presence or absence of oxygen in LHC-8 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C for 1 to 3 days. IL-8 concentration in the supernatant was determined by ELISA (Biosource). Cellular viability was assessed by two methods: LDH release (Promega) indicating cell membrane integrity and ATP activity in mitochondria (MTS, Promega) indicating cellular metabolic activity.",

Abdullah, L.H.; Davis, C. CF Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Our understanding of the regulation of mucin synthesis in the airways is essentially limited to an appreciation of mucin gene (MUC5AC, MUC5B) expression upon exposure of animal or culture models to inflammatory stimuli. Little is known about synthesis under control (i.e., \"healthy\") conditions, about the relationships between mucin gene transcription and translation, or about potential feedback mechanisms between mucin synthesis and secretory granule stores. We explored these relationships in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell cultures, using qRT-PCR to measure MUC5AC and MUC5B mRNA, and semi-quantitative Western blotting for the non-glycosylated (immature) mucin proteins, and the mature mucins. Goblet cells mount a full discharge of mucin secretory granules during a prolonged exposure to purinergic agonist [Kemp, et al., 2004. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 31:446-55] , a feature we used to deplete mucin stores fully at the beginning of an experiment. HBE cultures were exposed for 45 min to 100 \u00b5M ATP\u03b3S, washed, then extracted as a function of time into 8 M guanidine hydrochloride or RLT buffer (Qiagen) to solubilize mucins and mRNAs, respectively. Mature MUC5B, measured using antibodies to the Cys-rich domains in the tandem repeat, remained at their post secretion lows for 2-4 hrs, then increased such that the stores were approximately half restored at 12 hrs and fully so at 24 hrs. Immature MUC5B was measured with an antibody to a peptide sequence in the glycosylated repeat domain; because positive signals are obtained exclusively from mucins in the ER, the antibody offers a measure of mucin peptide synthesis. This signal was elevated over baseline at 2 hrs, it peaked between 8-16 hrs, and then it declined over the next 24+ hrs. MUC5B mRNA, interestingly, was elevated less than 2-fold over baseline at a single time point, 4 hrs post-secretion; by 8 hrs the levels had",

            "text": "Conclusions: These preliminary in vitro cell culture model systems suggest that TGF-\u03b21 activity is increased in CF by at least two CF-specific mechanisms: 1) stimulation with cytokines elevated in the CF airway and 2) aberrant CF epithelial:fibroblast interaction. As increased TGF-\u03b21 activity is pathogenic in multiple non-CF lung diseases, these findings offer insight into the mechanisms through which TGF-\u03b21 may modify CF lung disease severity and importantly introduce CF-specific model systems through which potential therapeutic interventions can be trialed to inhibit TGF-\u03b21 activity in CF. The use of osmotically active solutions such as hypertonic saline for rehydration of fluid-depleted (FD) airways has been employed clinically in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with a resultant improvement in lung function. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism by which osmotically active solutions exert a beneficial clinical effect in CF. The frog palate model of airway mucociliary clearance was used in this study for its versatility and resilience to be studied by multiple methodologies over a sustained period of time during a single experiment, including the ease of measurement mucus clearance time, easy access and large ciliated flat surface for high speed video, abundance of mucus and for its anatomical similarity to returned to baseline. That is, MUC5B transcription peaked as translation was increasing, and mucin peptide synthesis then continued to increase, but at basal levels of mRNA. To test whether elevated MUC5B transcription was essential for increased translation, we treated HBE cultures, post-secretion, with actinomycin D and found that mucin peptide synthesis at 8 hrs was unchanged from control. As expected, inhibiting translation with cycloheximide abolished mucin peptide synthesis. Hence, restoration of mucin stores following a full, agonist-induced discharge does not appear to depend on the synthesis of new mRNA. Rather, the regulation of mucin synthesis is posttranscriptional, with translation being modulated on stable, basal levels of mRNA. In control experiments, treating HBE cells with a supernatant of mucopurulent material harvested from lungs of CF patients removed at transplant caused massive, multi-fold changes in both mucin transcription and translation. Consequently, there appears to be at least two levels of control exercised over goblet cell mucin synthesis, one that operates independently of elevations in transcription levels under \"healthy\" conditions, and one triggered during inflammation that is highly dependent on elevated gene transcription.",

Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom; 3. Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom Several studies using a variety of in vitro models indicate that sex hormones such as oestrogen can alter ion transport across epithelial cells by either directly affecting CFTR or altering the activity of alternative chloride channels; such effects may in part explain the gender-difference in disease severity observed in some studies. However, published data are inconsistent with several studies postulating beneficial and others detrimental effects of oestrogen on CF ion transport abnormalities and, therefore, disease severity. A large proportion of women with CF regularly use oral contraceptives (OC), but the effect of OC use on disease severity has not been systematically studied. Here, we assessed the effects of OC use on clinical outcomes in a retrospective study of patient data from the Dendrite Database at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK. The data include annual follow-up information from 681 women born between 1937 to 1992 of whom 42% have taken OC albeit for varying periods of time. Data regarding OC use is currently available from 1981 to 2010. We first performed an inter-patient analysis comparing average yearly changes in %FEV 1 and body mass index (BMI) and total days of intravenous (IV) antibiotic use over a five year period between matched cohorts of OC users (n=57), (median age at start of study period in years: 23 (16-45), median %FEV 1 at start of study period: 56. 2 (20.4-111.1) ), and OC non-users (n=57) (median age at start of study period in years: 22 (17-44), median %FEV 1 at start of study period: 48.4 (12.8 -119.6)). We found no differences between the two groups (median change in %FEV 1 : users: -1.87 (-11.5 to 10.4) , non-users: -1.03 (-11.8 to 17.9) ; median change in BMI: users: 0.051 (-1.1 to 1.6), non-users: -0.065 (-1.5 to 3.3) ; median total days on antibiotics: users: 49 (0 to 308), nonusers: 42 (0 to 378)). We next performed an intra-patient analysis of the same outcomes over a three year period on and a three year period off OC in the same patient (n=23 -27), but again did not detect any differences in any of the clinical outcomes studied. In conclusion, OC use in CF females did not affect %FEV 1 , BMI or intravenous antibiotic usage in this retrospective study; our findings suggest that there is no evidence of a clinically significant effect on CF outcomes. Paisley, D.; Czarnecki, S.; Coote, K.; Danahay, H. NIBR, Novartis, Horsham, United Kingdom The clinical methodology for evaluating nasal transepithelial potential difference (NPD) has been successfully adapted in a number of studies for use in the mouse. In addition to its use in evaluating the ion transport phenotype of both wild-type and CFTR knockout animals, this model has proven valuable in evaluating the ability of compounds to restore normal ion transport in CFTR knockout mice (e.g., Grubb et al., Am J Physiol. 266: C1478-83 (1994 ). Furthermore, UTP-mediated changes in NPD have also been demonstrated, most likely as a result of activation of calcium activated chloride channels (CaCC) (Ghosal et al., Eur Respir J. 15: 146-150 (2000) ).",

Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Changes in intracellular Ca 2+ are fundamentally important for innate lung defense. For example, Ca 2+ regulates chloride secretion, ciliary beating, and mucin release. Recently, stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) has been identified as a Ca 2+ sensor which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER). Upon ER Ca 2+ depletion, which occurs following UTP stimulation, STIM1 aggregates and moves via microtubules to the plasma membrane (PM)-ER junction to activate Ca 2+ entry. This paradigm has been well established in cell lines, such as HEK293 cells. However, since little is tion of XBP-1 during HBE inflammation expands the Golgi and mitochondrial compartments. Because XBP-1 activation is increased in freshly isolated and inflamed CF HBE, these responses are likely relevant for CF airways disease. We are currently addressing the functional consequences of XBP-1induced Golgi and mitochondrial expansion on HBE inflammatory responses, e.g., production of oxygen radicals. These studies may lead to new therapies for CF patients by targeting the XBP-1 pathway. CFF funded. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteria which commonly infect lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, secrete N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-S-homoserine lactone (3O-C12) to regulate bacterial gene expression. 3O-C12 also affects functions of eukaryotic cells. Transepithelial electrophysiology in Ussing chambers showed that 10-100 \u00b5M 3O-C12 increased Clsecretion (I Cl ) in CFTR-expressing airway epithelial cell lines, but not in CF cells. Bright field observations of \"bubble\" formation in oil-covered pig tracheas showed that 3O-C12 also increased fluid secretion by submucosal glands in non-CF pig tracheas. Fura-2 imaging showed that 3O-C12 increased cytosolic [Ca 2+ ], Ca cyto , similarly in Ca 2+ -containing and Ca 2+ -free solutions, indicating that Ca 2+ was being released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). FRET imaging of ER-targeted cameleon D1-transfected cells confirmed that 3O-C12 reduced [Ca 2+ ] in the ER (Ca er ). The Ca-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin (tg) also increased I Cl and Ca cyto and decreased Ca er ; 3O-C12 had no effect in cells treated with tg. Patch clamp measurements on isolated nuclei from DT40 cells showed that 3O-C12 also activated IP 3 R1. TIRF imaging showed that 3O-C12 and tg both caused STIM1, a Ca-dependent ER protein that regulates plasma membrane Ca 2+ and cAMP signaling, to migrate to the plasma membrane, indicating STIM1 had become activated. FRET imaging of Epac H30-transfected cells showed that 3O-C12 increased cytosolic [cAMP] (cAMP cyto ). 3O-C12-stimulated I Cl was inhibited by a cAMP antagonist and increased by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The high Kd Ca 2+ chelator TPEN, which lowers Ca er without increasing Ca cyto in other cells, increased cAMP cyto and I Cl similar to 3O-C12. It is concluded that 3O-C12 stimulates CFTR-dependent Cland fluid secretion in airway epithelial cells by directly activating IP 3 R, lowering Ca er and activating STIM1 and storeoperated cAMP production. In CF airways, 3O-C12 (and other Ca-raising agonists) will alter Ca and cAMP signaling but will not increase Cland fluid secretion. An implication of these studies is that PKA-dependent activation of CFTR in airway epithelia may occur in response to agonists (e.g., VIP) that activate cAMP directly and also in response to Ca cyto -raising agonists (e.g., ATP and 3O-C12) that activate cAMP indirectly through the store-operated cAMP mechanism.

            "text": "known about STIM1 translocation in native tissues, we tested the hypothesis that STIM1 movement is an important step in Ca 2+ influx in polarized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). STIM1 knock down had no effect on ER-Ca 2+ release while Ca 2+ influx was abolished, demonstrating that STIM1 is required for Ca 2+ influx in HBECs. Next, we infected HBECs with a retrovirus containing STIM1-YFP, a construct that has previously been shown to regulate Ca 2+ entry in HEK293 cells, and cultured them on Transwell permeable supports for 4 weeks to induce polarization. Through qPCR we found that STIM1 expression levels in STIM1-YFP infected HBECs increased 3-fold, over mock infected cultures, which coincided with an increase in the Fura-2 emission ratio following UTP stimulation. These data imply that STIM1-YFP plays a role in airway Ca 2+ metabolism and that higher expression levels result in a larger influx of Ca 2+ . Using XZ and XY scanning confocal microscopy, we found that STIM1-YFP was distributed throughout the cell under basal conditions. Upon stimulation with 100 \u00b5M UTP, we observed no change in localization of STIM1-YFP. Inflammation of human bronchial epithelia (HBE) triggers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced expansion of ER/calcium stores, a process responsible for amplification of calcium-dependent inflammatory responses and mediated by activation of X-box binding protein-1 (XBP-1). To date, it is not known whether XBP-1 also expands the Golgi and mitochondrial compartments during HBE inflammation. An expanded Golgi might contribute to the increased production of inflammatory factors and mucins by facilitating their glycosylation. Together with expanded ER/calcium stores, mitochondrial expansion might be relevant to oxidative stress responses of CF airways, since mitochondria uptake calcium released from ER stores, which stimulates mitochondrial production of oxygen radicals in HBE. We tested the hypothesis that HBE inflammation-induced XBP-1 activation promotes Golgi and mitochondrial expansion. We first evaluated whether mucosal exposure of primary cultures of HBE to supernatant from mucopurulent material (SMM) from CF airways, a condition that activates XBP-1, up-regulated the mRNA expression of Golgi and mitochondrial markers. SMM increased the mRNA expression of several markers of these compartments by 1.4-4.3 fold at 6 hr, whereas at 24 hr their mRNA expression was maintained or decreased (n=4). To test whether these responses were coupled to XBP-1-induced Golgi and mitochondrial expansion, 16HBE14ocell lines stably expressing control vector, the active form of XBP-1 (spliced XBP-1) or a dominant negative XBP-1 (DN-XBP-1) were studied following 48 hr PBS or SMM exposure. The Golgi and mitochondria were stained with antibodies to p230 trans-Golgi and cytochrome oxidase and their expression studied by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Data are expressed as mean fluorescence intensity + SEM, n=6-13 culture sections from 2 experiments. In PBS-exposed cultures, p230 fluorescence was slightly increased by expression of spliced XBP-1 and not affected by the DN-XBP-1 ( Table 1) . Expression of spliced XBP-1 or DN-XBP-1 potentiated or blunted SMM-up-regulated p230 fluorescence (Table 1) . Cytochrome oxidase fluorescence was similar in PBS-exposed cultures expressing spliced XBP-1 vs. control cultures, but decreased in DN-XBP-1-expressing cultures (Table 1) . SMM up-regulated cytochrome oxidase fluorescence in control cultures, and this response was increased or blunted in cultures expressing spliced XBP-1 or DN-XBP-1 ( Airway surface dehydration and mucus accumulation are found in cystic fibrosis (CF); however, the complex relationship between defective ion transport and changes in mucus rheology is not well understood. It is thought that the airway surface is covered by an airway surface liquid (ASL), comprising a mucus layer (ML) and a periciliary fluid layer (PCL), overlying motile and sensory cilia at the apical membrane of epithelial cells. In CF, increased viscosity of the ML has been postulated to be an important factor in the impaired clearance of pathogenic bacteria and reduced function of innate immune mediators. The PCL is dehydrated in CF, but its viscosity is thought to be low. In order to study the determinants of ASL microviscosity in the ML and PCL separately, we measured the diffusion of fluorescently labeled macromolecules as a function of distance from the epithelial cell surface. Studies were performed by laser scanning confocal microscopy in primary cultures of human CF and non-CF bronchial epithelial cells that were grown for 21 days at an air-liquid interface. Experiments were made under steady-state conditions in unperturbed cell cultures, without prior washing, but covered by perfluorocarbon for use of a high-numerical aperture immersion objective. Diffusion of FITC-dextrans of different molecular sizes (10-2000 kDa) was studied by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, in which time-resolved confocal imaging was performed at different depths in the fluorescently stained PCL (5 \u00b5m above the epithelial cell surface, confirmed by the presence of cilia in xy-scans) and ML (10 \u00b5m above the epithelial cell surface, no cilia observed). Relative diffusion of FITC-dextran in the ASL was size-dependent and slower in CF vs. non-CF cell cultures. In the PCL the relative diffusion coefficients (compared to FITC-dextran diffusion in saline) were D/Do = 0.54 (CF) vs. ~1 (non-CF) for 10 kDa FITC-dextran, and D/Do = 0.43 (CF) vs. 0.68 (non-CF) for 2000 kDa FITC-dextran. In the ML of CF cells, diffusion was further reduced, with D/Do = 0.4 for 10 kDa FITC-dextran and D/Do = 0.35 for 2000 kDa FITC-dextran. However, in non-CF cells diffusion in the ML was similar to that in the PCL. Studies of effects of CFTR and ENaC modulators are underway, as are measurements in ex vivo fragments of intact trachea. These first data on ASL microviscosity in human airway cultures provide evidence for CF-related increased viscosity of both the PCL and ML, and indicate solute size-dependent diffusion in the ASL of CF airways. This work was supported by the CFF, NIH and CFRI. Defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), including the \u2206F508 mutation that impairs CFTR trafficking, are associated with increased activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). This is hypothesized to result in airway surface liquid depletion, decreased mucociliary clearance, and increased bacterial colonization of the airway seen in CF patients. Restoration of proper airway surface liquid in the CF airway will likely require correction of both CFTR function and decreased ENaC activity. Evidence suggests that CFTR and ENaC trafficking involve similar mechanisms (Wagner, Ott et al. 2001; Lang, Henke et al. 2003; Dieter, Palmada et al. 2004; Sato, Chapline et al. 2007 ), leading us to examine mechanisms of CFTR trafficking control in understanding ENaC trafficking regulation. In particular, we are interested in the influence of \u2206F508-CFTR correctors on ENaC trafficking and functional expression. We hypothesize that ENaC trafficking can be regulated by the molecular chaperone proteins Hsp70 and Hsc70, which have altered expression in response to the prototype corrector, 4-phenylbutyrate, in a manner similar to their proposed regulation of \u2206F508-CFTR (Rubenstein and Zeitlin 2000; Choo-Kang and Zeitlin 2001).",

            "text": "We performed Ussing chamber assays to examine the effect of Hsc70 and Hsp70 on amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (Isc), as a readout of ENaC functional expression. Consistent with our previous work in Xenopus oocytes (Goldfarb, Kashlan et al. 2006) , our preliminary data in MDCK epithelial cells show an inhibition of ENaC functional and apical surface expression when Hsc70 is overexpressed by ~20%. This appears to result from more rapid removal of functional ENaC from the plasma membrane. In contrast, 1.8-fold overexpression of Hsp70, a chaperone protein closely related (85% identical) to Hsc70, has the opposite effect and enhances the functional activity and surface expression of ENaC. Hsp70 does not alter the rate of ENaC's retrieval from the apical membrane, suggesting that it acts to stimulate ENaC delivery to the apical membrane. Our data support the hypothesis that Hsc70 and Hsp70 have opposing effects on ENaC trafficking and functional expression in epithelial cells via actions at distinct sites along ENaC intracellular itinerary. This research is supported by grants from R01 DK-58046 to RCR and T32 DK-07748 to RAC. Large conductance, Ca +2 activated and voltage-dependent K + (BK) channels control a variety of physiological processes in different tissues. BK is encoded by a single gene (KCNMA1), but alternative splicing, regulatory beta-subunits, and post translational modifications contribute to diverse activity and function of BK. Ion transport regulation in lung epithelium contributes to the adequate water balance needed to preserve mucociliary transport. Although other K + channels are recognized as modulators of ion transport in response to nucleotides, the involvement of BK in this process has not been described. Since BK channels are sensitive to intracellular Ca +2 , we hypothesized that these channels may be involved in ion transport changes in response to ATP stimulation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NBE), a process at least partially mediated by Ca +2 . BK channels expression and function were studied by electrophysiology and confocal microscopy in NBE cells. K + currents were elicited upon depolarization using patch-clamp in cell-attached and inside-out configurations. A typical BK single conductance (290 pS) was detected in trypsinized NBE cells at intracellular Ca +2 concentration of 100 \u00b5M. Fifty percent of the macroscopic current was blocked by paxilline (40 nM) added to the apical side of NBE cells. Confocal microscopy showed immuno-reactive apical BK channels co-localizing with acetylated tubulin in the base of cilia. In Ussing chamber experiments conducted in the presence of a basolateral/apical K + gradient, basolaterally permeabilized cells respond to 10 \u00b5M apical ATP with a change in short circuit current (Isc) of 41.97 \u00b1 5.165 \u00b5A (n=6). Apical paxilline blocked the Isc change in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.9431, logIC50=1.496 \u00b1 0.0648) with 31.37 nM paxilline causing half maximal inhibition. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knock down of KCNMA1 was accomplished by infection of NBE cells with lentiviruses (pLKO.1) encoding puromycin resistance and shRNA targeting KCNMA1 (NM_001014797 and NM_002247, TRC clone Id TRCN0000000212) or non targeting shRNA (SHC002). Infected NBE cells were selected with puromycin and grown until differentiation (~20 days). Relative mRNA expression was measured by qPCR with GAPDH as the gene of reference and was normalized to the average mRNA level in untreated cells. Knock down of KCNMA1 mRNA expression to 39 \u00b1 8.1% of control caused a decrease of the ATP-induced Isc change (19.0 \u00b1 1.482, n=4); in contrast, no significant reduction was recorded in cells infected with non-targeting lentiviruses (49.5 \u00b1 8.383, n=4) or untreated (56.1 \u00b1 7.130, n=5) controls. Finally, after four days without washing of the apical surface, knocked down cultures were dryer than control and non-target cells. We conclude that BK channels are present in the apical membrane of NBE cells and contribute to ion transport in response to ATP, by transporting K + to the apical compartment. Therefore, BK channels play an important role in airway water regulation. Decrease of KCNMA1 activity might be especially relevant for cystic fibrosis where water balance is already dysfunctional due to defective CFTR.",

These data demonstrate that overexpression of \u03b2arr2 in normal epithelial cells results in CF-like intracellular cholesterol accumulation. In order to elucidate the full effect of \u03b2arr2 on CF-like cholesterol accumulation, 9HTEo-cells and two different CF model cells, pCEPR and IB3, were transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged \u03b2arr2 shRNA construct to effectively knock down \u03b2arr2 expression. Both the pCEPR and IB3 cells transfected with \u03b2arr2-GFP shRNA show an alleviation of the intracellular cholesterol accumulation which is similar to that seen in wildtype cells. To further analyze the role of \u03b2arr2 in cholesterol processing, total cellular cholesterol was measured. \u03b2arr2-overexpressing cells show nearly 2-fold increase in total cholesterol compared to their respective controls (p < 0.05). Since \u03b2arr2 has been shown to bind to the Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA) and facilitate endocytosis of the pump, and also that knockdown of the sodium pump is implicated in the development of perinuclear cholesterol accumulation, we studied the effect of \u03b2arr2 overexpression on the NKA. \u03b2arr2-overexpressing cells show a 6-fold increase in NKA compared to controls (p < 0.05) and an increase in its internalization as determined by immunostaining. These data suggest an involvement of NKA in \u03b2arr2-mediated cholesterol regulation; this relationship is currently being explored. We previously have shown that two signaling proteins, NOS2 and RhoA, exhibit CFrelated expression differences that are downstream consequences of cholesterol changes in CF. To directly test the impact of \u03b2arr2 on CF phenotypes, Cftr/\u03b2arr2 double knockout mice were developed. Nasal epithelium was excised from wt mice (Cftr +/+; \u03b2arr2 +/+), CF mice (Cftr -/-; \u03b2arr2 +/+), and DKO mice (Cftr -/-; \u03b2arr2 -/-),and analyzed for NOS2 and RhoA expression. The DKO mice showed nearly 80% recovery of NOS2 and 50% decrease in RhoA compared to CF mice suggesting a significant role of \u03b2arr2 in regulating the secondary manifestations of lost CFTR function; studies are on-going. In conclusion, these data implicate a regulatory role of \u03b2arr2 on cholesterol processing and the development of the cholesterol phenotype in CF. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is an emerging CF complication, diagnosed in 20 to 40% of CF adults, and associated with both decreased lung function as well as a 6-fold increase in morbidity and mortality. We then hypothesized that CFRD-associated hyperglycemia contributes to epithelial cell dysfunction. In particular, we postulated that hyperglycemia could worsen the airway ion transport dysregulation, leading to abnormal airway surface liquid volume and mucociliary clearance. To test this assumption, we then investigated the impact of hyperglycemia on ion transport through differentiated bronchial epithelial cell monolayers.",

Interestingly, we observed that treatment with 25mM glucose reduced by \u224850% the I Fk (4.2 vs 2.3 \u00b5A/cm2, in mannitol and glucose treated monolayers, respectively). To determine if this decrease could be due to a direct down-regulation of CFTR channel activity, the basolateral membrane of wt-CFBE monolayers was permeabilized with amphotericin B (7.5 \u00b5M) and a basolateral-to-apical Clgradient was established. In these conditions, high glucose failed to inhibit the I Fk . Furthermore, CFTR expres- We have previously demonstrated that cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) exhibits increased phosphorylation and activation in cystic fibrosis (CF) cells and tissues. This finding was consistent with our hypothesis that increased cAMP signaling in CF cells leads to a number of CFrelated phenotypes including intracellular cholesterol accumulation. We demonstrated that inhibition of cAMP signaling with Rp-cAMPS in CF cells results in the reversal of the cholesterol phenotype supporting this general hypothesis. However, when examining the effect of Rp-cAMPS treatment on CREB regulation, it was observed that PKA inhibition had no impact in CF samples. We believe that the regulation of CREB is key to a number of cell regulatory cascades that contribute to cellular events that characterize CF including inflammation and redox regulation. Therefore, the goal of this study is to determine how the CREB pathway is regulated in the absence of CFTR function. The hypothesis of the study is that increased expression of the protein beta-arrestin-2 (barr2) leads to CREB activation in CF cells through a PKA-independent mechanism. Arrestins are multifunctional proteins that influence several cell regulatory pathways. The function initially identified was as regulators of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) in concert with G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Arrestins and GRKs act as silencers of a variety of GPCRs such as \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AR). To begin testing this hypothesis, barr2-GFP expressing 9/HTEo-cells (barr2-GFP) were examined for pCREB content compared to GFP expressing control cells. Expression of pCREB normalized to total CREB (tCREB) content in barr2-GFP cells was 2.3 +/-0.3 fold increased compared to controls (n=9, p < 0.05), similar to what we observed in multiple CF models. Based on these data, a candidate pathway by which barr2 could regulate CREB activation would be the Src/ERK cascade. Both Src and ERK exhibit increased activation in barr2-GFP cells compared to GFP cell controls as determined by Western blot. The ability of Src inhibitor (PP2) and two MEK/ERK inhibitors (PD98059 and UO126) to inhibit cAMP response element (CRE)-luciferase activation was examined in barr2-GFP and CF model cells. In both cell models, Src and ERK inhibition significantly diminished CRE activation. To test directly the impact of barr2 on CREB activation in CF, Cftr/barr2 double knock-out mice were developed and analyzed for pCREB expression. Nasal epithelium was excised from wt mice (Cftr +/+;barr2 +/+), CF mice (Cftr -/-; barr2 +/+), and DKO mice (Cftr -/-;barr2 -/-). Ratios of pCREB/tCREB are reduced 75% in DKO mice compared to CF mice (n=4, p < 0.001). These data demonstrate directly that barr2 expression in CF is impacting the CREB signaling pathway. Other evidence suggests that predicted CREB signaling consequences are also reverted towards wt levels, although this work is ongoing. It is concluded from this study that CREB regulation in CF is mediated directly through barr2 expression via the Src/ERK pathway.",

These alterations include intracellular cholesterol accumulation, increased membrane cholesterol content, and increased cholesterol synthesis. How these aberrations relate directly to CFTR function is not known. Previously we demonstrated that CF cells exhibit at least a 2fold increase in beta-arrestin-2 (\u03b2arr2) expression compared to non-CF controls. The hypothesis of this study is that a cellular feedback response to lost CFTR function leads to increased \u03b2arr2 expression and that \u03b2arr2 mediates cholesterol phenotypes associated with CF. To examine this, 9HTEo-cells were stably transfected with the control and \u03b2arr2-overexpressing pEGFP-N1 constructs, which express GFP or \u03b2arr2-tagged GFP (\u03b2arr2-GFP), respectively.

Cystic Fibrosis Center, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Pharmacology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 3. Cell Biology, Emory, Atlanta, GA, USA Ano1, also known as TMEM16A, has recently been identified as the Ca 2+ activated Clchannel that is the apical membrane conduit for Clsecretion in CF airway epithelia. Since little is known about this protein, we used fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) to test the hypothesis that Ano1 exists as a multimer in the plasma membrane. We C-terminally labeled Ano1 with either eGFP (FRET donor) or mCherry (FRET acceptor) and these constructs both displayed identical I-V relations and sensitivity to Ca 2+ as untagged Ano1 when expressed in HEK cells, suggesting that appending a fluorescent protein to the C-terminus did not affect Ano1 function. We then measured the % FRET by the acceptor photobleaching method using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. When coexpressed in either primary human bronchial or HEK293 cells, Ano1-eGFP and Ano1-mCherry were clearly visible in the plasma membrane and underwent 8% FRET (n= 22 and 56 respectively). In contrast, Ano1-mCherry did not FRET with eGFP alone (n=19) and underwent a small, but significant amount of FRET with either A2BR-eGFP or with CFTR-eGFP of ~1.5% (both n=20; p<0.05). This FRET was significantly less than the 8% FRET seen between Ano1 constructs. Biochemical analysis revealed that Ano1-mCherry coimmunoprecipitated with Ano1-eGFP but did not co-immunoprecipitate with either eGFP alone or with A2BR-eGFP, suggesting that the Ano1-Ano1 FRET represents a specific physical interaction. The Ano1-Ano1 FRET was also ~8% when measured in intracellular compartments (n=36) and was not altered by addition of thapsigargin (n=27), which elevates intracellular Ca 2+ , suggesting that Ano1 association occurs early in the biosynthetic process and remains constant during channel activation. Furthermore, application of cytochalasin D, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, also failed to alter Ano1-Ano1 FRET (n=35). Since the Ano1 FRET was specific and constant, we used FRET to gain more detailed information about Ano1 stoichiometry. To this end, we varied the ratio of donor/acceptor cDNA expressed, whilst keeping the total amount of cDNA constant at 2 \u00b5g/ml and measured the resultant changes in FRET. There was a ratio-dependent increase in FRET which asymptoted at 8%. When both donor and acceptor molecules are present at equal concentrations, there is a finite probability that (i) all donors, (ii) all acceptors, or (iii) a mix of the two will combine. Thus, a mathematical model that describes the probability that an eGFP (donor) subunit is contained in a multimer with none, one, two or three mCherry (acceptors) can be compared to the actual FRET data. Based on this probability model, the shape of the curve is influenced by the number of subunits in the complex and can be used to determine the stoichiometry. Using this approach, we found that our data was best fit by the trimer probability model. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Ano1 undergoes FRET in the plasma membrane of airway epithelial and HEK cells and most likely exists as a homotrimer. Whether or not these subunits interact and bind with other proteins remains to be determined.",

The thin layer of liquid at the surface of airway epithelium, the airway surface liquid (ASL), is important in normal airway physiology and in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. The ASL is thought to consist of a mucus layer overlying a periciliary fluid layer. At present, the best method to measure ASL depth involves scanning confocal microscopy after staining with an aqueous-phase fluorescent dye. We designed and validated a simple, noninvasive imaging method to measure ASL depth by reflectance imaging of an epithelial mucosa in which the surface is illuminated at a 45-60 degree angle by an elongated 13-\u00b5m wide rectangular beam produced by a 670 nm diode micro-focus laser. The principle of the surface laser reflectance microscopy (SLRM) method is that air-liquid, liquid-liquid and liquid-cell interfaces produce distinct specular or diffuse reflections that can be imaged to give a micron-resolution replica of the mucosal surface. SLRM was validated using fluid layers of specified thicknesses, and in cell cultures by agreement with measurements using z-scanning confocal microscopy. The SLRM method was applied to measure ASL thickness in native, unperturbed cell cultures and in ex vivo fragments of pig trachea. ASL thickness was initially measured in well-differentiated bronchial cell cultures after washing, addition of a small volume of fluid, and waiting 6-12 h to reach a steadystate ASL thickness. SLRM showed an ASL thickness of 8.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m, which agreed with confocal microscopy and many prior measurements of similarly prepared cultures. In contrast, SLRM in native, unperturbed cell cultures gave a wide range of ASL thicknesses (7-20 \u00b5m, average 11 \u00b1 3 \u00b5m), which is likely due to a heterogeneous mucus layer. ASL measurements were also done in ex vivo fragments of pig trachea, giving an average ASL depth of 10 \u00b1 3 \u00b5m. SLRM was adapted to measure transepithelial fluid transport from the dynamics of fluid layer thickness. Human bronchial epithelial cell cultures absorbed fluid over 4-6 hrs, which was inhibited by amiloride. SLRM measurements in pig trachea showed rapid apical fluid secretion (0.15 \u00b5L/min/cm 2 ) after stimulation by forskolin, IBMX and carbachol. The SLRM method was also adapted to measure transepithelial osmotic water permeability. Using mannitol (300 mM) in the basolateral perfusate, the transepithelial osmotic water permeability coefficient (P f ) in bronchial epithelial cells was P f = 48 \u00b1 7 \u00b5m/s, which was not significantly different when the osmotic gradient was reversed (apical mannitol), P f = 42 \u00b1 8 \u00b5m/s. Compared with confocal microscopy, ASL thickness measurement by SLRM does not require dye staining or costly instrumentation, and can potentially be adapted for in vivo measurements using fiberoptics.",

In the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, hyperactivity of ENaC is hypothesized to cause impaired mucociliary clearance and portend bacterial colonization of the airway. In our group, the studies of correction of \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking by 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) led us to identify a novel 29 kDa molecular chaperone, ERp29, that was present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that had in CF epithelial cells increased abundance after treatment with 4-Phenylbutyrate. We tested the hypothesis that ERp29 would regulate intracellular trafficking of \u2206F508-CFTR in CF epithelial cells and wt-CFTR in human colon adenocarcinoma T84 cells. ERp29 is homologous to thioredoxin/PDI proteins, which are enzymes that catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bridges. However, ERp29 has a single cysteine residue and lacks the cysteine sequence motif (C-X-X-C) that is characteristic of thioredoxins. In order to test how this motif influenced ERp29 function, our group constructed a plantation. Our results revealed that CF bronchial monolayers repaired slower (55%) than non-CF. We then decided to define the role of CFTR channel in that phenomenon, by testing the impact of CFTR down-regulation in non-CF cells, and conversely, by exploring a possible beneficial effect of CFTR correction in CF cells. Therefore, we showed that CFTR silencing in non-CF bronchial cells, with CFTR-siRNAs, partially inhibited wound healing after injury. In addition, we made an interesting observation: wound repair in IB3 CF bronchial cells corrected with wt-CFTR (S9 cells) was enhanced by 127 % when compared to non-corrected IB3 (CF) cells. Similarly, wound healing in CFBE cells over-expressing wt-CFTR (wt-CFBE) was enhanced by 148 % when compared to CFBE cells over-expressing \u2206F508-CFTR (\u2206F508-CFBE). Furthermore, we noted that CFTR correction was accompanied with an increase in K + currents in wt-CFBE monolayers. More precisely, short-circuit current measurements were performed in Ussing chamber on apical membrane permeabilized CFBE monolayers, in the presence of an apical-to-basolateral K + gradient. Our results revealed that the basolateral clofilium-(KvLQT1) and glibenclamide-sensitive (K ATP ) currents as well as the 1-EBIO-activated (KCa3.1) current were 3-7 fold higher in wt-CFBE than in \u2206F508-CFBE monolayers.",

Little is known about the effects of hypertonic solutions on cilia beating in human airway epithelial cells at deposition rates consistent with inhalation nebulizers (i.e., in the range of nanoliters/min/cm 2 ). In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of nebulized HS on CBF in airway epithelial cells.",

            "text": "Hypertonic saline is a clinically proven therapy that can improve MCC in CF patients, purportedly by drawing water onto the airway surface. However, topical hypertonic saline has been shown to decrease CBF in human nasopharynx. We sought to determine the effect of nebulized HS on cilia mutant where this strictly conserved cysteine was mutated (C157S). Transfection of ERp29 C157S significantly decreased CFTR whole cell and surface expression in T-84 cells. These data suggest that C157 plays a critical role in ERp29's regulation of CFTR trafficking. Based on the similar trafficking pathway between CFTR and ENaC, we hypothesized that ERp 29 would promote ENaC functional expression, and that ERp29 C157S would inhibit ENaC trafficking. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, co-injection of ERp29 RNA with \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC RNA caused a ~2-fold increase in amiloride-sensitive whole oocyte current compared with oocytes injected with \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-ENaC RNA alone, suggesting that ERp29 can regulate ENaC functional expression. We then completed a selection of ENaC-overexpressing MDCK cell lines with tetracycline-inducible expression of wt or C157S ERp29 as an epithelial cell based model. Both wt and C157S ERp29 expression increased with increasing doxycycline concentrations (0, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.05 \u00b5g/ml). We established conditions by which these cells form high resistance polarized monolayers when grown on permeable supports that will allow assessment of ENaC function in Ussing chambers. Preliminary data suggest that full length (uncleaved subunit) \u03b3-ENaC whole cell expression increased with increased ERp29 C157S expression (0.05 \u00b5g/ml). Interestingly, this increased C157S ERp29 expression was associated with decreased amiloride sensitive current in Ussing chamber experiments. These data support the hypothesis that ERp29 can regulate ENaC functional expression by regulating both trafficking or subunit proteolysis, and that the C157 may be a critical residue in this regulation.",

            "text": "This study was supported by grants from R01 DK58046 and R01 DK73185 to RCR. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by acute pulmonary exacerbations (APE) with reduced FEV1. The CF nasal airway exhibits a similar ion transport defect as the lung, and colonization, infection, and inflammation within the nasal passages are common among CF patients. In addition, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has been postulated to contribute to CF pathogenesis, including its role as an early marker of descending pulmonary infection. Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) is a minimally invasive means to collect upper airway samples, and IL-8 has been suggested as a potential biomarker of CF pathogenesis in some but not all studies. The Luminex platform provides a ready means for rapid screening of the cytokine profile of biologic fluids, providing a new means to assess NLF. We collected NLF from CF patients at the onset and resolution of CF APE and compared the Luminex Bio-Rad 27 human 27-plex profile to stable CF outpatients and normal controls. We identified elevated levels of IP-10 in subjects hospitalized for APE (2582 pg/mL [95% CL of mean: 818, 8165], N=13) which significantly decreased (647 pg/mL [357, 1174] P<0.05, N=13) following antimicrobial therapy (mean duration 16 \u00b1 0.6 days). Stable CF outpatients exhibited intermediately elevated levels (680 pg/mL [281, 1644] , N=13)) that were not significantly different than normal controls (342 pg/mL [110, 1061]; P=0.3, N=10) but less than CF inpatients upon admission (P=0.056). All comparisons were log-tranformed based on distribution of IP-10 levels in biologic samples. Resolution of elevated IP-10 was associated with concomitant improvement in FEV1% (46 \u00b1 6 at admission vs 55 \u00b1 8 upon discharge, P<0.05). In contrast to IP-10, no increase in other cytokine levels were observed in any of the CF groups, which included TNF, IL-8, and IL-1, among 27 cytokines evaluated. To add confidence to the clinical relevance of our findings, we tested IP-10 levels in the BALF of CF patients. Elevated IP-10 was observed in CF BALF (2673 pg/mL [1306, 5458] , N=10) which was significantly greater than healthy post-lung transplant patients (8.4 pg/mL [0.03, 2172] , N=5, P<0.001). Similarly elevated IP-10 levels were observed in the BALF of disease controls which included recurrent pneumonia, cough, and tracheomalacia, suggesting IP-10 elevation may not be unique to CF APE (267 pg/mL [36, 1968] , N=20, P=0.05 post-lung transplant controls). IP-10 levels in the basolateral compartment of fully-differentiated nasal airway epithelial monolayers derived from CF mice exposed to PAO-1 (bacteria-free prep from 20 hour log-phase growth) or LPS (100 nm) apically for 24 hours were significantly elevated compared with vehicle controls (1159 \u00b1 147, N=13, P<0.001 for PAO-1 and 1373 \u00b1 191 N=11, P<0.001 for LPS vs. 305 \u00b1 68 for vehicle control specimen (N=13)), suggesting IP-10 levels in NLF/BALF may be due to stimulation of epithelia with bacterial pathogens. We conclude that IP-10 is elevated in the nasal lavage of CF patients with APE and responds to antimicrobial therapy. Further exploration of IP-10 as a potential biomarker and the pathogenic role of this TH-2 cytokine is warranted.",

The functional expression of the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, is elevated in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia, but the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. We tested the hypothesis that correction of \u2206F508-CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) would alter the functional expression of endogenously expressed human ENaC in the CFBE41o-model of CF epithelia. Functional expression of ENaC, as defined by amiloride-inhibited short circuit current (I sc ) in Ussing chamber experiments was absent under control conditions, but present in CFBE41oparental and \u2206F508-CFTR-overexpressing cells after treatment with 1 \u00b5M dexamethasone (Dex) for 24 h. Application of trypsin to the apical surface of the epithelia to activate uncleaved, \"near silent\" ENaC caused an additional increase in amiloride-sensitive I sc in the Dex-treated cells, and was without effect in the control cells, suggesting that Dex caused increased expression of ENaC at the cell surface. We tested the influence of two strategies to improve \u2206F508-CFTR trafficking, incubation at reduced temperature (25 o C) or with 1 mM sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), on this endogenous ENaC functional expression. These methods of \u2206F508 correction resulted in miminal CFTR-mediated I sc 's in the parental cells, and in modest CFTRmediated I sc 's in the \u2206F508 overexpressing cells. Amiloride-sensitive I sc remained absent from Dex-treated CFBE41o-parental or \u2206F508-overexpressing cells that had been incubated at reduced temperature, and these reduced temperature-incubated cells also failed to have an increase in amiloride-sensitive I sc with trypsin. In contrast, incubation with 4PBA was without significant effect on ENaC functional expression in Dex-treated CFBE41o-parental cells, but synergistically increased Dex-induced ENaC functional expression in \u2206F508-CFTR overexpressing cells. This synergistic increase was not associated with change in the rate at which functional ENaC was retrieved from the apical surface, or in the fraction of total ENaCmediated current that could be stimulated by trypsin. These data suggest that 4PBA and overexpressed \u2206F508 synergistically stimulated ENaC delivery to the apical membrane, and further suggest that the mechanisms by which reduced temperature and 4PBA correct \u2206F508 trafficking have distinct effects on ENaC trafficking. These are also consistent with the hypothesis that lack of regulation of ENaC trafficking by CFTR is one potential mechanism by which ENaC becomes hyperactive in CF airway epithelia.",

CF Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 2. Pharmacology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA Experimental evidence suggests that the absence of functional CFTR channels leads to airway surface liquid (ASL) dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance and persistent lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. The complexity of the regulatory system that maintains ASL homeostasis presents a major challenge for understanding the pathophysiology of CF and therefore hinders the development of effective therapies. To overcome this challenge, mathematical models can be developed that quantitatively describe lung epithelia electrophysiology and the signaling pathways that regulate ASL hydration. Although models of epithelial transport have been reported, a full characterization of human airway epithelia electrophysiology is still missing. In particular, the distinct bioelectric properties of CF vs. normal epithelia have not yet been incorporated into a predictive model. We developed a mathematical model of airway epithelial cell electrophysiology that has three compartments (ASL, cytoplasm, and plasma) and incorporates the three main ions contributing to cell osmolarity (Na + , K + , and Cl \u2212 ), ion transport due to electrochemical gradients and water transport due to differences in osmotic pressure. Microelectrode measurements performed in primary cell cultures of human nasal epithelium were used to fit model parameters. The effects of amiloride, bumetanide and ouabain on the steady-state bioelectric properties were investigated. The model successfully reproduced the bioelectric properties of both CF and normal airway epithelia, including ion concentrations, membrane potentials, transepithelial resistance, short-circuit current and cell volume. Importantly, the model parameters that best fit the experimental data were consistent with known differences between normal and CF epithelia, namely CF cells have (a) lower apical Cl \u2212 permeability, (b) higher apical Na + permeability and (c) higher expression of the Na-K pump than normal cells. Finally, the model provided predictions that can be tested experimentally, such as the prediction that CF cells have higher basolateral K + permeability than normal cells. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of ASL height regulation, the next step in this research project will be to incorporate ion channel (ENaC, CFTR, CaCC and CaKC) regulation by extracellular nucleotides (ATP, Adenosine) via membrane receptors (P2Y 2 and A 2b ) using our previously published model of extracellular nucleotide regulation [Zuo et al.

Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA Brief hyperthermic treatments (BHT; 41-43 o C for 30-60 min) of the airways have been applied in clinical studies for the common cold and are known to increase the expression of cytoprotective heat shock proteins. The inducible Hsp72 (iHsp72) is one of the most highly inducible heat shock proteins and has been shown to restore normal fluid transport in response to cAMP-dependent stimulation in an animal model (Pittet et al., J. Physiol. 538, 583-597, 2002) . The goal of this study was to use CFTR-corrected CF bronchial epithelial cell monolayers (wtCFTR-CFBE41o-) to establish a heat shock treatment protocol for i) examination of the effect that BHT has on CFTR Cltransport and ii) evaluation of its putative protective role by 32, 259, 2009 ). This study was conducted to further evaluate the role of IRE1\u03b2 in the regulation of mucin production. Utilizing Celsius, a Gene Expression Tool (http://genome.ucla.edu/projects/UGET), we found that IRE1\u03b2, but not IRE1\u03b1, exhibits a strong association with genes involved in mucous cell function and mucus production. A strong correlation of IRE1\u03b2 gene expression was found with a) SAM pointed domain containing ets transcription factor (SPDEF), which is required for pulmonary goblet cell differentiation and regulation of genes associated with mucus production; b) anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2), a protein disulfide isomerase essential for production of intestinal mucus; and c) CLCA1/3 (GOB-5), a member of the calcium-activated Clchannel family associated with mucin gene regulation and goblet cell hyperplasia. Other genes highly correlated with IRE1\u03b2 gene expression included several enzymes predicted to be involved in mucin glycosylation. To further address the role of IRE1\u03b2 in mucin production, we used Calu-3 cells, an airway epithelial cell line that expresses mucous cells and secretes gel-forming mucins. In Calu-3 cultures, IRE1\u03b2 mRNA was upregulated by interleukin-13 (IL-13), a response coupled to mucous cell metaplasia. Baseline and IL-13-induced IRE1\u03b2 mRNA levels were knocked-down by ~60% in Calu-3 cultures stably expressing pSIREN IRE1\u03b2 shRNA, an effect coupled with inhibition of IL-13-induced mucus cell metaplasia. In addition, while IL-13 up-regulated MUC5AC, MUC5B, SPDEF and AGR2 mRNA levels in control cultures, this effect was blunted in cultures expressing the IRE1\u03b2 shRNA (Table 1 ; data correspond to mean + SEM of fold changes over control cultures at t=0; n=2-3). Finally, overexpression of IRE1\u03b2 in Calu-3 cells increased the basal expression of MUC5AC. We conclude that 1) IRE1\u03b2 is a key regulator of airway mucin production and 2) this IRE1\u03b2 function results from, at least in part, IRE1\u03b2dependent regulation of genes associated with mucin production. We are currently investigating IRE1\u03b2-regulated airway mucin production in models relevant to CF. These studies may lead to the use of IRE1\u03b2 inhibitors as therapeutic agents for CF airways disease. We investigated how cystic fibrosis (CF) affects the relationship between Cland mucin secretion in cultures of human tracheobronchial gland mucous (HTGM) and CF tracheobronchial gland mucous (CFTGM) cells. Biochemical studies showed that the cultures secreted typical airway mucins, and molecular studies showed that the cells expressed genes encoding MUC1, MUC4, MUC5B, MUC15, MUC16 and MUC20. An enzymelinked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was used to measure mucin secretion, and short circuit current was used to estimate Clsecretion. Effects of cumulative doses of methacholine (MCH), phenylephrine (PHE), isoproterenol (ISO) and ATP on mucin and Clsecretion were studied. Baseline mucin secretion was not significantly altered in CF, nor were the increases in mucin secretion induced by mediators. In both CF and non-CF cells, mediators (at 10 -5 M) increased mucin secretion in the rank order ATP > PHE = ISO > MCH. They increased Clsecretion in the sequence ATP > MCH \u2248 ISO > PHE. Responses of CF-HTMG to MCH, ATP and PHE were not significantly different from those of HTMG. By contrast, the response of CF-HTMG cells to ISO was significantly reduced to ~20% that of HTGM cells. Across mediators, there was no correlation between the maximal increases in Cl -mitigating the loss of CFTR function by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence factor pyocyanin (Schwarzer et al., Free Radic. Biol. Med., 45: 1653 -62, 2008 . Western blot analysis showed that BHT caused iHsp72 protein expression to increase in a time-dependent fashion by a factor of 1.2-fold (2 hours), 1.7-fold (4 hours), 3.1-fold (6 hours), and 4.1-fold (24 hours). Transepithelial, CFTR-mediated chloride transport (I Cl ) of confluent, heatshocked epithelia was further investigated in Ussing chambers. BHT caused a gradual hyper-activation of forskolin-stimulated I Cl that progressively increased from 57\u00b16 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=12) to 153\u00b19 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=3) after 4 hours, and to 225\u00b133 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=3) after 6 hours. The largest stimulatory response to forskolin was obtained at 24 hours after recovery from BHT exposure with an average I Cl of 269\u00b140 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=4). The BHT-induced hyperactivation of the forskolin-stimulated I Cl was completely blocked by CFTRinh-172 (20 \u00b5M) applied apically. BHT effects were absent in non-complemented CFBE41o-monolayers homozygous for \u2206F508 CFTR indicating that BHT specifically activated the CFTR-mediated Clconductance. The apical application of the virulence factor pyocyanin (100 \u00b5M) caused a gradual decline of forskolin-stimulated I Cl up to 63% in wtCFTR-CFBE41o-monolayers that were not exposed to BHT. In contrast, prior exposure to BHT prevented the loss of forskolin-stimulated I Cl by pyocyanin. Over the course of 2-3 hours, pyocyanin caused I Cl to drop to 25\u00b13 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=9) in untreated controls, whereas I Cl was stimulated to 181\u00b135 \u00b5A/cm 2 (n=7) in BHT-treated monolayers. These data suggest that activation of the heat shock response in CFTR-corrected CF bronchial epithelial cells hyper-stimulated CFTR activity that protected against the loss of cAMP-dependent CFTR Cltransport in presence of the cytotoxic virulence factor pyocyanin.",

Mucociliary clearance (MCC) depends critically on the volume and rheological properties of a thin airway surface liquid layer, ciliary beating and balanced mucin secretion. All components of MCC are under control of purinergic signaling. Its first step involves nucleotide release by surface epithelium, however, the stimuli and pathway(s) contributing to nucleotide release remain incompletely understood. We have previously demonstrated that ATP release from alveolar A549 cells is a mechano-sensitive, Ca 2+dependent process that is strongly stimulated by low volume of liquid covering cells. Such a stimulus involves cell mechanical deformation by tension forces at the air-liquid interface (ALI) leading to elevation of intracellular Ca 2+ and exocytotic ATP release. In this study we examined whether airway epithelial cells are also susceptible to such mechanical stimulation and, if different manipulations that expose cells to tension forces of ALI will produce ATP release. Human bronchial epithelial 16HBE14ocell monolayers grown on glass coverslips were mounted in a flow-through chamber and exposed to ALI by brief introduction of an air bubble into the perfusion chamber, or by tilting an open culture dish (6-well plate) with cells covered by small volume of media. Intracellular Ca 2+ was determined by Fura-2 fluorescence imaging, ATP content in the extracellular medium was measured by luciferase assay. Regardless of experimental approach, tension forces acting on 16HBE14ocells at the ALI consistently induced significant intracellular Ca 2+ elevation and ATP release. The latter was not affected by removal of extracellular Ca 2+ but was reduced by ~70% in cells loaded with BAPTA-AM. ATP release was completely abolished in N-methylmalemidetreated cells, suggesting involvement of a Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis. Ethidium bromide staining did not disclose any cell damage in these experiments. Confocal fluorescence microscopy study showed reversible cell deformation (flattening) in the monolayer part that was in direct contact with the air bubble and confirmed that cell integrity was entirely preserved.",

            "text": "( Mucin proteins are present in abundance in the luminal airway space, and they are considered highly relevant to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease pathogenesis. Several mucin species can be found in airway secretions in both normal and CF lungs by proteomics analyses, including MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC16. Of these mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B are generally considered the most important gel-forming mucins that contribute to the rheological properties of the mucus layer in both normal and CF lungs. MUC16 is the most abundant sulfated mucin, and, as such, may be altered in CF lungs, where mucin sulfation is known to be increased. The specific roles of each of these mucins in normal lung and the relative importance of the mucins in the development of disease are not fully understood. In Scnn1b-Tg mice, airway-targeted overexpression of the \u03b2 subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (\u03b2ENaC protein, Scnn1b gene) recapitulates many of the pathological features of human CF pulmonary disease, including airway surface dehydration, development of mucus plugs, impaired mucus clearance, early bacterial burden, and chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that the phenotype in Scnn1b-Tg mice would be significantly altered in the absence of mucin proteins, and that these phenotypic differences would provide clues about specific mucin functions during disease pathogenesis. We have evaluated these hypotheses by crossing Muc16, Muc5AC, and Muc5B knock-out mice with the Scnn1b-Tg model. Several parameters of the phenotype have been analyzed in the resulting mucin deficient/Scnn1b-Tg, including survival, bronchial mucus plugging, mucus cells abundance, airspace enlargement, airway inflammation, and lymphoid hyperplasia. No measurable differences in lung phenotype have been yet observed when Muc16-or Muc5AC-deficient/Scnn1b-Tg mice are compared to Scnn1b-Tg controls. However, Scnn1b-Tg mice lacking Muc5B contain significantly less bronchial mucus plugs at 5 weeks. Preliminary data indicated that absence of Muc5B does not significantly modify the inflammatory infiltrate in Scnn1b-Tg mice, but correlated with an increase in peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia, which is a general indicator of ongoing adaptive immune responses. The results of these studies suggest that Muc5B is a particularly important mucin for plug development, and that it may play a role in modulating long-term chronic inflammation in this model. Presently, we are evaluating a number of other phenotypes, including early post-natal mucus plugging and the presence of bacteria in early stage disease. The insights from these mouse studies have obvious implications for human CF and corroborate human studies to control mucin production as a therapeutic target. 3 -) , and is severely impaired in the cystic fibrosis \u2206F508 murine reproductive tract [1] . Although evidence suggests HCO 3 secretion is reduced in CF epithelia, these measurements have never been made in the native female reproductive tract. The present study demon-that CFTRinh172 modifies the formation of various cyclopentenone-protein complexes. Their identification by mass spectrometry, currently ongoing, will give important information about the molecular pathways affected by CFTR inhibition, and on the role of CFTR in the cell response to inflammatory stimuli. 1 1. Clinical Microbiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2. Copenhagen CF Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark Background: Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection is the most severe complication in CF patients. The infection is characterized by hypoxic endobronchial mucus with mucoid biofilms surrounded by numerous polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). We have recently identified the reduction of O 2 for production of O 2 by PMNs as the major mechanism for the O 2 depletion in sputum from infected CF patients. In this study, we hypothesized that the PMNs also consume O 2 for production of nitric oxide (NO) by the inducible NO synthases (iNOS) in infected endobronchial mucus.",

            "text": "Methods and Results: NO production by PMNs was examined in fresh expectorated sputum from chronically infected CF patients. The occurrence of discrete zones with NO in the sputum was demonstrated by microsensors and suggests that NO does not spread far from the source of production before being degraded. Fluorescence microscopy of sputum stained with the NO-indicator, DAF-FM, indicated PMNs a source of NO production. Furthermore, flow cytometry demonstrated the presence of iNOS in the majority of the host cells. To verify NO production by the iNOS of the PMNs, staining with the NO-indicator, DAF-FM, was reduced during inhibition of the iNOS with the arginine analog L-NMMA (p<0.002, n=8). Accordingly, O 2 consumption was also reduced during inhibition of the iNOS with L-NMMA (p<0.002, n=4). In addition, production of NO by PMNs was further indicated by the positive correlation observed between the concentration of PMNs and stable endproducts of NO generation; NO 3 and NO 2 -(p<0.04, n=11) as estimated with the Griess Reagent System. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that sputum from chronically infected CF patients contains PMNs that consume O 2 for NO production. Therefore, in addition to depleting O 2 for the production of reactive oxygen species, the PMNs in the endobronchial mucus may also consume O 2 for the generation of reactive nitrogen species during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection in CF. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) can be assessed in the clinic using gamma-scintigraphy. An aerosol of 99m Tc-particulate is inhaled and residual lung radioactivity is monitored over time. A potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of multiple respiratory diseases is to enhance MCC. To assist in the development of such novel \"mucokinetics\" it is desirable to establish a translational small animal model of MCC.",

Herein, under similar conditions these agonists concurrently stimulated HCO 3 secretion. Both basal and stimulated HCO 3 secretion were significantly reduced in the CF \u2206F508 uterine epithelium, providing the first direct measurements from native tissue of HCO 3 secretion in the CF female reproductive tract. The present findings provide further support of our hypothesis that normal mucus formation requires HCO 3 - [2] , demonstrating that where HCO 3 secretion is impaired, mucus release is also impaired. Inflammation is a physiological process that firstly suppresses both the initial injurious stimulus and its effects (onset and active phase), and secondly restores the normal tissue function (resolution). When cells cannot correctly respond to the aggression, the physiological phenomenon does not succeed and evolves toward a chronic inflammatory state leading to tissue destruction. This is the case in cystic fibrosis (CF), where both onset and resolution of inflammation are altered. While enhanced arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipids is an important feature of the disease, a large number of eicosanoid mediators derived from this fatty acid may be either pro-or anti-inflammatory. These include prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which enhances pulmonary recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, and its intracellular dehydration product 15-deoxy-12,14D-PGJ2 which alters the function of many reactive proteins via its binding on their S-S bridges. The present study was designed to determine in human Calu-3 cells whether PGD2 and 15deoxy-12,14D-PGJ2 production ( measured by enzymatic immuno-assays) is affected by inhibition of CFTR channel activity with CFTRinh172.",

The same effect was obtained by incubation with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1b (250 pg/ml). Surprisingly, pre-treatment of cells for 48 hours with CFTRinh172 reversed the effect of IL-1b on both PGD2 and 15-deoxy-12,14D-PGJ2 cell content, which was increased by 2-fold. When the experiments were performed in the presence of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and -2 (COX-2) inhibitors SC560 and NS398, the results revealed that PGD2 production is due to COX-1 activation, which is inhibited by CFTRinh172 and negatively modulated by COX-2. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical link between CFTR and COX-1 that disappears under CFTRinh172 treatment. Moreover, by incubating cells under control or stimulated conditions with 15-deoxy-12,14D-PGJ2-biotinamide, we found To test if we could pharmacologically manipulate guinea-pig MCC, animals were exposed to an aerosol of either 5% dextrose (vehicle) or 100 \u00b5M benzamil, an ENaC blocker, for 60 minutes. Previously, the same exposure regimen of benzamil has been shown to significantly attenuate guinea-pig tracheal potential difference (Coote et al. Br J Pharmacol, 2008 , 155: 1025 . When tested in the guinea-pig MCC model, a 60-minute aerosol exposure to benzamil increased MCC compared to control (38.9 \u00b1 4.3% and 18.1 \u00b1 0.7% n=6, respectively). To assess if this model was sensitive to other \"mucokinetics,\" we exposed guinea-pigs to a 10-minute aerosol of the endogenous purinergic agonist ATP (100 mM) immediately prior to the anaesthesia/radio-aerosol protocol, which induced an increase in MCC compared to vehicle (33.5 \u00b1 4.0 % and 18.1 \u00b1 0.3% respectively n=6). As these agents elicit their effects by different mechanisms we wanted to test if coadministration further enhanced guinea-pig MCC. Guinea-pigs were exposed to 50 minutes of 100 \u00b5M benzamil immediately followed by a 10minute exposure to 100 \u00b5M benzamil + 100 mM ATP immediately prior to the radio-aerosol protocol.

Expression of TMEM16A protein is associated with the activity of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs). There are multiple TMEM16A isoforms generated by alternative splicing and usage of an alternative promoter. Using patch-clamp recordings on heterologous expression systems (FRT and HEK-293 cells), we have investigated the properties of three different isoforms: TMEM16A(abc), TMEM16(ac), and TMEM16A(0). The (abc) and (ac) isoforms, generated by inclusion/skipping of exon 6b, are coexpressed in many cell types including primary bronchial epithelial cells and in the pancreatic CFPAC-1 cell line. Inclusion of this exon, coding for a segment of 22 amino acid residues (segment b) localized before the first transmembrane domain, decreases the calcium affinity of TMEM16Adependent chloride currents by nearly four-fold. Conversely, the expression of TMEM16A(0), an isoform devoid of all alternative segments including a region of 116 amino acid residues at the N-terminus, generates chloride currents activated by cytosolic calcium but lacking voltage-dependent activation at positive membrane potentials. We also studied endogenous CaCC activity in various cell lines such as CFPAC-1 cells. In these cells, chloride currents have characteristics consistent with the co-expression of multiple TMEM16A isoforms. Cells expressing TMEM16A show also an inhibition of chloride currents at high (> 1 \u00b5M) cytosolic free calcium concentrations. This mechanism may limit the extent of chloride secretion in epithelial cells following maximal stimulation.",

The deltaF508 CF phenotype affects secretory epithelia in different tissues, in particular the lung, the site of chronic infection in CF. The surface mucus is a key component of the innate immune system of the respiratory tract. Proper hydration of the airway surface layer (ASL) is prerequisite for efficient mucociliary clearance of inhaled particles and pathogens. There are significant differences in the progression of CF in male and female patients termed the \u00ab CF gender gap \u00bb. Lung function among female patients deteriorates 26% more rapidly than in male patients and on average, male CF patients survive 9 years longer than females. Moreover, measurement of nasal trans-epithelial potential difference in female CF subjects has shown an effect of menstrual cycle stage and circulating oestrogen on ion transport properties of the epithelium.",

Further, our studies suggest that several therapeutic agents affecting lipid metabolism as well as CFTR correctors can be tested in this paradigm. Current studies show a reduction of mucin lung content in Cftrtm1eur mutant mice treated with the cPLA2 inhibitor ATK (N=6; p<0.02) as reported previously in CFTR KO mice (3) The rate of mucociliary transport (MCT) in the airways is strongly influenced by the depth of airway surface liquid (ASL). Secretion of this liquid, from both the surface epithelium and the submucosal glands, is driven by a combination of active transepithelial Cland HCO 3 secretion. However, the relative contributions of Cland HCO 3 secretion to the ASL depth and MCT are unclear. This study was designed to assess the relative importance of Cland HCO 3 secretion to MCT in ex vivo porcine tracheas. Pigs (10-20 Kg) were euthanized, and the tracheas were excised and mounted in an environmental chamber designed for measurement of MCT. To test the effects of inhibiting HCO 3 secretion on MCT, one group of tissues was exposed to HCO 3 --free Krebs solution for the duration of the experiment while a parallel group was exposed to HCO 3 --replete (25 mEq/L) Krebs solution. Following three consecutive 20 min measurements of MCT, 100 \u00b5M acetylcholine (ACh) was added to stimulate submucosal gland mucous liquid secretion, and MCT was measured again for three additional 20 min periods. Prior to ACh addition, the mean MCT was higher in HCO 3 --depleted tissues (4.20\u00b10.88 mm/min) than in tissues bathed in HCO 3 --replete Krebs (2.34\u00b10.33 mm/min), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Adding ACh significantly increased MCT in both groups, but the ACh-stimulated MCT was significantly lower in tissues exposed to HCO 3 -free Krebs (11.00\u00b11.52 mm/min) than in tissues exposed to HCO 3 --replete Krebs (17.00\u00b11.96 mm/min). A second series of experiments examined the effects on MCT of inhibiting active Clsecretion with 100 \u00b5M bumetanide, an NKCC inhibitor. In these experiments, which were all conducted in HCO 3 --replete Krebs, one group of tracheas was pretreated with bumetanide and the other group served as untreated controls. Before adding ACh, MCT in bumetanide-pretreated tracheas (0.97\u00b10.18 mm/min) was significantly lower than in the control tracheas (3.82\u00b11.06 mm/min). Adding ACh significantly increased MCT in both groups, but there was no significant difference between the bumetanide-pretreated (21.35\u00b11.73 mm/min) and control groups (19.54\u00b13.40 mm/min). These results indicate that HCO 3 secretion significantly enhances the ACh-stimulated MCT, whereas the loss of Clsecretion significantly impairs spontaneous MCT in the absence of ACh.",

This is accompanied by progressive airway remodelling, chronic inflammation and infections, frequent exacerbations, and eventually fatal loss of lung function. We hypothesize that early air trapping reflects distal mucus hyper-secretion caused by pro-inflammatory signalling, due to CFTR deficiency.

In the present study, we examined the relationship between the rate of airway liquid secretion (J v ) and mucous solids in ex vivo bronchi from porcine and non-CF human lungs. Bronchi were isolated as intact tubes and cannulated to collect the liquid secreted into the airway lumen. In pig bronchi, variable rates of J v were induced with different secretogogues (acetylcholine, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and anion secretion inhibitors. The nonvolatile solids content of secreted liquid was determined from its dry weight. At high rates of liquid secretion (14-16 \u00b5l/cm 2 /h), the percent solids were about 2%. However, a curvilinear trend was observed for increased percent solids at lower liquid secretion rates with a maximum of 19.9% solids seen at 0.5 \u00b5l/cm 2 /h. When the secretion rates of solids mass (J s ) and water mass (J w ) were determined, both of these parameters were linearly related to the J v . The y-intercept of the J s /J v relationship was positive relative to the J w /J v , which accounts for the high percent solids at the low J v rates. A predictive model incorporating these two linear relationships fit the experimental data very well. In experiments with human bronchi, variable J v rates were achieved with acetylcholine and forskolin as secretogogues. The human bronchi (obtained from explanted and donor lungs) mirrored the behavior of the pig bronchi with high percent solids measured in airway liquid at low J v rates. J s and J w in human tissues were also linearly related to the J v , and the J s /J v relationship also exhibited a positive y-intercept. The predictive model incorporating the human bronchial J s /J v and J w /J v relationships closely approximates the model for the pig airways. These data indicate that secretion of mucus with high percent solids content is the normal consequence of sustained, low rates of mucus liquid secretion in both human and porcine airways.",

Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by recessive mutation in the CFTR gene, resulting in a massive pro-inflammatory phenotype in the lung. The problem is that the mechanism by which mutant CFTR causes inflammation is completely unknown. Recently, microRNAs (miR-NAs) have been proven to be key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression by directing their target mRNAs toward degradation and/or translational repression. The mis-regulation of specific miRNAs has been demonstrated in a variety of diseases in humans including cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Since each miRNA governs the expression of multiple genes, the most effective way to overcome the effects of a mis-regulated miRNA is to modulate its expression in diseased cells. Thus, miRNAs have emerged as important therapeutic targets in the frontier of biomedical research. Recent studies indicate that even a single miRNA can induce a therapeutic response in an animal model of disease. Our goal is to investigate the mechanism by which aberrant expression of miRNAs in CF neutrophils leads to the pro-inflammatory disease phenotype and develop novel miRNA-based anti-inflammatory therapeutics for CF.",

Insight into the mechanisms associated with miRNA-mediated regulation of inflammation in CF will lead to novel miRNA-based therapy for CF. The TMEM16A protein (also known as anoctamin-1) appears as an important component of calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs). When expressed in heterologous expression systems, TMEM16A causes the appearance of calcium-activated chloride currents characterized by slow activation at positive membrane potentials (Caputo et al., Science 322:590-594, 2008) , a feature of classical CaCCs in different cell types. TMEM16A belongs to a protein family that includes nine other members, from TMEM16B to TMEM16K. Using electrophysiological and biochemical techniques, we have evaluated the expression and function of TMEM16A-K proteins in human epithelial cells. TMEM16A, TMEM16F, and TMEM16K are the anoctamins with the highest expression in primary bronchial epithelial cells, the bronchial cell line CFBE41o-, and pancreatic CFPAC-1 cells. However, only TMEM16A was clearly associated with a plasma membrane chloride channel function in such cells. By cell transfection with siRNA, we found that silencing of TMEM16A inhibited calciumdependent anion transport, whereas silencing of the other anoctamins was ineffective. We also transfected different cell types with plasmids coding for most TMEM16 proteins. Expression of TMEM16A, and to a lower extent TMEM16B, evoked calcium-dependent chloride transport. In contrast, the expression of TMEM16C, 16E, 16F, 16G, 16H, 16J, and 16K was not associated with the appearance of calcium-or cAMP-activated chloride channels, as measured by YFP fluorescence assay, patch-clamp, or short-circuit current experiments. Our experiments indicate that TMEM16C-K proteins are not involved in the function of CaCCs. They may constitute a different type of plasma membrane ion channel, activated by a stimulus other than calcium. Alternatively, they may have a non-channel function or be localized in intracellular compartments.",

            "text": "Supported by Italian Foundation for Cystic Fibrosis. Calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) have long been thought to play a role in fluid transport in airway epithelia. The molecular identity of these channels has remained unknown until recently when TMEM16A / Anoctamin-1 was shown to be essential for tracheal secretion in mouse. These channels are gated both by calcium and by voltage, but the molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we have performed a detailed biophysical and structure-function analysis of the voltage-and calcium-dependent gating of Ano1 expressed in HEK-293 cells. We show that Ano1 is essentially a ligand-gated channel whose voltage dependence is conferred not by a voltage sensor composed of charged amino acids but by permeant ions stabilizing channel open state. Gating of Ano1 is controlled by at least two calcium binding sites. The high-affinity site, which exhibits low cooperativity and is weakly coupled to voltage, is abolished by neutralizing 4 glutamic acids (444-EEEE-447) in the first intracellular loop. The low affinity site exhibits high cooperativity, is intimately coupled to voltage-dependent gating, and is disrupted by a naturally-occurring splice variant that deletes 4 amino acids (448-EAVK-451). Our data support a model in which Ano1 is primarily gated by calcium with allosteric coupling of the calcium binding sites to a permeant anion binding site in the channel whose occupancy is voltage-dependent. This mechanism provides a unified explanation of CaCC channel gating by voltage and ligand that has long been enigmatic. the glandular stem/progenitor cell niche and what impact this might have on regeneration of the airways in the setting of disease. We have begun to address this question by comparing tracheal injury responses between CFTR-/-and CFTR+/-mice, and evaluating the localization and proliferative capacity of the slow-cycling nucleotide label-retaining cells (LRCs) thought to represent stem/progenitor cell populations in the mouse airway. Although mice have relatively few glands in their proximal trachea, others have shown that CFTR plays a similar role in glandular secretions of mice and humans. Our studies showed that LRCs accumulated in SMGs of the proximal trachea in CFTR+/-mice, whereas LRCs of CFTR-/-mice predominantly localized to the tracheal surface airway epithelium (SAE). Analysis of airway progenitor cell proliferative capacity using a colony forming efficiency (CFE) assay, demonstrated significant differences in the CFE index of proximal (SMG containing) and distal (SMG absent) portions of the trachea between CFTR-/-and CFTR+/-mice. The CFE index in the proximal glandular regions of CFTR+/-tracheas was 5.8-fold higher than distal segments, consistent with the highest density of LRC stem/progenitors in the SMGs of the proximal trachea. In contrast, the CFE and LRC indexes were both evenly distributed across proximal and distal tracheal segments of CFTR-/-mice. To evaluate what properties of CF glands might change and influence the glandular niche, we evaluated expression of a number of neuropeptides known to be produced by neuroendocrine cells associated with stem cell niches in the bronchioles. Significantly enhanced (10 fold) expression of the mitogenic neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was observed in CFTR-/-tracheal SMGs. CGRP is known to activate CFTR through G-protein signaling and thus its altered expression may be a compensatory response to enhance glandular secretions in CF. Interestingly, glandular expression of CGRP was also induced (6.4 fold) by airway injury in CFTR+/-mice, while no further enhancement in CGRP was seen in CFTR-/-mice following injury. Elevations in glandular CGRP were also seen in CF human and CFTR-/-ferret tracheobronchial tissues. Adenovirusmediated expression of CGRP in mouse trachea also led to a significant increase in epithelial cell proliferation. Collectively, our findings suggest that CFTR defects in SMGs may invoke an injury response that influences maintenance of the stem/progenitor niche in this region through the induction of CGRP, a discovery that may have important implications for injury/repair mechanisms in the CF airway. Surface expression of TLR4 was followed over 24h after stimulation with PA LPS (clinical isolate, 100ng/ml) in CFTE & HTE cells. Basally, CFTE showed increased TLR4 expression (p<0.05 vs. HTE). LPS exposure decreased TLR4 in both cells (8h). TLR4 remained significantly below basal levels (24h, p<0.05) in HTE, while in CFTE cells it returned to basal level, which was associated with a significant increase of IL-8 release (24h). Following stimulation with SA PGN (10\u00b5g/ml), a similar pattern was observed for TLR2, with a significantly higher basal TLR2 expression in CFTE, which remained significantly elevated at 24h (p<0.05). These data suggest a role for CFTR to downregulate TLR expression thus controlling the inflammatory response produced. To confirm this we repeatedly stimulated cells (24h LPS, wash, 24h LPS). After the second stimulation HTE cells showed a significant decrease in IL-8 (48h vs. 24h (p<0.05)), but CFTE cells still released similar amounts. This suggests that reduced TLR4 expression in HTE may provide a protective mechanism against repeated stimulation, whereas CFTE cells are continuously stimulated.",

The short, palate lung and nasal epithelial clone (SPLUNC1) is expressed in the submucosal glands and surface epithelia of the conducting airways and was recently identified as secreted protein, which negatively regulates ENaC. SPLUNC2 and long PLUNC1 (LPLUNC1) are related PLUNC family members that are also expressed in the airways and we tested whether these proteins could likewise inhibit ENaC by co-injecting Xenopus laevis oocytes with 0.3 ng of cRNA for each \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3-ENaC subunit and either 1.5 ng of SPLUNC1, SPLUNC2, LPLUNC1, or water as a control, followed by voltage clamping 24 hours later. The resultant amiloride-sensitve current was recorded and normalized to ENaC control groups. Compared to controls, SPLUNC1 inhibited ENaC current while SPLUNC2 and LPLUNC1 had no effect [control 1 \u00b1 0.10 (n=18), LPLUNC1 0.82 \u00b1 0.17 (n=17), SPLUNC2 0.74 \u00b1 0.09 (n=22), and SPLUNC1 0.30 \u00b1 0.06 (n=22, p<0.05)]. Since SPLUNC1 is a small, secreted protein (256 amino acids), identifying its active site may enable us to design a therapeutic peptide that inhibits ENaC. To identify this region, we engineered truncation mutants that retained the N-terminal, 19 amino acid signal sequence but lacked 30, 60, or 85% of the full-length protein, deleted from the C-terminus. These truncants were co-expressed with ENaC in oocytes for voltage clamp measurements. Secretion of each truncant was confirmed by Western blot. SPLUNC1's inhibitory effects on ENaC were retained in truncants with deletions up to 85% [control 1 \u00b1 0.04, SPLUNC1 0.52 \u00b1 0.03, SPLUNC1 del30% 0.389\u00b1 0.09, SPLUNC1 del60% 0.45 \u00b1 0.06, SPLUNC1 del85% 0.49 \u00b1 0.06 (n=15-18 per group, p<0.05)]. Since SPLUNC1 del85% retained full function, we analyzed its peptide sequence. Residues 22 to 39 were ~40% homologous to the ENaC inhibitory peptides, \u03b126 and \u03b343 that are released from the extracellular loop of ENaC following proteolytic cleavage. To test whether this region of SPLUNC1 was responsible for the inhibition of ENaC, we engineered additional SPLUNC1 truncants that bisected or omitted this putative active site. These mutants did not inhibit ENaC (control 1.00 \u00b10.06, SPLUNC1 del88.75% 1.01 \u00b1 0.13, SPLUNC1 del92.5% 1.03 \u00b1 0.06; all n=12), suggesting that the active site of SPLUNC1 lies in its first 40 amino acids and, specifically, appears to be in the region with high homology to ENaC inhibitory peptides \u03b126 and \u03b343. However, despite its strong simiarity to these inhibitory peptides, SPLUNC1's mechanism of action may differ. Using surface biotinylation and Western blotting, we found that SPLUNC1 facilitated a reduction in the number (N) of ENaC subunits at the plasma membrane, which may contribute to the inhibition of macroscopic ENaC current. In conclusion, our data suggest that SPLUNC1 inhibits ENaC by acting through amino acids 22-39, which are homologous to the previously described ENaC inhibitory fragments. Identifying the active site of SPLUNC1 may provide a new avenue for therapeutic regulation of hyperactive ENaC in CF airways.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the loss of CFTR is associated with (1) Accumulating evidence suggests that defective function/expression of CFTR contributes to the hyperactive innate immune response of respiratory epithelia in cystic fibrosis (CF). TMEM16A was recently identified as a calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC) at the plasma membrane. Based on the significant CaCC activity and the lack of lung disease in CF mouse, it was postulated that activation of the CaCC may alleviate the mucocilliary clearance defect and excessive innate immune response of respiratory epithelia in CF patients. To assess this possibility experimentally, we asked whether TMEM16A has the ability to suppress the inflammatory status of human respiratory epithelia model lacking CFTR. First we examined the consequence of CaCC activation on pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion in CFBE41o-epithelia derived from a CF patient with undetectable \u2206F508CFTR expression. IL-4 has been shown to induce the endogenous expression of TMEM16A in primary epithelia. Alternatively, the channel can be transiently activated by P2Y receptor stimulation with UTP leading to calcium release from intracellular stores. Both of these methods were used to activate TMEM16A in CFBE41o-cells cultured on permeable filter supports and differentiated under air-liquid culture (ALC) conditions. Initial results suggest that neither UTP nor IL-4 treatment were able to reduce the hyper-inflammatory phenotype, marked by IL-8 secretion, of the CFBE41oepithelia. Furthermore, we were unable to suppress the pro-inflammatory phenotype by overexpression of exogenous TMEM16A alone or in combination with IL-4 treatment and UTP stimulation. Ongoing studies are aimed at assessing the extent of TMEM16A activation by IL-4 and UTP in CFBE41o-epithelia. In contrast to TMEM16A, overexpression of CFTR in CFBE41o-epithelia under a tetracycline-inducible promoter attenuated the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Notably, wt CFTR inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, MCP-1 and GRO\u03b2/\u03b3) by >50%. Preliminary observations suggest that CFTR expression reciprocally influences the CaCC activity. Expression of wt CFTR reduced the UTP or ionophore stimulated halide secretion in CFBE41o-epithelia expressing endogenous or exogenous TMEM16A. While CFTR induction does not alter the global TMEM16A expression, ongoing studies suggest that it may attenuate the CaCC channel density at the apical plasma membrane. Although the overall abundance of the TMEM16A and CFTR channel density may be preserved by a presently unknown physiological mechanism, our results are consistent with the notion that TMEM16A is unable to compensate for the hyper-inflammatory phenotype of CFBE41o-model of CF bronchial epithelia.",

The thin liquid layer lining the alveolar space is essential for maintaining efficient gas exchange, surfactant homeostasis, and defense against inhaled toxins/pathogens. Airway epithelial cells actively secrete or absorb ions in response to local stimuli to coordinately regulate the liquid layer lining airway surfaces. However, it remains unclear whether the alveolar epithelium exhibits similar capacities, and if so, how the physiologies of the two regions are coordinated. Since it has been difficult to achieve a unified understanding of the surface liquid physiology within the intact alveolus, in vitro studies were performed using primary human alveolar type II (AT2) cells to observe how these cultures respond to specific challenges. First, our data revealed that AT2 cultures exhibited both epithelial Na + channel (ENaC)-mediated Na + absorption and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-mediated Clsecretion, both regulated by extracellular nucleotides. Moreover, measurements of alveolar surface liquid (AvSL) height by confocal microscopy revealed that human AT2 cells: 1) achieved an extracellular nucleotide concentration-dependent steady-state AvSL height of approximately 4 \u00b5m; 2) absorbed liquid when the lumen of the AT2 culture was flooded; and 3) secreted liquid when treated with forskolin, uridine 5' triphosphate (UTP), or subjected to cyclic compressive stresses mimicking tidal breathing. The secretory responses mediated by either nucleotides or cAMP were shown to be highly dependent on the function of CFTR, since pretreatment of normal AT2 cultures with the CFTR inhibitor (CFTRinh-172) significantly inhibited these changes in AvSL height. In addition, the increase in AvSL height/secretion was markedly inhibited in cultures pretreated with apyrase, demonstrating a nucleotidemediated regulation of AvSL height by AT2 cells exposed to UTP or subjected to continuous cyclic compressive stress. Overall, our studies of AvSL regulation demonstrate that human AT2 cells in vitro can respond to ambient needs, e.g., can absorb in response to the equivalent of alveolar flooding, but can secrete in response to addition of exogenous secretagogues. Our results suggest that in vivo, AT2 cells under baseline conditions can be secretory, thus, resulting in a bulk movement of liquid from AT2 cells to airway surfaces. Further studies will be required to test this hypothesis and analyze how the integrated system, including AT1 cells contribute to surface liquid transport regulated in response to physiologic stresses in health and in response to pathophysiologic stresses in disease. We have previously demonstrated that ENaC activity is regulated by the protease/protease inhibitor balance on the apical surface of cultured human bronchial epithelia (HBE). This balance is disturbed in CF, leading to constitutive proteolytic ENaC activation, Na + hyperabsorption, airway surface dehydration, and mucus plugging in the lung. Channel activating protease (CAP) expression appears to be increased in CF HBE and prostasin, a known CAP, appears to undergo excessive zymogen activation in these tissues. Recent evidence suggests that matriptase is an upstream protease that activates prostasin and matriptase is likely to be highly active in the acidic airway surface liquid (ASL) present in CF. Therefore, we hypothesized that matriptase activity in the airway is regulated by ASL pH and that excessive matriptase activation promotes Na + hyperabsorption in the CF airway.",

In human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, abnormal CFTR function results in absent chloride (Cl -) secretion and greater than normal sodium (Na + ) absorption with subsequent depletion of airway surface liquid (ASL) and mucus dehydration.

            "text": "Supported by the Lynne and Arnold Irwin Family Foundation and the Canadian CF Foundation. It is now well established that cAMP signaling is compartmentalized. The components of the cAMP signaling machinery, such as the GPCRs, adenylyl cyclases, and cAMP effectors such as PKA and its downstream targets are tethered by macromolecular signaling complexes, an arrangement that increases both efficiency and specificity of signaling. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the enzymes that hydrolyze and inactivate cAMP, are critical components of these signaling complexes. These enzymes serve to restrict the free diffusion of cAMP throughout the cell and to finely tune cAMP levels within localized microdomains of signaling. PDEs represent a superfamily of isoenzymes that are divided into 11 PDE families on the basis of their kinetic and pharmacologic properties. Here, we investigated whether PDE isoenzymes are tethered to macromolecular signaling complexes involving the CFTR and may, thus, serve to control the cAMP-mediated regulation of this channel. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous CFTR from T84 epithelial cells resulted in co-IP of a significant amount of PDE activity that was sensitive to the PDE4-selective inhibitor, Rolipram. Co-IP of PDE4 activity was also observed in CFTR-IPs from Calu3 cells and mouse lung tissue suggesting that the formation of CFTR/PDE4 complexes is a conserved feature among different epithelia. The PDE4 family consists of four genes, PDE4A-D, which are each expressed as multiple variants. IP of PDE4A from Calu3 cells resulted in co-IP of a large amount of CFTR protein, whereas only a minor amount of CFTR was co-immunoprecipitated with PDE4D. The predominant interaction of CFTR with PDE4A rather than PDE4D is somewhat surprising as previous reports suggested a predominant functional and physical interaction of the PDE4D subtype with the CFTR. However, CFTR also interacted more strongly with PDE4A compared to PDE4B or PDE4D in the Hek293 overexpression system, thus, confirming a preferential interaction of CFTR with PDE4A. Deletion of the four C-terminal amino acids of CFTR encoding the PDZ-binding domain did not ablate the CFTR interaction with PDE4A. Thus, PDE4A interactions with CFTR are mechanistically different from the previously reported interaction of CFTR with PDE4D which is dependent on the PDZ domain scaffold protein Shank2. Furthermore, recombinant CFTR carrying the F508 deletion immunoprecipitates PDE4A with the same efficiency as wildtype CFTR. This may suggest that F508-CFTR still associates with and is controlled by PDE4A in CF patients and that inactivation or displacement of PDE4A may provide a means to elevate cAMP in the vicinity of the mutant channel and stimulate F508-CFTR activity.",

The mechanism by which the compound augments CBF may involve changes in periciliary viscosity due to CFTR potentiation, or direct effects on pathways known to influence ciliary beating. The nasal culture model provides an excellent model system for elucidating the mechanisms by which compounds such as hesperidin activate MCC, including analysis of CFTR biochemistry, mucus propulsion in vitro, and cell signaling pathways that contribute to the mucociliary apparatus. Submucosal glands secrete mucus that is rich in antimicrobials and is thought to play a role in airway innate defense. Gland fluid secretion is stimulated by increases in [cAMP]i or [Ca 2+ ]i and both of these are probably elevated during neurally-stimulated secretion. In CF humans, pigs and ferrets, gland secretion to [cAMP] i is severely depressed because of CFTR dysfunction; secretion to [Ca 2+ ]i is partially spared. The phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (Dormer,Thorax,2005) and milrinone (Kelley,JCI,1996 , Kelley,PNAS,1997 as well as structural analogs of sildenafil (Robert,Mol Pharmacol,2008) partially correct function of \u2206F508-CFTR.

To determine if milrinone affected forskolin-stimulated fluid secretion from normal human glands from donor tracheas (CONTROL) and from CF airway glands(from lung transplant), we used in-situ optical monitoring to measure secretion rates from individual glands. A forskolin dose-response curve in CONTROL subjects (100nM~100\u00b5M) gave an EC50 of 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5M and Vmax of 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 nL/min/gland (nmg) (36-57gl#,n=3), with response to 30 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M forskolin no different than to 10\u00b5M forskolin (P=0.9). Therefore 10 \u00b5M forskolin was used for all tests, milrinone was used at 100 \u00b5M, and all secretion rates are given as mean \u00b1 SEM nmg. In CONTROL, forskolin stimulated secretion of 0.31 \u00b1 0.08 nmg (99gl#,n=9), milrinone induced secretion of 0.28 \u00b10.1 nmg (67gl#,n=7), and the combination of milrinone+forskolin increased secretion 1.4-fold to 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 nmg(99gl#,n=9), which greater than the response to either agent alone(P<0.05) but was less than an additive effect.

Cultures were subjected to transepithelial ion transport measurements using pharmacologic manipulation in Ussing chambers, Fura-2 calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging, and cAMP signaling.

Partial activation of Clsecretion in CFTR -/-MNSE indicates that a non-CFTR mechanism contributes (at least in part) to the Clsecretory response, but without requiring elevations in Ca 2+ as a second messenger. Our findings indicate that effects on CFTR underlie the majority of Clsecretion attributable to the drug, although enhanced electrochemical gradients for Cltransport, or CFTR independent pathways at the apical membrane, may also contribute. Background: Ineffective mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a common pathophysiologic process associated with airway inflammation and infection. Airway surface liquid (ASL) is a principal component of the mucociliary apparatus and is strongly influenced by the vectorial transport of ions, such as chloride (Cl -). Dysfunctional Cltransport results in dehydration of the ASL and mucus stasis as demonstrated in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Conventional interventions for chronic sinusitis have been limited by bacterial resistance milrinone+forskolin increased the secretion rate to 0.5\u00b10.2nmg, 7.5-fold more than forskolin alone (P=0.03,84gl#,n=8). Remarkably, the mean secretion rate to milrinone+forskolin across subjects were equivalent for CON-TROL and CF subjects(P=0.69), although the control responses in this series were ~half as large as historical controls for unknown reasons. The mechanism of milrinone's effect is under investigation to determine if it is correcting or potentiating mutant CFTR or is activating an alternate channel. If rapid correction is occurring, phosphodiesterase inhibitors might be useful starting points for developing CFTR correctors.",

Furthermore, mass spectrometric analysis revealed the significant presence in CF NPS fluids of free amino acids and amino acid-containing molecules, indicative of ongoing proteolysis. Perhaps most strikingly, CF NPS fluids contained methionine sulfoxide, a molecular signature seen at later disease stages that is likely formed through proteolysis of methionine-rich airway mucins by neutrophil-derived proteases followed by oxidation by neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase, thereby providing an independent proof of early airway neutrophil dysfunction.",

            "text": "Introduction: A20 is an inducible gene responsible for the termination of NF-\u03baB signalling through immune receptors including Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs). Mice deficient in A20 display persistent activation of NF-\u03baB by TLRs and TNF-R, causing multiorgan inflammation (1) . A20 inhibits TLR induced NF-\u03baB signalling at the level of TRAF6, but is reliant on the formation of a complex with Ring Finger protein (RNF)11, the E3 ligase Itch and an adaptor protein called TAX1BP1 to do so (2) . We propose that in the chronically inflamed CF epithelium, A20 and the A20 signalling complex is fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or are secondary to postnatal infection and inflammation. Recently, we developed a porcine model of CF. The lungs of newborn CFTR-targeted pigs lacked inflammation. However, with time they spontaneously developed characteristic features seen in the lungs of older patients with CF including inflammation, remodeling, mucus accumulation, and infection. In this study, we asked whether, at birth, the airways of CFTR-/-pigs show any abnormalities using CT scans, pathology and morphometry. Compared to littermate controls, the trachea and mainstem bronchi had a smaller caliber, tracheal cartilage rings were irregular and disrupted, and cross-sections of trachea were less circular than controls. Accompanying these changes, we found alterations in trachealis smooth muscle including altered bundle orientation and an increased trend in size. We also asked if these changes occur in young infants and children with CF. First, we retrospectively examined chest CT scans from non-CF and CF children two years of age and younger to evaluate the trachea. We found no significant difference in the tracheal lumen area between non-CF and CF, but CF tracheas were distinguished from controls by having less circular walls in cross sections. These changes were similar to those seen in neonatal CFTR-/-pigs. Second, we analyzed previously published morphometric data (Sturgess J and Imrie J. Am J Pathol 106: [303] [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] [309] [310] [311] 1982) and found reduced tracheal caliber in CF infants less than 2 weeks of age. These findings suggest that CF-related airway changes begin in utero and might contribute to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Rationale: There is significant evidence that the cystic fibrosis (CF) neutrophil is intrinsically abnormal. However, molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated neutrophil activity and the actual presence of the CF transmembrane receptor (CFTR) in neutrophils remains controversial. We focused on the neutrophil membrane as it is involved in cell signaling and plays a central role in regulating neutrophil delivery, function, and clearance. The question that this project will address is: are CF neutrophil membranes intrinsically abnormal?",

This work is supported by the CF Trust UK (PJ541). Vitamin D insufficiency is common in CF patients. Such a problem may lead to a reduction in the innate immune defenses in the lung. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ) plays an important role in the regulation of innate immunity through the induction of the gene expression of antimicrobial peptides such as the cathelicidin LL-37, which plays a role in defense against bacteria and other infectious agents. We earlier reported that LL-37 is induced by (1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ) in airway epithelial cells (AEC) with a resultant increase in antimicrobial activity against airway pathogens. We further examined AEC for the expression of other innate immune genes in response to (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 ). We observed that a novel mediator of innate immunity, Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells (TREM-1) is induced by 10 -8 M (1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ) in both CF and normal AEC. In general, lower levels of TREM-1 were induced in CF cells compared with the normal cell line. Inhibition of CFTR in the normal line results in a reduction in TREM-1 levels to those found in the CF cells. Furthermore, a characterization of SNPs in the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene showed differences at four common polymorphisms between the normal and CF cells. Activation of TREM-1 in normal cells by a cross-linking antibody results in the induction of human \u03b2-defensin 2 expression and an increase in antibacterial activity in the airway surface fluid. An examination of the TREM-1 promoter region demonstrated the stimulation promoter activity with (1,25(OH) 2 D 3 ), which is inhibited by the transcription factor PU.1. Since TREM-1 has been demonstrated to be involved in the early defense against bacterial infection in the lung, our data suggest that differences may exist in the vitamin D-regulation of innate immunity in CF patients, and that regulation of innate immune mediators by vitamin D may be able to enhance the natural antibacterial defense in the CF lung.",

This effect maximized at ~3 days post-inoculation (pi) (ctrl 7.5\u00b10.3 \u00b5m, RSV 15\u00b11 \u00b5m, n=6). Parallel experiments using CF HAE revealed that RSV infection failed to increase ASL height over the same time period (ctrl 5.8\u00b10.1 \u00b5m, RSV 5.5\u00b10.2 \u00b5m, n=6). These data demonstrate that non-CF HAE, but not CF HAE, respond to RSV infection by increasing mucosal fluid secretion and suggest that CFTR plays a critical role in this response. Using pharmacological reagents we confirmed a role for CFTR in RSVinduced fluid secretion. Bumetanide (Bum), an inhibitor of chloride secretion, significantly inhibited RSV-induced ASL secretion (ctrl, 7.2\u00b11 \u00b5m, RSV 14.5\u00b11 \u00b5m; RSV+bum 9\u00b10.5 \u00b5m, ctrl+bum 5.9\u00b10.5 \u00b5m, n=3). To determine the specific contribution of CFTR-mediated Clsecretion to this response we used CFTRinh172 which significantly inhibited RSV-induced ASL height (ctrl, 6.8\u00b10.3 \u00b5m, RSV 11 \u00b11.8 \u00b5m, RSV+172 8.2\u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m, ctrl+172 6.8\u00b10.5 \u00b5m, n=3). Thus, our data indicate that CFTR activation during RSV infection is critical for the increased ASL height. Previous studies have shown that regulation of fluid secretion in non-CF HAE is governed by extracellular nucleotide concentrations. We found that RSV infection of either non-CF HAE or CF HAE significantly increased levels of ATP and adenosine (ADO) in the ASL, suggesting that increased nucleotides mediate increased fluid secretion when CFTR is present during RSV infection. Furthermore, the adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-SPT, significantly attenuated RSV-induced fluid secretion in non-CF HAE (RSV 12.7\u00b10.3 \u00b5m, RSV+8SPT 9.0\u00b10.1 \u00b5m, n=3). To determine the source of ATP/ADO after RSV infection we assessed ATP release from the epithelium vs. cells shed after RSV infection and found that ATP was derived from the shed, infected ciliated cells and that increased ASL height correlated with the numbers of shed cells. We hypothesize that RSV infected ciliated cells shed from the epithelium undergo apoptosis releasing ATP into the ASL. Breakdown of ATP to adenosine by ectonucleotidases then stimulates CFTR-mediated fluid secretion.",

TC 50 could not be determined because of insolubility issues greater than 500 \u00b5g/mL in cell culture medium. Western analysis revealed the translation of MMP-9 message into constituitive protein and further work to elucidate the molecular signaling of doxycycline is forthcoming. Conclusion: Doxycycline exhibited immune-modulatory activity, without serious toxicity concerns, as measured by the inflammatory marker IL-8, airway proteolysis marker MMP-9, and the metabolic viability agent MTT in a CF in vitro model. Defective CFTR results in a variety of changes in airway clearance and lung milieu contributing to inefficient resolution of lung infection and inflammation in cystic fibrosis (CF). The inability to resolve infection/inflammation suggests defects in immunity; however whether this is primary or secondary to the defective epithelium is unknown. We hypothesize that deficient Cftr expression in myeloid cells directly impacts the phenotype and response to infection in the lung ultimately contributing to the pro-inflammatory phenotype of CF airways. To determine the role of myeloid Cftr in chronic infection to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, myeloid specific Cftr KO mice (generated using the Cre+/LoxP system and the lys-M promoter), controls (Cre-), congenic Cftr null (B6.129P-2 Cftrtm1Unc ) and C57Bl/6 mice were treated with agar beads impregnated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evaluated for 10 days (10-12 mice/group, n=3). Outcome measures included survival, weight change, clinical and lung pathology scores. Surviving animals were euthanized for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) which was used to measure cytokines, total cell count and differential. The myeloid specific Cftr KO mice had decreased ability to resolve infection and inflammation relative to the controls (p<0.05). The infection resolution in the myeloid specific Cftr KO (40\u00b117% survival) was similar to the congenic Cftr null mice (55\u00b120% survival). The myeloid specific Cftr KO also had increased values for clinical score (p=0.003) and lung pathology (p=0.04) relative to the controls, which correlated with the increased inflammation (r 2 = 0.963, p\u22640.01) and loss of weight (r 2 =0.978; p\u22640.01). The BAL total cell counts increased (p=0.07) with elevated numbers of neutrophils. Controlling for the variability in the infection model, two sets of studies were done infecting both Cftr null (n=14) and myeloid specific Cftr KO mice (n=15) and controls at the same time. In these studies, 5 mice were euthanized at 3 days post-infection, while the remaining mice continued to day 10. The myeloid specific Cftr KO mice had an elevated total cell response when compared to the myeloid specific control (p<0.05) similar to Cftr null mice (p<0.05). We then compared the relative neutrophilic response in the myeloid specific Cftr KO and Cftr null mice along with controls at both the inflammation time point (day 3) and inflammation resolution time point (day 10). There was no statistical difference in the neutrophilic response to infection between the Cftr nulls, myeloid specific Cftr KO versus controls at day 3. Differences in the neutrophilic response was observed at day 10 for both the Cftr null (p=0.053) and myeloid specific Cftr KO (p=0.07) . Further, at day 10 the BAL of the myeloid specific Cftr KO mice had elevated cytokines IL-6 and KC relative to controls (p<0.05) consistent with observations in the Cftr null. When evaluating the myeloid specific Cftr KO BAL cells directly, we found an enhanced responsiveness to LPS stimulation resulting in increased IL-6 and KC gene expression (n=4, p\u22640.05). These studies suggest that myeloid cells in CF are intrinsically different in their ability to response and resolve inflammation in CF.",

Recently, we demonstrated that this hyperinflammatory response to LPS is due to abnormal spatio-temporal localization of TLR4 during signaling. Specifically, CF macrophages have more rapid TLR4 internalization and prolonged TLR4 retention in the endosomal compartment compared to WT cells. This abnormal TLR4 trafficking leads to increased LPS-induced activation of the NF-kb, MAPK and IRF-3 pathways (Bruscia et al., submitted) . We hypothesized that the prolonged retention of TLR4 in endosomal compartments and the increased signal transduction were concurrent with impaired TLR4 degradation. To test this hypothesis, WT and CF macrophages, pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, were exposed to LPS (3h and 6h) and total TLR4 protein was assessed by Western blot. We found that during LPS stimulation, the rate of TLR4 degradation was slower in CF cells than WT controls. These data suggest that the retention of the receptor in the endosomal compartments in CFTR-/-macrophages delays TLR4 degradation, which is fundamental for resolution of inflammatory stimuli.",

No significant differences were found in Keap1 levels in any of our models. Fractionation studies revealed significant decreases in Nrf2 in the cytosol and nuclear fractions of CF models. Conversely, Nrf2 levels in membrane and cytoskeletal fractions were significantly increased. These results are consistent with the decreased activation of Nrf2 in CF models, which we confirmed by proteomic analysis.

This work is supported by CF Trust UK (PJ541 A strong body of evidence demonstrates a marked dysfunction of the resolution of inflammation in CF, in patients and experimental models. Previously, we reported that CF epithelial cell lines, primary cells treated with the CFTRinh-172, and airway epithelial tissues from R117H mutant mice fail to properly eliminate proinflammatory oxidants [Dysfunction of Nrf-2 in CF epithelia leads to excess intracellular H 2 O 2 and inflammatory cytokine production. Chen J, Kinter M, Shank S, Cotton C, Kelley TJ, Ziady AG. PLoS One. 2008;3(10):e3367]. Central to this dysfunction is a decrease in the activity of the transcription factor Nrf2 in CF epithelia. We showed that the failure to properly activate Nrf2 contributed to an increased inflammatory response, while correction of Nrf2 function significantly reduced it. To determine the mechanism by which Nrf2 is dysregulated in CF epithelia, we examined the Nrf2 activation cascade. In the inactive state Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its interaction with the cytoskeleton-associated protein, Keap1. When oxidant levels increase, Keap1 is oxidized and Nrf2 is released, then phosphorylated, and either enters the nucleus or is ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation. In the nucleus, Nrf2's interaction with a number of binding partners, such as CREB binding protein (CBP), modulates its activity. We used Western blot analysis to probe for unphosphorylated Nrf2, Keap1, and phosphorylated Nrf-2 in whole cell as well as Conclusions: Our work demonstrates the dysregulation of the TIM-3/galectin-9 signalling axis in the CF lung, due to proteolytic cleavage. This mechanism represents a novel intrinsic defect that contributes to the neutrophil-dominated immune response in the CF airway. Up until recently, neutrophil dysfunction in the CF airways has been mainly linked with necrosis and release of proteolytic enzymes and DNA. However, scientists and clinicians are now considering the blood CF neutrophil as inherently abnormal. Consistent with these views the circulating CF neutrophil has been shown to release greater levels of primary granule proteins, including neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. In spite of this, recent in vitro studies have shown that CF neutrophils kill bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa inefficiently. To address this anomaly, the aim of this study was to determine whether CF circulating neutrophils illustrated altered degranulation of secondary and tertiary granules when compared to healthy control cells.",

Moreover, release of MMP-9 from tertiary granules of CF neutrophils was decreased by 75% after 20 min stimulation (p<0.005). In addition, surface expression of CD66b, a marker for secondary and tertiary granules, was significantly reduced in CF cells as measured by flow cytometry (p<0.05 for 5 and 10 min, p<0.005 for 20 min post stimulation). Impaired response to TNF\u03b1 may cause decreased degranulation of antimicrobial proteins from secondary and tertiary granules by CF circulating neutrophils and impact upon the killing ability of these innate immune cells. The underlying disease mechanism of CF remains unclear. It is generally believed that impaired chloride transport due to reduced CFTR function impairs transepithelial salt/water balance and dehydrates the airway surface. As a consequence, viscous mucus inhibits antimicrobial activity and promotes recurrent bacterial infection. The continued bacterial colonization in the CF lung leads to a hyperinflammatory response with persistent infiltration of immune cells. However, the CF lung is not able to suppress bacterial infections, even with increased inflammatory response, suggesting the possibility of innate immune suppression. Recent data has indicated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a quorum sensing homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL) that represses innate immune function by disrupting critical transcriptional responses mediated by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). As such, P. aeruginosa may actively establish and maintain infections in CF, rather than merely flourishing in a favorable niche. We developed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules that block HSL-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling to be used as a research tool to investigate the immune response repression in P. aeruginosa colonization of the lung and as potential drug candidates. A stable Fischer rat thyroid cell line was generated that expresses luciferase under the control of NF-\u03baB-response elements (FRT-NF-\u03baB cells). Stimulation of FRT-NF-\u03baB cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 \u00b5g/ml for 4 hours) resulted in a robust luminescence response (~5times background signal), which was suppressed completely by 3OC12-HSL (at 25-50 \u00b5M). This cell-based assay was adapted for high-throughput screening, giving a robust Z'-factor > 0.7. Primary screening of 25,600 drug-like synthetic small molecules gave several classes of active compounds that blocked 3OC12-HSL suppression of NF-\u03baB signalling by >70 %. Secondary screening verified the activity of six compound classes in FRT-NF-\u03baB cells, including benzothiazoles and isoxazoles. Current efforts are focused on testing of these compounds in additional relevant cell types, including macrophages, optimization of leads, and testing in animal models of inflammation. Small-molecule 3OC12-HSL inhibitors may be useful in studying mechanisms of P. aeruginosa colonization and lung inflammation, and may provide a novel approach to treat P. aeruginosa infection in CF.",

We then investigated the effect of elevated NGAL on macrophage innate immune function using THP-1 human macrophage-like cells treated with recombinant NGAL protein (100 ng/ml) overnight prior to stimulation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS (10 pmol/ml). We found that NGAL suppressed LPS-induced cytokine production in THP-1 macrophages as demonstrated by decreased production of the inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10) release. We also investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) release from macrophages as a defense mechanism that is important for the oxidant killing of invading pathogens; however, excessive ROS release also contributes to tissue damage. We observed that exposure to CF serum primed macrophages for massive ROS release, reflecting a pathological oxidative stress in CF host. ROS release was detected using the chemiluminescent probe lucigenin in THP-1 cells primed with either CF serum (50 \u00b5l /10 million cells in 10 ml volume), or the TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 (1\u00b5g/ml), TLR4 ligand P. aeruginosa LPS (10 pmol/ml), or recombinant TNF\u03b1 (1ng/ml).

These enzymatic changes can be corrected by exogenous supplementation with DHA, which also corrects the EFA abnormalities.

The changes can be reversed, in part, by blocking SREBP-1 expression either by DHA or by transfection of specific siRNAs. These findings suggest that SREBP-1 may play an important role in the production of EFA abnormalities in CF and in their correction by DHA. CF lung pathology is dominated by a huge recruitment of neutrophils in the bronchial lumina, in which IL-8, mainly released by respiratory epithelial cells, plays a key role. IL-8 transcription is regulated by several transcription factors (TFs) such as NF-kB, AP-1 and NF-IL6. Recently, it has been reported that also the TF CHOP (GADD153) is involved in IL-1\u03b2-and PGE2-dependent IL-8 transcription in CF bronchial epithelial cells (IB3-1) [1] . The aim of this investigation is to detect the possible involvement of CHOP also in P. aeruginosa-dependent IL-8 transcription and gain further insights in the transmembrane signalling leading to CHOP activation. Decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) strategy [2] has been applied in IB3-1 cells pre-incubated for 24 hrs with ODNs mimicking the CHOP consensus sequence localized in the IL-8 promoter region, before exposure to P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain, IL-1\u03b2 or TNF-\u03b1 for further 4 hrs, before quantifying IL-8 mRNA. We confirm that CHOP is implicated in IL-1\u03b2-dependent IL-8 transcription [1] , and we suggest its involvement also in P. aeruginosadependent pro-inflammatory signalling. Interestingly, CHOP does not seem to participate in IL-8 transcription mediated by TNF-\u03b1. It has been previously reported that CHOP is induced by the p38 MAPK and HSP27 pathways in human melanoma cells [3] . Therefore we tested the pattern of phosphorylation of 21 different phosphokinases with an immunoenzymatic nitrocellulose membrane assay and we found that: a) P. aeruginosa leads to the phosphorylation of the MAPK p38 isoforms \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b3, RSK-1, GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2 and HSP27; b) IL-1\u03b2 of MAPK p38 isoform \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b3, RSK1, ERK2, MSK2, and HSP27; c) TNF-\u03b1 of MAPK p38 isoform \u03b4, JNK2 and JNK3. Thus, in our model, we confirm that CHOP is involved in the IL-8 transcription when induced by P. aeruginosa and IL-1\u03b2 in human bronchial epithelial cells and this seems associated with the activation of HSP27 and possibly the MAPK p38 isoforms alpha and gamma, but not delta. Previously, we reported that extracts from N. arvensis seeds, which are widely used as anti-inflammatory remedies for skin and pulmonary inflammatory diseases in traditional medicine of Northern Africa, were able to inhibit selectively the expression of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 in IB3-1 CF bronchial cells exposed to the P. aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1 [1] . In this study we analyzed the chemical composition of the extracts and identified four major compounds: beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol and thymoquinone. The first three molecules are phytosterols, cholesterol-like molecules found in plant material with the highest concentrations occurring in vegetable oils. Phytosterols act as a structural components in the vegetal cell membrane, a role which is played by cholesterol in mammalian cells. The molecules found in N. arvensis seeds were purchased and tested in IB3-1 CF bronchial cells exposed to the P. aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1 for 4 h. IB3-1 cells were pre-treated for 20 h with increasing doses, ranging from 1 nM to 200 \u00b5M for beta-sitosterol; to 100 \u00b5M for stigmasterol; to 10 \u00b5M for campesterol; to 100 \u00b5M for thymoquinone. Total RNA was extracted and the neutrophil chemokine inflammatory marker IL-8 transcript was quantified. Beta-sitosterol was the only compound that significantly inhibited the PAO1-dependent transcription of IL-8 starting from the dose of 100 nM. By now, limited data has suggested that phytosterols may help reducing inflammation [2] . These data provide encouraging results supporting the concept of developing bioactive compounds following screening active leads purified from medicinal plants to identify safe and innovative pharmaceutical molecules to control lung inflammation in CF patients. Objectives: Innate defence regulator (IDR) peptides are synthetic derivatives of endogenous host defence peptides, and are currently under investigation as novel anti-infective agents. IDRs lack effective antimicrobial activity; rather, they enhance bacterial clearance by increasing leukocyte recruitment to infection sites while simultaneously suppressing harmful inflammation. As cystic fibrosis (CF) pathology arises from chronic bacterial infections which in turn drive chronic lung inflammation, we sought to investigate the ability of a lead IDR (IDR-1018) to modulate human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli.",

Physiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA; 2. Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH, USA; 3. Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA We previously reported that a secreted toxin from P. aeruginosa, Cif (PA2934), reduces CFTR-mediated chloride secretion by human airway epithelial cells by enhancing the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR and its degradation via the lysosomal pathway (Swiatecka-Urban, et al. 2006; Bomberger et al. 2009 ). The aim of the current study was to determine if Cif regulates other ABC transporters, specifically the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Patients with TAP deficiency, like CF patients, have recurrent bacterial infections, nasal polyps, and chronic purulent rhinitis in the first six years of life, and chronic bacterial infections, bacterial pneumonia, and bronchiectasis later in life. Thus, we hypothesized that Cif facilitates the degradation of the TAP complex, resulting in reduced viral antigen presentation via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and therefore, diminished immune response to viral pathogens. Recombinant Cif protein reduced TAP1, but not TAP2, protein abundance in polarized human airway epithelial cells (CFBE41o-cells) in a time-dependent manner. The Cif-mediated reduction in TAP1 was more dramatic in CFBE41o-cells, as compared to WT-CFTR complemented CFBE41o-cells. Cif inhibited ubiquitin specific protease 10 (USP10), a deubiquitinating enzyme, resulting in increased poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TAP1. The inhibition of USP10 by Cif was more profound in CFBE41o-cells as compared to WT-CFTR complemented CFBE41o-cells. The Cif-mediated decrease in TAP1 expression reduced ating the differences between normal and CF cells, including the AMPK-Akt-GSK-3\u03b2 axis. Pretreating IB3-1 cells with metformin (AMPK activator) or inhibitors of Akt or GSK-3\u03b2 had negligible or subtle inhibitory effects on flagellin-specific responses, but completely reversed the ability of IDR-1018 to inhibit airway cell cytokine secretion.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Taken together, these data implicate the AMPK-Akt-GSK-3\u03b2 axis in mediating dysfunctional responses of CF cells to immunomodulatory therapeutics, and indicate the utility of systems biology in identifying signalling pathways which underlie abnormal pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by CF cells. Mechanical clearance of mucus constitutes the primary airway defense mechanism and without which, the mucus layer is not only ineffective in airway defense, but the accumulated mucus contributes to airway pathophysiology. Traditionally, two primary mechanical mechanisms are known to be important in airway mucus clearance; 1) mucociliary clearance (MCC) and 2) cough clearance. While both MCC and cough clearance have been extensively studied, there have been almost no studies on a purported third mechanism of mucus clearance; cilia-independent two phase gas-liquid transport (GLT). This clearance mechanism was proposed over two decades ago using mechanical models to suggest airflow-mediated mucus clearance at airflow velocities of normal breathing. Despite the potential importance of gas-liquid transport in airway clearance, studies directly investigating this clearance mechanism using in vivo systems are completely absent. To investigate the role of GLT on airway clearance, we developed a mouse model that was devoid of ciliated cells (by SO 2 exposure, 500 ppm for 3 hrs) and studied the effect of breathing on radiotracer clearance. To assess mucus transport by both these mechanisms, we used radiolabeled sulfur colloid particles (99mTc-SC) focally deposited (150 nl of radiotracer) in the main stem bronchus and imaged clearance by gamma camera scintigraphy. At day 3 post-SO 2 treatment, radiotracer clearance was measured on SO 2 -treated mice as well as controls. While the rate of clearance in the SO 2 -treated mice was reduced about 2 fold from the control mice (from 13.5\u00b11.0 to 8.7\u00b13.0 %/min), these mice were still able to clear the tracer in the absence of cilia. We allowed the mice to recover for one day following the first imaging procedure, and then again anesthetized the mice, delivered the isotope and immediately killed the mice by exsanguination and repeated our imaging protocol. Because cilia will still continue to beat effectively for many hours following death, the control mice still exhibited a robust clearance (12.2\u00b11.0 %/min) which was not significantly different from alive, control, mice. This suggests that when cilia are capable of beating effectively, MCC represents the dominant mechanism of mucus clearance. However, after death and cessation of breathing, the SO 2 -treated mice exhibited virtually no airway clearance (0.4\u00b10.3 %/min). These data indicate that in the absence of beating cilia, the movement of air in live SO 2 -treated mice is capable of resulting in substantial airway clearance. However, without airflow or the mechanical forces associated with breathing, airway clearance dropped to zero. These data demonstrate for the first time that GLT is an important mechanism of airway clearance, providing significant clearance when mucociliary clearance is impaired. We predict that gas-liquid transport is an important mechanism for airway clearance, and identifying variables that improve GLT may be important in optimizing this method of airway clearance in vivo including in CF patients. Because CF airways exhibit fluid hyperabsorption, resulting in PCL collapse and mucus thickening, we speculate that this transport system is defective in CF.",

Furthermore, Cif decreased MHC class I presentation of peptide in a timedependent manner and eliminated CD8 T cell recognition of influenza Ainfected cells. We propose that P. aeruginosa, by secreting the Cif toxin, inhibits the ability of CD8 T cells to recognize and eliminate viral infections, severely compromising the immune defenses in the lungs of CF patients. This is the first bacterial toxin that inhibits the viral immune response of the host, potentially illuminating a mechanism for the clinical observation that viral-bacterial co-infections dramatically increase the morbidity of CF patients chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa. This work was supported by grants from the CF Foundation, BOMBER08F0 and Research Development Program (RDP: STANTO7R0), and the NIH (R01-HL074175 and P20 RR-018787). A structured-based Virtual Screening (VS) of differently substituted furocoumarins and analogues has been carried out against NF-\u03baB to select molecules for their ability to inhibit the binding of this transcription factor with the DNA. The focus library was developed starting from known chemical structures from literature as well as retrieving compounds from suitable commercial databases on the network. The first step of the present study was the construction of a customized small molecules database. The prepared library of 1710 compounds contained 54 structures of angelicin derivatives (molecular weight range: 186-478), 1384 of psolaren derivatives (molecular weight range: 186-619), 51 of Furo(3,2-c) chromen-4one structures (molecular weight range: 268-439) and 166 of benzoquinolizin-5-one analogues (molecular weight range: 258-499). Molecular docking approach was followed against NF-\u03baB in both p50 aggregation states using Glide software. The docking studies were carried out by using the extra precision (XP) method on a subset of 1000 molecules selected by preceding Standard Precision (SP) procedure as implemented in Glide software. The selection of interesting docked compounds was based on the docking GlideScore (G-Score) values in each target. All the individuated best ranked ligand poses in both dimer and monomer, were localized in the DNA binding surface of the N-terminal domains involved in the formation of the solvent-filled cavity as in case of active cellular dimeric aggregation process. Among the ten highest-scored ligands selected from docking studies, five different molecules were commercially available and investigated in further experimental analysis. Four furocoumarin derivatives showed IC50 values in the range of 40-100 \u00b5M in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Three compounds significantly inhibited NF-\u03baB dependent biological functions in cystic fibrosis IB3-1 cells infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (expression of IL-8). These findings on one hand validated the virtual screening approach here presented and reinforce the successful results of our previous computational studies to a difficult target as NF-\u03baB. On the other hand, the discovered four novel compounds could be of relevance to identify more potent inhibitors of NF-\u03baB dependent biological functions which could be beneficial to control lung inflammation of CF patients. Background: CF is characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation causing damage and repair mechanisms that lead to fibrosis. The alternatively activated macrophage (AAM) phenotype is an important subtype of cell involved in tissue remodeling-the role of AAM in the CF lung has not been investigated. Previous work in our lab has associated AAM markers with pulmonary function decline in a CF patient population. We have also demonstrated that azithromycin (AZM), a common therapy for CF, induces markers of alternative activation. AAM are important in repair mechanisms and orchestrate the build-up of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through production of key mediators such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2). Conversely, proteins involved in turnover of the ECM, such as matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9), are down-regulated. Both TGF\u03b2 and MMP-9 have been shown to be increased in CF patients.",

Microbiology and Immunology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA Recent studies (7, 8) suggest that the \u2206F508 mutation in CFTR reduces the proinflammatory response to infection in airway epithelia. We therefore applied a novel metanalytical approach (1) to microarray studies that measured the effect of 1 to 4 hour P. aeruginosa (PA) exposures on human airways cell lines expressing either \u2206F508-CFTR or wt-CFTR (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . These included two \u2206F508-CFTR cell lines (IB3 and CFBE41o-) and four wt-CFTR (S9, A549, CALU3 and BEAS2B) lines. We found that PA exposure activated a suite of inflammatory genes including IL-6, IL-8, and NF\u03baB1 in all 6 lines. Notably, PA exposure caused less robust cytokine gene activation in \u2206F508-CFTR lines than in wt-CFTR lines (P<0.05). As many would predict stronger activation by \u2206F508-CFTR cell lines, we performed microar-p<0.05). In contrast, no relationship was observed between serum vD and BAL LL-37. This molecule is known to be sensitive to proteolysis and can be degraded by both neutrophil elastase and MMPs, which could therefore mask any effect of vD on LL-37 expression.

This suggests that correction of EFA abnormalities, and by extension, CF-related pathology, is mediated through regulation of these enzymes. Background: Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease is characterized by exuberant inflammation. Pharmacological modulation of this inflammation without compromising antibacterial defenses is a desired therapeutic goal in CF. Current drugs (systemic corticosteroids, high-dose ibuprofen) are effective clinically, however, their serious adverse effects necessitate a search for novel, safer medications. Production of many inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, are regulated transcriptionally (NF-\u03baB, JNK and p38 MAPKs) and post-transcriptionally (p38 MAPK). Identification of molecular mechanisms of current drugs should facilitate development of prospective therapies. Recently, we ruled out NF-\u03baB as a potential molecular target to decrease IL-8 because both systemic corticosteroid dexamethasone (Dex) and high-dose ibuprofen (Ibu) suppress NF-\u03baB transactivation, but only Dex down-regulates IL-8 production {Dauletbaev N et al., Respiration 2010;79:234}. Specific objective of this study was to identify molecular targets responsible for the decrease of stimulated IL-8 production in CF respiratory epithelium. MKP-1 is the major negative regulator of JNK and p38 MAPKs, and a recently recognized molecular target for corticosteroids. We hypothesized that MKP-1 is the principal molecular target of Dex responsible for the decrease in stimulated IL-8.",

Only Dex decreased IL-8 production in CFTE29o-cells (IC50 ~4 nM). Further, only Dex up-regulated MKP-1 mRNA expression (2.3-fold increase; p<0.01). MKP-1 silencing by siRNA resulted in hyperproduction of IL-8, with a greater magnitude on IL-1\u03b2 stimulation (>2-fold increase; p<0.001). This IL-8 hyperproduction was due to transcriptional mechanisms and did not involve increased mRNA stability (Actinomycin D pulse-chase). Further, IL-8 hyperproduction in MKP-1 silenced cells was completely reversed by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (IC50 ~0.2 \u00b5M), whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 did not show any effects at equimolar concentrations. The ability of Dex to down-regulate IL-8 was significantly (>25%; p<0.01) diminished by MKP-1 siRNA silencing.

            "text": "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of CF pulmonary disease. The increased oxidant stress burden of the CF lung arises from the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from activated neutrophils recruited to infections sites. Furthermore, there are decreased anti-oxidant levels due to decreased absorption of fat soluble antioxidant vitamins from the diet, as well as decreased glutathione transport via CFTR. Using the model human epithelial airway cell lines, 16HBE14o-and CFBE41o-, we have confirmed that non-CF epithelial cells are indeed much more susceptible to oxidant stress. To do this, we utilized the stable oxidant stressor tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) to induce oxidant stress. We exposed both 16HBE14o-and CFBE41o-cells to increasing concentrations of t-BOOH and monitored cell viability using an MTT assay. No significant cell death was apparent in the 16HBE14o-cells at t-BOOH concentrations between 50 -500\u00b5M, while 1000 \u00b5M was toxic to nearly all of the cells. In contrast, the CFBE41o-cells succumbed to t-BOOH at much lower concentrations; for example, application of 200 \u00b5M t-BOOH resulted in a cell viability of 98.9 \u00b1 2.1 % for the 16HBE14o-cells versus 4.2 \u00b1 1.3 % for the CFBE41o-cells, suggesting that CF cells are inherently less able to deal with exposure to oxidant stress. As a result of these findings, we hypothesised that the heme-oxygenase (HO) system may be dysfunctional in the CF cells, and this may play some role in the differential effects of oxidant stress on CF and normal cells. HO is a member of the heat shock family, of which HO-1 is induced by a number of stresses related to oxidative stress and inflammation. HO-1 is reportedly upregulated in CF patients, likely as a cytoprotective mechanism. HO-2 is expressed constitutively in a number of cell types, though little is known about its role in the airways. Initially, we confirmed via RT-PCR, that both 16HBE14o-and CFBE41o-cells express HO-1 and HO-2. We additionally investigated expression of mPGES-1 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1) in both cell types, since previous reports indicate that HO-1 induction affects mPGES-1 expression and consequent PGE2 protection. Again, via RT-PCR, we determined mPGES-1 mRNA expression in both cell lines. Using quantitative PCR, we next investigated the effects of short term oxidant stress on HO-1, HO-2 and mPGES-1 expression. Exposure of cells to 600 \u00b5M H 2 O 2 for 2 hours resulted in significant decreases in HO-1, HO-2 and mPGES-1 levels in the 16HBE14ocells, with no significant difference in expression in the CFBE41o-cells. This concentration of H 2 O 2 caused no cytotoxicity. These findings are in contrast to our predicted results, since oxidant stress generally induces HO-1 expression. Further experiments are underway to delineate the role of HO and oxidant stress in airway epithelial cells.",

Airway surface dehydration in \u03b2ENaC-overexpressing transgenic mice (Scnn1b-Tg) impairs mucus clearance, resulting in neonatal mortality and development of complex lung pathology in surviving mice. Spontaneous neonatal bacterial colonization previously demonstrated in Scnn1b-Tg mice suggests that pathogen associated molecular patterns accumulating in static mucus may trigger an innate inflammatory response by signaling through pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We have also previously noted that the combination of poor mucus clearance and absence of the TLR downstream signaling in Scnn1b-Tg mice lacking the TLR adapter molecule MyD88, enhances bacterial colonization in neonatal mice and decreases bacterial clearance in older mice, as compared to MyD88-sufficient Scnn1b-Tg mice. Among the TLRs upstream of MyD88, TLR2 and TLR4 recognize bacterial wall components and are known to function in respiratory epithelial and inflammatory cells, respectively. To test the hypothesis that TLR2 and TLR4 signaling contribute to host defense and the development and progression of lung pathology due to airway surface dehydration, we bred Scnn1b-Tg mice (hemizygous, inbred line C57BL/6N-6608, average survival 75%) with mice deficient in TLR2 or TLR4 or both in combination. Although redundancy in TLR signaling is thought to achieve effective airway immune surveillance in the absence of a single TLR, we found that absence of either TLR2 or TLR4 in Scnn1b-Tg mice caused a severe drop in neonatal survival in comparison to TLR-sufficient Scnn1b-Tg mice (TLR2 -/-, Scnn1b-Tg 58 \u00b1 7%, n=43 vs. TLR2 +/-, Scnn1b-Tg 81 \u00b1 7%, n=33; TLR4 -/-, Scnn1b-Tg 46 \u00b1 14%, n=13 vs. TLR4 +/-, Scnn1b-Tg 65 \u00b1 8%, n=32). Moreover, preliminary data suggest that the effect of combined TLR2 and TLR4 deletion on survival is additive. Absence of TLR2 or TLR4 did not eliminate neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration in surviving mice, phenotyped at 5 weeks of age, and did not significantly modify the lung pathology characteristic of Scnn1b-Tg mice, namely mucus plugs, mucous secretory cell hyperplasia, airway inflammation and emphysema. Assessment of, bacterial burden, sepsis and lung pathology in neonatal mice from all TLR -/-Scnn1b-Tg crosses are in progress. These results highlight the importance of innate defense mechanisms in the neonatal period and suggest that while TLR2 and TLR4 per se are not essential for developing or sustaining chronic lung pathology in the Scnn1b-Tg mouse model, they are non-redundantly critical for host defense that enables neonatal survival in the context of defective mucus clearance. Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis who have identical CFTR genotypes can have marked variation in pulmonary phenotype. We have previously demonstrated high inter-individual variation in Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immune responses in humans and have found that these responses are down-regulated in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) relative to healthy controls (ref). The mechanism underlying this down-regulation of TLR-mediated responses is not known.",

RNA was also purified from leukocytes from healthy controls frequency-matched for age and gender. We performed quantitative real-time PCR to measure the level of mRNA expression for SOCS1, TOLLIP, IRAKM, SARM1, SHIP1(INPP5D), AKT1, as well as TLR4 and TLR7. Levels of beta-actin and GAPDH mRNA were used to normalize the gene It is well known that pulmonary acquisition of P. aeruginosa (Ps. a.) by individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) portends declining lung function. Ps. a. lung infection is characterized by destructive neutrophilic inflammation thought to result in part from airway epithelial cells responding to Ps. a. by secreting pro-inflammatory chemotactic factors. We have previously shown that acute stimulation of well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial (W-D hBE) cells with sterile Ps. a. culture filtrates strongly stimulates CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL8 and CCL20 production. After chronic Ps. a. stimulation, secretion of these cytokines was somewhat reduced, but was sustained at significantly higher levels than the original baseline. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this new pro-inflammatory state, we treated W-D hBE cultures with control, bacterial growth medium or with Ps. a. conditioned medium for three consecutive days, referred to as na\u00efve and Ps. a.-adapted cells, respectively. We obtained mRNA expression profiles using microarrays for both na\u00efve and adapted cells at baseline and four hours after control or Ps. a. challenge using cells from six individuals at each time point. We found higher steady state mRNA levels for the above cytokines in Ps. a.-adapted cells, which was validated by qRT-PCR. Higher cytokine protein production in Ps. a.-adapted cells correlated with elevated mRNA levels, suggesting transcriptional regulation. To understand altered cytokine mRNA transcription in W-D hBE cells, the full-length CXCL8 promoter driving luciferase expression was cloned into a lentiviral vector, which was used to infect primary hBE and growth extended UNCN3T cells. After infection, the cells were differentiated for 21-28 days at an air-liquid interface and assayed for luciferase activity in response to Ps. a. or control challenge. We observed enhanced basal CXCL8 promoter activity in Ps. a.adapted cells without further stimulation by subsequent rounds of Ps. a. challenge. Via mutation of the CXCL8 promoter, we determined that specific proximal NF-\u03baB and C/EBP transcription factor binding sites regulated the enhanced baseline expression after adaptation to Ps. a. Each site had a specific role, i.e. the NF-\u03baB promoter binding site was essential for both inducible and enhanced basal activity of the CXCL8 promoter in na\u00efve and Ps. a.-adapted cells. However, Ps. a. did not stimulate a minimal NF-\u03baB binding site reporter construct in adapted cells, suggesting that the NF-\u03baB alone was not sufficient to drive the enhanced baseline transcription in Ps. a.-adapted cells. Mutation of the C/EBP element adjacent to the NF-\u03baB site in the CXCL8 promoter similarly decreased the response of both na\u00efve and Ps. a.-adapted cells to Ps. a. stimulation. However, inhibition of C/EBP\u03b2 with shRNA increased basal CXCL8 promoter activity, suggesting that chronic exposure to Ps. a. releases C/EBP\u03b2 repression. These results suggest that pharmacologic manipulation of the pathways resulting in C/EBP\u03b2 derepression may be useful to reduce sustained neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs of CF patients. Introduction/Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is marked by a robust inflammatory response. Macrophages are key regulators of innate immunity as they are responsible for bacterial phagocytosis and recruitment of neutrophils. Previous studies demonstrate that changes in membrane potential accompany phagocytosis in macrophages and that chloride (Cl -) channels may be important in this process. We hypothesize that Clflux is present in macrophages and that multiple Clpathways contribute to this flux.",

Introduction: Using data from the North American Cystic Fibrosis Gene Modifier Consortium, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for Meconium Ileus (MI), using 556,445 SNPs typed on 3,655 CF patients, 615 of whom had MI. We did not observe any genome-wide significant results, based on a p-value criterion of 5x10 -8 or a q-value (FDR adjusted p-value) of 0.05. It is common for a GWAS to result in suggestive but not overwhelming evidence for association. Recent methodological work suggests that such single-SNP analysis approaches are a preliminary step in the gene identification process, where methods that help to prioritize observed results should then be used. Pathway analysis is a popular method to prioritize single-SNP results (referred to as GWAS-PA), however an interactive pathway is but one hypothesis for disease mechanism and can be restrictive, since contributing genes/proteins can relate to residual or compensating activities in other ways that could span multiple processes. We apply a more general approach to our MI GWAS results, that we refer to as the Hypothesis-driven GWAS (GWAS-HD), highlighting that any hypothesis can be tested within this framework. Given that loss of CFTR leads to CF with perturbed epithelial transport, we considered that coincident phenotypes including MI reflect residual or adapted transport capability. The polarization of epithelial tissue involves distinct cell localization for many transport-relevant proteins and we hypothesized that constituents of the apical plasma membrane, where CFTR normally resides, may be contributors.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is due to mutations in the chloride channel CFTR gene causing impairment of chloride secretion in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The most common CFTR mutation in CF is the deletion of the phenylalanine at the position 508 of the protein (\u2206F508), leading to the retention of CFTR in the ER and its rapid degradation via ERAD pathway. More than 1700 mutations have been identified so far, variably affecting CFTR activity but none of them have been clearly linked to a certain pathophysiology. In other words, even if carrying the same genotype, CF patients might face a different development in their disease. Clearly, CF disease also depends on other genetic and/or environmental factors. Lately, a number of studies focus on modifier genes that may determine severity of lung disease, as e.g. Mannose Binding Lectin and Transforming Growth Factor beta. Recently, Wright et al. performed whole-genome microarrays assays of nasal cells from non-CF individuals, mild CF and homozygous \u2206F508-CFTR patients and found a total of 652 out of 1187 genes differentially expressed in these three groups (1) .",

Since NBS, the percentage of patients followed in our institution with 2 mutations and negative/intermediate sweat tests is significantly greater. Most patients are compound heterozygotes for a severe and mild allele, or two mild alleles; many meet criteria for CRMS. This has implications for treatment and management of patients and psychosocial implications for families coping with the uncertainty regarding if or when their child may develop symptoms. Introduction: New treatments are needed to improve the health of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Controlling lung-damaging inflammation is likely to be beneficial but specific anti-inflammatory targets have not been identified.

Unlike repaired cells with higher ribonuclease H (RNASEH2) levels, the CF cells possess relative higher expression of the RNASEL and RNASET2, which have been implicated in carcinogenesis. As a result of the aberrant expression profile of multiple RNA controlling genes, the CF cells demonstrate distinct expression profiles for the gene transcripts which correspond to different isoforms, thereby implying alternative RNA splicing. Among various genes that appeared to be alternatively spliced in CF cells, we identified the RNA-binding MSI2 which further suggested alterations in posttranscriptional RNA control. In addition, differentially expressed transcripts for multiple genes involved in cell death/proliferation (PDCD2, JADE1, BAIAP2, CDCA7, and CDK10) indicated dysregulation of the cell survival associated transcriptional control in CF-inflammation.",

However, whether these changes are causal or compensating is yet to be discerned. Background: Some studies report a decrease in incidence of CF while others observe a consistent incidence. The Minnesota (MN) Newborn Screening (NBS) Program, initiated in March 2006, measures immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) followed by DNA analysis for infants with IRT values above the 96th percentile, or >170 ng/ml. According to CF Foundation guidelines, infants with two CFTR disease-causing mutations and normal sweat tests have CF or CFTR-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS), and evaluation is recommended.

In CF, the delta F508 mutation is the most common in Caucasian population but is less common in South Asians (1) . A high incidence of novel mutations has been reported in South Asians (1) . We present two patients with V456A that have significant disease. An 11-yr old female of Pakistani descent with consanguineous parents was admitted to the hospital for severe obstructive lung disease, respiratory distress and hypoxia. FEV1 was 32% predicted and FEF25-75 was 33% predicted. Initial sweat test was negative. Immunological evaluation, including HIV, was normal. Sputum cultures were positive for Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A repeat sweat test by quantitative ionotrophic electrophoresis was borderline (40 mEq/L and 39 mEq/L). Bronchoscopy with lavage and biopsy showed diffuse mucoid secretions and normal ciliary architecture. CT of the sinuses showed pan sinus disease and CT scan of chest showed multiple areas of atelectasis and bronchiectasis. Subsequent CF genetic analysis including gross deletions revealed that the patient was homozygous for V456 A. We have also followed a 6-year old female of Indian descent who presented with positive newborn screening and failure to thrive. She was a compound heterozygote for V456A with mild lung disease and a borderline sweat test. Both of these patients were negative for the most common CFTR mutations. V456A was initially called a novel variation but now is described as mild pathogenic mutation (2) . Patient # 1 who is homozygous for V456A presented with a severe phenotype.

Rationale: Epithelial Na + Channels (ENaC) are located on the apical membrane of airway cells, playing an important role in airway surface liquid (ASL) maintainence through regulation of Na + influx. Individuals with CF suffer from hyperabsorption of Na + and consequently thick, viscous mucus and reduced ASL. Genetic knock-out models have shown that disruption of the alpha subunit results in the greatest attenuation in channel activity in alveolar cells. Previous work in humans has suggested that the A663T genotype of the alpha subunit of ENaC may help protect against hypertension, suggesting reduced ENaC function with the T polymorphism at amino acid 663 compared to the wild-type (A663A). Since stimulation of the \u03b2 2adrenergic receptors results in an increase in number and activity of ENaC, we sought to determine the influence of genetic variation at position 663 of ENaC on exhaled Na + in individuals with CF following \u03b2 2 stimulation. cause significant disease and support the theory that novel mutations are prevalent in South Asian populations. Background: CFTR mutations can be classified according to loss of function, with class 1, 2 and 3 mutations (including dF508) resulting in severely reduced CFTR function, while class 4 and 5 have some residual function. While CFTR functional classes are known to predict pancreatic status and survival, their association with clinical characteristics in young CF patients is poorly understood.",

With a carrier frequency of 1/30 to 1/40, the most common mutation of the CFTR gene, F508del, is present in the whole population of central and western Europe and in their descendants residing elsewhere such as in North America. The origin and the age of the F508del is still a matter of debate and controversy. Although Serre et al (1) estimated F508del to be 3000-6000 years old, Morral et al (2) reported an \"age\" (duration of prevalence) approximating 52000 years. In order to gain new insight in this debate and improve our understanding of the origin and distribution of F508del, we selected homozygous CF patients and their parents (trios) in three current European populations (Irish, Austrian, Breton) and used the likelihoodbased method developed by Genin et al (3) to estimate the age of the most recent common ancestors of F508del mutation carriers. Unrelated CF patients and their relatives from Ireland (20), Austria (27), and Brittany, France (16) were included in the study. Microsatellites around the CFTR gene (7q31) were screened as previously described by Fichou et al (4) . These sequences were amplified by multiplex PCR using universal fluorescent labelling. Haplotypes at the 10 microsatellites loci were reconstructed, and the age of the most recent common ancestor was estimated using the estiage program (3). The age of the most common ancestor was estimated with 95% confidence interval: for the samples from Brittany, the result was 3750 years (2550-5625), for Austria 3650 years (2725-4950), and for Ireland 3925 years (2775-5675).

This 32 kDa transmembrane protein of unknown function has been found to be upregulated following hypoxia [1] and ER stress [2] , and downregulated by asthma and smoking [3] , and is thereby implicated in pathways relevant to CF pathophysiology.

We also confirmed that in these cells TMEM45a was up-regulated by hypoxia (4fold; p<0.0001). Next, using a polyclonal antibody against TMEM45a (C-13, Santa Cruz) we determined the intracellular localization of this protein by immunocytofluorescence. We found a punctate expression pattern for TMEM45a in several different cell types (HBE, CFBE, 293-HEK) corresponding to that expected for a centrosomal protein. Partial co-localization with \u03b1and \u03b3-tubulin further suggested that TMEM45a is present in the pericentriolar matrix, a mass of proteinaceous material that organizes microtubules in the cytoplasm and mitotic spindle [4] . Our data also showed that the TMEM45a stained structure is dynamic, sometimes ring-shaped, sometimes taking the form of a pair of centrioles, and sometimes dispersed, e.g., during spindle formation and mitosis. When condensed, the structure is associated with the Golgi apparatus, as shown by co-localization with Golgi-P58 protein. The CFTR gene has been cloned 2 decennia ago, and over 1500 CFTR mutations have been identified. However, in certain genotypes we are still uncertain about the accompanying phenotype and their prognosis. Although one can divide CFTR mutations by type and phenotypic result (Castellani 2008 , Farrell 2008 , some gene variations like R117H remain difficult to classify due to the large variety in clinical outcome.

            "text": "Conclusion: We showed that homozygosity for the R117H mutation does not predict clinical presentation. Our female patient was without any disease phenotype and produced offspring, whereas our male patient presented with CBAVD. Therefore, this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is possibly associated with vas deferens dysfunction, but not with classical CF characterized by pulmonary or intestinal involvement. However, the presence of two CF mutations including R117H-7T on one allele can be associated with late presentation and severe lung disease (Peckham et al 2006) . The borderline sweat test in both patients does suggest a degree of CFTR dysfunction at least in this organ system. Therefore, we think it is too early to exclude this mutation from NBS. We will continue our analysis by including the phenotype and function tests of the R117H compound heterozygous patients to gain further knowledge on the penetration of the R117H mutation and the justification of its presence in the NBS panel. The phenotype of homozygous-\u2206F508 human subjects varies considerably, suggesting that genes other than CFTR modulate CF disease expression. The Yeast Oligomycin Resistance gene is an ABC transporter analo-gous to human CFTR. yor1-\u2206F670 (containing a mutation corresponding to \u2206F508 in human CFTR) displays a CFTR-\u2206F508-like phenotype with regard to protein misfolding as judged by limited proteolysis and defective biogenesis. Sixty-three percent of genes described previously for the human CFTR Proteome (hCFTRP, Balch, et al. Cell. 2006 ) have yeast orthologs (as compared to only 23% human-yeast orthologs overall). A yeast model of ABC protein maturation therefore offers a powerful means to identify, prioritize, and determine the epistatic relationships among genes that influence ABC protein trafficking. In the present study, we are applying a novel method, Quantitative High Throughput Cellular Phenotyping (Q-HTCP), in combination with a molecular genetic protocol called SGA (synthetic genetic array) for introducing a tetracycline regulatable allele of yor1-\u2206F into the complete genomic collection of yeast deletion strains. This strategy has allowed us to identify enhancers and suppressors of oligomycin resistance in order to investigate their potential roles in biogenesis and trafficking to the plasma membrane of yor1-\u2206F. By analyzing kinetic growth curves for 4850 double mutant strains at multiple concentrations of oligomycin, we have defined several modifier gene categories relevant to yor1-\u2206F maturational processing. These functional categories include well known chaperones, protein trafficking genes and components of the ubiquitination and proteasome pathways previously shown to mediate defective biogenesis of CFTR-\u2206F508. Based on encouraging results from the primary screens, secondary genetic and computational studies were performed to prioritize hits. Biochemical and cell biological validation (QT-RT-PCR of yor1-\u2206F mRNA, cellular localization of yor1-\u2206F, pulse chase analysis) and computational screens (phenomic clustering of yor1-\u2206F modifiers, overlap of hits with related genetic screens) will be presented. We have also confirmed that a novel, evolutionarily conserved protein folding complex, recently identified by another laboratory and with relevance to CFTR (Weissman, et al. Science. 2009 ), participates in the biogenesis of yor1-\u2206F. Reduced growth is a common manifestation in cystic fibrosis. Understanding the origins of the growth reduction observed in CF patients is important because of its correlation with severity of lung function and reduced survival. CFTR is present in many tissue types other than epithelia, and evidence is mounting that it is functional in these tissues and, in certain tissues, may even contribute to normal growth. CFTR is present in the brain and is hypothesized to play a role in acidification of synaptic vesicles in neurons. CFTR's loss in neurons may inhibit secretion of important neuropeptides and possibly disrupt growth. However, given the systemic nature of CF it is difficult to identify if loss of Cftr in the brain directly contributes to poor growth in CF. CF mouse models, which display reduced growth similar to humans with CF, provide a tool to identify factors that contribute to growth reduction in CF. We have created a conditional Cftr knockout (KO) mouse that provides the ability to inactivate Cftr in specific tissues and cell types. To test the hypothesis that Cftr function in the brain may affect growth, we specifically inactivated Cftr in all neurons using our mouse model system. In these neuronal specific Cftr KO mice, we observed normal Cftr function in nasal and intestinal epithelium but complete absence of Cftr expression in the brain supporting neuron specific deletion of Cftr. We were surprised to find that in contrast to CF mice in which poor growth is evident within days of birth, the neuronal specific Cftr KO mice were indistinguishable from littermates early in life but by 15 days of age were significantly smaller than control littermates (p<0.05). At 6 weeks of age growth reduction was still evident (p<0.05). Interestingly, body mass index (BMI) of these mice was similar to control mice and significantly increased compared to CF mice (p<0.05). These findings may be due to an increase in inguinal fat in neuronal specific Cftr KO mice (p<0.05) compared to CF mice which have very little inguinal fat. In addition, Insulin Like Growth Factor-1 (Igf-1), an important regulator of growth, was significantly reduced in neuronal specific Cftr KO mice and CF mice compared to controls (p< 0.005). Our findings in these neuronal specific Cftr KO mice are similar to findings observed in Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease in which the majority of the morbidity and mortality is associated with progressive pulmonary infection and inflammation. In the past, studies exploring the causes of CF pulmonary disease have been hindered by the absence of an animal model that develops lung disease similar to humans. The development of the pig model for CF provided us with the opportunity to study the early features of pulmonary disease, including the timing of the onset of infection and inflammation. The development of spontaneous pulmonary disease in older CF pigs and the documentation of a defect in the ability of newborn CFTR-/-pigs to eradicate bacteria, enabled us to investigate early temporal events regarding the onset of pulmonary inflammation in this model. Here we summarize results from experiments done in newborn pigs (within 6-12 hrs post birth). Histopathological examination of the airways and parenchyma revealed no evidence of cellular inflammation, with the newborn CFTR-/-lungs appearing very similar to that of their CFTR+/+ littermates. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed on several newborn animals to measure total cell counts, neutrophil percentage and IL-8 concentrations in BAL fluid found no statistically significant differences between genotypes. We also evaluated gene transcript profiles in trachea, bronchi, and distal lung in newborn CFTR+/+ and CFTR-/-pigs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering segregated samples into two clusters: airway (trachea + bronchi) and distal lung; but failed to segregate samples based on CFTR genotype. A very small number of genes were identified by ANOVA to be differentially expressed between the two genotypes. However, neither did these genes exhibit consistent change in expression across the three tissues, nor were they involved in any pathway or gene network based on analysis done using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Database for Annotaton, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). To explore for the presence of enriched pathways, we queried the microarray data using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). No evidence of a pathway, gene network, or signaling cascade consistent with inflammation in the lungs of newborn CF pigs was identified. To specifically investigate the enrichment of pathways involved in innate immunity, host defense, fluid and electrolyte transport, and other systems relevant to CF pathogenesis, we made several custom gene sets for GSEA based on published literature. No statistically significant enrichment was observed in the CFTR-/-samples. Finally, on looking for intersections between our data and previously published expression profiling in CF, we found no genes common between our work and previous studies that were relevant to CF pathogenesis and consistently changed in the porcine data. These data indicate that newborn CFTR-/-pigs manifest a lung host defense defect before the onset of inflammation. Normal airway epithelial cells have the capacity to absorb and secrete salt via active ion transport mechanisms, with a resultant movement of water in response to the generated osmotic gradient. However, as a consequence of defective CFTR in CF cells, the control of secretion of Clions and water flux is disturbed, leading to dehydrated airway mucosa and cessation of mucociliary clearance (MCC). Hypertonic saline (HS) is an ionic rehydrating agent that increases the osmotic pressure on the surface of the airway epithelium and draws water down an imposed osmotic gradient into the airway surface liquid (ASL). Aerosolized HS has been clinically proven to be an effective therapy in CF, resulting in improved MCC and FEV1. Despite mouse models in which the growth hormone pathway is disrupted due to specific gene mutations. Similarities between these mouse models suggest that the growth hormone pathway may be disrupted in CF due to loss of Cftr in the brain. These results also suggest that loss of Cftr in the brain may contribute to an overall endocrine dysfunction that could contribute to endocrine abnormalities observed in CF patients. Further investigation is necessary on the specific role Cftr plays in the brain and how its loss may contribute to growth. These studies suggest that therapeutic strategies for CFTR correction should include the targeting of non-epithelial tissues to facilitate correction of CF manifestations. Nearly all male cystic fibrosis (CF) patients exhibit tissue abnormalities in the reproductive tract, a condition that renders them azoospermic and infertile, a phenotype not present in CF mouse models. Progress in defining a causal link between CFTR mutations and duct atresia has been hindered by the lack of an animal model that includes CBAVD. Two porcine CF models have been reported recently that include respiratory and digestive manifestations that are comparable to human CF. The goal of this study was to determine whether a male reproductive tract phenotype is present in the porcine CF models. Tracts from newborn CFTR -/-, CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 and wildtype (WT) littermates were isolated, placed in ice-cold buffer and studied in 24 hours. Inspections of CFTR -/tracts revealed that 14 of 14 samples exhibited vas deferens and/or epididymis abnormalities, while 28 of 28 WT littermates presented normal anatomy. Vas deferens atresia was often localized to the distal region of the duct (prostatic end), with a variable proportion of the proximal vasa being present. Epididymal atresia was present in 13 of 14 CFTR -/tracts, and was consistently localized to the corpus epididymis. In some cases, only rudimentary caput and cauda epididymes were present. Among CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 , 2 revealed disruptions in the corpus epididymis and no overt atresia was observed in 2 tissues, although the vasa appeared more fragile and thinner. Histology from the CFTR -/vas deferens often revealed the presence of a lumen lined by epithelial cells. Epithelial cells delineated round areas of empty space adjacent to the basement membrane, suggesting the formation of cysts. Signs of epithelial cell degeneration and luminal debris were present. Epithelial cells lining patent vas deferens were isolated and grown on permeable supports for electrophysiological and immunochemical analysis. Western blots revealed CFTR immunoreactivity only in WT, whereas signals were detected for SLC26A3 and SLC26A6 in all samples. When examined in Ussing chambers, WT exhibited transepithelial resistance that was 26% greater than CFTR -/and CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 , which suggests that the epithelial barrier is compromised in the absence of CFTR. WT responded to forskolin, norepinephrine, adenosine and PGE2 with increases in current (I SC ) that were subsequently sensitive to DASU-02 or bumetanide, as reported for adult porcine and human vas deferens epithelia. CFTR -/exhibited no discernable Isc responses, while CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 presented a degree of forskolin-induced Isc. When cultured in the presence of dexamethasone, all genotypes exhibited greater basal I SC that was sensitive to amiloride, again consistent with data reported for adult epithelia. Taken together, these results show that the male reproductive duct is fully formed during fetal development, but that CFTR -/and CFTR \u2206F508/\u2206F508 epididymes and vas deferens undergo atresia in late gestation. Epithelial cells lining the reproductive ducts can absorb Na + via ENaC, but CFTR -/are unable to secrete either Clor HCO 3 -, likely resulting in reduced duct luminal fluid volume, with abnormal characteristics. Mechanisms linking CFTR expression and ion transport abnormalities to duct atresia remain to be determined, and these porcine models appear to be ideal tools for such studies. [Supported by NIH HD058398.] its clinical use, however, little is known about the mechanism of action of HS in vitro. Previous studies evaluating the effects of HS have used large, non-physiologic volumes applied directly to the surface of airway epithelia. The goal of this study is to utilize an in vitro nebulizer-based delivery system to examine the effects of a nebulized dose of HS on ASL kinetics during and after treatment to human CF airway epithelial cultures.",

The bronchiolar epithelium has then to rapidly regenerate its structure in order to restore its defense functions. The aim of our study was to determine and characterize the sequence of events leading to the reconstitution of the human bronchiolar epithelium. Bronchioles were microdissected from lung samples and processed for histology, immunohistochemical characterization and epithelial cell dissociation. After two rounds of enzymatic dissociation, bronchiolar epithelial cells (BECs) were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI), and cultures were collected at different steps of the regeneration process for characterization of epithelial cell polarization, differentiation and functionality. Our results demonstrated that, at day 6, BECs formed a polarized monolayer expressing intercellular junction proteins. BECs started to differentiate at day 15, and at day 25, the cultures were well-differentiated, similar to the native human bronchiolar epithelium, and composed of basal, ciliated, goblet and Clara cells. The CC10 protein was detected in the secretory products collected from ALI cultures. The Ussing chamber technique showed that cAMP-induced chloride effluxes were detected at, and increased from the step of ciliated cells appearance (day 15) whereas CFTR mRNAs were expressed as early as day 5. Finally, the ability of BECs to kill S. aureus progressively increased during the course of regeneration, and in the well-differentiated cultures the ciliary beating frequency was similar to that measured for native bronchiolar epithelium sheets. In conclusion, we have developed an in vitro model allowing reconstitution of a fully mature and functional human bronchiolar epithelium. This model represents a tool for the analysis of the molecular events associated with CF and non-CF bronchiolar epithelium regeneration.",

            "text": "Conclusions: These results are an invaluable starting point for developing an in vitro model employing multiple, human cell types for further investigation of CF. We envisage that our models will be useful for comparing the response of human CF and non-CF airways to infection and inflammation. Submucosal glands (SMG) are recognized as an important tissue in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Some important functions include secretion of bulk liquid, electrolytes, mucin, and antimicrobial peptides and proteins. However, morphologic features of SMGs early in life are limited and often biased by multiple variables. We adopted a morphometric approach to characterize SMGs in fixed cross sections of neonatal CFTR-/-(CF) and CFTR+/+ (WT) pig trachea. The number of SMG ducts was reduced in CF pigs, however when normalized to lumen circumference, duct numbers were similar between CF and WT trachea suggesting similar frequency of SMG units. We then stereologically assessed SMG units (including ducts, acini, tubules, lumens). CF pigs had reduced SMG volume compared to control pigs, and this was also true even after normalization to lumen circumference and inner wall area. We found preferential SMG distribution along the posterior wall, followed by the anterior and then lateral walls. While this distribution pattern was similar for both groups, CF pigs had reduced SMG volume compared to WT pigs at each wall location. We assessed surface epithelium mucus with Periodic acid-Schiff and immunohistochemistry for MUC5AC and MUC5B; they showed similar mucus staining patterns in both genotypes. In contrast, periodic acid-Schiff and MUC5B staining were significantly reduced as a percentage of SMG volume in CF pigs, suggesting reduced mucous cell differentiation. This was confirmed by reduced cytokeratin 18 staining in CF SMGs, consistent with reduced mucous cell differentiation. SMG lumen size as a percent of SMG unit volume was the same in both genotypes, indicating that they were not dilated. We examined a proliferation marker (Ki-67) and found similar proliferation in CF and WT surface epithelium, but reduced proliferation in CF SMG. We then asked if there were changes in the global transcripts of SMG and surface epithelium. We found no enrichment in the surface epithelium gene set, but CF pigs had significant global reduction in SMG gene sets. Our data are consistent with immature and hypoplastic SMGs in the neonatal CF pig trachea. This is contrary to the hypertrophic and hyperplastic SMG changes often described in advanced CF disease. Furthermore, immature and small SMGs could have altered secretions, which could influence mucociliary clearance and antimicrobials levels in airway fluid, both potentially contributing to CF pathogenesis. Deletion of F508 in CFTR is the most common mutation that causes CF. In vitro studies have shown that the \u2206F508 mutation disrupts protein processing and decreases chloride channel function. However, the relationship between in vitro and in vivo behavior of CFTR\u2206F508 protein remains uncertain. In addition, lack of a CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 animal model has limited insight into pathophysiology and possible treatments. Therefore, we developed CFTR\u2206F508/\u2206F508 pigs (hereafter called \u2206F pigs). All \u2206F pigs had meconium ileus, and microgallbladder was common. Focal biliary cirrhosis was detected in some livers. The pancreas showed significant destruction, although detectably less severe than in CFTR-/-pigs. The \u2206F lung showed no evidence of inflammation and the morphology was similar to that of the CFTR-/-pigs. Thus, the histopathological findings in \u2206F pigs were strikingly similar to those in the null pig. We asked how CFTR mRNA and protein are altered in \u2206F pigs. Preliminary results indicated that mRNA levels in \u2206F intestine were approximately half those in wild-type littermates, consistent with our earlier results in CFTR+/\u2206F508 pigs. We also found a striking reduction in the amount of CFTR\u2206F508 protein in cultured and excised airway epithelia and in intestine. CFTR isolated from wild-type pigs was nearly all mature band C protein. In contrast, CFTR isolated from \u2206F pigs was present as both band B and band C. This pattern was the same in cultured and excised airway epithelia and in intestine. Immunocytochemistry showed wild-type CFTR in intestinal crypts and the apical membrane of airway epithelia. CFTR\u2206F508 was expressed in the same cells, but at greatly reduced levels, and much of the mutant protein was intracellular. These data are consistent with our earlier studies of in vitro recombinant porcine CFTR\u2206F508. To test CFTR\u2206F508 function, we assayed Clcurrent in intestine mounted in Ussing chambers. We found little to no forskolin-stimulated current in intestine with the exception of ileum where we also recovered The Ift88 TG737RpW polycystic kidney disease (PKD) mouse was developed as the result of a large-scale, transgene-induced insertional mutagenesis screen. An insertion disrupted the intraflagellar transport 88 (Ift88) locus, resulting in a hypomorphic murine allele (Ift88 TG737RpW ). Homozygous mice with this mutation not only exhibit renal cyst abnormalities, but also pancreatic and hepatic damage (including cyst formation) morphologically reminiscent of human cystic fibrosis. Cysts in PKD have been reported to develop in a fashion dependent upon CFTR expression. Moreover, Ift88 may have important ramifications with regard to the CF phenotype. For example, Ift88 is necessary for normal development of both immotile and motile cilia in mammalian epithelial tissues. Abnormalities attributable to motile cilia dysfunction have been noted previously in Ift88 TG737RpW mice, and defects in Clsecretion have been reported in certain tissues of the Ift88 mouse model. Taken together, these observations suggest a shared mechanistic pathway linking two very common congenital diseases defined by cyst formation. The present study was therefore intended to determine whether partial or total loss of CFTR would influence the phenotype of Ift88 TG737RpW mice, or if disruption of Ift88 (with disturbed epithelial ciliary activity) could negatively impact a CFTR-/-murine model. We bred CFTR tm1Unc/J mice onto the Ift88 TG737RpW strain (both strains congenic on either C57BL/6 or Balb/c backgrounds), and genotyped a colony of more than 60 individuals over several generations. Measurement of nasal potential difference, intestinal Isc, ciliary function (in murine airway cell monolayers), and histopathology will be presented for heterozygous and double homozygous mice to determine whether mutations in both genes confer physiologic or morphologic additivity. The study will also provide a formal test of the model in which PKD severity is dependent upon functional CFTR.",

            "text": "Supported by CFF and NIH. Small molecules and gene products that are capable of partially restoring the \u2206F508-CFTR folding and processing defect have been, predominantly, identified by function-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that measures the PKA-activated halide permeability of the plasma membrane. As a direct biochemical measurement, we developed a cell surface ELISA, which detects the extracellular 3HA-tag of the \u2206F508-CFTR, however, it entails multi-steps immunoperoxidase detection, which is not optimal for the HTS. To overcome this limitation we designed a robust, sensitive and economical biochemical assay that would permit performing chemical and genetic screens to identify additional corrector molecules and potential drug targets. The assay is based on the assumption that inserting the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme in the exofacial surface of CFTR would provide an enzyme activity in the extracellular compartment following the mutant translocation to the plasma membrane. To ensure that the CFTR-HRP preserves the biochemical and functional properties of the channel, the biosynthetic processing and chloride transport characteristics of the chimera were compared to that of CFTR-3HA. Processing of wt CFTR-HRP and the low temperature rescued \u2206F508-CFTR-HRP were confirmed by immunoblot analysis, as well as by glycosidase digestion in stably transfected BHK cells. Preliminary metabolic pulse chase and cell surface stability measurements indicate that the turnover of the wt and rescued \u2206F508-CFTR-HRP variants are comparable to that of their 3HA-tagged counter-the highest amount of CFTR\u2206F508 protein. Excised and cultured airway epithelia studied in Ussing chambers showed a reduced forskolin-stimulated Clcurrent that was slightly greater than that in CFTR-/-epithelia consistent with the reduced amount of CFTR\u2206F508 at the apical membrane. Measurements of in vivo nasal voltage revealed a pattern like that in CFTR-/pigs. These studies suggest the following interpretations: First, the clinical phenotype of \u2206F pigs is similar to that of CFTR null pigs. Second, because disease in \u2206F pigs was not more severe than that in null pigs, it is likely that loss of functional CFTR rather than a detrimental effect of mutant CFTR\u2206F508 caused disease. Third, the small amount of function conferred by the CFTR\u2206F508 protein was not sufficient to prevent disease. Fourth, in vitro studies of recombinant pig CFTR\u2206F508 may predict the in vivo behavior of the mutant protein. NF\u03baB is a major transcription factor that regulates genes responsible for both the innate and adaptive immune response and controls many genes involved in inflammation. NF\u03baB forms a complex that includes p65 (aka RelA). In unstimulated cells, NF\u03baB complexes are sequestered in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitors, called I\u03baBs (Inhibitor of \u03baB) and upon stimulation, I\u03baB is degraded allowing p65 to translocate into the nucleus where it then regulates transcription. Common methods for measuring NF\u03baB activation include luciferase-based assays and Western blots, neither of which are ideal for making repeat measurements in live cells over time. We therefore set out to design an NF\u03baB reporter assay that could be used in live cells, and was suitable for use in a microplate reader/96 well plate format. To this end, we designed a FRET pair that incorporated p65 N-terminally fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and I\u03baB that was N-terminally labeled with monomeric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry). Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated that both constructs were situated in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells under basal conditions, and that eGFP-p65 translocated to the nucleus upon stimulation with either TNF\u03b1 or NECA, which activates adenosine receptors. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of mCherry-IkB was markedly reduced upon stimulation consistent with the degradation of this protein that accompanies p65 activation. Confocal measurements of FRET revealed a ~3 fold decrease in FRET as these proteins dissociated (n=10). We next measured FRET in a 96 well plate using a Tecan Infinite plate reader. Non-transfected wells served to correct for background and wells transfected with eGFP-p65 alone served to control for any spectral bleed through. We then excited eGFP at 488 \u00b1 5 nm and collected emission at 510 \u00b1 15 nm (donor channel). We also collected FRET fluorescence by exciting at 488 \u00b1 5 nm and collecting mCherry emission at 610 \u00b1 15 nm (FRET channel). Under these conditions, we could detect significant emission in both channel and divided donor emission by FRET emission to calculate the FRET ratio. Five min after addition of 10 \u00b5M NECA, the FRET ratio significantly increased 3.2 fold, a change which persisted for 30 min before falling towards baseline (n=6). Similarly, TNF\u03b1 exposure elicited a 50% increase in the FRET ratio which also waned over time (n=6). We conclude that the eGFP-p65/mCherry-I\u03baB FRET pair is suitably sensitive to be used to measure FRET in an automated fashion in a microplate reader. The effect of CFTR on NF\u03baB FRET remains to be determined.",

To more closely mimic the in vivo situation, CFTR-HRP was also expressed in human CFBE41o-bronchial epithelial cells. Initial cell surface density measurements indicate that low temperature rescues the \u2206F508-CFTR-HRP processing defect, manifesting more than ten-fold higher fluorescence or luminescence signal over the background. Further validation of the assay is underway using the corrector panel provided by CFFT and Dr. R. Bridges. Initial results suggest that the correction profiles, detected by the cell surface ELISA and the CFTR-HRP-assay are comparable. Optimization of the assay in 96 and 384 well format will facilitate largescale biochemical corrector screens to identify potent lead compounds and drug targets in CF. Supported by CFFT and NIH as well as EMBO and CFF fellowships to GV and TO, respectively. Airway mucus clearance is an essential innate defense mechanism and its failure contributes to pathology of obstructive lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). In Scnn1b-transgenic (Scnn1b-Tg) mice, airway-targeted overexpression of the epithelial Na + channel \u03b2 subunit (\u03b2ENaC, Scnn1b gene) causes airway surface dehydration and results in airway mucus obstruction and inflammation that strikingly resemble CF lung pathology, except for the lack of chronic bacterial infections. To determine if bacteria play a role in the pathology of Scnn1b-Tg mice, we performed a time course analysis of bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) from neonatal (5-7 day-old), juvenile (8-12 day-old), and adult (1-6 month-old) congenic C57BL6/N Scnn1b-Tg and wild-type (WT) littermates. The majority (13/15) of neonatal Scnn1b-Tg mice harbored bacteria (2.46 \u00b1 0.33 log CFU/mouse), whereas WT littermates did not (n=14), linking inadequate mucus clearance to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection/colonization. Preliminary results suggest that these bacteria are part of the oropharyngeal flora. There was an inverse relationship between age and total CFU (juvenile, n=3/8, 0.94 \u00b1 0.46 log CFU/mouse; adults, n=2/11, 0.29 \u00b1 0.19 log CFU/mouse), indicating the ability of the mice to clear these bacterial species. CFU directly correlated with number of neutrophils/ml BAL fluid, which was highest in neonatal mice (182 \u00b1 69 \u00d7 10 3 cells/ml BALF, n=8) and lower at older ages (40-60 \u00d7 10 3 cells/ml BALF, 1-6 months). We have previously reported that Scnn1b-Tg mice lacking the Toll-like receptor adapter molecule MyD88, had defective neutrophil recruitment. CFU quantification confirmed that neonatal MyD88-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice had significantly more bacteria than Scnn1b-Tg mice (MyD88 -/-, Scnn1b-Tg n=11/11, 5.65 \u00b1 0.39 vs. MyD88 +/-, Scnn1b-Tg, n=14/14, 3.80 \u00b1 0.31 log CFU/mouse). MyD88 deficiency was associated with higher CFU in Scnn1b-Tg mice at all time points, but CFU did decline with age (adult MyD88 -/-, Scnn1b-Tg n=6/8, 2.86 \u00b1 0.80 log CFU/mouse), indicating that MyD88-independent mechanisms aid in bacterial clearance. We also tested whether higher bacterial burden was responsible for the severe lung pathology observed in CFTR-deficient Scnn1b-Tg mice. Although not significantly, CFU counts were higher in \u2206F508 homozygous as compared to \u2206F508 heterozygous Scnn1b-Tg mice (3.87 \u00b1 0.28 log CFU/mouse, n=8/8 vs. 2.84 \u00b1 0.36 log CFU/mouse, n=13/15, respectively, p=0.068), suggesting that CFTR deficiency further impairs mucus clearance. Finally, to test the contribution of neonatal bacterial infection to the development of chronic lung pathology, we have derived Scnn1b-Tg mice in a germ-free (GF) environment. As expected, no bacteria were detected in BAL from GF neonatal mice (n=5), but surprisingly, adult GF Scnn1b-Tg mice exhibited airway inflammation and mucus obstruction comparable to those of mice reared under non-GF conditions. This finding indicates that the bacteria normally present in the lungs of neonatal Scnn1b-tg mice are not necessary for the development of lung disease, and that other triggers can drive the development of lung pathology due to airway surface dehydration. MUC5AC is a gel-forming mucin secreted by airway goblet cells which plays a key role in the viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer. Although mucus is necessary for airway clearance, epidemiological and pathological studies have suggested that excessive mucus secretion may be accountable for airway obstruction and/or inflammation. In obstructive pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), MUC5AC expression is upregulated as a result of goblet cell metaplasia, which is believed to contribute to the CF pathogenesis. To determine whether increased Muc5ac production alone is sufficient to produce airway obstruction and inflammation, we generated a mouse model that overexpresses Muc5ac in the lungs using the Clara cell (rCCSP) promoter. Muc5ac cDNA was cloned from mouse lungs and tagged internally with a GFP for tracking purposes. The transgenic line was tested by quantitative PCR for transgene expression and showed a 20-fold mRNA increase in the lungs. Bronchoalveolar lavages were analyzed by agarose Western blots and revealed an 18-fold increased protein expression. In addition, Western blotting confirmed the proper maturation and polymerization of Muc5ac-GFP as depicted by the typical ladder-like migration pattern. Despite overexpression of a functional mucin, no incidence of lung pathology was revealed in transgenic animals. Survival curve was unchanged. Histopathology was similar to wild-type (WT) mice, with few AB/PAS-positive cells and no mucosubstance accumulated in the lumen. Immunohistochemistry revealed that GFP was mainly localized to the airways in domeshape-like cells, which correlates with the predicted CCSP expression. Inflammatory cell count was not increased in transgenic mice. The absence of pro-inflammatory phenotype led us to explore the response of these mice to influenza virus challenge. Thus, mice were instilled intranasally with 700 PFU PR8 (H1N1). Virus titer, lung histology and inflammation were monitored at day 2 and day 4 post-infection. Virus grew to titers 10-fold lower in Tg-Muc5ac than in WT littermate controls, suggesting a protective role of the mucin. No significant difference in inflammation was detected. To demonstrate that Muc5ac alone was responsible for the reduced infection, we purified Muc5ac-GFP by density gradient and presented the mucin to increasing concentrations of viruses for plaque assay measurements. The results showed decreased virus infection when incubated with Muc5ac-rich fractions, supporting the hypothesis of a direct interaction between mucin and viruses. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the overexpressed Muc5ac-GFP was a high-molecular-weight protein, packaged in Clara cells and formed polymers upon secretion. The lack of discernable phenotype in the transgenic lungs suggests that mucin overproduction alone is not sufficient to trigger luminal mucus plugging, airway inflammation and goblet cell metaplasia. Conversely, this work demonstrates that Muc5ac acts as a shield to prevent viral infection, supporting a protective role for mucins in the absence of other triggering agents.",

Model systems provide an excellent platform for studying mucociliary clearance, yet there is a trade-off between physiological relevance and the ability to measure fundamental aspects of the system. Cell culture models makes it possible to make measurements at the cellular level and understand those elements in the context of the larger clearance process. The access afforded by cell culture, however, is also a liability: in most culture systems the cultures are in a closed geometry and can't truly clear the airway surface liquid (ASL) that they generate. Moreover, the in vitro environment lacks the forces found in vivo; forces that have proven to play an essential role in cell phenotype and tissue behavior. We present a mucus clearance assay capable of the powerful analytical techniques used in cell culture while moving further towards physiological relevance. Our clearance assay grows cells in a bilayered fluidics channel, which allows us to perfuse the cells basolaterally while maintaining an air-liquid interface (ALI) on the apical surface. We have demonstrated the ability to grow well-differentiated, wellciliated cultures inside of our system. Furthermore the fluidics channel presents a geometry that enables the system to truly clear the ASL. Additionally we have integrated apical ports into our system. The ports facilitate several key features: (1) Exploring ciliary entrainment via the application of external forces, (2) Sampling and dosing the ASL, (3) Studying clearance when challenged by external flows e.g. airflow simulating tidal breathing. Finally we have built our system so that all of the aforementioned studies can be performed with high-resolution microscopy: we can investigate ciliary beat frequency and ASL properties on the cell length scale. Ultimately our system provides a platform to investigate the effects of several parameters (e.g. external forces, disease, pharmacological agents) on mucus clearance while retaining the ability to measure the underlying phenomena. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is an emerging technique capable of providing reflectance images with subcellular resolution at video rates. Previously we demonstrated discrimination of respiratory epithelia, cilia, mucus, and gland anatomy in three dimensional images of formalin-fixed porcine and human airways. Subsequently, we have developed an SD-OCT system for video-rate microscopy with an axial resolution of 1 \u00b5m and a transverse resolution of 2 \u00b5m. Cross-sectional images are acquired at a speed of 32 frames per second with 512 axial lines (reflectance as a function of depth) per image.",

The UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium will be undertaking a Phase IIB clinical trial of repeated application of liposome-based gene therapy over a one year period in approximately 100 CF patients (Multidose Trial). In preparation for this, we sought to address two key questions. Firstly, could we define the optimal set of patients in which the therapy could both be delivered (good access to the airways via nebulisation), and in whom any therapeutic effect was measurable (one or more abnormal measures of lung disease). Secondly, in this set of \"can deliver -can measure\" patients, which biomarker(s) could be powered to be the primary outcome measure for the trial. To address both questions, we undertook a study (Run-in), cross-sectionally assessing \"can deliver\" and longitudinally assessing a large set of candidate biomarkers for \"can measure.\" One hundred ninety-two patients from age 10 upwards, with FEV1 >40% were enrolled at two clinical centres; 154 of these remained in the study after four visits spaced at approximately 4-5 month intervals. Biomarkers assessed cross-sectionally included radionucleotide deposition scans, CT and mucocilary clearance. Longitudinal biomarkers included a large series of serum, sputum and exhaled breath inflammatory markers, lung physiology, exercise-related assays and quality of life assessment. Twelve patients were judged too severe for adequate delivery and were excluded. A shortlist of 4 biomarkers was generated based on a) showing a CF/non-CF difference, b) response to course of intravenous antibiotics, and c) coefficients of variation. These four were matched against the remaining 142 patients, and a further 7 patients excluded in whom none of these shortlisted biomarkers was abnormal. Eighty-nine patients (3 or 4 biomarkers abnormal) have been definitely included to progress into the Multidose Trial, and a further 46 (1 or 2 biomarkers abnormal) are awaiting the final primary outcome selection. The Run-in study has, therefore, been able to a) select a cohort of \"optimal\" patients in which to assess gene therapy, and b) provide an indication of which may be the more useful biomarkers to use in phase IIB clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents.",

Development of small molecules capable of correcting defective F508del CFTR maturation, gating, and plasma membrane half-life could be of potential clinical benefit to the majority of CF patients. In the current study, 89 adult CF subjects (median age: 26 years, gender: 60% male) homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation were each randomized to one of four VX-809 dose groups or matching placebo to evaluate the safety, tolerability and CFTR activity of once daily VX-809 compared with placebo for 28 days. Dose levels evaluated included 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, and the primary measure of CFTR activity was sweat chloride (Wescor macroduct). Optional nasal potential difference (NPD) and rectal biopsy to detect C Band CFTR by Western blot were each performed in a subset of subjects (75% and 37%, respectively). In addition, lung function (FEV 1 , FVC, FEF 25%-75% ), and Cystic Fibrosis-Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) scores were measured. Safety was assessed by adverse events, physical exams, standard laboratory testing, ECGs, and vital signs. The study was performed in a two part, dose-ascending format with two blinded, independent interim assessments for safety. Safety data were analyzed using descriptive statistics only, and efficacy data using an analysis of covariance model. All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety and pharmacodynamic analyses. VX-809 was generally well-tolerated across the four dose groups compared to placebo. Overall, the type and rate of AEs were similar among treatment and placebo groups and respiratory events were the most common AEs reported. AEs leading to withdrawal were seen in one subject in each active treatment arm and were related to respiratory symptoms. Pulmonary exacerbations were seen in 17% of VX-809 subjects and 12% of placebo subjects (p=0.62). Sweat Clvalues were reduced in a dose-dependent manner (p=0.0013) during the period of treatment. The treatment difference between the placebo response at day 28 in the 25-mg, 50-mg, 100-mg, and 200-mg groups were +0.10, -4.61, -6.13, and -8.21, respectively. These differences reached statistical significance for the 100mg (p<0.05) and 200-mg (p<0.01) groups. Sweat Clvalues returned to pretreatment values following 7 days of drug washout. Lung function, CFQ-R and NPD parameters did not change significantly during the study in any dose groups, and no C band CFTR was detected in any subjects. The results provide evidence of the tolerability and biologic activity of VX-809 in F508del CFTR homozygous patients, and provide support for future clinical trials.",

Inhaled dry powder Mannitol is an osmotic agent that increases water content of the airway surface liquid and improves mucociliary and cough clearance in patients with CF (1). A 6-month double blind (DB) phase III trial of inhaled Mannitol (400 mg bid) in 295 CF patients aged 6 -56 years, mean 23 \u00b1 SD 11.3 years demonstrated a sustained improvement in FEV 1 of 6.5% at 26 weeks from baseline (2, 3) . A similar improvement in FEV 1 was seen in the subset of patients on concurrent rhDNase, (5.1% change compared to control, p=0.006) (2, 3) . This sister trial was conducted in the U.S., Canada, Argentina and Europe to further assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled Mannitol.",

Objective: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) often develop detectable structural airway damage before reaching 5 years of age. Disease modifying therapies have the potential to prevent or reduce such damage when used as early intervention. Denufosol, a novel ion channel regulator, stimulates Cltransport, inhibits Na + absorption, and increases ciliary beat frequency independently of CFTR genotype. The potential of denufosol as an early intervention agent was assessed in a subgroup of patients with minimally effects, with the 280 mg dose appearing to be the minimum effective dose; and the 560 mg dose showing statistically significant improvements in clinical symptoms, microbiologic activity, and sustained improvement in lung function for up to 28 days post-study drug. These data warrant confirmation of safety and efficacy of Arikace\u2122 in Phase 3 trials of CF patients chronically infected with Pa. The methodology for measuring mucociliary (MCC) and cough clearance (CC) needs to be standardized between CF centers to allow for its future use as an effective non-invasive, outcome measure of CF therapeutics. A standardization protocol has been developed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC (UNC), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the University of Pittsburgh (UP).",

In general, the predicted pharmacologic effect of VX-770 on Na + conductance was most evident when data were analyzed using the best nostril response per visit, then the best nostril response identified pre-treatment, followed by the mean nostril response. Dose-dependent improvements in maximal basal PD were observed only in the best nostril response per visit analysis (P<0.05 within group and vs placebo for the 75, 150, and 250-mg groups). Based on these preliminary analyses examining the best nostril response per visit, treatment arms of <20 subjects should have 85% power to detect withingroup changes in zero Clplus isoproterenol -4 mV (SD=4.0), 90% power to detect 10 mV changes in mean basal PD (SD=9.0), and 90% power to detect 15 mV changes in maximal basal PD and Ringer's PD (SD=13). This analysis may provide more power than traditional NPD analyses based on mean values per subject, in which 24 subjects would be required for detection of -4 mV improvement (SD=4.5).

Background: Measurement of mucociliary and cough clearance (MCC/CC) by gamma scintigraphy following inhalation of a radiotracer has been used as a biomarker in CF. Administration of inhaled hypertonic saline (HS) to CF patients results in acute and sustained improvements in MCC (Donaldson, et al 2006) , while long-term administration of HS is associated with improvements in lung function and pulmonary exacerbations (Elkins, et al 2006) . Nevertheless, the duration of action for a single dose of HS remains unknown. This knowledge would be useful in the development of novel inhaled therapies designed to achieve similar clinical benefits as HS. We hypothesize that MCC/CC can be used to determine the duration of action of agents like HS, and is an excellent choice as a Proof of Concept endpoint for exploratory clinical studies in the development of new inhaled therapies for CF.",

Eighty-eight percent of patients experienced adverse events (AEs) that were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-related AEs more commonly found with TIP than TOBI\u00ae were cough (25.3 vs 4.3%), dysgeusia (3.9 vs 0.5%) and dysphonia (12.7 vs 3.3%). A similar proportion of patients in TIP (27.4%) and TOBI\u00ae (29.2%) groups experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). The most common SAE was lung disorders (pulmonary/CF exacerbations) (TIP: 19.5%; TOBI\u00ae: 18.7%). The frequency of AEs and SAEs decreased with each successive treatment cycle. There was no significant difference in the change in FEV1% predicted from baseline to end of Cycle 3 between TIP and TOBI\u00ae [least square mean difference: 1.1%; lower bound of 1-sided 85% confidence interval = -0.67] confirming the non-inferiority hypothesis.

Hypertonic saline (HS, NaCl 7%) improves airway surface hydration by inducing osmotic flux of water into the airway lumen. Previous clinical trials demonstrated that inhalation of HS improved mucus clearance and lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients with chronic lung disease (Donaldson SH et al., N Engl J Med., 2006; Elkins MR et al., N Engl J Med., 2006) , and recent pilot studies demonstrated that inhalation of HS is well tolerated by infants and young children with CF (Dellon EP et al., Pediatr Pulmonol., 2008) . However, effects of HS therapy on other characteristic features of CF lung disease, i.e. airway mucus obstruction and airway inflammation, and the benefits of preventive HS treatment have not been studied. In the present study, we used \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice as a murine model of CF lung disease, and determined the effects of preventive and late HS therapy on mortality, airway mucus obstruction and airway inflammation. Newborn or 4-week old \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice and wildtype littermate controls were treated by intrapulmonary instillation of HS (NaCl 7%; 1\u00b5l/g body weight) or vehicle (H 2 O) alone three times per day for a period of 2 weeks. During HS therapy, growth and survival were monitored. After the 14 day treatment period, mice were euthanized, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to determine inflammatory cell counts, and lungs were processed for histology and morphometry to quantitate airway mucus obstruction. We demonstrate that preventive HS therapy significantly reduced pulmonary mortality, improved growth, and reduced airway mucus content in HS-treated compared to vehicle-treated \u03b2ENaC-Tg neonates. In adult \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice with chronic lung disease, HS also conferred significant reduction in airway mucus content compared to vehicle treatment. BAL studies demonstrated that HS treatment was associated with a significant increase in BAL inflammatory cell counts in wild-type and \u03b2ENaC-Tg neonates, as well as in adult wild-type mice. Our preclinical studies indicate that both preventive and late HS treatment provide an effective mucolytic therapy for CF-like lung disease. However, HS promoted air-way inflammation in neonates and had no therapeutic effect on airway inflammation in adult \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice with established CF-like lung disease. These results suggest that potential proinflammatory side effects of early HS treatment should be evaluated before using HS as treatment for CF infants. Further, our results suggest that combined mucolytic and antiinflammatory therapeutic strategies may be necessary for the treatment of CF lung disease.",

            "text": "Supported by EC (MEXT-2004-013666 We have previously shown that simian immunodeficiency virus pseudotyped with F and HN protein from Sendai virus (F/HN-SIV) transduces murine nasal epithelium efficiently (3-5% of respiratory epithelial cells after perfusion with 5x10 8 TU) and importantly can be repeatedly administered. We now show that expression in the nasal epithelium persists for the lifetime of the animals (16-25 months, 9 of 9 C57Bl/6 mice). The vast majority of published studies have assessed lentiviral vectors in mouse nasal epithelium, and transduction of lung epithelium, particularly without preconditioning through polidocanol treatment or tissue damage, remains challenging. Here, we show that F/HN-SIV transduces lung epithelium efficiently and dose-dependently. In contrast to other studies, we show that lentivirus-mediated gene expression in the lung is stable for at least 13 months (latest time-point currently analyzed) (month 2: 362660\u00b163922 photons/sec, month 13: 431454\u00b165647 photons/sec, n=5-8 mice). We also show, for the first time, that lentivirus can be repeatedly administered to the lung (2 doses of F/HN-SIV-GFP followed by a third dose of F/HN-SIV-Lux at monthly interval) without loss of activity compared to a single dose of F/HN-SIV-Lux (1 Dose: 40178\u00b14843, 3 Doses: 39080\u00b17490 RLU/mg protein, n=21/group). Importantly, we also show that gene expression increases with increasing number of doses (10 doses at daily interval) (Dose 1: 4693\u00b1 899, Dose 10: 239212\u00b148362 RLU/mg protein, n=8/group, p< 0.0005). We have not observed acute or chronic toxicity in 12 months follow-up studies in mice. We have also assessed the performance of F/HN-SIV in various airway ex vivo models. (a) The virus transduces human air liquid interface cultures efficiently with expression persisting for at least 4 months. (b) The virus transduces freshly obtained human nasal brushings dose-dependently. (c) The virus transduces human lung slices efficiently and expression persists for the life-span of the slices. These data suggest that F/HN-SIV may be a suitable vector for cystic fibrosis gene therapy. The nuclear membrane is likely to be a significant barrier to non-viral gene transfer into non-dividing differentiated airway epithelial cells. Transcyclohexane 1,2 diol (TCHD) is an amphipathic alcohol which has been shown to temporarily disrupt the permeability of the nuclear pore. Previous studies have shown that TCHD can increase lipid-mediated transfection in vitro (Vandenbroucke et al, 2007) . Here, we aimed to reproduce these in vitro studies using the cationic lipid GL67A which we are currently assessing in cystic fibrosis gene therapy trials and, more importantly, to assess the effects of TCHD on transfection efficiency in fully differentiated airway epithelium ex vivo and in vivo.",

Our data suggests that selective HDAC inhibition can be developed as a novel therapeutic strategy to ameliorate chronic CF lung disease.

TCHD exposure increased luciferase expression dose-dependently up to 100-fold compared to no TCHD treated controls (n=6/group, p<0.001). We next assessed the effects of TCHD in fully differentiated human air liquid interface (ALI) cultures (Epithelix S\u00e0rl, Switzerland). ALIs were transfected with GL67A complexed to pCIKGLux (10 \u00b5g/insert at a 6:8 lipid:DNA molar ratio) for 6 hr followed by a 1 hr exposure to TCHD (0.5 to 2% w/v in medium). The effect of TCHD in ALIs was inconsistent with only 1 out of 4 ALI batches (n=3 ALIs/batch/dose) showing a dose-dependent increase in gene expression 48 hrs after transfection (0%: 1585\u00b1801; 0.5%: 17446\u00b13595 RLU/\u00b5l apical medium). Different batches of ALIs are generated from different donor material and the inconsistent effect of TCHD in ALIs warrants further investigation. We then assessed the effects of TCHD in vivo. GL67A/pCIKLux complexes were administered to the lungs of mice by nebulisation and various concentrations of TCHD (0.4 to 10% w/v) were administered by nasal sniffing immediately pre and post nebulisation to ensure maximal exposure of the mice (n=8/group). In a separate set of experiments mice (n=8/group) were nebulised with GL67A/pCIKLux complexes followed immediately by nebulisation of 10% TCHD (maximum concentration that could be dissolved) for 1 hr. In a third set of experiments GL67A/pCIKLux was administered to the nasal epithelium by nasal perfusion over 15 min followed by nasal perfusion of 100 \u00b5l of 10% TCHD over 15 min (n=8 mice/group). This protocol ensured prolonged contact time between the airway epithelium and the compounds. None of the TCHD treated mice had higher gene expression when compared to no TCHD controls. In conclusion, although the amphipathic alcohol TCHD significantly increases gene transfer in cell lines, the effects are lost when moving into more relevant ex vivo and in vivo models of non-dividing fully differentiated airway epithelium. Rationale: Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from the mutation(s) in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The most common mutation, \u2206F508-CFTR, is a temperature-sensitive, trafficking mutant with reduced chloride transport and exaggerated immune response. The neutrophil-dominated airway inflammation results from NF\u03baB mediated, proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8, hyper-secretion. The recent studies have identified several novel \"correctors\" and molecular targets for functional rescue of misfolded protein or chronic inflammatory state of CF but the challenge is to bypass the mucus and selectively deliver these drug(s) to the airway.",

Introduction: Lung damage in CF is thought to begin by mucus impaction mainly localized in the peripheral airways. To prevent lung damage from occurring sputum mobilization is important in the treatment of CF. Daily nebulization of rhDNase facilitates mobilisation of mucus from the airways. However, relatively little of the inhaled drug is deposited in the peripheral airways. Targeting rhDNase to the peripheral airways might improve mucus clearance from these airways. Therefore we hypothesized that peripheral deposition of rhDNase can improve lung function in children with CF.",

Criteria for qualification included 1) completion of the standardized process and sequence, 2) absence of sustained breaks in the tracing, 3) stable and interpretable values at respective 10 sec scoring interval, and 4) >3 mV change in amiloride and ATP PD. All tracings were reviewed and qualified by a single analyst. We received 380 agar tracings from 54 operators and 29 centers across 9 countries; 217 were non-CF and 163 were CF tracings.

BMI and FEV1% predicted were found to be statistically significant covariates for Vd/F, as well as FEV1% predicted for ka. However, none of the covariate effects would likely be clinically significant based on the simulation results. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) represents a promising potential gene therapy vector for CF. However, the most commonly-studied rAAV serotype (rAAV2) is inefficient at transducing polarized human airway epithelia (HAE) from the apical membrane, and CF clinical trials using this vector failed to produce efficient gene expression in vivo. Interestingly, rAAV2 transduction from the basolateral membrane is highly efficient. In contrast, rAAV1 is efficient at transducing HAE with no polarity bias. Differences in intracellular trafficking of rAAV virions have been thought to underlie the transduction differences observed with these two serotypes. We hypothesized that rAAV2 trafficking from the apical membrane results in accumulation of the virus in an endosomal compartment that is unable to process the virion, and that this compartment would differ from that used during apical trafficking of rAAV1. Co-infection experiments with differently-labeled fluorescent rAAV1 and rAAV2 particles suggested that whereas rAAV1 trafficking pathways from both membranes converge, rAAV2 utilizes two completely different endosomal trafficking pathways from the apical and basolateral membranes. In order to identify the specific apical and basolateral trafficking pathways of rAAV2, we performed staining for various endosomal markers on polarized HAE infected with fluorescentlylabeled virions. Entry through the apical membrane was found to be markedly slower than through the basolateral membrane. We determined that rAAV2 particles entering through the apical membrane move to the early endosome, and then a majority of these particles move rapidly to the late endosome/lysosome, where they remain for long periods of time. We are currently evaluating the endosomal compartments utilized by rAAV1. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors has been shown to augment rAAV2 transduction by enhancing viral trafficking to the nucleus. We hypothesized that proteasome inhibitors might rescue rAAV2 from the lysosome following apical entry. We found that fluorescently-labeled rAAV2 particles had trafficked significantly farther towards the nucleus following proteasome inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, treatment with proteasome inhibitors two weeks following apical infection of HAE rescued transduction to levels seen with basolateral infection, which is highly efficient. We conclude that inefficient rAAV2 apical transduction is caused by the routing of viral particles into the late endosome/lysosome, where they are unable to be effectively processed and remain dormant for long periods of time. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors rescues functional virions from this compartment, allowing them to move into the nucleus and transduce the cell. These results provide promising evidence that rAAV2 gene therapy in the airway may be successful if the basic trafficking biology of the virus is altered.",

Chloride efflux from airway epithelia into a chloride-free mucosal buffer solution containing lucigenin was quantified from the kinetics of lucigenin fluorescence. Large, robust fluorescence signal changes, reflecting CFTR function, were found in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells grown for 21 days at an air-liquid interface. In a protocol in which cells were first incubated with a chloride-free buffer, addition of CFTR agonists (forskolin/IBMX in presence of indomethacin) to a 0 mM chloride basolateral perfusate greatly increased chloride efflux into the apical solution in non-CF but not in CF cells. Subsequent addition of chloride (10-120 mM) to the basolateral perfusate greatly increased rates of chloride efflux into the apical solution, with higher chloride efflux rates in the presence of CFTR activators, allowing the resolution of transcellular and paracellular components of chloride transport. In preliminary studies we applied the method to measure CFTRdependent chloride transport in pig trachea, suggesting its potential utility in native ex vivo airway tissue. Studies using ion channel inhibitors and ion substitution maneuvers are underway to characterize the ion transporter determinants of the fluorescence signal. This newly established optical assay of CFTR-dependent chloride transport may have utility in preclinical testing of candidate CF drugs as an adjunct or alternative to conventional electrophysiological assays.",

            "text": "This work was supported by CFF, NIH and CFRI. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive disease in the U.S. and Europe, and is due to mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. CF mutations, of which the most common is \u2206F508-CFTR, cause a massive pro-inflammatory phenotype in the lung arising from profound expression of inflammatory genes including interleukin-8 (IL-8). Recently, miRNAs have been proven to be key regulators of gene expression by directing their target mRNAs toward degradation and/or translational repression. Based on partial homology between the 3\u2032-UTRs of TNF\u03b1 and IL-8, we hypothesized that miR-16, which is known to reduce TNF\u03b1 mRNA stability, might also reduce IL-8 mRNA stability in CF cells. We found that miR-16 indeed suppressed IL-8 expression in CF lung epithelial cells by interacting with the AU-rich sequences in the 3\u2032-UTR of IL-8 mRNA. To more generally identify CFspecific miRNAs, we screened a miRNA library for differential expression in [\u2206F508] CFTR and [wildtype] CFTR lung epithelial cell lines. We found 18 miRNAs that are up-regulated in CF cells and four miRNAs that are down-regulated. Of these, miR-155 is the miRNA most significantly elevated in CF cells. Consistently, treating the CF cell with the stable antisense antagomir for miR-155 potently suppresses expression of IL-8 mRNA, as well as IL-8 protein. These data suggest a regulatory role for miR-155, and a few other miRNAs, in the CF airway, and identify the antagomir-155 as a novel candidate anti-inflammatory therapeutic for CF. Introduction: Lubiprostone, a bicyclic fatty acid, is in clinical use for treatment of chronic constipation. It alleviates obstruction by stimulating intestinal fluid secretion, purportedly through activation of CLC-2-type chloride channels. Intestinal obstruction caused by the loss of CFTR-mediated chloride secretion is also a severe pathological symptom in a subpopulation of CF patients. To find out whether lubiprostone, through activation of CLC-2, could compensate for the chloride secretory defect in CF, we investigated its mode of action in both mouse and human intestine.",

CFTR blockage by CFTRinh172, but not ClC-2 blockage by Cd 2+ , inhibited the lubiprostone response. Lubiprostone also induced a Cd 2+ -insensitive secretory response in the intestine of WT mice, but failed to induce intestinal chloride secretion in Cftr-null mice. Similarly, lubiprostone induced a secretory response in human rectal biopsies and resected ileum of controls, but not of CF patients. The EP4-type prostanoid receptor antagonist L-161,982 blocked the lubiprostone response in all three models studied. In T84 cells, lubiprostone induced a rise in cellular cAMP levels that was blocked by L-161,982.

            "text": "Conclusions: Activation of the EP4 receptor/ cAMP/PKA/CFTR pathway can fully account for the pro-secretory action of lubiprostone in mouse and human intestine. Lubiprostone-induced chloride secretion is lost in CF intestine, and is not compensated by CLC-2 channel activation. Most plausibly, CLC-2 functions as an absorptive chloride channel at the basolateral membrane of intestinal surface cells, implying that its downregulation in CF may serve to reduce NaCl and fluid absorption and to restrict luminal dehydration. Lubiprostone may further promote luminal hydration in CF through an anti-absorptive rather than pro-secretory action, based on the known inhibitory effect of cAMP/PKA signaling on salt-and water absorption at the level of the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3.

Antiinflammatory drugs, interfering with a vicious circle that amplifies inflammation and perpetuates infection, could represent an important strategy for CF lung pathology. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, such as vardenafil, are used for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction and are able to activate chloride transport in CF mice homozygous for the F508del mutation (Lubamba et al. 2008) , although the underlying mechanisms of action are poorly understood.",

Introduction: Chronic inflammatory response in the airway tract of patients affected by cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by an excessive recruitment of neutrophils to the bronchial lumina, driven by the chemokine Interleukin (IL)-8. Modulation of IL-8 is considered to be one of the key strategies to reduce the progressive pulmonary deterioration of these patients. In this context, we previously identified 5-methoxypsoralen as a relevant molecule able to reduce the P.aeruginosa (Pa)-dependent transcription of IL-8 mRNA ( Nicolis, 2009) . Extending the investigation to linear and angular trimethylated analogues (e.g. psoralen (PSR), angelicin (ANG), 4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP), 4,6,4'-trimethylangelicin (TMA)) identified a selective reduction of IL-8 mRNA upon exposure of the cells to psoralens, with TMA being the most potent. We observed that these compounds are also able to potentiate CFTR-mediated ion transport not only in w/t but also F508del CFTR expressing cells, where the mutant protein was rescued to the apical membrane. The above findings led us to investigate TMA in murine models of lung infection following exposure to Pa.",

Auranofin activated CFTR mediated currents in both cell lines. The Auranofin-stimulated Isc was blocked by two specific CFTR inhibitors, GlyH-101 and Inh-172, indicating that Auranofin is an activator of wt-CFTR. Auranofin stimulated electrogenic Cltransport across the apical membrane in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC 50 of ~50 \u00b5M and ~30 \u00b5M, and its maximal response reached 80% and ~60% of that observed with 2 \u00b5M forskolin in T84 and FRT cells, respectively. Unlike forskolin, our data demonstrated that Auranofin did not increase cellular cAMP and cGMP levels in T84 and FRT cells. Thus, Auranofin is not an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase or an activator of adenylate cyclase. In addition, the PKA inhibitor H89, the PKC inhibitor BisX and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT5823 failed to abolish the I sc response to Auranofin. However, activation of CFTR by Auranofin was suppressed by staurosporine, a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, suggesting that activation occurs through an unknown kinase rather than protein kinase A. Moreover, our data revealed that Auranofin significantly increased the forskolin-stimulated I sc in temperature-corrected F508del-CFTR expressing FRT cells (27\u00b0C, 48 hr) with an EC 50 of ~20 \u00b5M. When F508del-CFTR-FRT cells were incubated with correctors, overnight at 37\u00b0C, Auranofin without forskolin directly stimulated Isc. When pretreated with a combination of correctors, this direct stimulating effect of Auranofin was enhanced ~4-fold compared to the effect on cells treated with a single corrector. Although Auranofin was a weak activator of G551D-CFTR in the absence of forskolin, it significantly increased I sc of forskolin-stimulated G551D-CFTR by ~10-fold with an EC 50 of ~20 \u00b5M. A similar effect of Auranofin was also observed for the G1349D-CFTR mutant. In conclusion, these results indicate that Auranofin is an activator of wt-CFTR by a cAMPindependent mechanism and a potentiator of CF-associated CFTR mutants including F508del-CFTR, G551D-CFTR and G1349D-CFTR. Therefore, Auranofin, acting as an anti-inflammatory compound and a modifier of electrolyte transport, may be beneficial in the treatment of CF. Current efforts are underway to assess Auranofin's effects in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells. The pyrazinoylguanidines (e.g. amiloride, benzamil) currently represent the only class of potent blockers of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Amiloride has been demonstrated to enhance mucociliary clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF) when delivered into the airways as an aerosol, but with a short duration of action. An inhaled ENaC blocker with improved duration of action would be a promising candidate for CF therapy. In this study we focused on exploring bioisosteres of the acyl guanidine portion of amiloride, which when protonated acts as the sodium mimetic. We postulated that quaternary amines being formally positively charged would also be effective sodium cation mimetics whilst their charged nature might aid lung retention by reducing transcellular absorption thus enhancing duration of action following inhaled delivery. Simple amide linked quaternary amines were designed and synthesised which exhibited similar potency to amiloride in blocking ENaC in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC, IC 50~3 00 nM). A rapid expansion of the structure activity relationships (SAR) with this chemical scaffold afforded analogues with excellent in vitro potency (HBEC IC 50 < 5nM), limited membrane permeation and ENaC block in vivo as measured using a Guinea Pig tracheal potential difference (TPD) model (ED 50 44 -66 \u00b5g/kg). These studies provide the first reported potent alternatives to the pyrazinoyl guanidine core in the search to discover novel ENaC blocking compounds as candidate therapies for the treatment of CF lung disease.",

In preparation for in vivo studies using the human G542X transgenic mouse (on a Cftr -/-background) treated with combination therapy, we next evaluated whether potentiation of human CFTR could be observed in mice intestine examined ex vivo in the Ussing chamber. For these studies, we examined excised intestine from Cftr -/-mice with gut-specific expression of human WT-CFTR under the FABP promoter.

Inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been found to significantly improve the trafficking of \u2206F508-CFTR to the plasma membrane (Hutt et al., Nat. Chem. Biol. 6:25-33, 2010) . Therefore, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) may be effective as a \u2206F508 corrector. We have evaluated the efficacy of SAHA, a HDACi, in cell lines and in primary CF bronchial epithelial cells. Incubation for 24 hours of CFBE41o-and A549 cells expressing \u2206F508-CFTR with SAHA (5-10 \u00b5M) caused a dramatic increase in cAMP-dependent anion transport, as measured by YFP fluorescence assay or short-circuit current experiments. The effect of SAHA was larger than that of known \u2206F508 correctors such as corr-4a. SAHA, but not corr-4a, also increased the CFTR mRNA levels. We also analyzed the maturation of \u2206F508-CFTR protein by immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. SAHA markedly increased the levels of the partially-glycosylated form of \u2206F508-CFTR (band B) but not the mature version of the protein (band C). We tested the efficacy of SAHA and other treatments on bronchial epithelial cells from CF patients carrying the \u2206F508 mutation. Cells were plated on porous membranes (Snapwell) to generate polarized epithelia and studied with the short-circuit current technique. Under control conditions, cell stimulation with forskolin and genistein activated a small current that was inhibited by the selective CFTR inhibitor 172. The amplitude of this current was not affected by treatment with SAHA (5-10 \u00b5M). Our results indicate that SAHA is particularly effective in transfected cell lines because of a possible transcriptional mechanism. The upregulation of \u2206F508-CFTR expression in heterologous expression systems may cause an increased trafficking of the mutant protein to the plasma membrane by mass action. The lack of effect in primary cells needs further investigation.",

Thus, we are investigating the intracellular fate of pDNA following transfection, using the clinically relevant Genzyme cationic lipid (GL67A) formulation and three-dimensional Spinning-Disk real-time confocal, combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to track, quantitate and provide high resolution \"snapshots\" of pDNA at the single molecule level in transfected primary human airway epithelial cells (AECs) grown at the air-liquid interface (hALI). The pDNA was tagged with fluorescent, photostable semiconductor quantum dots (Qdot-pDNA) or 1.4 nm gold nanoparticles (Au-pDNA) for use in fluorescence or TEM studies, respectively. Both confocal microscopy and TEM experiments demonstrate that GL67A was able to transfect AECs with Qdot-and Au-pDNA. The number of gold spots in the nuclei of Au-pDNA-transfected AECs compared with those in unconjugated-pDNA-transfected control cells was significantly higher (p<0.05, n=5 independent experiments). Approximately 50% of the total internalised pDNA localised to nuclei within one hour posttransfection in both confocal (123 AECs, 8 independent experiments) and TEM (40 AECs, 5 independent experiments) studies. Thus, within one hour pDNA is equally distributed between the cytoplasm and the nucleus in well differentiated hALIs following non-viral based gene transfer.

Suppression of premature termination codons (PTCs) represents a genetic oriented therapy with the potential to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) in affected patients.

High-throughput drug screening has discovered novel compounds that strongly potentiate mutant CFTR localized to the surface, including VX-770, a CFTR potentiator efficacious in G551D subjects in a Phase 2 trial. Although VX-770 was designed for plasma membrane-localized mutations, it also activates WT-CFTR, suggesting VX-770 can enhance function following translational readthrough of PTCs and provide an augmented response to nonsense codon repair.

Background: With improved nutritional intervention and new medical treatments, the median predicted survival among CF patients is now 37 years. However, CF patients incur high medical expenditures which may impact future clinical decision-making. In this analysis, we plan to compare healthcare costs and utilization in CF patients infected with PA treated with AZLI (Cayston\u00ae, Gilead Sciences) or TIS using 6-month data from Study GS-US-205-0110 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00757237).

For clinical use, GMP production of high purity plasmid was established (<2% contaminating RNA, DNA, Protein; <5 EU/mg endotoxin). Multi-gram scale production of pGM169 was achieved via host cell fermentation at the 100 L scale, coupled with bubble lift lysis, anion exchange membrane capture, HIC chromatography purification and TFF formulation and concentration (VGXI, Houston Texas). Reproducibility was assured via validated master and working cell banks. Pharmaceutical stability of pGM169 was assessed via real-time and accelerated ICH conforming stability studies; the current shelf-life of pGM169 using our production process exceeds 4 years. The ability of the GMP lots to express hCFTR mRNA in target human airway cells was confirmed following ex vivo transfection of human nasal brushings (mean 24 %VE; n=5). The performance of a single aerosol dose of plasmid pGM169 is currently being evaluated in the lungs of CF patients. The physiological etiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease involves increased Na + absorption and decreased Clsecretion in the apical airway epithelium, resulting in dehydration of airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. The disruption of this mechanical clearance system leads to chronic bacterial infections, pulmonary inflammation, bronchiectesis, and death in severely affected CF patients. Denufosol is an investigational early-intervention therapy for CF shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of CF in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The objective of this research was to further elucidate denufosol's mechanism of action by investigating the effects of denufosol on Na + absorption through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Clsecretion through the calciumactivated chloride channel (CACC), airway surface liquid height, and cilia beat frequency in well-differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from normal and CF respiratory tract tissue.",

In addition, average annual expenditures for outpatient visits and prescription medications are higher for those with CF than those without CF. The total average annual physician visit cost per patient is $1,578. Clinical studies are underway for the aerosol delivery of Genzyme lipid GL67A/plasmid DNA to the lungs of patients with CF. A key requirement for successful non-viral gene therapy is a plasmid with the ability to direct long-term hCFTR gene expression in target cell types. To achieve this, we developed a series of novel, fourth generation plasmids that were free of CpGs to mimimise inflammatory responses after delivery, and tested the utility of a range of promoter, enhancer and terminator sequences in various models. We evaluated the plasmids for the expression of CpG-free, codonoptimized human CFTR (soCFTR2). Ultimately, a synthetic CpG-free promoter, hCEFI, was selected for long-term soCFTR2 expression. Successful expression of functional hCFTR protein was confirmed following transient transfection of HEK293T cells, using Western blotting, iodide efflux and patch clamp studies (Hyde 2008 Nature Biotechnology 26:549). To evaluate the performance of pGM169 in vivo we complexed the plasmid with GL67A, and aerosolised to the lungs of mice. To quantify plasmid deposition and hCFTR mRNA expression in the lungs we used TaqMan PCR and RT-PCR assays with sensitivities in the near single copy number range. After aerosol delivery, bulk pGM169 DNA levels in the lung fell by approximately three orders of magnitude from a peak at day 1 (27.8\u00b112.0 x10 3 copies per lung cell genome) to a steady state level by d14 onwards (P<0.05). Importantly, hCFTR mRNA was expressed in the lung at >5% endogenous (%VE) levels for at least 2 months (range 9.04-20.64%) and was not significantly different at d1, d14, d28 and d56 (P>0.33). Expression was also measured in human ex vivo cultures of nasal cells grown at an air liquid interface (Epithelix, Switzerland) (pGM169: 8/8 samples positive at d2; 5/8 at day 7), at higher levels (median 28.6 %VE at day 2) than first gen-",

            "text": "Conclusions: IV gallium, if found safe with favorable PK, offers a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic lower airway infection with P. aeruginosa in CF. It also could provide an additional agent to treat multi-drug resistant infections that have been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis in CF. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are promising vectors for use in gene therapy due to their high safety profile in human patients and long term transgene expression. We have employed a novel evolution and selection strategy to create and identify new AAV capsid variants which successfully infect a polarized human airway model system (Excoffon et al. PNAS 2009 ). The resulting capsid (AAV2.5T) was a chimera of AAV2 and AAV5, with amino acids 1-128 from AAV2 and amino acids 129-725 from AAV5, and a single additional point mutation (A581T). We hypothesized that AAV2.5T would have increased sialic acid-dependent binding on human airway epithelia. We found that AAV2.5T binding required sialic acid on the apical surface of human airway epithelia, and that AAV2.5T bound ~30 times better than AAV5. AAV2.5T binding reached saturation with a K d of 3.2x10 5 vg/cell and 7.7x10 3 receptors/cell. To further investigate the sialic acid dependence, we examined AAV2.5T binding on parental and sialic acid-deficient CHO cells. Interestingly, AAV2.5T bound equivalently in the presence or absence of sialic acid on the surface of CHO cells, but sialic acid was required for transduction by the virus. Thus, we hypothesized that sialic acid would be important downstream from the initial binding of the virus. We found that the sialic acid interaction was required for internalization of the virus. Restoration of \u03b12-3 N-linked sialic acid on mutant CHO cells restored internalization and transduction by the virus. Based on the distinct sialylation patterns between humans and pigs, we hypothesized that AAV2.5T may not infect airway epithelia cultured from pigs. Although viral binding was only slightly reduced in pig epithelia, viral internalization was significantly reduced. Thus, we found that AAV2.5T transduction correlated with the amount of viral internalization and not with the level of viral binding, suggesting that internalization was the rate limiting step in virus transduction of primary airway epithelia. We concluded that a novel interaction between the virus and sialic acid is required for internalization and transduction of AAV2.5T in human airway epithelia.

UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium, Edinburgh, London, Oxford, United Kingdom Aerosol delivery of gene transfer agents is the most practical route for CFTR based gene therapy for CF lung disease. When complexed with plasmid DNA (pDNA), the cationic polymer, 25kDa branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) retains transfection efficiency following aerosolisation and consequently is a popular non-viral choice for lung gene transfer. Until recently, progress towards the clinical use of PEI was limited by the low pDNA concentration achievable in standard PEI formulations. However, we have shown that concentrated PEI (cPEI) formulations containing up to 8 mg/ml pDNA can be prepared by controlled ultrafiltration of pDNA/PEI complexes, leading to robust levels of gene expression in the lungs of mice and sheep following aerosol delivery. We have capitalised on this important development to further exploit the potential of cPEI aerosol delivery for use in the clinic, focusing on formulations that are physically stable and suitable for long-term storage following manufacture, an absolute requirement for clinical utility. Plasmid DNA encoding firefly luciferase reporter gene was complexed with branched 25 kDa PEI (N:P of 10:1) at an initial pDNA concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile water and concentrated to 2.0\u00b10.2 mg/ml using a pressurised ultrafiltration cell incorporating a 100 kDa cut-off cellulose membrane. Complexes were filter sterilised and aliquots stored under nitrogen in glass vials at 4\u00b12\u00b0C for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 21 weeks. Visual inspection revealed no evidence of aggregation or precipitation at any time-point. A small increase in particle size from 62.5\u00b10.3 nm (mean\u00b1SEM) at 0 weeks to 65.1\u00b10.3 nm at 21 weeks (p<0.05 ANOVA) was identified using dynamic light scattering. No significant deviations from the initial particle zeta potential (+62.8\u00b10.5 mV) were observed over the same period. Following storage, cPEI complexes were aerosolised to the lungs of BALB/c mice via whole body aerosol exposure and 24 hrs later luciferase reporter gene expression was measured in lung homogenates at 426\u00b132 RLU/mg protein compared to 0.05\u00b10.01 RLU/mg in untreated mice (p<0.0001, Student's ttest). Storage of cPEI formulations for 1 week was associated with a minor reduction in luciferase reporter gene expression (307\u00b137 RLU/mg), but no further loss of biological efficacy was observed upon continued storage, with equivalent expression levels observed for at least 21 weeks (p>0.05 ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test).",

Background: Many patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) receive repeated courses of aminoglycosides, leading to an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since markers such as blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine (SCr) lack adequate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of AKI, other biomarkers may be useful to promptly and accurately identify AKI. Early diagnosis and intervention may modulate AKI and improve clinical outcome in patients who experience repeated subclinical renal insults as a result of chronic nephrotoxin exposure. We sought to characterize Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), Nacetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase (NAG) and total protein as urinary biomarkers (UBMs) of kidney injury in our CF patient population.",

Five of 8 patients actively receiving IV aminoglycosides had elevated KIM-1 levels (> 1.0 ng/mg creatinine) and all of these subjects had significant proteinuria (>0.2 mg/mg creatinine). KIM-1 levels were significantly increased compared to non-CF controls for all patients (p<0.001) and though it did not achieve statistical significance, this trend was reversed when comparing aminoglycoside na\u00efve patients with non-CF controls. Elevated KIM-1, NAG and total protein levels in urine were significantly associated with disease severity (p <0.001) in the CF patients.

Urinary KIM-1 and total protein levels were elevated in patients receiving aminoglycosides, even in the absence of elevation of serum creatinine. In addition, we have demonstrated that random KIM-1 and NAG levels are directly associated with disease severity. We expect that further characterization of UBMs will clarify their utility in detecting kidney injury in CF. Research and Treatment Center, UNC at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA In CF, adhesion between dehydrated luminal secretions and surface epithelia is thought to underlie the formation of mucus plaques and plugs. As shown in CF epithelial cultures, releasing adhered mucus plaques from epithelial surfaces is extremely difficult with rehydration alone. The use of a therapeutic aerosol with detergent-like properties, therefore, was postulated to reverse mucus adhesion by interrupting the molecular interactions that bind mucus secretions to airway surfaces. Inhaled surfactants are a therapeutic candidate that may fulfill this need. Previous studies with surfactant preparations have yielded improvements in mucus transport in a variety of model systems. Based on these findings, an ongoing single center clinical trial was designed to test the efficacy and safety of nebulized Lucinactant (Discovery Laboratories, Inc.). Lucinactant is a wholly synthetic preparation that includes the lipid constituents and the KL4 peptide, which mimics SP-B functions.",

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an epithelial chloride channel that regulates ion and fluid transport in multiple organs, including the lung. The F508del-CFTR mutation is the most common CF-disease causing mutation and is present in over 70% of CFTR alleles. This mutation results in impaired intracellular trafficking and reduced cell-surface expression of the F508del-CFTR protein. Such mutations are known as Class II mutations. Class I mutations, such as W1282X and G542X, are less common and result in a total lack of protein synthesis due to premature stop codons. Class III mutations (e.g. G551D) lead to the pared to 10.6% of normal in the placebo group (P<0.05 for the 250-mg group vs. placebo). In the 150-and 250-mg groups, Ringer's PD improved to 97.9% and 127.3% of the PD in normal subjects, compared to 182.9% of normal in the placebo group (P<0.05 for 150-mg group vs. placebo). In the 150-mg group, amiloride response was 89.3% of normal compared to 151% in placebo (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that Na + and Clconductance in HBEs treated with VX-770 closely corresponded to the in vivo response to VX-770 measured by NPD.

Cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding for F508del CFTR and halide-sensitive YFP, transfected cells were treated with test compounds overnight, and the extent of iodide influx was measured the next day. Good assay characteristics were achieved, with Z' values > 0.5. Several correctors showed activity, including VRT-325 and corrector 4a, as well as FoldRx correctors. Some correctors not detected in the FRT assay were active in the BHK assay, including Daunorubicin, Doxorubicin and Ciclopirox, demonstrating proof-of-concept for the discovery of different correctors than the FRT assay.

Class IV mutations (e.g. R117H) are associated with altered channel conductance. Class V mutations (e.g. 2789 + 5G \u00c7 A) lead to the production of normal proteins, but in reduced levels. VX-770 is an orally bioavailable agent that aims to potentiate the gating of CFTR channels. Previous studies demonstrated that VX-770 increased the gating activity of the G551D and F508del forms of CFTR. The current in-vitro study aimed to evaluate whether VX-770 could potentiate the activity of more than 50 different mutant forms of CFTR expressed in recombinant Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells and in cultured human bronchial epithelial (HBE) isolated from the bronchi of CF donors carrying different mutant CFTR forms. VX-770 was evaluated in FRT cells expressing 8 Class III mutations (e.g., G178R, G551D, G551S, G1349D). In this group, forskolin (10 \u00b5M; EC 99 )-stimulated chloride transport was increased by more than 10-fold following acute addition of VX-770. In FRT expressing Class IV mutations (e.g., R117H, D1152H, I148T), VX-770 potentiated 10 \u00b5M forskolin-stimulated chloride transport to a lesser degree than in the Class III mutations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene that encodes the CFTR protein, an epithelial Clion channel. VX-770, an investigational CFTR potentiator, aims to increase the ion channel activity of CFTR at the cell surface. In in-vitro studies, forskolin-stimulated primary F508del/G551D-HBE cells were treated with VX-770 10 \u00b5M. Cltransport increased by a mean of 4.3 mV and potential difference (PD) prior to amiloride decreased by a mean of 21.9 mV, suggesting reduced hyperabsorption of Na + . In CF patients, Na + is hyperabsorbed through ENaC in comparison to non-CF individuals. In the presence of forskolin, the baseline PD improved from 300% to 210% of wild-type with application of VX-770 (P<0.01). A Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of VX-770 was conducted in 39 CF subjects with a G551D-CFTR allele. Safety and efficacy results were reported previously. Statistically significant improvements from baseline in Clconductance as measured by NPD were seen after 14 days. In the 150-mg group (n=16), the mean change in zero Clplus isoproterenol response was -4.6 mV (P<0.01 within-subject, P<0.05 vs placebo). The mean change was -7.6 mV in the 250-mg group (n=7; P<0.05 within-subject and vs placebo). A significant increase in Ringer's PD was observed in the 150-mg group, suggesting a reduced hyperabsorption of Na + . In the 150-mg group (n=16), the starting basal PD increased by 13.0 mV (P<0.001 within-subject) compared to a 2.7 mV decrease in the placebo group (P=not significant within-subject for placebo and P<0.05 for 150mg vs. placebo). This suggests CFTR functional improvements were accompanied by reduced ENaC activity. As previously reported by Van Goor et al., the restoration of Cltransport to ~50% wild-type activity in primary F508del/G551D-HBE was similar to the change in Clconductance, measured by NPD, observed in the study of VX-770 in CF subjects with a G551D mutation. At day 14 in the 150-mg and 250-mg groups, the zero Clplus isoproterenol response was 29.7% (n=16) and 40.6% (n=7), respectively, of the normal (non-CF) response derived from a multicenter NPD dataset, com-",

Oxylipins are a group of oxidized metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids including the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) derived metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These oxylipins play an important role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, tissue repair, blood clotting, blood vessel permeability, inflammation, immune cell behavior and numerous other biopathologies.

Comparison of the different extraction methods indicates most of oxylipins stay in the pellet fraction of sputum. Liquid-liquid extraction has the highest extraction efficiency. Using the current extraction protocol and oxylipin profiling methodology, many biologically active pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators have been detected. Most of them have not been reported previously in CF sputum. Further characterizations and quantitation of bioactive lipids in CF secretions will be helpful towards further understanding of inflammation in CF and have potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

AAV is the most promising viral vector to develop successful gene therapy for CF, since feasibility and safety have been demonstrated without pathogenicity. Inflammation, known to be minimal, is not absent: in fact the various serotypes have been recognized as potentially impacting gene expression. The viral capsid is thought to trigger the innate immune response through pattern recognition receptors, prior to induction of the adaptive immune response. We hypothesized that aerosolized gene delivery would perturb gene expression, allowing the identification of those pathways involved in the modification of gene expression.",

Therefore, this environment may apply a selective pressure to PA that promotes the synthesis of CF-specific lipid A modifications, which include the addition of palmitate. To determine if this environmental condition had the ability to regulate specific LPS structural modification in PA, we examined the lipid A profiles from a variety of PA strains after growth under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions. We report that under these oxygen-limited growth conditions, laboratory adapted and environmental strains and acute disease clinical isolates were induced to add palmitate similar to those constitutively present in CF clinical isolates. Additionally, we showed that this is a PA specific process, as other bacterial species such as E. coli, S. typhimurium or Yersinia subspecies strains do not add palmitate after growth under oxygen-limited conditions. Finally, we show that the addition of palmitate is regulated by the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system. PhoP/PhoQ regulates lipid A modifications in many bacterial backgrounds in response to limitation of divalent cation, antimicrobial peptides, and low pH. This is the first report of this regulator responding specifically to oxygen limitation. This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (AI47938) and the CF Foundation. Introduction and Aims: The majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) die from chronic opportunistic infection of the lungs. Numerous studies have shown that CF airways are infected with complex microbial communities and that pathogens persist through multiple rounds of antibiotics. As many microbes are not detected by conventional culture methods, molecular detection techniques offer a more complete view of the nature of CF infections. The objective of this study was to characterize the CF lung microbiome and to determine the effect of antibiotic treatment on bacterial diversity and abundance during exacerbation.",

Over time a small number of taxa predominate causing more severe clinical symptoms. While the presence of Burkholderia was usually associated with a low FEV 1 , patients with Burkholderia that had higher overall microbial diversity tended to have a higher FEV 1 . Similar trends were seen with Pseudomonas. These data argue that microbial diversity may be a useful clinical parameter in addition to the usual assignment of pathogen identity. Many bacterial species can cause either acute or chronic infection, depending on host conditions. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prime example. P. aeruginosa can cause life-threatening infections in some hosts, while in other conditions, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), bacteria can persist within the airway for decades and never produce a disseminated infection. In chronic infections, P. aeruginosa becomes extremely tolerant to antibiotics and host defenses, even though the bacteria are susceptible when tested ex vivo. We hypothesized that the physical and biochemical properties of sputum may promote P. aeruginosa chronic infection by making the bacterium resistant to killing and less injurious to the host.",

P. aeruginosa growing diffusely in gels lacking sputum components rapidly injured airway epithelia as determined by transepithelial resistance measurements. In contrast, P. aeruginosa aggregates grown in CF sputum gels produced far less epithelial injury. These data show that both the physical and biochemical properties of CF sputum may contribute to growth of P. aeruginosa in aggregates. Formation of aggregates markedly increases tolerance to host defenses and antibiotics, reduces injury to epithelia, and possibly promotes the development of chronic airway infections in CF patients. To determine whether individual amino acids could influence the levels of c-di-GMP, a hyper-swarming strain with mutations in two diguanylate cyclases (sadC and roeA), involved in the synthesis of c-di-GMP, was tested on arginine. The sadC roeA mutant strain was able to restore swarming on arginine unlike the wild type, indicating that repression of swarming by arginine requires the synthesis of c-di-GMP and further suggesting that arginine can modulate c-di-GMP levels. To further confirm this observation, the double sadC roeA mutant was shown to act as a hyper-swarmer for every single amino acid, including methionine and phenylalanine, two amino acids that normally repressed swarming. Furthermore, the sadC roeA mutant, known to be deficient in biofilm formation due to its lower level of c-di-GMP, was also reduced in biofilm when grown with every individual amino acid tested. Finally, our initial biochemical analysis demonstrated that P. aeruginosa PA14 cells grown in the presence of arginine had elevated levels of intracellular c-di-GMP compared to cells grown with casamino acids in which swarming occurs.",

Mortality in cystic fibrosis is most commonly a result of persistent bacterial infection in the lungs due to reduced mucociliary clearance. As the number of options for the treatment of persistent infection has grown, it has become unclear which therapy is optimal. This uncertainty partly reflects the absence of a good model of chronic airways infection consequent to reduced mucociliary clearance in which to test potential therapies. To address this problem, we have developed a technique in which an infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an organism commonly found in CF lungs, can be established and chronically maintained in the lungs of mice overexpressing the \u03b2 subunit of the epithelial sodium channel scnn1 (\u03b2ENaC). \u03b2ENaC and wild type (wt) mice were intratracheally challenged with a small volume (15 \u00b5L) of low melting point agarose containing a low dose (1 x 10 4 cfu) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By 21 days after the challenge, nearly 90% of wt mice had completely cleared the Pseudomonas challenge, and those wt mice still infected exhibited an average bacterial load of less than 50 cfu/mouse. However, more than 85% of the challenged \u03b2ENaC mice maintained an active infection with Pseudomonas throughout the course of the challenge, with an average load of 6 x 10 3 cfu/mouse. The bacterial load in \u03b2ENaC mice did not significantly change through the course of the experiment. The infection in \u03b2ENaC mice led to a chronic mucopurulent obstructive inflammatory response in the airways characterized by neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as mucus overproduction leading to obstruction of the airways. This model will allow the investigation and comparison of clinical treatment regimens that clear mucus from obstructed airways, treat bacterial infections, or combine the two strategies. The hemolytic phospholipase C, PlcH, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a.) is an important virulence factor that is highly induced during lung infection in both animal models and P.a. infected CF sputum. In animal models this induction is dependent on the transcription factor GbdR. We have previously reported that PlcH directly alters pulmonary surfactant leading to closure of the small airways. While directly targeting PlcH with therapeutic agents is under study, we have data that stimulation of GbdR also induces other potential virulence factors. In addition, catabolism of host choline or carnitine provides glycine betaine (GB) which is a potent osmo-exposed to different selective pressures, genetic diversity may evolve in vivo in the infecting population. The emergence of extensive diversity is made more likely by the fact that infecting populations are large, mutator strains arise, and environmental conditions within the CF lung are heterogeneous.",

Spatial heterogeneity certainly exists in CF lungs as areas of severe, moderate, and mild disease co-exist in most patients. In addition, lung topography, the inactivation of motility genes, and constraints on bacterial movement imposed by viscous secretions could lead to subpopulations being geographically isolated. These points led us to hypothesize that the composition of P. aeruginosa populations varies in different lung regions. To test this, we sampled explanted lungs from three CF patients removed at the time of lung transplantation. Several hundred P. aeruginosa colonies from both peripheral lung parenchyma and major lobar airways were isolated and subjected to the phenotypic tests described above.

Furthermore, analysis of explanted lungs suggests that regional differences in environmental conditions and/or geographic isolation of subpopulations may contribute to the evolution of the population diversity. Our findings have implications for CF lung disease as diversity generally increases the stress resistance of biological populations, and their ability to exploit available resources. If these principles apply to the P. aeruginosa populations infecting CF patients, diversity may enhance the ability of bacteria to persist in the face of host defenses and clinical treatments. Bacteria can sense a diversity of signals regulating many of their functions allowing them to adapt to changing environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most important bacterial pathogen encountered by the cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs, faces a wealth of signaling molecules in this environment. The CF sputum is an ideal niche to support P. aeruginosa growth allowing the establishment of chronic infections. To support high-density growth, the CF sputum contains abundant amino acids that can be used as carbon sources. Although P. aeruginosa can catabolize only a few amino acids, it was shown that it could sense and respond to a variety of individual amino acids. However, such studies often used non-physiological amount of amino acids, making conclusions difficult to extrapolate to the host environment. However, the concentrations of free amino acids in CF sputum were recently quantified allowing for more relevant in vitro studies.",

Using relevant in vivo concentrations of 19 amino acids, we demonstrated that each amino acid differentially impacted the ability of P. aeruginosa strain PA14 to form biofilms when used as a sole carbon source. Although some amino acids, such as arginine, did not support robust growth, they still promoted the formation of biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, most amino acids could support swarming with the exception of arginine, methionine, and phenylalanine. We previously demonstrated that the level of the intracellular signaling molecule c-di-GMP had opposing effects on biofilm formation and swarming motility. In particular, high lev-protectant and stress protectant that may increase P.a. survival in the lung. In this study, we report a rationally designed small library of choline analogues to dissect the roles of the quaternary amines in regulation of P.a. virulence and to generate lead compounds that inhibit one or more steps in the catabolic pathway.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Airway colonization with C. albicans presaged a greater rate of FEV1 decline and hospital-treated exacerbations in CF. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most lethal genetic disease among the Caucasian population affecting over 4,000 Canadians. The genetic defect results in the production of dehydrated thick mucous at many epithelial surfaces. In addition to other clinical complications, this leads to chronic colonization of the lower airways of CF patients. It is chronic airway infection and the associated loss of lung function that is responsible for more than 90% of mortality in CF. CF microbiology is usually associated with well characterized pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but recently other organisms such as the Streptococcus milleri group have been implicated as potentially common but overlooked pathogens in CF. Furthermore, both culture dependent and independent approaches have demonstrated that the CF airway infections are polymicrobial. These communities include organisms which in animal models are avirulent on their own by enhancing the virulence of pathogens such as P. aeruginosa. These syergens include many streptococci that do not fall into known species. In this study, we screened our CF cultured microbiome collection (greater than 1400 strains) for potential novel streptococci by partial 16S rRNA sequencing. One hundred isolates did not correspond to any typed strains. Genotypic analysis, including full 16S sequencing and multilocus sequence typing with the sodA, rpoB, and ddl genes, yielded 48 novel strains in 7 clades. Phenotypic assays were conducted in parallel. Results showed that 86% of strains were positive for at least one exoenzyme virulence factor. There was poor correlation between genotypic and phenotypic properties highlighting the variability among this genera and the limitations to current speciation. Antibiotic susceptibility assays were also completed using the disc diffusion method with a high percentage of strains displaying resistance to macrolides, such as azithromycin (61%) and erythromycin (71%), drugs commonly used in CF treatment. These strains may serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes within the airway microbiome. The characterization of these novel Streptococcus spp. highlights their potential to be both primary pathogens as well as synergens within the CF microbiota. Results: Forty-one subjects isolating M. abscessus were identified (31 multiple isolates/10 single isolates). One subject was excluded from evaluation as insufficient clinical details were available. The mean age at first isolation was 27.6 years. Concerning concomitant diagnoses, ABPA was present in 38% of subjects who had multiple isolates and CF related diabetes in 10%.",

The 18-month EPIC trial compared cycled antibiotic therapy (administered quarterly regardless of culture findings) with culturebased therapy (administered only in response to Pa positivity). Participants received tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) with either oral ciprofloxacin or placebo during treatment cycles. No differences between groups were identified in the primary outcomes, time to pulmonary exacerbation and overall proportion of Pa positive cultures. The objectives of this study were to evaluate key secondary outcomes to (1) determine whether cycled therapy (with or without ciprofloxacin) is more effective than culture-based therapy in delaying Pa recurrence, and (2) Conclusions: PE are frequent events in CF. Approximately one quarter of events fail to respond adequately to initial management attempts.

Treatment failures were observed in 125 (27.7%) of PE episodes which were classified as: ARC 27 (6%), ERE 63 (14%), FTR 66 (15%) and POT 29 (6%). Thirty-nine (48%) patients experienced treatment failures. Of patients who experienced a mean one treatment failure/year demographic risk factors included: receipt of enteric feeds, CF-related diabetes and CFliver disease but did not include female sex or F508del homozygosity. Increased risk of treatment failure was associated with lower admission FEV 1 and increased admission white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). At therapy completion an elevated WCC and CRP increased risk of treatment failure. Therapy failure risk with individual antibiotics were as follows: piperacillin-tazobactam odds ratio (OR) 0.6, ceftazadime OR 0.9, aztreonam OR 1.24, meropenem OR 1.43, ciprofloxacin without beta-lac- 6 ; Ratjen, F. 7 ; for the AZ0004 Study, G. 6 1.

A total of 4,349 patients with chronic PA and adequate PFT data were identified; 1111 subsequently developed MARPA, while 3238 patients were PA+ but MARPA\u2212. Compared with patients who remained MARPA free, MARPA+ patients had lower FEV1 and received more antibiotic therapy. In the MARPA+ group, the mean FEV1 decline in the 2 years prior to MARPA detection was \u22122.22% predicted/year. After MARPA detection, it was \u2212 2.46%, which was not a significant change (P = .39). Persistent MARPA detection was found in only 11.1% of patients. Of patients with at least 1 MARPA+ culture, 36.3% were MARPA\u2212 for all subsequent cultures, with the balance of patients being intermittently MARPA+. There was no relationship between persistent infection and FEV1 decline.

However, MARPA acquisition is not associated with a significant change in FEV1 decline. These results suggest that MARPA is more likely to be a marker of more severe disease and more intensive therapy, and it does not independently contribute to more rapid lung function decline. Multi-year surveillance of bacterial pathogens in respiratory cultures of nearly 300 pediatric patients with CF and subsequent molecular typing of MRPA isolates revealed the continued prevalence of the endemic strain, or dominant clone. A retrospective study was performed to ed throughout the length of the study. Eleven of the 82 patients were under evaluation for lung transplantation, but the remaining 71 patients were further analyzed based on clonal groupings. Objectives included identification of risk factors for acquisition of the dominant MRPA clone and patient outcomes related to infection with the endemic MRPA strain. Initial results prompted further evaluation of infection control processes including stricter guidelines for contact isolation. Multiple improvements related to infection control in the CF patient population led to the reduced incidence of the endemic MRPA strain.",

MRSA are very seldom cultured from our CF population, and resistance to other drugs have no clinical implications on treatment of S. aureus infection. We do not use prophylactic chemotherapy but treat when S. aureus is detected by microscopy and culture. The number of eradications was about 60% and only 14% of the patients were chronically infected during the two years. The type I interferon (IFN) signaling cascade is increasingly being recognized as an important part of host defense against bacterial as well as viral infections, contributing to both pro-and anti-inflammatory signaling in the airway. In this study we tested the hypothesis that induction of type I IFN signaling by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is reduced in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells and that type I IFN signaling expedites clearance of P. aeruginosa from the airways. We used a human CF bronchial epithelial cell line IB3 (\u2206F508/W1282X) and corrected line C38 for in vitro comparison of type I IFN signaling following exposure to live P. aeruginosa, the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or the TLR3 ligand Poly:IC. CF epithelial cells were significantly attenuated in their ability to produce type I IFN in response to P. aeruginosa as compared to corrected epithelial cells. Interestingly, no defect was observed in CFTR knockout dendritic cells. Phosphorylated IRF3, a kinase immediately upstream of the type I IFN promoter, and type I IFN production was reduced in CF cells following LPS (TLR4) but not Poly:IC (TLR3) treatment compared to corrected cells. To elucidate a role for type I IFN in clearance of P. aeruginosa from the airways, wild type C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with Poly:IC to stimulate IFN production 24 hours prior to inoculation with P. aeruginosa (~1\u00d710 7 CFU). Bacterial counts in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung homogenate, and spleen samples were determined after 24 hours. Immune cell populations present in the BALF were analyzed by FACS. Mouse lungs infected with P. aeruginosa showed significant induction of type I IFN as measured by quan- Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes acute lung infection in children worldwide, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality. Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for severe RSV infections because they are prone to lung inflammation, bacterial colonization and airway disease. No treatment currently exists, hence prevention is important. Palivizumab (Synagis\u00ae) has been shown to reduce RSV hospitalization rates and is recommended for prophylaxis in high-risk children with other conditions. It is unclear if palivizumab is effective in preventing RSV hospitalizations in children with CF. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of palivizumab in preventing hospitalization and mortality due to RSV infection in children (18 years and younger) with CF.",

Full publication of the identified trial and additional randomized trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this vaccine in children with CF.",

Pretreatment of mice with Poly:IC greatly improved clearance of P. aeruginosa and increased the level of CD86+ airway macrophages and dendritic cells compared to mice treated with P. aeruginosa alone. We conclude that CF epithelial cells produce less type I IFN in response to P. aeruginosa, potentially due to a specific defect in TLR4 signaling, as type I IFN production is not reduced in these cells when treated with Poly:IC, a TLR3 agonist. Furthermore, type I IFN production in vivo facilitates the clearance of P. aeruginosa from the airways, suggesting that a reduction in type I IFN production in CF patients may promote colonization of the lung by this opportunistic pathogen. The majority of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients acquire chronic lung infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to biofilm formation. The inflammatory response may depend on whether the biofilm infection is established in the larger airways in the conducting zone (airflow) or the smaller airways in the respiratory zone (oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange) of the lungs. Due to localization of alveolar macrophages in the respiratory zone, we propose that biofilm infection in the smaller airways is more important, due to increased recognition. As a consequence, increased tissue damage in the respiratory zone would be expected.",

Introduction: CF is characterized by chronic pulmonary infection and intermittent acute exacerbations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen known to affect patients with CF, and by age 18, almost 80% of individuals are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. In 2003, Saiman et al. published the results of a randomized controlled trial demonstrating that treatment for 6 months with azithromycin in patients with CF and P. aeruginosa was beneficial. Specifically, there was a statistically significant increase in FEV 1 , decrease in pulmonary exacerbations, and an increase in weight compared to control patients. These data have led many CF clinicians to prescribe chronic macrolide therapy to patients with CF who are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. According to the 2008 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Patient Registry Report, only 65.6% of people who fit the criteria are receiving macrolide therapy. However, there have been no large scale long term follow-up studies on this patient population.",

            "text": "Funding The prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing in patients with cystic fibrosis. (CF) According to the CF registry, in 1995 less than 1% of patients had a respiratory culture positive for MRSA. Today that number has risen to greater than 20%. Several studies have recently shown a deleterious effect of persistent MRSA infection in patients with CF. For example, new persistent infection with MRSA in these patients is associated with an increased rate of decline in lung function (FEV1). There is no strong consensus among CF experts regarding the management of MRSA infection and even less published on its eradication. Therefore the University of Wisconsin-Madison American Family Children's Hospital CF Center developed a protocol to eradicate MRSA upon first acquisition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the triple antibiotic protocol using trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, rifampin and topical mupirocin. Three sets of surveillance cultures were obtained using standard technique 2 weeks following the completion of the protocol, as well as sputum cultures at 6 and 12 months post eradication protocol. From 1/10/2005 to 7/31/2009, 22 patients cultured positive for MRSA. Of those, 5 received the eradication protocol due to first acquisition of MRSA. All (100%) of the protocol patients remain free of MRSA 1 year post eradication protocol. Of the remaining 17 patients who did not receive the protocol due to persistent MRSA infection, 3 (18%) cleared MRSA on their own, and 14 (82%) remain colonized with MRSA. The overall results reveal MRSA clearance rates pre-protocol of 18% and post protocol of 100%, with a P value of 0.002. Based on these findings, we conclude that utilization of our protocol is positively associated with eradication of first acquisition of MRSA. Purpose: Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are often treated with aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics during an infective pulmonary exacerbation caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Achieving pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets to improve outcomes and counteract increasing rates of resistance is paramount. The primary objective of this study was to compare the number of pediatric CF patients achieving AG PK/PD targets when therapy is managed by a pharmacist (P) compared with nonpharmacist (NP)",

However it is possible that Ed contributes to clinical findings in CF pts and may require specific therapy. The high rate of co-infection with atypical mycobacteria seen in our population may be significant and suggests the need to actively search for this pathogen in pts isolating Ed failing to respond to usual CF treatments. Previous reports suggest Ed infection responds to treatment with antifungal agents and although this has been attempted in selected pts from our case series we cannot as yet determine the effectiveness of such therapy. A major cause of chronic airway infection in cystic fibrosis is biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa. Biofilms impede antibiotic penetration and increase antibiotic resistance. A small molecule that inhibits biofilm formation or disrupts/weakens existing biofilms may reduce P. aeruginosa colonization and recurrent lung infection in cystic fibrosis. Available iron chelators to inhibit biofilm formation are too toxic for clinical use. We conducted high-throughput screens to identify compounds that inhibit P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and/or growth. P. aeruginosa strain PA01 at mid-log phase was grown in 96-well plates (initial concentration 1 million cfu/ml) for 9 h at 37 o C in the presence of test compounds or vehicle (DMSO) alone. Growth was measured by optical density, and biofilm formation by crystal violet staining after washing to remove non-biofilm-associated bacteria. The screen was robust with Z'-factors greater than 0.5-0.6 for identification of antimicrobials and biofilm inhibitors. We screened 100,000 synthetic small molecules at 50 and 100 \u00b5M concentration, as well as smaller collections of approved and investigational drugs, as well purified plant-and microbederived natural compounds. Screening revealed known antimicrobials that inhibited P. aeruginosa growth, as well as several novel small-molecule antimicrobials, the most potent of which, a quinolone derivative, had IC50 6.3 \u00b5M. Two classes of compounds were identified that inhibited biofilm formation without affecting P. aeruginosa growth. After preliminary optimization by structure-activity analysis of more than 300 chemical analogs, the most potent class of compounds, benzothienopyrimidines, inhibited biofilm formation with IC50 ~ 3.1 \u00b5M. Biofilm inhibition was confirmed using alternative peg-lid and flow-cell methods, and by confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled bacteria. Following further optimization and compound prioritization, and testing on clinical isolates, the best compound(s) will be evaluated in a mouse model of P. aeruginosa infection. Non-toxic inhibitors of P. aeruginosa biofilms may be useful for therapy of chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis. This work was supported by the CFF and NIH.",

MRSA was associated with lower lung function than MSSA. Moreover, specific virulence factors, including the USA100-related pulsotype, clindamycin-resistance, the lack of pvl, and SCCmec II, were associated with lower lung function. Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses a number of strategies to colonize and persist in the CF lung. One recently discovered strategy is secretion of a virulence factor called Cif. Cif is capable of reducing trafficking of CFTR to the apical membrane of epithelial cells, thus diminishing the amount of CFTR present in infected lungs. Expression of this virulence factor is variable, with highest levels of expression seen in early-colonizing clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting its importance in early infection. Our goal is to decipher the regulation of this virulence factor to better understand its role in Pseudomonas infection. One previously identified regulator of Cif, CifR, is a TetR family repressor of gene expression. We know that this regulator directly binds to the promoter upstream of the cif gene to repress its expression, however we do not know the location of its binding site or if there are any other regulators that modify Cif expression. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and promoter mapping, we locate two distinct binding sites of CifR upstream of cif. Through mutational and overexpression analysis we also characterize another regulator of cif expression, CifA which is a LysR family repressor of cif expression. We further show, via expression analysis of these two regulators, that the regulation of this system is complex, with a dynamic interplay of repression. From these analyses we can conclude that CifR and CifA tightly regulate cif expression and that they are important for the regulation of Pseudomonas response to the host environment. Although the controls received no antibiotic treatment, the percentage of resistant strains in their periodontal pockets was similar to that of CF patients. Obviously, the frequent treatment with antibiotics in CF patients does not increase the percentage of resistant strains in their oral cavity. However, identical facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria in CF periodontal pockets and sputum samples suggest the oral cavity as a possible source for lung infection with these bacteria. ",

Consequently, we developed a novel co-culture model and showed that enhanced iron release by CF airway cells facilitates biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa growing on airway epithelial cells (1) . In order to identify the mechanisms involved in the iron imbalance observed in CF cells, we investigated the expression of DMT1, the major divalent metal transporter involved in human iron metabolism. The DMT1 gene is known to produce 4 isoforms by alternative splicing of its N-and/or C-terminus ends. The presence of an Iron Response Element (IRE) in the 3'-UTR of the mRNA differentiates the C-terminus spliced variants and is thought to stabilize and regulate the (+)IRE species of DMT1. Here we examined the expression of DMT1 in a human airway cell line originally isolated from a CF patient (CFBE+\u2206F508) and in its isogenic WT corrected counterpart (CFBE+WT). We show that both cell lines constitutively express the DMT1 (-)IRE protein. Surprisingly, CFBE+\u2206F508 cells also express DMT1 (+)IRE constitutively, whereas this isoform was undetectable in CFBE+WT under the conditions tested. Using a commercially available DMT1 (+)IRE cDNA, protein expression of the (+)IRE isoform was achieved in CFBE+WT cells at levels similar to the ones found in CF cells. Overexpression of the (+)IRE isoform in CFBE+WT cells resulted in enhanced biofilm formation at the apical surface of these cells, with a biomass significantly higher than on CFBE+WT cells transformed with an empty vector (1.59 \u00b1 0.10 vs 1.10 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 respectively, P=0.0009) and similar to the biomass observed on CFBE+\u2206F508 cells (1.40 \u00b1 0.07 \u00b5m 3 /\u00b5m 2 , P=0.119). Intracellular iron levels were determined with the calcein assay, in which the degree of calcein fluorescence quenching measures the chelated iron inside cells. Both CFBE+\u2206F508 and CFBE+WT cells incorporated calcein-AM at the same rate. However fluorescence quenching was more pronounced in CFBE+\u2206F508 cells suggesting that they have a higher (~1.8-fold) intracellular iron concentration. This result is in accordance with our previously published ICP-MS data (1) , and validates the use of the calcein assay. Overexpression of the (+)IRE isoform of DMT1 in CFBE+WT cells enhanced calcein fluorescence quenching (i.e., enhanced iron accumulation) compared with CFBE+WT cells transformed with an empty vector. In conclusion, expression of the (+)IRE isoform of DMT1 in CFBE+\u2206F508 cells increases iron uptake and is responsible, in part, for increased biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa at the apical surface of airway epithelial cells.",

The microorganisms of primary importance are bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia complex. The prevalence of airway colonization with Aspergillus species varies widely depending on the study population but rates over 50% have been reported. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is relatively common but despite high rates of Aspergillus spp. colonization, invasive Aspergillus spp. infection is very uncommon in those who have not been transplanted. Colonization with Aspergillus spp. is a predictor for worsening lung function, hospitalization and infection post-lung transplant. The role of antifungal therapy in persons with cystic fibrosis and Aspergillus spp. colonization remains unclear. A galactomannan assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Platelia\u2122 Aspergillus EIA) is approved for use in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in adults by detecting circulating galactomannan in human serum. There are studies in pediatric oncology patients suggesting serum galactomannan may also be useful in children but this has not been established. We sought to establish whether the galactomannan assay could detect circulating galactomannan in CF patients with chronic colonization and aid in identifying a subgroup that may need potential antifungal intervention. In an effort to identify breakpoints relevant to the clinical efficacy of inhaled antibiotics in CF, a retrospective analysis of clinical response to aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI; Cayston \u00ae ) or tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) therapy was conducted in relation to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) susceptibility to aztreonam and tobramycin, respectively. Data from patients treated with 75 mg AZLI or placebo three times daily (TID) for 28 days in two Phase 3 double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (AIR-CF1 and AIR-CF2) were pooled for analysis. TIS data are presented from patients who used \u22653 courses of TIS in the previous 12 months and received a 28-day course of TIS prior to AZLI or placebo in AIR-CF2. Three efficacy endpoints were used to categorize patients as improved, worsened or maintained at the end of 28-day therapy: CFQ-R respiratory symptoms score (RSS), pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) and sputum log 10 PA CFU.",

There was poor correlation of Etest synergy testing results and MCBT results. Persistence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients is due to its biofilm forming capacity. The biofilm mode of growth contributes to the tolerance against treatment with antibiotics as well as to the cellular components of the host response especially the polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). In addition, the persistent biofilms stimulate immune complex mediated tissue damage resulting in the demise of the patient. We have previously demonstrated that P. aeruginosa biofilm engages quorum sensing regulated production of cytolytic amounts of rhamnolipid when interacting with PMNs in vitro. Therefore we hypothesized that P. aeruginosa biofilm also employs rhamnolipid as a cytolytic defence against PMNs during infection in vivo. To study the dynamics of the interplay between bacterial biofilms and the innate immune system, an interplay which has only been described in vitro, we developed an animal model using hollow tubes which are implanted in the peritoneal cavity of mice. We followed the pathogen-host interaction by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at different time points to elucidate the role of rhamnolipids which causes the PMNs to undergo a necrotic death in vitro.",

Unexpectedly, QscR completely retained 3OC12-HSL throughout the purification. Furthermore, a significant portion of QscR from E. coli grown in the presence of N-(\u03b2-ketocaproyl)-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL) aggregated after each purification step. The aggregated QscR contained very little 3OC6-HSL whereas soluble QscR retained 3OC6-HSL. We conclude that QscR releases signal, but if the protein is at a sufficient concentration, in the nanomolar range, there will be sufficient signal with which to bind. Signal-free QscR is extremely unstable and aggregates or denatures quickly. Based on our findings, we propose a model whereby functional QscR molecules are synthesized in the absence of an acyl-HSL but they do not accumulate under those conditions because they are unstable and are eliminated from cells by aggregation or proteolysis. We do not believe that this model is specific to QscR. It likely applies to QscR homologs. We have a related poster showing that LasR can bind its cognate signal reversibly and it can fold into an active conformation in the absence of signal.

Biosynthesis of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent anti-microbial oxidant, in phagosomes is one of the chief mechanisms employed by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to combat infections. This reaction, catalyzed by myeloperoxidase, requires chloride anion (Cl -) as a substrate. Thus, Clavailability is a rate-limiting factor that affects neutrophil microbicidal function. Our previous research demonstrated that defective CFTR, a cAMP-activated chloride channel, present in CF patients leads to defective chloride transport to neutrophil phagosomes and impaired bacterial killing (Painter et al., 2008 (Painter et al., & 2010 . In this report, we successfully achieved lentiviral vector-mediated expression of the small interference RNA against CFTR in HL60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line. After DMSOinduced differentiation, CFTR expression in the neutrophil-like cells was abated by ~50-80% when compared to that of the control. The created CFTR deficiency in the HL60-derived neutrophils resulted in impaired bactericidal capability, thereby recapitulating the phenotype seen in CF patient cells. The results provide further evidence suggesting that CFTR plays an important role in phagocytic host defense. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) lung infections are main causes of morbidity and mortality in CF. Repeated courses of antibiotics give fewer infections and improve prognosis, but the threat of serious side effects by the use of antibiotics is a reality -especially the rapidly increasing antibiotic resistance; but also the toxic effects on kidneys and hearing, the detrimental effect on the normal intestinal flora and the emergence of new Gram negative bacteria in the lungs. Alternatives and/or complements to antibiotics are urgently needed.",

In 1985 the first description of A. xylosoxidans in relation to pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) was published. A. xylosoxidans is increasingly found in CF clinics world wide contributing to the problematic treatment of these patients due to its extremely elevated resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. These circumstances are making it an emerging CF pathogen of great interest. Several investigations have documented chronic infections by A. xylosoxidans with a general incidence of approximately 6-10% of the CF population and there is an overall perception from studies that it can spread by cross-infection. The majority of the literature about A. xylosoxidans is case reports, whereas publications documenting important pathogenic properties and resistance mechanism are scarce.",

A difference in the inflammatory response between the infection in the sinuses and the lungs is suggested by transcriptome data.

Pyrrolnitrin, xylocandin, the pseudanes, 4-quinolones, cepalycin, cepaciamide, maculosin, banegasin, and non-ribosomal peptide antibiotics are among the many antifungal Burkholderia compounds that have been identified. Few Burkholderia antibiotics with anti-bacterial activity have been characterised with the cepacins and the recently characterized polyketide, bactobolin, being examples of those with anti-Gram positive activity. The capistruin peptide of Burkholderia thailandensis is also one of the few antibiotics secreted that is active on another Burkholderia species, Burkholderia caledonica; such inhibition between species from the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) has not been observed. To survey antimicrobial secondary metabolite secretion by species within the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a collection of 267 strains representative of the 13 current species and several novel species groups was screened. Overlay assays with Staphylococcus aureus, Bulkholderia multivorans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were performed to detect anti-Gram positive, anti-Gram negative, and antifungal activities. lata were all resistant to the B. ambifaria antimicrobial.

Mutations in quorum sensing genes, the general protein section pathway, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and novel hypothetical genes were also found to alter or prevent antibiotic production. The global gene expression linked to the production of the antibiotic was determined using a custom genomic microarray designed B. ambifaria strain AMMD and demonstrated that multiple genes within the polyketide biosynthesis island were upregulated during antibiotic production.

Infections and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy; 2. Department of Microbiology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland Background: CF lung disease is characterized by transient airway P. aeruginosa infections and excessive neutrophil-dominated inflammation early in life followed by permanent chronic infection that causes persistent respiratory symptoms and a decline in lung functions. The pathogen itself may actively cause a great deal of damage, rather than damage caused by the host response. In an earlier study, we showed that P. aeruginosa is subjected to PAMPs modification as a strategy to hijack genes involved in innate immune responses. Comparing lipid A and peptidoglycan of sequential strains isolated from CF patients during a period of up to 7.5 years, we established for the first time that P. aeruginosa has evolved the capacity to evade immune system detection (Cigana et al, PlosOne 2009; Bragonzi et al, AJRCCM 2009 ). However, the \"pathological drift\" by P. aeruginosa adapted strains as a mechanism to sustain chronic infections remains to be established.",

Background: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of severe infections, many of which may have strong epidemiological impacts, such as meningitis, otitis media, pneumonia and sinusitis. In patients (pts) with cystic fibrosis (CF), S. pneumoniae has been reported as the fourth most common bacterial organism isolated from sputa, after Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Its prevalence may be underestimated, as S. pneumoniae is difficult to isolate from sputa often heavily colonized with the other organisms. The pathogenic role of S. pneumoniae in CF is controversial and only few reports document its potential involvement in pulmonary damage. The isolation of S. pneumoniae was associated with episodes of acute exacerbation.",

            "text": "We have determined the structure of Cif and shown it to be an epoxide hydrolase (EH) with unique substrate selectivity (3) . Mammalian EHs function as regulators of blood pressure and inflammation, while bacterial EHs are thought to detoxify xenobiotic compounds. Cif is the first example of an EH serving as a virulence factor. Based on structural comparison, it appears that the enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad of residues Asp129, Glu153 and His297, with accessory residues His177 and Tyr239 coordinating the epoxide oxygen during ring opening. His207 sits along the substrate access tunnel to the active site (see Figure) . We have generated mutations in the catalytic triad (E153Q), the ring coordinating residues (H177A), and the substrate tunnel (H207A). These mutations all prevent EH activity and also eliminate the CFTR inhibitory effect seen on airway epithelial cells. Thus, it appears that EH activity is strictly required for Cif mediated mislocalization of CFTR, suggesting that Cif may act on a physiological epoxide with a role in regulating CFTR trafficking. Mutation of the Glu153 side chain in the catalytic triad prevents Cif from releasing products of epoxide hydrolysis, but does not obstruct the formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate intermediate complex. This supports our mechanistic hypothesis and provides a basis for substrate-trapping experiments designed to identify candidate physiological targets. This work was supported by grants from the CFF (MADDEN08G0) and the NIH (P20-RR018787 and T32AI007519). Viral respiratory infections are a major source of morbidity in patients with CF, increasing lung inflammation, reducing Cltransport, and contributing to acute and chronic pulmonary decline. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis in young children, with higher incidences of disease complications in those with CF. Previously, we have reported that RSV is a potent stimulus of pro-MMP-9 expression and release in human airway cells. MMP-9 activity demonstrates a negative correlation with lung function in CF patients [1] , and is a critical enzyme in the production of chemotactic proline-glycine-proline (PGP) trimers from types I and II collagen [2] . PGP has been shown to bind CXCRI receptors on neutrophils, recruiting them into the pulmonary compartment. MMP-9 activity and PGP are extremely high in CF lower airway secretions and may represent an important component of excess levels of neutrophils and activity in the CF airway [3] . In the current study, we examined the effect of RSV infection on the MMP-9 axis in polarized human airway cell monolayers (16HBE cells and CFBE410-cells stably transduced with wtCFTR and F508del CFTR). Measurements were taken of RSV replication and MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression and release. RSV infection at an MOI of 0.1 -0.2 was sufficient to stimulate pro-MMP-9 expression and release from the apical and basolateral membranes, with maximal expression at days six to nine, post-infection. Control virus experiments with heat-killed RSV, and replication competent and incompetent adenovirus (serotype 5) failed to illicit MMP-9 expression and release. TIMP-1 expression was low or undetectable following RSV infection, indicating that MMP-9 was produced and released independently of its natural inhibitor. Inhibition of MMP-9 expression with transfection of siRNA directed against MMP-9 (Assays on Demand) and inhibition of activity through addition of a small molecule inhibitor of MMP-9 (doxycycline, 100 \u00b5g/mL) abrogated RSV replication in CFBE41o-wtCFTR+ cells, also reducing syncytia formation over the time course of RSV infection (p<0.001). Our results confirm that RSV is a potent stimulus of MMP-9 expression and release in human airway cell monolayers and identifies a critical role for MMP-9 in RSV replication. Use of MMP-9 inhibitory molecules may represent a novel means to reduce RSV replication and morbidity in CF patients infected with RSV.",

Biofilm bacteria are remarkably tolerant to antimicrobials and host defenses and this tolerance is a major factor causing persistent infection. Several mechanisms likely contribute to the antimicrobial tolerance of biofilms including the extracellullar matrix and induction of efflux pumps, but its mechanism remains elusive.

Thus, the starvation of subpopulations is thought to be a principal cause of antimicrobial tolerance in biofilms. Here we hypothesized that antimicrobial tolerance is mediated by the active induction of starvation responses in biofilms, and that interfering with these responses could reverse tolerance. We tested this by manipulating the stringent response (SR). This global regulatory mechanism is induced when bacteria sense stress and starvation, and the relA and spoT genes synthesize (p)ppGpp. This alarmone regulates many functions needed in starvation and stress conditions. We compared the antimicrobial tolerance of the relA spoT mutant (unable to induce the SR) to the wild type strain. In log-phase planktonic cells, serine starvation caused growth arrest in both strains but only conferred ofloxacin tolerance to the wild type. This indicates that starvation alone (without induction of the SR) was not sufficient to confer tolerance. Inactivation of the SR also increased the killing of biofilm bacteria by a broad range of antimicrobials (ofloxacin, meropenem, colistin) by 1000 to 10000 fold, and oxidants by 100 to 10000 fold.",

Inactivation of the stringent response greatly enhanced antibiotic activity against both nutrient limited planktonic bacteria and biofilm bacteria, and in-vivo infection models. These results raise the possibility that antimicrobial tolerance in biofilms and other nutrient limited conditions may depend upon orderly and regulated response to starvation that could be targeted using new therapeutic approaches. Infection with the Gram-negative rod Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes considerable morbidity in patients with cystic fibrosis and other causes of bronchiectasis. P. aeruginosa often forms airway biofilms in such patients by production of a battery of exoproducts and virulence factors, in a cell population density dependent fashion, a process called quorum sensing. In Pseudomonas, quorum sensing is mediated in part by the transcription factor LasR. This protein has previously been shown to have a very high affinity for its cognate signal, N-3-(oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3OC12-HSL). Prior studies of LasR-signal interactions, most of which were conducted in vitro, demonstrated functionally irreversible binding of LasR to 3OC12-HSL. In addition they suggested that 3OC12-HSL serves as a scaffold for LasR folding and as a consequence the absence of signal results in a misfolded, inactive protein. These results were consistent with prevailing models for members of the LasR family from other bacteria. Because of the extremely high affinity of LasR for 3OC12-HSL, it has been regarded as a difficult target for drug inhibition, although targeting quorum sensing may result in significant benefits to patients with pseudomonal colonization.",

This occurred in either recombinant E. coli or P. aeruginosa. We subsequently showed that the function of these LasR molecules can be rescued by re-addition of 3OC12-HSL, suggesting that this transcription factor retains an active conformation even in the absence of bound signal. We show that LasR is functional when synthesized in the absence of signal and, finally, that it can bind to a specific DNA target in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay when 3OC12-HSL is subsequently added. Together, these data demonstrate that LasR can be produced intracellularly in a properly folded activatable form, even if signal is not present, and also that the removal of cognate signal from the milieu results in cessation of LasR activity. These findings change our general view of the transcription factors that serve as signal receptors in acyl-HSL-mediated quorum sensing. They further suggest that the interaction of LasR and 3OC12-HSL may be more amenable to pharmacological disruption than previously believed. This work was supported by USPHS grant GM-59026.

We report the bactericidal activities of Panaecin against >100 P. aeruginosa (Pa) strains from CF patients as compared to tobramycin and aztreonam, as well as the Microbiological analysis of sputum isolates, showed the following incidences of microbiological isolations stable over the years: PNX+: S. aureus 100%, MRSA 62.5%, PA 75.0%, PAm 50.0%, B. cepacia 12.5%, S. maltophilia 25.0% PNX-: S. aureus 75.0%, MRSA 12.5%, PA 50.0%, PAm 37.5%, B. cepacia 12.5%, S. maltophilia 12. 5% We also analyzed data on the frequency of co-infections: -S. aureus + P. aeruginosa: 75% in PNX pts; 37.5% in No Pnx pts -MRSA + P. aeruginosa: 50% in PNX pts; 12.5% in No PNX pts. Conclusions: Prevalence of chronic infection by S. aureus in the PNX group was 100%, with a MRSA prevalence of 75%. Prevalence of chronic S. aureus in the control population was 75%, with a MRSA colonization in only 12.5% pts. Moreover, co-infection with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa was more frequent in pts with a history of PNX (75%) compared to controls (37.5%),and even more frequent in pts with MRSA and P. aeruginosa coinfection (50% vs 12.5%). There was a stable decline in SatO 2 in pts with PNX and a decrease in FVC, compared to controls. Our data revealed a correlation between chronic infection by S. aureus and PNX in CF pts. Given the small population, more studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogenic, Gram negative bacterium implicated in lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa can employ several different mechanisms of virulence, including formation of biofilms, which are bacterial aggregates with unique phenotypic properties. Biofilms of P. aeruginosa generally display a reduction in expression of toxins. Using a novel model of P. aeruginosa biofilm formation on cultured human airway epithelial cells, we have found that antibiotic treatment decreases bacterial toxicity toward the mammalian cells. We further found that this effect could be mediated, in part, by the magnesium transporter MgtE; expression of MgtE decreased toxicity, and deletion of the mgtE gene increased toxicity. Tobramycin treatment of P. aeruginosa biofilms grown on CF airway cells upregulated expression of the mgtE gene. In an attempt to further understand the role of MgtE in P. aeruginosa virulence, we are investigating the effects of other antibiotics on MgtE regulation. Toward that end, transcriptional assays and RT-PCR are being used to elucidate the response of mgtE after treatment of P. aeruginosa biofilms with several different antibiotics. Since MgtE plays a role in biofilm cytotoxicity and biofilms are an integral part of P. aeruginosa infections, this research will lead to a better understanding of the role MgtE plays in biofilm virulence, the impact of different antibiotics on biofilm formation, and, ultimately, P. aeruginosa virulence. Chronic lung infection with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of death for individuals with CF. This infection process involves the formation of P. aeruginosa communities called biofilms. While the production of some toxins and other virulence determinants generally decreases as P. aeruginosa forms biofilms, the bacteria upregulate expression of factors that promote chronic survival, including alginate (an exopolysaccharide) and genes involved in antibiotic resistance. Using a tissue culture model system for developing P. aeruginosa biofilms on human airway epithelial cells, we have previously found that expression of the bacterial magnesium transporter MgtE decreases cytotoxicity of the bacteria by decreasing transcription of the type III secretion system (T3SS). We also previously found that cytotoxicity could still be inhibited if magnesium transport was disrupted, suggesting a dual function for MgtE. In order to more clearly define these functions, we performed a structure/function analysis of MgtE. Point mutations, as well as C-terminal truncations, were created in the mgtE gene, and the resultant clones were tested for the ability to transport magnesium and inhibit cytotoxicity. Thus, we are identifying which regions of the protein are involved in which function. On the other hand, deletion of the mgtE gene leads to increased cytotoxicity by enhanced transcription of T3SS genes. In order to clarify the molecular details of this interaction, we have performed a genetic screen of random transposon mutants in an mgtE deletion mutant background, looking for suppressor mutations. In this manner, we have identified several genes that might be involved in MgtE-mediated control of T3SS transcription, including a gene for a transcription repressor that influences expression of antibiotic resistance genes. Our studies show that MgtE can affect the virulence of P. aeruginosa grown as biofilms on CF airway cells. These data further suggest that it might be possible to induce P. aeruginosa to switch to a planktonic (nonbiofilm) state while maintaining low expression of toxicity factors. Future therapies might target MgtE to disrupt biofilms and decrease bacterial toxicity. Methods: SP isolates were collected from sputum of CF patients at quarterly visits or during exacerbations and from pediatric patient sputa without CF (NCF) between 2002 and 2008 at Children's Hospital, Birmingham, AL, where 300 CF patients are followed. Patient demographics, antibiotic susceptibility, and co-infecting species were recorded. The isolates were serotyped by multiplex bead assay which allows identification of 51 serotypes including those contained in current pneumococcal vaccines (PCV7, PCV13 (Pfizer), and Pneumovax). Isolates not recognized by the assay were labeled nontypeable (NT).",

Secondary or late acylation is carried out by the acyltransferase enzyme, htrB (lpxL). Mining of the laboratory-adapted strain PAO1 genome revealed the presence of two homologues to the S. typhimurium htrB gene, htrB1 (PA0011) and htrB2 (PA3242). These genes share 29% homology to each other. In this study, clean deletions were generated in these genes and their effect on lipid A structure was analyzed. To assess potential alterations in the fatty acid content from these mutant strains, lipid A was subjected to gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Subsequently, to determine the location of the individual acylation reactions, complete lipid A structural analysis was examined by both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS n ). Interestingly, the two genes were not redundant but each carried a site-specific function. Disruption of htrB function may decrease resistance to antimicrobial peptides, making further study of these genes important for the improvement of treatment of PA in CF patients.

Biostatistics, UNC, Chapel Hill, NC, USA; 4. Columbia University, NY, NY, USA Introduction: The prevalence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in American CF patients is increasing. In 2008, the overall prevalence was ~ 23%, ranging from 4-41% between CF centers. The highest age-specific prevalence was reported in adolescents. MRSA complicates care (isolation, medication choices) and may affect clinical outcomes. Molecular analysis of MRSA shows different staphylococcal cassette chromosomes (SCCmec) types that carry the resistance genes. Epidemiologically SCCmec II has been associated with hospital-associated [HA] strains and SCCmec IV with community associated (CA) infections. Additionally the pvl gene is one of the important virulence factors, which is more frequently but not uniformly seen in SCCmec IV strains. It is unknown if different molecular types of MRSA, as have been reported in non-CF patients, are present in CF patients and are associated with different outcomes. directly related to the duration of exposure but does not appear to be a fixed sensitization as eosinophil values on subsequent admissions have returned to their prior baseline. The effect of prednisone as a modifier was noted but no dose relationship was established. However, consideration should be given to the concurrent use of low-dose prednisone to blunt the potentially deleterious effect of the release of unspecified cytokine agents from the degranulation of the excessive circulating eosinophils.",

In patients with MRSA bacteremia, MIC > 1 is associated with up to 7-fold increase in localization of the calcium-sensitive transcription factor NFAT, which could contribute to the enhanced secretion of IL-13 and other cytokines. In summary, our data identified that CFTR dysfunction in T cells can lead directly to aberrant immune responses. Specifically, Cftr deficient lymphocytes directed skewed responses to Aspergillus fumigatus, leading to a higher than normal IgE response. These findings implicate the lymphocyte population as a potentially important target for therapeutics directed to the treatment of CF lung disease. Background: Patients (pts) with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at increased risk for severe illness with influenza. Annual influenza vaccination is therefore commonly recommended for people with CF. During the 2009 influenza A/H1N1v pandemic, vaccination against A/H1N1v was strongly recommended for CF pts.

Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA Cystic fibrosis (CF) remains the most common fatal monogenic disease in the US, affecting 1 in 3,300 live births. CF is the result of mutations in CFTR, a chloride channel and regulator of other ion channels. The mechanisms by which CFTR mutations cause chronic lung disease in CF are not fully defined, but may include the combined effects of altered ion and water transport across the airway epithelium and aberrant inflammatory and immune responses to pathogens within the airways. We have shown that Cftr-/-mice mount an exaggerated IgE response toward Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) when compared to Cftr+/+ mice. Along with the increased IgE levels, the Cftr-/-mice had higher levels of IL-13 and IL-4, mimicking both the Th-2 biased immune responses and predilection to mounting Af-specifc IgE seen in CF patients. Herein we hypothesize that these immune aberrations are primarily due to the lack of Cftr expression in lymphocytes rather than with Cftr deficiency in the epithelium. Our results indicate that adoptive transfer experiments with CF splenocytes confer higher IgE response to Af in host mice as compared to hosts receiving wild-type splenocytes. The predilection of Cftr-deficient lymphocytes to mount Th2 responses was confirmed by in vitro antigen recall experiments, where higher levels of IL-13 and IL-4 where seen only in the presence of Cftr-deficient lymphocytes. Conclusive data on this phenomenon were obtained with conditional Cftr knockout mice, where mice lacking Cftr in T-cell lineages developed higher IgE titers as compared to their wild-type littermate controls. Further analysis of Cftr-deficient lymphocytes revealed an enhanced intracellular Ca 2+ flux in response to T cell receptor activation as compared to normal lymphocytes. This was accompanied by a significant increase in nuclear nisms by which alginate confers resistance to complement-independent phagocytic killing. To accomplish this, we developed a model to investigate the early stages of bacterial phagocytosis, specifically adherence and uptake. Phorbol ester was used to induce THP-1 cells, an acute monocytic leukemia derived cell line, to become adherent and highly phagocytic macrophages. Isogenic Pseudomonas strains carrying a plasmid constitutively expressing GFP or mCherry were visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Mucoid P. aeruginosa FRD1, a frequently studied CF isolate and alginate overproducing (Alg+) strain, was used. When phagocytic uptake of an algD::Tn501 Alg-mutant, FRD1131, was compared to the Alg+ parent strain, the proportion of macrophages containing the Alg-strain greatly exceeded that of the parental strain. To verify that the bacteria had been phagocytosed, the infected cells were treated with gentamicin to remove the extracellular bacteria and lysed, after which cells were plated to assess the number of viable P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, in contrast to E. coli (which served as a positive control), intracellular P. aeruginosa were still viable after 6 hours of culture. Using flow cytometry, both the kinetics and extent of uptake were measured. Alg+ and Alg-bacteria were both taken up, but phagocytosis of the Algstrain was more rapid and efficient. Exogenous alginate (from Pseudomonas or seaweed) did not appear to protect the Alg-strain from uptake. Currently, we are examining the relationship between phagocytic uptake and the induction of signaling.",

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) represents the predominant Cltransport conduit within respiratory epithelial cells. Activation of secondary Cltransport pathways through calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) provides a potential mechanism to circumvent CF-related airway defects in mucus clearance. While much is known regarding CFTR structure and function, the Clchannel TMEM16A has only recently been identified as a major pulmonary CaCC. Because TMEM16A may serve as a respiratory target for CF therapy, studies to improve understanding of CaCC in CF airway disease are indicated. In the present experiments, primary murine nasal septal epithelial (MNSE) cultures (wild type (wt) and transgenic CFTR -/-) were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or an ultrafiltrate of PAO1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (bacteria-free preparation from 20 hour log-phase growth). Basal media was collected from airway cell monolayers and analyzed for murine CXCL1/KC (human IL-8 analogue) by ELISA to confirm activation of NFKB mediated inflammatory signaling. Cultures were mounted in Ussing chambers for ion transport measurements. The presence of TMEM16A mRNA and protein in primary cell culture was determined using RT-PCR and immunofluorescence, respectively.",

We expect to enroll 150 patients who will be followed for 3 years with a projected total of >900 specimens. Preliminary data suggests that respiratory samples from CF patients may be more diverse than previously thought, with many samples having more than 20 bacterial phylotypes present. In addition, our results underscore the importance of anaerobic bacteria (eg., Prevotella spp.), as abundant and important members of the CF respiratory microbiota. This ongoing pilot study's aim was to screen a variety of essential oils (EOs) for antimicrobial activity toward cystic fibrosis (CF)-adapted pathogens, toward their potential use in the battle of persistent and polymicrobial infections in CF. Essential oils (EOs) have long been known to possess healing effects, with many providing antimicrobial, antioxidant, and/or anti-inflammatory activities. Individuals with CF suffering from chronic respiratory tract infections are frequently co-colonized with one or more phenotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and/or Staphylococcus aureus (SA), along with other bacterial and fungal species. The EO screening study presented here tested laboratory strains and clinical isolates of CF pathogens PA and SA. EO inhibition of respiratory pathogen growth was evaluated by disk diffusion and vapor exposure assays. To date,159 EOs have been evaluated. Generally SA was more sensitive to contact and vapor inhibition by EOs than PA. Fifty-three oils were effective on 1 or more PA strains. PA zones of inhibition (ZoI) ranged from 6 mm (w/6mm disk) to over 20 mm in disk diffusion tests, employing consistent volumes of \"neat\" essential oils. Where no growth was seen in the zone, inhibition was considered complete; where growth was less within a zone surrounding the disk, it was judged as incomplete. One CF isolate was generally the most sensitive and lab strain ATCC 39018 was generally the least sensitive PA based on zone size and completeness of growth inhibition. The top performers evaluated thus far are bay (Pimenta racemosa), cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum), oregano (Origainum compactum), thyme white (Thymus vulgaris), cassia (Cinnamomum cassia) and wintergreen (Gaultheria fragrantissima), with disk ZoI of 9 -35 mm. Cassia was the only oil to significantly inhibit all PA tested (avg ~20 mm for these top 6 oils). Ongoing studies include To better understand the complex bacterial/inflammatory cell interactions occurring in the CF lung, we have chosen to study the arginine metabolite, agmatine. Agmatine is the product of the arginine decarboxylase pathway present in both bacteria and mammals. In mammals agmatine acts as a neurotransmitter, a regulator of nitric oxide and a ligand of the \u03b12-adrenoreceptor, which is implicated in lung inflammation. In most bacteria, agmatine serves as the major intermediate in the production of polyamines, which are essential for bacterial growth. We believe both the host and pathogen agmatine pathways contribute to the agmatine pools we have found in CF sputum. We have previously shown that sputum agmatine is positively correlated with inflammatory markers and that agmatine is capable of NF-\u03baB mediated inflammatory signaling in both macrophage cell culture and in mouse lungs as measured in a transgenic NF-\u03baB reporter mouse. Our new data confirms this signaling occurs through the \u03b12-adrenoreceptor as systemic administration of a specific \u03b12-adrenoreceptor blocker in mice inhibits agmatine induced NF-\u03baB stimulation in the lung.",

As agmatine appears to be an inflammatory mediator of the lung, P. aeruginosa may have evolved this mechanism to detect a potential inflammatory milieu and retreat to a biofilm in its presence. We have generated a number of mutants of the agmatine pathways in P. aeruginosa and our preliminary results in an acute pneumonia model suggests strains that do not metabolize agmatine are more lethal than those that cannot make agmatine. This suggests unchecked bacterial agmatine production may overdrive the inflammatory response, or prevent bacterial killing by a possible attempt to form a biofilm. We have also generated agmatine-induced, bioluminescent reporter P. aeruginosa to measure bacterial transcription of the agmatine operons while in the live mouse lung or in cell culture models. These reporter strains have revealed real-time detection of agmatine pools within the mouse lung during an acute pneumonia model. Future studies will seek to determine the contribution of bacterial, or host cell derived, agmatine pools in lung inflammation and potentially biofilm formation in vivo.",

Rhinovirus was the main viral agent identified (140 samples, 34.3%), but was not associated with respiratory exacerbations.

Co-infections were identified in 6 samples chemical analyses of effective oils, antimicrobial assays of the individual components of the most effective oils in initial screening, chemical modification of key constituents to improve their effectiveness and reduce potential adverse effects, and screening for possible synergistic effects of EOs with antibiotics used in CF. As CF infections often consist of multiple bacteria and yeasts and/or fungi, and present in the context of the thick, heterogeneous mucus environment in which the opportunistic pathogens persist, the effectiveness of EOs against organisms in CF sputum directly is also being addressed. In initial testing, cassia was found to effectively inhibit growth of all species when a typical polymicrobial CF sputum specimen with mucoid PA and C. albicans was plated directly and challenged with EO by disk diffusion or vapor. This preliminary study suggests that further screening, chemical analyses, and evaluation in cell culture systems, of specific essential oils may indeed lead to an additional and complementary, botanicals-based therapeutic tool for the treatment of complex airway infections in CF. Studies utilizing culture-independent methods suggest that the airways of chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients harbor a diverse collection of bacterial species. The organisms detected include those not considered to be typical pathogens, and recent work raises the possibility that these organisms may contribute to disease manifestations in CF. However, the oropharynx is known to be colonized with a vast array of microbial species and these organisms could confound microbial diversity studies if oropharngeal bacteria contaminate expectorated sputum. To mitigate this potential problem, we studied CF lung explants removed at the time of lung transplantation using a culture-independent method to measure microbial diversity. To date, endobronchial secretion samples from five explanted lungs were evaluated using bacterial tag-encoded FLX-Titanium amplicon pyrosequencing. Three patients also provided preoperative upper airway sputum samples for bacterial comparison.",

Furthermore, a similar spectrum of colonizing species was detected regardless of whether culture-independent or culture-dependent methods were used. These data raise the possibility that in end-stage CF lung disease, culture-independent analysis of samples obtained through the upper airway overestimates bacterial diversity present in the lungs. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by chronic airways infections that are nearly impossible to eradicate once established. The bacterial infections, particularly due to P. aeruginosa, exist as a biofilm, a form of growth that is resistant to phagocytosis and antibiotic therapy. Another hallmark of CF lung disease is an intense neutrophilic infiltration and activation within the airways. Despite the recognition of the bacterial biofilm as a pathologic nidus in the airway, there is very little knowledge of its in vivo regulation or the signals it releases to generate such a robust, but ineffective, inflammatory response.",

One mechanism of resistance involves antibiotic efflux pumps which have previously been associated with resistance in non-CF samples. They have been suggested to play a major role in PA infections in patients with CF. Resistance to aminoglycosides has specifically been associated with increased expression of the mexXY efflux pump in both CF and non-CF isolates, however little is known about the time course of change in the CF lung.

Centre for Understanding and Preventing Infection in Children, Vancouver, BC, Canada The Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) group of Gram-negative bacteria are highly virulent, opportunistic pathogens in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. It is the current dogma that all species of the complex are highly and intrinsically resistant to polycationic antimicrobials, and that characteristics of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are responsible for the resistance. Cationic agents enter Gram-negative bacteria through LPS-mediated selfpromoted uptake, relying specifically on anionic lipid A binding sites. Here we observed that most environmental and clinical isolates of B. vietnamiensis, unlike other BCC species, were intrinsically susceptible to aminoglycosides, but resistant to other cationic agents (natural and synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptides and polymyxin B). Furthermore, some strains acquired aminoglycoside resistance during chronic CF infection. The objective of this study was to characterize aminoglycoside susceptibility in B. vietnamiensis and gain insights into the potential mechanisms involved in aminoglycoside resistance. Gentamicin and tobramycin time-kill assays revealed that high drug concentrations were required for significant killing of a susceptible B. vietnamiensis CF strain. Susceptible B. vietnamiensis CF isolates accumulated 5 to 6 times more [ 3 H]gentamicin than a resistant isolate, but permeability to the fluorescent hydrophobic probe 1-N-phenylnapthylamine (NPN), a measure of self-promoted uptake, was not enhanced following incubation with gentamicin or tobramycin. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy revealed the presence of lipid A-associated aminoarabinose moieties in aminoglycoside-susceptible and -resistant B. vietnamiensis isolates. These data suggest that in B. vietnamiensis decreased cellular accumulation is involved in aminoglycoside resistance and aminoglycoside entry does not occur via self-promoted uptake. We are currently investigating the basis of the observed differential gentamicin accumulation. This work was supported by the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research and the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Human influenza A viruses bind host cell sialic acids terminating in an \u03b1(2,6)-linkage, while hybridized avian and animal strains adapted to infect humans may bind both \u03b1(2,3)and \u03b1(2,6)-linkages. Also, many candidate adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vectors transduce via sialic acid receptors. Human airways are commonly colonized with non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a gram negative bacterium. NTHi inhabits the nasopharynx of asymptomatic carriers and the conducting airways of cystic fibrosis patients. NTHi scavenges sialic acids, incorporates these sugars onto its surface and forms sialic acid-rich biofilms.",

We have measured 8 protein biomarkers (G-CSF, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b21, NEAPC, hsCRP) in paired pre and post IV antibiotic plasma samples and are currently measuring 7 additional proteins (\u03b11-antitrypsin, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, arginase-1, calprotectin, serum amyloid A, sCD40L). Serum aliquots collected both pre and post IV antibiotic therapy were submitted for complete blood counts. Additionally, spirometry, a CF Respiratory Symptom Questionnaire, and sputum for bacterial culture were collected at both time points. Changes in individual and combinations of biomarkers will be correlated to changes in these clinical parameters.",

Antibiotic treatment for a pulmonary exacerbation resulted in a significant decrease in sputum arginase activity (216.7\u00b135.6 vs 75.1\u00b113.2 mU/mg protein, p=0.0005). In contrast, the concentrations of sputum NO metabolites (NOx) increased (432.3\u00b183.6 vs 893.6\u00b1143.7 \u00b5mol/L, p=0.0004), confirming previous results from our group. The absolute concentrations of L-arginine, ADMA and SDMA decreased with treatment (p < 0.01, respectively). However, the L-arginine/ADMA ratio in CF sputum increased significantly with treatment (194.7\u00b130.9 vs 311.9\u00b147.7, p=0.01) suggesting an increase in the ratio of substrate over inhibitor for NOS.The changes in sputum ADMA level showed a significant correlation with both changes in sputum NOx concentrations (r=-0.63) and changes in FEV1 (r=-0.66), as did the change in SDMA (r=-0.49 and -0.63, respectively) suggesting that CF patients who showed the greatest degree of decrease in sputum ADMA and SDMA concentrations with antibiotic treat-ease often compared to CF, but little is known about the relationships between spirometry, LCI and HRCT in PCD. We hypothesised that the worse prognosis for CF would be reflected by disproportionately greater lung destruction as a given level of functional impairment than in PCD.",

Verona CF Center, Azienda Ospedaliera di Verona, Verona, Italy Background: The most important components of CF lung disease are bronchiectasis (BE) and trapped air (TA). Chest-CT is the current gold standard to diagnose and monitor BE, TA and other structural lung alterations in CF. Chest-MRI has been suggested as a radiation free alternative for CT, but is limited by a lower spatial resolution, especially in the lung periphery. To date no head to head comparison has been done to compare the sensitivity of chest-CT and chest-MRI to detect BE and TA in CF.",

Our study demonstrated as a previous study that MRI is less sensitive compared to CT in the detection of BE and TA. We are currently testing alternative image analysis techniques to improve the sensitivity of MRI to monitor CF lung disease. Results: The survey was completed by a minimum of 58 sites per year, by the site PI at ~75% of sites and by the research coordinator at ~25% (varied slightly by year). Infant pulmonary function testing was used to monitor lung disease in 2006 at 20/58 (34%) sites and in 2008 at 25/58 (43%). In 2008, performance was routine (76%) and for clinical indications (64%, not mutually exclusive). Chest CT scans were used to monitor lung disease in 2006 at 34/58 (58%) sites and in 2008 at 50/58 (86%) sites. In 2008, CT scans were performed more for clinical indications (96%) rather than routine use (14%, not mutually exclusive). As CF newborn screening has become more widespread, cohorting for infection control purposes has increased: scheduling infants and young children on different days or in different areas increased from 5 (8%) in 2005 to 17 (29%) in 2008. In terms of treatment practices, in 2008 56/58 (97%) sites always or often treated the initial isolation of Pseudomonas (Pa) in patients \u226412 years of age independent of symptoms.",

The mean number of measurements per participant was 6 (range: 3, 9) . The correlation between participants' z-score at the last IPFT and first spirometry was 0.4 (p = 0.02) for FEV0.5, 0.3 (p=0.03) for FEF25-75, and 0.3 (p=0.02) for FVC. The mean elapsed time between these measurements was 2.4 years (range: 0.9, 4.2). Average z-scores decreased by 0.2/year (95% CI: 0.1, 0.3) for FEV0.5, 0.1 (0, 0.2) for FEF25-75, and 0.2 (0.1, 0.3) for FVC over the observation period. However, there was significant variability among individual slopes (standard deviation of slopes was 0.2 z-scores/year for FEV0.5, 0.3 for FEF25-75, and 0.2 for FVC; range of slopes was -0.5 to 0.1 z-scores/year for FEV0.5, -0.6 to 0.4 for FEF25-75, and -0.5 to 0.1 for FVC). A recent culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) was associated with a 5% (95% CI: 0, 10) lower FEV0.5 and 16% (7, 24) lower FEF25-75 on average, after adjustment for length and test (IPFT or preschool spirometry). A recent Papositive culture was also associated with a 0.3 (95% CI: 0, 0.6) lower Zscore for FEV0. 5 and 0.8 (0.4, 1. 3) lower Z-score for FEF25-75 on average, after adjustment for age.",

At the same time, there is great interest in studying new interventions in these younger children with less advanced CF lung disease. CT scanning has been shown to be a sensitive method for evaluating CF lung disease and CT scans of young children have revealed evidence of lung disease earlier than x-rays or PFTs.

            "text": "Discussion: CT scanning has been shown to be a sensitive method for evaluating CF lung disease. Many investigators believe motion free images at TLC (total lung capacity) and near RV (residual volume) are important to obtain accurate information. This has often led to limiting imaging trials to children 6 years old or older, when cooperation with breathing instructions becomes possible. We have previously shown that GA in children ages 2-5 is a safe and effective way to obtain high-quality CT images. In this crosssectional study we used GA in 2-5 year olds and voluntary lung volume control in 5-6 year olds to evaluate the presence and severity of CF lung abnormalities on CT. No differences in lung disease across ages were demonstrated. This finding has been reported by others, and suggests that CF lung disease may progress relatively slowly in this age range. A longitudinal study is ongoing to further characterize lung disease in toddlers and preschoolers with CF.",

Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were obtained on all enrolled patients and tested by direct immunofluorescence (IF) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-3 and adenovirus A and B, as well as by a multiplex molecular diagnostic assay (ResPlex II v2, Qiagen) that detects the above plus rhinovirus, coxsackie/echovirus, parainfluenza 4 and coronavirus. Demographic data, microbiological results, pulmonary function tests, antibiotic use, hospitalizations, quality of life (CF Questionnaire-Revised) and severity scores (CF Clinical Score) were recorded. Sputum inflammatory markers, cell counts and bacterial density were also measured. Results: Forty-three patients were enrolled and had NP swabs for viral testing by IF and multiplex assay. Nineteen were negative for any virus and 24 were positive for at least 1 virus (10 positive by IF and multiplex; 14 positive by multiplex alone). In 9 of 24 patients (37%), more than 1 virus was detected. The most common viruses detected were RSV (28% of specimens), coxsackie/echovirus (22%), rhinovirus (13%), parainfluenza virus (10%) and pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (9%). Baseline patient characteristics demonstrated that virus-positive patients were more likely to be younger than virus-negative patients (7.8 yrs vs 10.8 yrs, p=0.05) and male (p=0.03). Other baseline characteristics including genotype, comorbidities and colonizing respiratory flora were similar between both groups. A greater percentage of virus-negative compared to virus-positive patients received the seasonal (31% vs 25%) and the pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine (63% vs 37%). At the time of pulmonary exacerbation, a greater percentage of virus-positive compared to virus-negative patients received antibiotics (79% vs 68%) and were hospitalized (33% vs 16%), but this was not statistically significant. At exacerbation, virus-positive patients had a lower mean FEV1% predicted (58.8 vs 69.4, p=0.17), higher severity score (27 vs 23, p=0.02) and lower quality of life (physical) score (54 vs 74, p=0.02) compared to virus-negative patients. The severity score inversely correlated with the quality of life score (p=0.0014). Sputum producing virus-positive patients had similar levels of 27 sputum inflammatory markers (including IL-8, 6, 10 and TNF-\u03b1) and sputum neutrophil counts (99.45% vs 99.5%) compared to virus-negative patients despite lower sputum bacterial densities (3x10 7 vs 1x10 9 CFUs/ml).",

VEGF levels are not associated with inflammatory mediators known to be important in CF, but rather associated with EPO levels. We propose that VEGF elevation and angiogenesis may result from a direct tissue hypoxia pathway in CF. Inhaled aerosol drugs can deliver substantial doses of medication directly to the lungs while minimizing the systemic concentrations that are often associated with side effects. Antibiotics are often administered through this route for the treatment of the pulmonary infections associated with cystic fibrosis. The altered patterns of ventilation associated with this and other lung diseases can cause inhaled drugs to deposit non-uniformly so that some lung regions receive very high local doses of medication while other regions go untreated. In an infected lung, this could result in a reservoir of infection that is never effectively treated by the therapy. Preliminary studies suggested that the addition of surfactant to the aerosol formulation may improve the uniformity of drug distribution by creating surface tension driven or Marangoni flows that will disperse the formulation over the surface of the airways after aerosol deposition.",

            "text": "To determine the optimal characteristics of surfactant formulations to be used in aerosol drug vehicles, we have investigated the spreading of aqueous solutions of soluble surfactants over entangled aqueous mucin solutions that mimic the airway surface liquid within the lung. The surfactant solutions contain dyes that not only serve as tracers but also as drug mimics, modeling the use of surfactant formulations as self-dispersing drug carriers for pulmonary drug delivery. Anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants were compared in order to determine the potential impact of surfactant-mucin binding on the extent of spreading. For all surfactants examined, we find that Marangoni stresses initiate flow over the rheologically complex mucin solutions and that the convective spreading terminates with the spread solution confined to a well-defined static area. Further motion of the spread solution progresses by much slower diffusive processes. Similar behaviors were observed on entangled aqueous polyacrylamide solutions, despite the significant difference in chemical complexity and surfactant-binding tendencies of the two macromolecules. The independence of spreading behaviors on the chemistry of the surfactant and subphase, as well as the solubility of the tracer dye, indicates that the spreading process is controlled by capillary and hydrodynamic phenomena and not specific chemical interactions among the components of the system, indicating that optimal formulations can be designed based on those fluid phenomena alone. We find that the final extent of spreading -the key parameter is determining the efficacy of a self-dispersing formulation -is not controlled by the same surface tension gradients that drive the initial spreading. Rather, this area is optimized by choosing surfactants that remain confined to the spreading solvent layer and formulations that inhibit the movement of solvent into the mucus subphase.",

The study is unable to measure actual adherence as we cannot be sure that the doses were actually administered once dispensed from the pharmacy. We speculate that improved adherence to dornase alfa and other therapies may greatly improve outcomes in CF, and that the percent adherence to prescribed dornase alfa may prove to be a useful surrogate marker for the level of overall adherence to prescribed therapies. Effective modes of improving adherence in CF patients need to be developed and validated.

Background: HFCC is an effective therapy for CF. There is, however, little knowledge regarding what frequency (freq) setting provides optimal clearance. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is a validated technique for assessing airflow obstruction in children with obstructive lung diseases. One measurement obtained by IOS is the resonant frequency (f res ), the freq at which reactance equals zero.

Strain rate imaging appears to be a sensitive tool to monitor the heart in CF. Myocardial velocities are also changed but are more difficult to interpret in individual children due to their strong age-dependence. The prognostic significance of these abnormalities will have to be determined. Rationale: Spirometry has been identified as the best predictor of lung disease and is utilized as the standard to evaluate disease severity and the requirement of additional treatment and/or hospitalization in individuals with CF. To date measures of diffusion of the lungs for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide (DLCO/DLNO) and its components alveolar-capillary membrane conductance (DM) and pulmonary-capillary blood volume (Vc) in CF subjects during maximal exercise using the rebreathe technique have not been studied as predictors of changes in outpatient therapy secondary to acute exacerbation. We hypothesized that these gas diffusion measures may explain more variability than resting spirometry measures alone. Resting spirometry has previously been criticized as lacking sensitivity to pulmonary status and early inflammation, especially in early stages of the disease.",

The objective of this study was to study the right heart in children with CF using tricuspid ring velocities and peak systolic strain rate derived from TDE.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterised by progressive destruction and dilatation of the airways. This occurs in the setting of chronic infection, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), and is associated with loss of elastin and cartilage, with progressive submucosal fibrosis. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) can degrade all components of the extracellular matrix, and are inhibited by the Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs). High MMP-9 activity has been identified in CF sputum, and correlates inversely with lung function (FEV1). The source and regulation of MMP-9 in CF is unknown. In other chronic suppurative lung diseases, for example tuberculosis, direct infection of inflammatory cells drives MMP-9 production, but inflammatory-parenchymal cell networks further augment MMP-9 secretion. We hypothesised that Pa infection could drive MMP-9 secretion by inflammatory and epithelial cells in the CF airway.",

These data show that values calculated from multiple breath WI and WO are not equivalent. Ways to improve reproducibility of WI should be explored. In vitro data shows that Gallium (Ga) kills P. aeruginosa (including multi-drug resistant strains), prevents biofilm formation, and effectively treats P. aeruginosa infections in animal models. Data for inflammatory lung diseases (eg, sarcoidosis) or difficult-to-find infectious sites indicate that Ga accumulates in regions of inflammation or infection. We hypothesized that the antimicrobial activity of systemically administered Ga might be enhanced if it accumulates within areas of infection, an advantage not typical of antimicrobial agents. In this study we explored whether acute CF pulmonary exacerbation resulted in high concentration of 67-Ga in the lung.",

These data suggest that both the infiltrating leucocytes and the lung parenchyma are potential sources of excessive MMP-9 activity in CF, and may contribute to the airway destruction that occurs in response to Pa infection. Background: Progression of lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by the development of bronchiectasis (BE) and trapped air (TA). This can be detected and monitored by chest computed tomography (CT). BE is a potentially important surrogate endpoint for CF lung disease. It is unknown whether BE influences the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). HRQoL can be assessed by the validated Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R).",

Radiology, \"Ca' Foncello Hospital\", Treviso, Italy Background: CF is characterized by chronic airways infection and inflammation and progressive lung disease from early childhood. Currently there are no sensitive, radiation free methods available to localize and quantify lung inflammation. PET-CT has been proposed for the localization and quantification of active inflammation in the lung, but its use is restricted by high ionizing radiation exposure and costs. DWI is a promising tool for the identification of active foci of inflammation in lung parenchyma. DWI signal intensity is strictly dependent to the free movement of water molecules which depends on the changes occurring in the extra cellular environment. DWI signal will be higher where an increased number of cells and macromolecules limit water movements (as it happens in inflammation). DWI accuracy in the identification of inflammation has been proven in organs such as: brain, liver, and intestines.",

Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom; 2. Department of Cystic Fibrosis, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom Introduction: In cystic fibrosis (CF), CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) affect up to 25% of patients. Hyperglycaemia in CF is mainly due to insulin deficiency but is confounded by insulin resistance which increases during exacerbations. The development of CFRD is associated with accelerated pulmonary decline, weight loss and early death. The relationship between \"glycaemic load\" and pulmonary parameters in patients without CFRD or IGT is not known.",

Recently we reported the results of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which oral azithromycin was associated with a 50% reduction in PEs and a 27% reduction in the initiation of new antibiotics in CF patients 6-18 years of age uninfected with P. aeruginosa (Pa) without a significant improvement in lung function (Saiman et al. JAMA 2010 ). An a priori definition for PEs was utilized in the RCT designed to capture the incidence of PEs in a CF patient group with mild lung disease. This definition was based on previously accepted definitions of a pulmonary exacerbation but utilized a shorter symptom duration (3 vs. 5 days) to meet the criteria for an exacerbation in this mild patient group. The characteristics and impact of PEs in this group are therefore important to characterize.",

Equipment of any size is difficult to bring from place to place during the course of the day. HVPEP may help individuals with CF to perform ACT throughout the day. Since no equipment is used, it can be done with Active Cycle of Breathing (ACB), Autogenic Drainage (AD) or Huff Coughs (FET). HVPEP is accomplished by the following: 1) hold the hand in a fist; 2) place the thumb-side of the hand in front of the mouth; 3) take a deep breath in through the mouth with a three second hold; 4) blow out through the closed fist at the point of the thumb and index finger to end of expiration; 5) as expiration is occurring, the fingers can be held tighter to increase positive expiratory pressure (PEP).

However, in practice a patient may be issued a different nebulizer to deliver a range of drugs; therefore, the performance characteristics of these nebulizers for use with CF drugs are of interest. We compared the particle sizes, delivered doses and treatment durations of SideStream Plus (Philips Respironics, Parsippany, NJ) and LC Plus (Pari Respiratory Equipment Inc., Midlothian, VA) nebulizers when used to deliver three drugs commonly used in the treatment of patients with CF. Surface tension and viscosity of the drugs was also examined.",

Inspiration Elite compressors (Philips Respironics) were used to run the nebulizers with dornase alfa and hypertonic saline, a Pulmo-Aide compressor (DeVilbiss Healthcare, PA) was used for tobramycin. Tests were conducted across two laboratories. Delivered dose was assessed using simulated breathing (Vt=500 mL, f=20 bpm, I:E=1:1.5) by collecting aerosol onto a filter. Aerosol was collected until one minute past the onset of sputter (treatment duration), and aerosol deposits were assayed using: spectroscopy (dornase alfa), High Performance Liquid Chromotography (tobramycin), and freezing point depression (hypertonic saline). Particle size was determined using laser diffraction (Spraytec, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK), surface tension using a handheld tensiometer (SITA t60, Messtechnik GmbH, Germany), and viscosity using a microviscometer (AMVn, Anton Paar GmbH, Austria).",

Literature has shown each technique works effectively as long as the technique is performed correctly. Cincinnati Children's revamped their practice of airway clearance through writing of protocols and education of their respiratory therapist and patients. Through these efforts we achieved a better program for our patients with cystic fibrosis.

Objective measurement of daily physical activity may be related to exercise capacity. Participants in the UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium Run-In study had a field-based estimate of exercise capacity and objective measurement of physical activity around 4 study visits performed at times of clinical stability at intervals of [3] [4] [5] [6] p<0 .0001, mixed model analysis), with a higher increase in activity associated with a less steep rate of rate of decline of FEV1. In addition, the rate of decline in FEV1 was less steep for HIGH, when adjusted for the disease-specific factors of gender, age, mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cystic fibrosis related diabetes (p=0.0074). When the analysis was performed with HPA as the outcome and change in FEV1 as the covariate, the effects were less significant, supporting our hypothesis that a change in activity has an effect on FEV1, rather than vice-versa.",

Despite the importance of PA for patients' health and quality of life in CF, the amount and intensities of the patients' activities are not regularly assessed in the clinical setting and PA has not yet been incorporated as a variable in CF registries. This is probably due to the fact that there are almost no validated means to quickly, easily and reliably assess the level of PA in the CF population. Therefore, the main study objective was to validate questionnaires with the help of accelerometry and exercise testing in a group of patients with CF.",

Furthermore, the patients completed three activity questionnaires: the Habitual Activity Estimation Scale (HAES), the 7 Day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire (7D-PAR) and the Lipid Research Clinics questionnaire (LRC). Data were expressed in minutes spent in a certain activity category per day (7D-PAR and HAES) or the individuals activity level (LRC). The results of the accelerometry were related to the results of the questionnaires by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) (for HAES and 7D-PAR) or Spearman rank correlation coefficents (LRC). Furthermore the results of the exercise test (maximal power in %predicted and peak oxygen uptake in %predicted) were related to the results of the questionnaires by using Spearman rank correlation coefficents.",

A CF HITH program which includes nurse managed intravenous antibiotics (IVABs) and twice daily chest physiotherapy, to fully mirror conventional hospital care, has not been evaluated. This study evaluated outcomes of HITH versus conventional admission for acute respiratory exacerbation in the paediatric CF population. The Mater Children's Hospital (MCH) has delivered HITH since June 2008, providing twice daily physiotherapy and daily delivery of IVABs. Outcome measures of length of stay (LOS), spirometry and weight change were compared with spirometry data and previous admission data for the 12 months prior.",

While this is to be encouraged to help patients continue with everyday life, for some patients an \"improving effect\" is desirable. The data indicates that use of the treadmill or bike has a greater training effect than the Wii or walking. However, it is clinically important to note that similar effects can be achieved with static bikes or Wii, as these are useful for patients in isolation. The data indicates that our patients in the severe group achieved a \"fitness maintenance effect\" while more of those with moderate disease were achieving an \"improving effect.\" Interestingly, our mild group achieved the lowest training effect, indicating they need to be pushed more. The Firstbeat system increased patient interest in exercise as a new way of showing them fitness improvements and reasons for modifications. This software utilising EPOC allows us to produce a specific exercise prescription. Background: As patients (pts) with CF grow older, they develop chronic airway infection and often take nebulized medications. Home nebulizer equipment can become contaminated with bacteria and this may lead to more pulmonary exacerbations in pts with CF.

This single-center, prospective study examined patients with cystic fibrosis age >18 years seen at routine clinic visits. From the period of June 2009-November 2009, consecutive patients seen at our CF center were provided with a questionnaire regarding eleven drugs/therapies typically prescribed for pulmonary complications in CF. On the questionnaire, patients were asked, in a multiple-choice format, to choose the mechanism(s) of action for each drug/therapy, how well they felt each drug/therapy worked, and the percentage of time they used the drug/therapy. Approximately 42 questionnaires were completed and collected. Patient compliance correlated highly with patient perceived efficacy for recombinant human dornase-alpha (R squared 0.985), airway clearance (R squared 0.950), and albuterol (R squared 0.970) but not for hypertonic saline (R squared 0.605) or exercise (R squared 0.0178). However there appeared to be no association between knowledge of the correct mechanisms of action for therapies and higher patient compliance. These results suggest that patient's perception of medication/treatment efficacy may affect patient compliance with the prescribed therapy. Certainly, patients should be informed regarding the purpose of their medications, but this knowledge seems to affect adherence less than patient perception of the intervention's efficacy. Further work will be performed to improve patient perception of efficacy and adherence to prescribed therapies.",

Patients who would benefit from a simultaneous lung and pancreatic islet transplant are probably few and should be selected with criteria which remain to be determined. Background: As of 2010, screening newborns to identify infants at risk for cystic fibrosis (CF) is underway nationwide in the U.S. About two-thirds of states use high values of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and DNA testing (IRT/DNA) to screen newborns, while the other one-third repeats the IRT test in a second blood sample (IRT/IRT). The primary goal of newborn screening (NBS) is to diagnose, and thus initiate treatment of, CF in the neonatal period, i.e., before 28 days of life. However, it is unclear if IRT/DNA and IRT/IRT methods achieve this goal. Our hypothesis was that infants born in IRT/DNA states are diagnosed at younger ages as compared to those born in IRT/IRT states.",

They found a decrease in the number of newborns with CF from 1999-2006. In contrast, the Colorado NBS program noted year-to-year variation, but no significant change from 1983-2006.

The total number of CF patients diagnosed by 2 CFTR mutations and sweat chloride of 60 or greater mEq/L (thus excluding CRMS) was collected by the WI NBS program from 1994-2008. WI birth rate data was obtained from the WI Department of Health Services. All data was categorized by ethnic background of the birth mother: white non-Hispanic (WNH), black non-Hispanic (BNH), Hispanic (HPC) and other. The incidence of CF births was adjusted for ethnic background. Loess smooth plot was used to fit the data and Pearson linear correlations were calculated.",

This is not due to changes in overall birth population demographics with regard to ethnic background or number of births. With the advent of universal NBS, this finding suggests a change in the composition of the CF cohort, influencing care and outcome. In the last 20 years, there has been great advancement in life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, improvements in CF outcomes may not be distributed to all demographics. Hispanic CF patients have worse pulmonary disease than non-Hispanic patients. Notably, in California, Hispanic CF patients make up one fifth of the CF population. There are few studies looking at the hospitalization and outcome patterns of the Hispanic patients compared to non-Hispanic CF patients.",

Analysis was limited to Conclusions: In multivariate regression, warmer temperatures and public insurance were associated with worse lung function. Given that insurance status was the strongest SES predictor of lung CF lung function suggests that nationwide healthcare may have potential implications for CF and other chronic diseases. The lack of seasonal variation in lung function suggests that temperature may be serving as a proxy for non-seasonal, regionally based factors, which may include P. aeruginosa. Additionally, it is likely that other geographic determinants of health exist, warranting future research. 4 1. University of Rochester School of Nursing, Penn Yan, NY, USA; 2.

University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA Background: Previous studies have shown that women with CF who become pregnant have better lung function than those never pregnant and that pregnancy is not associated with short-term decline in clinical status or survival (1, 2) . Less is known about longer-term physiologic and functional outcomes for these women that might reflect competing demands of disease self-management and parenting.",

In a subgroup of 260 women (54 pregnant and 206 never pregnant), health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured using the CFQ-R (3). Group differences for FEV 1 , pulmonary exacerbations, and healthcare utilization in the endpoint period of 2004-2005 were assessed using repeated-measures models adjusting for matched sets.

Hispanic CF patients are hospitalized disproportionately to their representation in the CF population. They also have 3 times the rate of death compared to non-Hispanic CF patients. These findings may have multifactorial causes including greater severity of disease and/or differential provision of care. Rationale: As U.S. healthcare transitions to an outcomes-based system, understanding sources of variation in outcomes assumes increasing importance. Specifically, there may be geographic factors that may impact health outcomes independent of the quality of care provided, suggesting that rankings of healthcare providers and the design of multicenter clinical trials may have to account for these environmental differences. Delineating specific geographic factors that modify lung disease may provide information for future therapeutic targets as well as allow for correction of rankings of CF centers for factors not within their control.",

Although the Kulich lung function percentiles do correct for age, there exist cohort and survivor effects that are not accounted for. On average, individuals with public insurance had lung function that was 6.4 percentile points lower than those with private insurance. Lastly, for every 10\u00b0F increase in mean annual temperature, lung function was found to decrease by 3.4 percentile points, thus for example, centers in New York and Florida may have a 7 percentile point difference in lung function based on temperature alone. Using data collected in both January and July demonstrated that the association of temperature and lung function is independent of season in both the CFTSS and CFF populations. Finally, secondary analyses determined that the prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was higher and the age of its acquisition younger in regions with warmer temperatures.",

Data from 21 QUERY and 16 CF infants were ascertained. At baseline, 4 (19%) QUERY infants had 1 mutation and borderline sweat chloride, 11 (52%) carried 2 mutations and borderline sweat chloride, and 6 (29%) had 2 mutations and normal sweat chloride. None, so far, has fulfilled the criteria for CF. Among 20 QUERY infants who had serial sweat tests, there was a significant fall in mean sweat chloride (SD) from 38.3 (10.8) to 27.7 (10.7) mmol/L (P=0.0007) over a mean (SD) period of 8.7 (6.8) months. All QUERY infants were pancreatic sufficient (PS) at baseline and at mean (SD) follow-up age of 10.4 (6.4) months old. All except 2 CF infants were PI at diagnosis; they remained PS at 5.7 and 15.7 months old respectively. Although all NBS-positive infants had IRT values exceeding the 96th percentile, QUERY infants had significantly lower IRT compared to CF infants (87.4 (33.7) vs. 153.0 (82.7) ng/mL; P=0.003). Serial IRT values demonstrated that QUERY infants had significantly lower serum trypsinogen than CF infants at age-intervals of 1-6 months (72.3 (36.1) vs. 274.6 (114.3) ng/mL; P<0.0001) and 6-24 months (40.2 (12.8) vs. 81.9 (21.6) ng/mL; P=0.006); 7/9 (78%) QUERY infants had elevated IRT (>46.5 ng/mL) at 1-6 months old while only 2/8 (25%) had raised IRT between 6-24 months old.

Complete registration of the affected population is required to avoid the introduction of selection bias should registered cases differ from those missed by the registry. Many disease registries use capture-recapture methods to estimate the size of affected popu-lations.

Initially, three pairwise comparisons (CFRI-CSO, CSO-survey, CFRI-survey) were undertaken to obtain preliminary estimates for combined source pairs. Differences in pairwise population estimates suggested that data sources were not independent, violating an underlying assumption of the capture-recapture method. To take account of such dependencies, log-linear models of capture probabilities were developed to estimate the number of patients missing from the 3 sources. Models were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion and the model with the lowest value was chosen.",

The overall sensitivity of the program was 95.5% with no statistical difference over time (94.4, 97.4, and 94.9%) . Initial and failsafe IRT were below the cut-off level in 40 and 4 patients respectively; a technical laboratory error was reported in 4 cases (3 IRT, 1 ST) . Median age at diagnosis was 1y 2m [4.9m-2y1m] with no significant delay between those presenting only respiratory symptoms (n=15, 8 cases with severe pulmonary involvement (1 death)) and those with dehydration, gastrointestinal or combined symptoms (n=25). Pancreatic insufficiency was found in 69%. Sweat test values were in the abnormal range in 40/46 (1 death, 1 epidermolysis bullosa) with a median value of 97 mmol/L [77-109] and 4 patients in the intermediate range (30-59 mmol/L). Mutation analysis found a CF-causing mutation in one or both alleles in 44 patients, while expanded genetic analysis remained negative for 5 alleles in 3 patients; in 4 cases a R117H was identified with one 5T.",

For all strategies, implementation caused savings compared to no screening, as the costs of screening were smaller than the savings resulting from reduced costs of diagnosis among CF and non-CF patients. Reduction of life long costs of treatment that can be obtained by detection of CF patients through neonatal screening compared to clinical detection of CF patients appeared to be the most important parameter determining the variance in cost effectiveness. Costs presented were based on 0% reduction, but if 5% is assumed, implementing neonatal screening for CF may lead to additional financial savings of about 1.1 million Euros yearly, depending on the screening strategy used.",

Results: Over that period, 37 NVFGB were recorded. We identified 5 CF foetuses (F508del / F508del n=2, F508del/937insT n=1, F508del/4005+1G>A n=1, F508del/R553X n=1), leading to an incidence of the disease of 13.5% (1/7.4) . This calculated rate was significantly higher than in the global population (1/2 928 p<0.0001). All CF affected foetuses had NVFGB associated with FEB, and all affected pregnancies were terminated. We also identified 3 heterozygous foetuses, leading to a carrier rate of 8.1%. All were sharing a single copy of the F508del mutation and they showed only NVFGB.

While causality can not be confirmed, the observed effect of one or more factors may approximate that seen by a successful intervention. Surprisingly, a high proportion of infants reach failure within the first year of life indicating the need for nutritional interventions. Our analysis gives a practical assessment to commonly used anthropometric outcomes in early childhood. While the scientific question should drive endpoint selection in a trial, statistical efficiency is equally important in a vulnerable infant population with an orphan disease.

New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY, USA; 6. New York State, New York, NY, USA Background: Newborn screening (NBS) for CF in New York State (NYS) started on October 2002. Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) is used to determine top 5% of daily specimens, which are then tested by mutation panel. Screen-positive (2 mutations, 1 mutation, the high IRT no mutation: IRT>170 ng/ml and the top 0.2%) are referred for sweat testing. Preliminary report in Australia showed only a small proportion of babies with IRT in the 99th percentile have CF. Additional CF testing has an extremely low yield (Masse. Arch Dis Child 2006; 91:222-225) . The implications may be different in an ethnically diverse population.",

CF infants in this group are predominantly of Hispanic origin (43%), and were not representative of the ethnic distribution in the total CF positive disease of this screening program (80% Caucasian, 10% Hispanic, 4% AA, 0.4% Asian and 5% mixed/other origins). Interestingly, only one CF infant is AA in spite of a two-fold increased incidence of an elevated IRT in AA infants, as recently reported from our NYS program (Guisti. Ped Pulm 2008; 43:638-641) . Implications: Extremely low yield for CF in this group, but yet with a different ethnic distribution, necessitates careful assessment of the algorithm process of the screening program. NYS has expanded its mutation panel to 40 mutations after 5 years (2007), and recently (2010) changed algorithm to establish the 0.1% cutoff IRT value. Careful algorithm changes will decrease referrals yet will minimize missing CF diagnoses. Data will be presented in the near future. Background: Colorado adopted newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis in 1982, using an algorithm of two immunoreactive trypsinogen determinations (IRT/IRT). We have previously reported a sensitivity of 94.6% (90.0-96.2%). Reports from other programs suggest sensitivity of this approach with initial cutoffs >100 ng/ml may be as low as 80%. We identified individuals in the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Registry who may have been missed by the Colorado NBS in order to further refine our sensitivity estimates.",

Eight missed cases (40%) had genotypes associated with pancreatic sufficiency. An additional 27 patients were identified from the CFF query, however only 2 have been confirmed as missed cases on the Colorado NBS. Of the remaining infants, 21 were confirmed as not missed on NBS, and 4 individuals have not yet been located. The 2 confirmed missed cases were diagnosed in other states: one diagnosed at 6 months due to failure to thrive and electrolyte imbalance (Cl=120, F508del/ F508del) and one diagnosed at 3 years of age (Cl=74, not genotyped). Three babies were reported who have CF identified by Colorado NBS. One infant moved following an elevated IRT, sweat test performed in infancy in another state was negative, and the child was diagnosed at 14 years (Cl=111, F508del/ F508del). One moved to another state after birth and diagnosis at 1.2 months was prompted by elevated IRT; another lived in a neighboring state and diagnosis was prompted by elevated IRT at 1.4 months. Four infants had been diagnosed by the Colorado NBS but not reported to the CFF. Eight infants were a duplication of records (names changed/misspelled). The birth state was misreported in four cases. One case was concluded to be Munchausen's by proxy (CFTR mutations not identified) and one child had a heart transplant, with no further mention of CF (CFTR mutations not identified). The missed case rate using infants with known state of birth is 22/337 (6.5%, 4.4-9.7% ).

Because older infants were more likely to eat table food and be treated with pancreatic enzyme and vitamin supplements, the patient data was divided into 2 groups: less than 10 months of age and 10-24 months of age. Serum levels of vitamin D were assessed in relationship to potential modulating factors including pancreatic status (sufficient vs. insufficient), vitamin supplementation, skin tone, and season of birth. Vitamin D insufficiency was defined as less than 30 ng/ml and vitamin D deficiency as less than 20 ng/ml.",

Of infants tested between 10-24 months of age, 7/28 (25%) had levels below 30 ng/ml and 2/28 (7%) were below 20 ng/ml. From the younger cohort, 14/23 infants had repeat levels after 10 months of age and although there was a mean increase of 6.3 ng/ml this was not significant. Of infants tested in the first 10 months, 16/23 (70%) were pancreatic insufficient (PI). Within this group of infants with PI, 10/16 had vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/ml and when compared to the PS infants the relative risk was 2.2 with a 95% CI of 0.63 and 7.5. In the older group, there were 19/28 (68%) patients with PI of which 7/19 had a vitamin D level less than 30 ng/ml and none of the infants with pancreatic sufficiency had low vitamin D levels. Of the 23 infants tested in the first ten months of life, 12 were born during the summer. The relative risk of being vitamin D insufficient or deficient for those born during the summer compared to those born in the winter was 1.83 with a 95% CI of 0.76 and 4.41. In the older cohort, the seasonal effect decreased and the relative risk was 0.72 with a 95% CI of 0.17 and 3.06. There was insufficient data to analyze the effect of vitamin supplementation or skin tone.",

Although this study was limited by a small sample size, the data suggests that PI and being born in the summer are potential risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency in the first ten months of life. These results, if corroborated by larger studies, support early nutritional intervention with attention to vitamin D supplementation to avoid vitamin D insufficiency and its inherent complications. Barker, H.; Floto, A.; Haworth, C.S. Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom Background: The Department of Health in the UK recommends influenza vaccination to people of clinical risk groups including patient with cystic fibrosis. Influenza infection can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in this group of patients [1] and vaccination remains the most effective measure in preventing this illness. In addition, there has been evidence to show that influenza vaccination in CF can prevent its subsequent acquisition [2] .",

Pediatrics, Columbia University, New York City, NY, USA Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is a recognized manifestation of pancreatic insufficiency in people with CF and is increasingly associated with osteopenia and osteoporosis. In addition to its role in bone health, vitamin D plays a role in promoting immune function in the lung. Early intervention and nutritional support of infants diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS) should potentially decrease the risk of vitamin D insufficiency.",

Mutation analysis and sweat testing were carried out simultaneously whereas PAP concentration examinations utilized the Muco-PAPTm assay (Dynabio) followed by absorbance analysis using the \"Plate reader\" from Bio-Rad. Within the routine nationwide scheme, mutation testing was performed sequentially with the same assay in samples with IRT concentrations above 65 mg/L (99.0 percentile). From the 42,688 newborns tested thus far, 87 (0.2 %) had a \"suspect\" result within the IRT/PAP/DNA protocol, while 6 CF patients and 5 carriers were diagnosed. In comparison, within the routine IRT/DNA protocol we tested 31,603 newborns, 318 (1.0 %) had a \"suspect\" result and among those 5 CF patients were identified, including 12 carriers. Interestingly, we detected 1 case of false negativity in the IRT/PAP/DNA protocol, but this patient was unambiguously detected in the nationwide scheme. Although the numbers of the IRT/PAP/DNA \"parallel\" scheme are still relatively small, our pilot data indicate that further studies are needed to compare both protocols.

To circumvent these problems, we are studying a sequential and pure biochemical strategy with immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) as first tier and pancreatitis associated protein (PAP) as second tier, and validated this approach (IRT/PAP protocol) against the widely used IRT/DNA protocol in a population-based NBS study in Southwest Germany.",

Our results indicate that lowering the previously suggested PAP cut-off level from >1.0 ng/mL to > 0.9 ng/mL may further improve the sensitivity and should therefore be further evaluated. This concept should substantially promote the implementation of CF NBS in countries with legal restrictions for genetic testing for population based screening. The opportunity to develop new treatments for cystic fibrosis and the search for a cure are more promising than ever before. Thus, there is an increased need for patients to participate in clinical trials. A national survey conducted by the CF Foundation revealed that the main reason people do not participate in clinical trials is because they were never asked. In 2006, the CFF launched the \"I am the Key\" initiative to promote a culture of research within CF care centers. Since its implementation, there has been an increased awareness and more people report being asked to participate in a clinical trial. However, many still do not participate for a variety of reasons. Efforts are needed to continue to improve communication and help overcome barriers to participation. Since people with CF and their families can relate to others with CF, we began a center specific campaign called \"Faces of a Cure\" featuring pictures of many of our research participants (different ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds, etc). The research staff contacted individuals who had participated in research and collected an array of photos of them in their normal activities. These photos were used in a collage to help make it personal and illustrate the variety of people that have and can participate in clinical trials. The hospital marketing department was contacted to help with the layout and make sure it was consistent with their standards. The IRB approved the campaign which was launched in May of 2009. Posters were made and hung in the patient exam rooms and other prominent places in the hospital. These were laminated so they could be cleaned in compliance with our infection control guidelines. Postcards were also printed and are used to notify a patient that they potentially qualify for participation in a clinical trial. The postcards \"congratulate\" patients on their eligibility and invite them to inquire for more information.",

Twenty-one percent of respondents had never participated in CF research. Of the 79% that had participated, 83% had done so in the last 5 years. While questionnaires (89%) were identified as the type of study in which respondents were most interested in participating, 68% expressed interest in participating in specimen collection studies, 58% in drug trials, and 57% in procedure studies (e.g., NPD, sweat testing). Interestingly, 74% expressed interest in participating in trials specifically focused on nutrition or exercise. Several barriers to participating in research were identified, with the most common being too busy (39%) and concern about missing school or work (35%). A separate analysis of parents' responses however revealed their primary barrier was how studies might affect their child's health (56%). Other identified barriers included not always being aware of studies (26%) and living too far from the center (24%). When considering whether to participate in research, 66% reported that talking to their CF physician in clinic would be the most important step. Contacting the Johns Hopkins research team was second (54%).",

To increase research participation, we must work to minimize time off from work/school, be considerate of time commitment of study visits, discuss with parents the potential impact of study on their child's health, and perhaps most importantly increase access to physicians and research coordinators in clinic to specifically discuss ongoing research, as patients look to them as the key sources of information about CF studies and potential research participation. Research is an exponentially growing field in the CF world. Therefore, integration and collaboration of the clinical and research teams is an essential part of creating and sustaining a successful research program. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) CF center provides care for 450 total patients -150 adult patients followed by 4 physicians at UAB hospital and 300 pediatric patients managed by 5 physicians at the Children's Hospital of Alabama. Four research coordinators are responsible for the coordination of clinical and observational trials across both populations.",

To reduce disruption to clinic flow, we recommend educating patients to minimize drop-in visits and to improve adherence to clinic appointment times. Booking the follow-up clinic visit prior to departure from the preceding clinic visit and improving access to booking appointments through email may also improve efficiency. Patients needing annual bloodwork should have their appointments clustered together to allow on-site phlebotomy. This will minimize the time spent waiting in the outpatient laboratory. In order to facilitate clinic flow and minimize delays, if an unanticipated prolonged visit with the physician is required the patient will be asked to wait until later in the clinic or have an appointment scheduled at a later time to allow scheduled patients to be seen in a timely fashion.",

Introduction: Pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients contribute to accelerated lung function decline. Improved detection of exacerbations through patient self-monitoring could improve clinical outcomes and slow lung function decline via earlier therapeutic interventions. Therefore, we developed a multifaceted home spirometry program in a population of adult CF patients.

Additionally, survey respondents overwhelmingly believed in the value of the program for helping them detect exacerbations earlier and preserve their lung function. Based on survey responses and feedback from non-users, an aversion to seeing FEV 1 values appears to be a prominent psychological barrier to use. Despite the subset of never-users, we believe that continued emphasis on patient self-monitoring at home, including the use of home spirometry, should be integrated into the standard of care for most adult CF patients. Although not statistically significant, those who failed eradication or had an early recurrence were older (mean age 13.6 versus 7.3 yrs, p=0.05), were more likely to have a prior history of Pa (71% versus 33%, p=.17) and were more likely to have a mucoid strain of Pa (43% versus 7%, p=.28). In the 9 months prior to protocol implementation, 13 patients (median age 9.1 yrs, range 1.1-17.4 yrs) had a new Pa infection.

Decreasing variability in clinical practice rapidly identifies patients who do not respond to therapy for further diagnostic evaluation. Use of the PExT reduced variability in time to followup for OI treated patients. There were no other changes in our approach to treating a PEx, largely because the algorithm was based on current practice. However, with uniform, aggressive follow-up and re-assessment, we hypothesize that eliminating variability in practice will result in improved lung function.

We propose that the PExT is a critical step in the development of national, standardized PEx treatment guidelines to improve clinical outcomes.",

Background: Pancreatic sufficiency (PS) is present in 10-15% of patients with cystic fibrosis(CF). These patients have sufficient pancreatic enzyme secretion to prevent overt steatorrhea. Pancreatic sufficient (PS) patients are known to have a milder CF phenotype than pancreatic insufficient(PI)patients and prior studies have shown absence of complications such as diabetes, liver disease, rectal prolapse or vitamin deficiencies. Studies published decades ago showed excellent growth in pancreatic sufficient patients.

The n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are required in diet and are crucial for numerous metabolic and physiological processes. The major dietary n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are the 18 carbon n-6 linoleic acid (LA,18:2n-6) and n-3 alpha linolenic acid (ALA,18:3n-3). LA is metabolized by delta 6 and 5 desaturases to dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3n-6) and arachidonic acid (ARA, 20:4n-6), while ALA is metabolized to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3). Metabolism of EPA via 22:5n-3 to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) involves delta 6 desaturation and chain shortening in peroxisomes; 22:5n-6 synthesis from ARA via 22:4n-6 uses a similar pathway. The functions of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids are related to their roles in phospholipids (PL), but PL are diverse, differ in fatty acids and have complex, inter-related metabolism. Abnormal n-6 and n-3 fatty acid patterns occur in CF, but their etiology and relevance to CF complications is incompletely understood. We used quaternary gradient HPLC resolution of lipids and GLC to separate and analyze lipids from erythrocyte membranes of children with and without CF. We separated and quantified 1-alkenyl-2 diacyl ethanolamine PL (EPG, plasmalogen), and diacyl ethanolamine (PE) and choline (PC) and their fatty acids. EPG are major PL on the inner membrane surface, are synthesized in peroxisomes, and contain high DHA and ARA, but low LA. PE and PC are synthesized from diglycerides in the endoplasmic reticulum, and PC can be formed by methylation of PE. PC is higher in LA and lower in ARA and DHA than PE. Changes in PL and their synthesis lead to changes in n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. Diet fat composition also modifies cell membrane fatty acids.",

Although choline and the PC/PE ratio is decreased in plasma of children with CF, the red cell PC/total PE ratio was not different between the CF children and control children without CF. DHA was decreased and 22:5n-3, 22:5n-3/DHA and 22:4n-6/22:5n-6 were increased in EPG, elevated 20:3n-6/ARA was present in all PL of children with CF. The results suggest impaired peroxisomal lipid metabolism, as impaired fatty acid desaturation. However, dietary fatty acid intake is an important determinant of cell membrane fatty acids. Dietary records were collected for 75 children with CF and 45 children without CF. CF children consumed as mean +SD percent total energy, 48+7.2 total fat, 26+13.4 saturates, 12.6+4.3 monounsaturates, 5.6+1.3 n-6 and 1.1+0.6 n-3 fatty acids, with 110+68 mg ARA, 42+55 mg EPA and 88+86 mg DHA/day. High fat intakes were due to foods high in saturated fatty acids, and this gave an unbalanced dietary fat profile; some children consumed <10 mg/day EPA and DHA. In conclusion, while the lipidomics confirms and extends the altered fatty acids in CF, interpretation is complicated by the deviations in dietary fat profile from that of age and gender matched reference children. The metabolic significance of high proportions of dietary fat from saturated fat should be considered.",

Liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS) enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, sometimes termed metabolomics, which is useful for broader understanding of disturbances across multiple pathways and discovery of previously unknown metabolic changes that predict or result from disease. Our focus is the biochemical basis for and implications of disturbed methyl and thiol metabolism among children with cystic fibrosis. Using this approach, we first analyzed urine from children with CF and healthy children without CF, and identified consistently lower hippurate levels in urine from the children with CF. Hippuric acid is the hepatic conjugation product of benzoic acid and glycine, thus implicating metabolic limitation of conjugation due to limiting glycine. To elucidate possible changes in amino acid metabolism, including glycine, we next developed a method for liquid-chromatography and fluorescence detection in combination with electrospray mass spectrometry to probe ortho-phthaldialdehyde and mercaptopropionic acid derivatives of primary amines found in biofluids and tissues. This method detects amino acids and other biologically relevant primary amines such as glutathione and polyamines. To date, with this approach analysis of 36 urine samples from children with CF showed lower excretion of glycine and serine compared to children without CF, but elevated N-acetylputrescine and more specifically elevated N-acetylcadaverine (p<0.05). Putrescine and cadaverine are polyamines which are important in numerous cell events, and which also require S-adenosylmethioninamine, the decarboxylated product of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) for further metabolism to spermidine and aminopropylcadaverine, respectively. Using LC-MS, we analyzed plasma from 84 children with CF and 45 healthy control children and found reduced methionine (30.9+1.43 and 25.8+1.55 \u00b5Mol, respectively). A major path of glycine synthesis is via serine hydroxymethyltransferase using SAM and serine as substrates, but our analysis showed not only decreased methionine but also reduced urinary glycine and serine in children with CF. In conclusion, integrating our results across metabolic pathways shows consistent evidence of disturbed methylation and low glycine with effects that extend to multiple pathways.",

Objectives and Study: Cirrhotic cystic fibrosis liver disease (CCFLD) develops in 5-10% of CF patients. CCFLD is mostly diagnosed based on physical examination in combination with ultrasound (US) of liver and spleen. Unfortunately, these diagnostics cannot predict which patients will develop CCFLD in the future. Currently, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only treatment employed to prevent CCFLD. It might be beneficial if UDCA could be administered in an early phase to patients with a high risk of CCFLD.

Using ROC analysis, the mean GGT value of the available results was identified as the best predictor for CCFLD (AUC: 0.89). Consecutive cross tab analysis showed that a cutoff value GGT above 30 IU/L (mean based on at least 2 measurements), in the absence of ALT elevation was a significant independent predictor for the development of CCFLD in the period 0-2 years prior to the diagnosis. A GGT > 30 IU/l could predict CCFLD with a sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 92% and a PPV and NPV of 71% and 96%, respectively. Based on these results the odds ratio for a CF patient age 2-15 years with a persistent GGT above 30 U/l, in the absence of ALT elevation, for developing CCFLD in the following 2 years was 60 (95%CI 10-374).",

However, nutrient absorption remains low and potential for viral contamination is high. Thus, we posited a new approach for treatment of EPI in children and adults with a microbial product, Lipromatase, rapid disintegrating tablet (LipRDT), which contains 3 highly purified and stable enzymes: crystalline protease, amorphous amylase, and crystalline, cross-linked lipase. We tested the product in young pigs with EPI, in which pancreatic duct ligation causes a total lack of pancreatic enzymes and diminished levels of bicarbonate that results in poor nutrient absorption, steatorrhea and arrested growth. We used young EPI pigs to demonstrate an effect of LipRDT on fat and protein digestion (%CFA, %CNA), absorption (growth, TG and NEFA muscle strength) and overall health.",

Our recent report showed that normal mouse small intestine mucus release requires cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) -dependent bicarbonate secretion, which may serve to prevent the formation of aggregated mucus. But how HCO 3 secretion functions in normal mucus release is still unknown. The aim of the present study is to better define the process of HCO 3 dependent mucus release. Methods: Segments of distal small intestines from CL57BL/6 wildtype mice were continuously perfused with glucose-free Ringers solution. Serial samples of luminal perfusates were collected and assayed for discharged mucus content by using WGA lectin binding reaction (Dot Blot) assay.

Results: In the wild type mouse small intestine, carbachol (100 \u00b5M, an intracellular Ca 2+ mediated activator) induced goblet cell exocytosis and mucus discharge in the presence and absence of HCO 3 -, but did not stimulate sustained HCO 3 secretion. Basolateral HCO 3 -Ringers solution did not enhance carbachol induced goblet cell exocytosis or mucus release. In contrast, cAMP-mediated activators (VIP 100 nM or isoproterenol 10 \u00b5M) did not stimulate significant goblet cell exocytosis or mucus discharge, even with HCO 3 in the bath solution, but did induce a marked increase in HCO 3 secretion. With HCO 3 in the basolateral solution, carbachol plus VIP or isoproterenol induced significantly more mucus discharge into the perfusate compared to carbachol alone ( Figure 1A) . Interestingly, the enhancing effects of cAMP activators on carbachol-induced mucus discharge were absent when we removed the HCO 3 from the bath solution ( Figure 1B) . Conlusions: These results suggest that cAMP-mediated activators potentiate Ca 2+ -dependent mucin exocytosis in mouse small intestine by stimulating HCO 3 secretion.

Although the primary endpoint was CFA, informed consent was given to permit measurement of percent fat (PF) in complete bowel movements. CFA was calculated from known fat intake and fecal fat contained in stool samples collected over 72 hours. PF was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance from each complete bowel movement during the collection period. Four values for each subject were derived and analyzed: mean PF from the first and last bowel movements on each day; mean PF from three randomly selected bowel movements (each on a different day); PF from a single random sample selected irrespective of day. The PF data were compared to CFA as a dichotomous variable and the analysis included evaluation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV). Area under the curve (AUC) values (1 = 100% accuracy) were obtained from receiver operating characteristic plots of sensitivity vs 1-specificity. Correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the association between PF and CFA as a continuous variable with three groups of samples: active treatment, placebo, and both combined. Scatter plots were used to verify the linear relationship between the two variables. A negative correlation and slope would indicate that as one variable (e.g. CFA) increases, the other (e.g. PF) decreases, and vice versa.",

Department of Biochemistry, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands In cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy does not completely correct fat malabsorption. Non-pancreatic mechanisms are suggested to play a role in the remaining fat malabsorption, like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). We aimed to determine the contribution of SIBO to fat malabsorption under CF conditions. Homozygous \u2206F508 mice and wild type littermates received antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and metronidazol) or placebo for three weeks. Before and after treatment, fat malabsorption was quantified by a 72 hours fat balance test. The competence of fat digestion (triglyceride hydrolysis) and of fatty acid uptake were assessed separately by determining plasma appearance of stable isotopelabelled fats, originating from intragastrically administered tri-1-13C-tripalmitin and 1-13C-stearate. After termination, bacterial load in the small intestine was quantified via qPCR, and faecal bile salts by gas chromatography. Bacterial load did not differ between \u2206F508 and wild type mice and was not reduced in either genotype after antibiotic treatment. In \u2206F508 mice, antibiotic treatment improved the absorption of saturated fatty acids. Plasma concentrations of 13C-fats from tri-1-13C-palmitin and 1-13Cstearate were non-significantly higher in the antibiotic treated \u2206F508 mice. Antibiotic treatment reduced faecal excretion of primary and secondary bile salts in \u2206F508 mice compared to placebo treatment (primary, 11\u00b15 vs. 19\u00b13 \u00b5mol/100 gram BW/day, p<0.05; secondary, 0.4\u00b10.2 vs. 7.0\u00b10.9 \u00b5mol/100 gram BW/day, p<0.01, resp.). We conclude that antibiotics improve fat absorption in homozygous \u2206F508 mice, but the mechanism does not seem to involve treatment of SIBO. Introduction: A large body of evidence links cystic fibrosis with abnormal content and metabolism of certain lipids in plasma and tissues from patients and animal models. The cftr exon 10-knockout mouse shows intestinal obstruction, malabsorption and inflammation, and a fatty acid imbalance in intestinal mucosa. The aim of this study was to perform a lipid cartography of mouse colonic mucosa and to search for any lipid alterations in the cftr knockout model with regard to intestinal morphology.",

CF patients typically experience reduced growth; both body weight and height are retarded, and consequently result in lower BMI. Malnutrition, as a consequence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and increased energy expenditure are typically implicated to explain growth reduction in CF. There is a strong, positive correlation with morphometric indices and lung function (FEV1) as well as CF patient survival. Konstan et al found that changes in body weight predicted future lung function in CF children, suggesting a causal link between body weight and lung health. Thus, current nutritional recommendations of higher energy intakes (high-fat diets) coupled with pancreatic enzymes are commonly implemented. While this approach makes sense superficially, our preliminary data indicate that partitioning and utilization of dietary fuels is quantitatively and qualitatively different in CF mice. We previously presented qualitative evidence of lack of fatty acid malabsorption (NACFC 2009 ) in CF mice. The objective of this work was to study processing and metabolism of dietary lipids in CF mouse models to elucidate the effectiveness of increased dietary fat on body weight and body composition. To study lipid processing and absorption, we fed mice with diets containing increasing lipid content, i.e. regular chow (6% fat kcals, P3000) and \"breeder's\" diet (10% fat kcals, 7960). We studied the effects of diets in wild-type, S489X null, and \u2206F508 mice. Lipids were extracted from feces and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Analyses of fecal lipid composition revealed that essential fatty acids (18:1, oleic and 18:2 linoleic) were completely absorbed with either diet (Table 1) . We did not find any indication of malabsorption of saturated fatty acids on P3000 diet. The 7960 diet with higher fat content caused increased excretion of saturated fatty acids. To reduce obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, Colyte (PEG-3350+electrolytes) was added to drinking water for \u2206F508 mice. This may partially explain the increase in saturated lipids in the feces of \u2206F508 mice. In addition, we find that \u2206F508 mice on Colyte and P3000 diet had higher excretion of fecal cholesterol (Chol); this was true for S489X mice on 7960 diet, but not for \u2206F508 mice on 7960 diet. We demonstrate that CF mice absorb fatty acids differently than non-CF mice and that this is a selective process. While the absorption of essential fatty acids appears similar between CF and non-CF mice, regardless of diet, the absorption of saturated fatty acids is handled much differently between CF and non-CF and is further influenced by the dietary context as well. Our current work focuses on the analyses of a larger spectrum of fatty acids and other lipid components and their processing and metabolism.",

Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA Pancreatic enzyme replacement and proton pump inhibitors are valuable tools in optimizing growth and nutrition in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. However, less is understood of their impact in CF adults. It had been our practice to titrate pancreatic enzyme dosing and proton pump inhibitor initiation based on patient reported malabsorption symptoms. As part of a quality improvement initiative our clinic developed an algorithm to optimize nutritional status. This algorithm included more frequent clinic visits for CF patients aged 18 and older determined to be \"at risk\" with BMIs of <21 for females and <22 for males, increasing pancreatic enzyme dosing to achieve optimal levels based on weight and initiation of PPI if patients had not achieved weight goals. Here we report the effects of implementing this algorithm using a retrospective review of all \"at risk\" adult patients. A total of 28 adults were identified as meeting criteria as of July 2008. After one year of implementation, enzyme dosing was statistically increased from a mean of 1731\u00b1641 units lipase/kg/meal to 1920\u00b1512, p<0.005. Similarly, the use of proton pump inhibitors increased from 32% to 62%. Subjectively these adult patients reported appreciation for the additional educational steps utilized with this aggressive intervention. At the end of one year, 3 of 28 (11%) had moved out of the \"at risk\" category and a total of 18 of 28 (64%) patients had improved their BMI. For the overall population, the BMI increased from 19.54 to 19.83 which was not statistically significant on paired analysis.",

A generalized epithelial defect attributable to absent CFTR could have significant implications for a number of tissues affected by CF, including intestine, pancreas, and lung. An increased ability for bacteria (within the intestine, or lung) and digestive enzymes (in the pancreas) to traverse the CF epithelial barrier and elicit submucosal injury, inflammation, and tissue remodeling could represent an important, and previously unappreciated, aspect of CF pathophysiology. Background: Previous correlative studies on lung function and serum levels of vitamins A and E have been conducted in children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). Adult CF patients have higher micronutrient requirements and have variability in lung function compared to children with CF. Due to such variances, adult CF patients require more in depth analysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin A and E levels in adult CF patients and markers of lung function, particularly FEV1 percent predicted values and the number of infective exacerbations.",

However, bacterial overgrowth has not been previously implicated as an isolated factor to cause intestinal inflammation in conditions other than CF. The normal gut epithelium provides an effective barrier against bacterial translocation and is also profoundly downregulated for inflammatory responsiveness to bacterial products.

Objective: Specific fatty acid abnormalities have been identified in the plasma and tissues of cystic fibrosis (CF) animal models, human patients, and in cultured cell models. These abnormalities include increased concentrations of palmitoleate (16:1n-7; POA), oleate (18:1n-9; OA), and eicosatrienoate (20:3n-9; ETA). These fatty acids are of particular interest in CF pathophysiology because of their potential roles as lipokines and as mediators of the inflammatory process. The aim of this study was to evalu-ate the hypothesis that increased expression and activity of fatty acid metabolizing enzymes is responsible for these fatty acid alterations in CF. The conversion of radiolabeled palmitate (16:0; PA), stearate (18:0; SA), and OA to downstream fatty acid products was measured in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells expressing a normal CFTR protein and compared to conversion in cells expressing a CF phenotype.

The additional responsibility of caring for a child/children may have a negative impact on the father's health.

Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians. CF is due to a mutation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR). The main mutation is a deletion at amino acid 508 (\u2206F508). The life expectancy of CF patients has increased and consequently new complications such as Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD) have emerged. CFRD is primarily due to a defect in insulin secretion. Studies have shown that women and subjects homozygotes for the \u2206F508 mutation have a higher risk of developing CFRD. However, very few studies have examined the effect of gender and genotype on insulin secretion. The main purpose of this study was to compare insulin secretion between CF men and women with different genotypes.",

The course of pregnancy cannot be predicted in any individual and all women should anticipate more intensive antepartum and postpartum treatment. The presence of pre-existing CFRD and a pre-pregnancy FEV1 of <60% predicted are associated with significantly worse outcomes. Introduction: Improved clinical care has led to a dramatic improvement in survival rates for patients born with CF and a child born in 2000 is now predicted to live into their 50s. Our understanding of diabetes has changed over the last 20 years. CFRD was initially thought to be mild and uncomplicated because patients were not predicted to live long enough to develop complications. It is well recognised that CFRD has a negative impact on pulmonary function, BMI and mortality, as well as causing microvascular complications. However, the observations previously recorded in younger adults may not apply to more mature adults with CF. Within the Manchester CFRD clinic we have become aware that several patients were overweight.",

Reproductive Medicine, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia In recent years the prognosis of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has improved, with the majority surviving into adulthood. As a consequence many people with CF are having families and it is estimated in Australia, nearly 1/7 people with CF have children. Given that greater than 98% of males with CF are infertile, owing to absent vas deferens, they face unique challenges in having children using assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) in CF men obstructs the transport of spermatozoa from testicular or epididymal structures to the outer genital tract resulting in azoospermia. However, in general, spermatogenesis is normal. On account that their sperm is normal, sperm harvesting and ART allow these patients to have their own biological children. The aims of this study were to assess the success rate of these tech-niques, and review the respiratory status of patients utilising these techniques, and paternal survival rates over this time period.",

This study indicates that increased serum 25(OH)D promotes higher two hour blood glucose levels and suggests a decrease in insulin sensitivity. It also implies that as BMI z-score increases, insulin resistance increases and insulin sensitivity decreases which is inconsistent with weight loss being a symptom of CFRD. A trend was seen indicating that an increase in BMI is associated with improved beta-cell function. Limitations of this study are that the sample size was small, confounding variables were not considered, the range of serum 25(OH)D levels had little variation, and only one patient had a serum 25(OH)D level less than 15 ng/ml. A recently published study suggested that insulin resistance increases with a serum 25(OH)D less than 15 ng/ml (3) . Further research on this topic is needed.",

Imperial College, London, United Kingdom Introduction: Guidelines issued by the UK CF Trust recommend an annual OGTT for all adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Yung et al. (1999) devised a selective approach to determine which patients require an OGTT (based on 1 or more of the following: random blood glucose (RBG) >11.0mmol/l; glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1C ) >6.1%; unexplained weight loss >5% per annum; FEV 1 decline >10% per annum and symptoms (polyuria, polydypsia and nocturia)), thus reducing the need for a universal OGTT. We performed the present study to: (1) validate the accuracy of the selective screening approach; and (2) if indicated, modify the selective screening criteria to optimise its sensitivity and specificity. Our overall aim was to develop a CFRD screening tool that could be used reliably at Annual Review -the Brompton Screening Tool (BST).",

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) are smaller than humans without CF. That observation has been attributed, in part, to decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, and this reduction has been blamed on malnutrition and pulmonary inflammation. We found that like humans, CF pigs were smaller than non-CF littermates and had lower IGF-1 levels. To better understand the basis of IGF-1 reduction, we studied newborn pigs and found low IGF-1 levels within 12 hours of birth. Moreover, humerus length and bone mineral content were decreased, consistent with less IGF-1 activity in utero. In exploring possible mechanisms, we discovered reduced growth hormone (GH) release in organotypic pituitary slice cultures of newborn CF pigs. These findings led us to test newborn humans with CF, and we found that they also had reduced IGF-1 levels. Discovering lower IGF-1 levels in newborns indicates that the decrease is not solely a consequence of malnutrition or pulmonary inflammation, and that loss of CFTR function has a more direct effect. These findings may explain the long-standing observation that CF newborns are smaller than non-CF babies and why some patients with good clinical status fail to reach their growth potential. The results also suggest that measuring IGF-1 levels might be of value as a biomarker. Finally, they raise the possibility that IGF-1 or GH supplementation beginning in infants might be beneficial in CF. Objectives: Metabolic bone disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is highly prevalent. The standard method of assessment for bone mineral density is dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which provides a two dimensional assessment of bone quantity. DXA scans have not been shown to correlate with fracture risk in CF. High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a new technology that provides information on both the quantity and quality of bone and has not been studied in the CF population to date. Our pilot study sought to determine if HR-pQCT would Raise Expectations), a clustered randomized controlled trial, is the first study to translate an evidence-based, behavioral intervention to improve adherence in to a clinic setting. The success of these programs may depend, in part, on the commitment of team members across disciplines (i.e, physicians, nurses, etc.).

Background: Recent advances in the treatment of chronic, pediatric diseases have dramatically increased rates of survival. Genetic discoveries, for example, have led to the development of new medications for cystic fibrosis (CF). Newborn screening and more aggressive treatments have increased the median life expectancy for CF from school-age in 1955 to 37.4 years in 2008 (Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2008 . Transitioning to adult clinics is now an important milestone for most CF patients. Despite these advances, CF is still a life-shortening disease. Thus, there is a great need for palliative care services for pediatric patients and their families. Palliative care, originally developed as end of life care, has recently expanded to include patients with life-limiting conditions (IOM, 2003) . With the aims of reducing symptom severity and increasing health-related quality of life (HRQoL), palliative care can benefit patients with CF and their families.",

Implications for improved health outcomes for patients and families will be discussed, along with feasibility implications for implementation using free or low-cost psychological services. Background: Managing a serious, chronic disease such as cystic fibrosis (CF) requires effective coping behaviors. Prior research has utilized generic measures of coping which are not specific to the disease or context. Given that adolescents with CF face unique challenges, such as performing daily treatments and disclosing their diagnosis, it is important to evaluate their ability to cope with these stressors. We have developed a context-specific measure of coping efficacy, the Role-Play Inventory of Situations and Coping Strategies (RISCS) (DiGirolamo et al., 1997) for adolescents with CF to evaluate coping in the following domains: Treatment Adherence, Parent-Teen Relationship, Eating/Weight Gain, Future Issues/Long-term Health, Medical Procedures/Symptoms, Friends, and School Issues. The purpose of this study was to examine correlates of effective coping, such as age, gender, health status, and parent-teen conflict.",

They then generated a coping response which was rated for efficacy on a 4-point scale using empirically-derived criteria. Adolescents also completed the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ) (Robin & Foster, 1989) , which measured parent-teen conflict.

The most frequent friend behaviors included, complained about my CF, left me out of activities because of my CF, and nagged me about exercising, while the most supportive behaviors were accepted my CF, showed me they cared about my health, and asked me how I was feeling. Significant relationships from the exploratory analyses included the following. Families' reminders, encouragement, rewards for treatments, and flexibility were related to enzyme adherence (r=.22 to .35). Families' naggings about treatments were related to fewer exacerbations (r=-.29), but treatment interference was related to more exacerbations (r=.23) and lower FEV 1 %Pred (r=-.24). Friends' acceptance, encouragement, flexibility, and reminders were related to fewer exacerbations (r=-.22 to -.33) and higher BMI%iles (r=.23 to .37), but friends' presence during treatments was related to lower adherence with airway clearance and aerosol medications (r=-.22 to -.30).

If dehydration is severe and losses are not replaced, this may lead to hypovolemic shock with detrimental effect on vital organs. At the present study, we investigated the impact of dehydration on kidneys of infants with cystic fibrosis. This impact was evaluated with renal ultrasound scans after an episode of severe dehydration.",

All 4 children had markedly abnormal electrolytes with chloride below 70 mmol/L and urea above 100 mg/dL. Conclusion: Severe dehydration alters renal morphology as detected by ultrasound scan. The clinical implication of this observation is very significant, so as to avoid concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs, which may have an add-on effect on vulnerable kidneys and cause irreversible damage. nities to enhance nutritional intake were missed since few children supplemented their oral intake between breakfast and lunch and 20% of children admitted to missing enzymes on weekly basis.

An early approach was to bring the families to clinic for education, evaluation and to meet with the entire team. This visit lasted up to five hours. Several years ago the process was revised based upon feedback from families. An interdisciplinary group, including families, developed an inpatient process for education, support, assessment and family mentoring. This process was successful in that families felt confident in their ability to provide care to their children by the end of the brief admission. However, a review of respiratory cultures revealed an increased incidence of MRSA in the children that were hospitalized for initial education compared to those that had been educated in an outpatient setting. As a result, this process was stopped and the team slowly reverted to the old process of providing the education in the outpatient setting. Without a consistent approach, however, the team was concerned that there were gaps in the information and support provided to each family. In 2009, the CF Foundation published \"Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guidelines for management of infants with cystic fibrosis.\" Based upon the recommendations in the guidelines, the Cincinnati CF Team developed a system to ensure consistency in education. The team first designed a tool to gather information via telephone from parents of newly diagnosed infants. This tool provides data to the team that assists them in planning for the initial visit. Next, the team mapped out the itinerary for the initial or \"CF Overview\" visit. They specified which providers would see the patient and in which order. Time and content were also considered to avoid overwhelming families with too long of a visit or information overload. The input from the parents on the team was critical in determining content and structure. The team decided that there was a need for standardizing the information shared by the physician and ensuring the use of visual teaching aids. A Powerpoint\u00ae show was developed with a CF overview. It was placed on a flash drive so that parents could take it home with them to share with others. The itineraries for visits two and three were similarly developed. Based upon the recommendations of the Guidelines, the team included which testing would be completed at each visit. Power-point\u00ae shows for portions of visits two and three are in development. Measures of satisfaction with the process and confidence in ability to provide care will be completed by families at the end of the third visit. Results will be compared to data collected from families whose children were admitted for initial education.",

Declining weight and lung function, associated with early insulin deficiency precedes diabetes onset and predicts early mortality. Insulin treatment is standard care for diabetes in CF, but not yet for early insulin deficiency. Conventional multiple-daily insulin injections are poorly accepted by patients and carry significant hypoglycemia risk. Objectives: We proposed that a single daily dose of insulin detemir (Levemir) would be anabolic, improve lung function and would be well accepted. Methods: Eighteen CF-subjects (median age 12.5 yrs, range 7.2-18.1), newly diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test with early insulin deficiency (n=12) or diabetes (n=6), were treated with once-daily, pre-breakfast insulin detemir (median dose 0.13 units/kg/day, IQR 0.12) adjusted for blood glucose target range of 4-8 mmol/L (72-144mg/dL). We compared changes after insulin treatment to changes prior to treatment (over a comparable period) in the following: weight standard deviation score (\u2206WtSDS), % predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (\u2206%FEV1) and % predicted forced vital capacity (\u2206%FVC)",

Data were compared to a cohort of 700 healthy controls of the DONALD Study. In addition, we determined pertinent biochemical parameters of bone metabolism. Results: Eighteen of 43 patients (41.9%) had already experienced fractures predominantly of the peripheral skeleton, 8 of them more than one. Compared to the general German population in 2007 aged 0-30 years (26,370,006 persons with 127,903 fractures) with a fracture rate of 48.4 per 10,000 patient years (95% CI, 48.1 to 48.8), this CF cohort exhibited a 10-fold increased fracture rate of 445 fractures per 10,000 patient years (95% CI, 307 to 622).

Mpex pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, USA Objective: Burkholderia cepacia is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Infections with certain strains of B. cepacia cause \"cepacia syndrome\" which is characterized by progressive and invasive necrotizing pneumonia and septicemia. Most B. cepacia have high MICs to many antibiotics. MP-376 is a proprietary formulation of levofloxacin that enables aerosol delivery of high drug concentrations to the lung.

Following this initial phase nationwide screening was officially instituted since October 2009. The aim of the study was comparison of the efficacy of the current IRT/DNA nationwide scheme versus parallel alternative protocol utilizing the IRT/PAP/DNA screening sequence. In this strategy we examine PAP concentrations (pancreatitis-associated protein) when the preceding IRT concentration exceeded the 98.0 percentile. As \"intermediate results\" we considered concentrations of IRT ranging between 50.0 -100.0 with PAP -1.8 or concentrations of IRT -100.0 and PAP -1.0 (all mg/L). The mutation panel comprised the 32 most common CF-causing alleles present within the Elucigene CF-EU1Tm assay (Tepnel) and pilocarpine iontophoresis-based (Gibson-Cooke) sweat test was consistently performed at 491 INFLUENZA VACCINATION UPTAKE IN ADULT CYSTIC FIBROSIS Wat, D.;",

Methods: Genotype and sweat tests were evaluated for newborns with CF screened through MN NBS from March 2006-December 2009 and for CF patients followed at Children's from 1989-2009. Chi-square test was used to compare two CFTR mutations and negative sweat chloride tests identified before and after the year of 2006. Poisson distribution was assumed to compare the incidence of CF over time because of the rare event. Results: MN incidence of CF from March 2006-December 2009 was 1/3596. MN NBS identified 77 patients with CF. 34 of 77 (44.2%) were F508del homozygotes; 66 of 77 (85.7%) had at least one delF508 mutation. The incidence of F508del homozygotes increased from 29.4% to 55.0% from 2006-2009. This includes two F508del homozygotes with positive sweat tests and negative NBS. Of 233 (49.8%) CF patients followed from 1989-2006, 116 are F508del homozygotes. Of 159 patients diagnosed at our institution between 1989 and 2006, only five (3.1%) have two mutations and negative/intermediate sweat tests, compared to 15 of 55 (27.3%) patients from 2006-2009 (p<0.001). Twelve of 14 were identified through NBS: two following a younger sibling's diagnosis through NBS, and one clinically. Nine of 20 have F508del/R117H, 7T/9T genotypes. Conclusion: Our data suggest the MN incidence is comparable to the national incidence of approximately 1/3500. Follow up studies could address CF incidence long-term in MN. Of patients diagnosed with CF since NBS initiation, 44.2% are F508del homozygotes. Previous studies have estimated 41% to 55% of individuals with CF in the U.S. are F508del homozygotes.

WT HAE cells also demonstrated a robust response to VX-770, with an improvement in ASL depth (15.3 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5m vs. 8.9 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5m, P<0.005, n=4 filters/condition) and MCT (7.0 \u00b1 0.1 mm/min vs. 6.9 \u00b1 0.2 mm/min, P<0.005), but no change in CBF (5.1 \u00b1 0.3 Hz vs. 5.2 \u00b1 0.4 Hz). Results in WT cells were confirmed by conventional measures of ion transport, ASL depth, and MCT. To test whether SD-OCT might be useful for in vivo imaging, we examined fresh human bronchial tissue ex vivo. CF tissues demonstrated adherent mucus on the airway surface not present in normal and disease controls. CBF was 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 Hz in CF and 4.3 \u00b1 0.3 Hz in control tissues (P<0.05, n=5 measures/tissue). Non-CF tissue suspended in warm Kreb bath at 37\u00b0C and 100% humidity for 30 min had an ASL depth of 10.4 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5m which increased to 29.5 \u00b1 4.3 \u00b5m following 30 min application of VX-770 (P<0.001, n=10 measures/tissue). Mucus extrusion from a single gland duct was 0.082 nL/mim (DMEM only) and increased to 0.43 nL/min following incubation with VX-770 (10 \u00b5M). SD-OCT provides video-rate subcellular imaging of living pulmonary epithelia, and is highly sensitive to the effects of CFTR function in living cells and tissues. This supports future development of a probe for in vivo monitoring of MCT, CBF, gland function, and ASL depth in vivo and could improve our understanding of epithelial function.Funded by the NIH and the CFF.LONGITUDINAL ASSESSMENT OF BIOMARKERS FOR CLINICAL TRIALS OF NOVEL THERAPEUTIC AGENTS; THE RUN-IN STUDYAlton, E.W.1,4 ; Boyd, C.3,4 ; Cunningham, S. 3,4 ; Davies, J.C. 1,4 ; Hyde, S.C. 2,4 ; Innes, J.A. 3,4 ; Gill, D.R. 2,4 ; Greening, A. 3,4 ; Griesenbach, U. 1,4 ; Higgins, T. 1,4 ; Porteous, D.J. 3,4 ; On behalf of the UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium, .. 4 1.

In study GS-US-205-0110, mean % changes in FEV1 % predicted at Day 28 were AZLI 8.35 and TIS 0.55 [treatment difference of 7.8 (p =0.0001; 95% CI: 3.86, 11.73)].

Previous studies have detected viruses by relatively insensitive culture or serology. The purpose of this study is to compare detection of virus rates in nasal, throat and sputum samples from CF patients with and without exacerbations using qRT-PCR.Methods:Year-round viral surveillance of children \u2264 18 years-old with CF, both with and without an exacerbation, were collected from September 2008 to June 2009. Samples were obtained from nasal and throat swabs, and sputum if produced. qRT-PCR analysis was performed for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1-3, and rhinovirus. Clinical and demographic data were collected at enrollment and the sample visits.Results: Eighty CF subjects provided 176 samples. Mean age of participants was 8.8 \u00b1 4.9 years; 53% were DeltaF508 homozygous. Previous bacterial cultures had shown 72% Pseudomonas, 92% methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and 48% methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Methods: A search of the CF database at the Royal Brompton Hospital took place for all subjects who have isolated M. abscessus between 2004 and 2010. A control group was then generated matching for age, sex, ABPA diagnosis, diabetic diagnosis and Pseudomonas status. Data was recorded from the medical notes.

Department  of Clinical Microbiology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark    Background: Over the last 20 years, an increasing number of cystic fibrosis patients have developed chronic, pulmonary A. xylosoxidans infection, and several patients have received lung transplantation (LTX). This study compares the survival from development of chronic infection until death or LTX in CF patients chronically infected with A. xylosoxidans, B. multivorans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.Methods: All patients followed in the Copenhagen CF centre were eligible for the study. In patients with chronic, Gram negative infections, time of development of chronic infection was assessed. In the group of P. aeruginosa infected patients, only patients with chronic infection duration of less than 20 years were included. Observation time until death or LTX or until the end of 2009 was calculated for each patient.Results: Seventy patients were included; 22 with chronic A. xylosoxidans infection, 21 with chronic B. multivorans infection and 27 with chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Median estimated survival time (std. error) was 12.1 years (0.44 years) and 14.1 years (2.08 years) in the A. xylosoxidans and the B. multivorans groups, respectively. Estimated survival could not be calculated in the P. aeruginosa group. No difference was found when comparing A. xylosoxidans and B. multivorans infected patients, but P. aeruginosa infected patients had a significantly better survival (p<0.003). Number of patients who died or had LTX performed was 7 of 22, 7 of 21 and 2 of 27, respectively (n.s.).aureus. Samples were collected for 55 sick and 121 well visits for a total of 176 sample visits (176 nasal, 175 throat and 31 sputum samples). Initial data evaluating nasal samples for 161 sample visits collected from CF patients with (45) and without (116) exacerbations (for rhinovirus, HMPV, RSV, and influenza A and B) revealed no difference in frequency of viral detection between the two groups. A virus was detected in 23/116 (20%) well and 17/45 (38%) sick. Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected virus in 21/116 (18%) well and 15/45 (33%) sick.

In recent years, we have observed a shift in new Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infections to Burkholderia multivorans (genomovar II). The UK CF Trust infection control guidelines for BCC recommend at least 12 months (m) of negative cultures before a patient is considered to have cleared the infection, though there are a paucity of data to support this. Here we report the outcome of new acquisitions of BCC organisms in our adult patients in the last 8 years. This review complements a previously published series (Jones et al,Thorax 2004). Methods: Case notes of adult patients with new BCC isolates since 1st January 2002 were reviewed. Patients who had transitioned to adult care, or moved into our unit from other adult units, with chronic BCC infections were not included. Results: There were 16 new BCC isolates: 11 (69%) B. multivorans, 2 x B. cenocepacia and 1 each of B. latens, B. vietnamiensis and B. gladioli. Median age of acquisition was 26 yrs (range 18-51). Median FEV 1 was 56% predicted (27-93%) and median BMI was 20.9 (17.0-25.8) at time of first RSV INFECTION STIMULATES MMP-9 EXPRESSION & RELEASE FROM HUMAN AIRWAY MONOLAYERS, & REPLICATION IS ABROGATED BY MMP-9 INHIBITION Maeng, P. 1 ; Li, Y. 2 ; Hong, J.S. 2 ; Gaggar, A. 2 ; Clancy, J.P. 1,2 ; Kong, M. 2 1.

Pancreatic enzyme products (PEP) significantly relieve the signs and symptoms of malabsorption associated with PI (including steatorrhea) and improve the nutritional status of CF patients.

A lack of vit K results in undercarboxylated OC (Glu-OC) causing an imbalance in bone formation and breakdown. CF patients are at risk of vit K deficiency due to pancreatic insufficiency and liver disease.Aim: To determine if vit K supplementation over 12 months is effective in improving carboxylation of OC and bone formation in patients with CF.Method: Thirty-eight patients(age 16-43 yrs) not taking vit K recruited from CF clinics at Barts and the London, Kings College Hospital and Lewisham University NHS Trusts were randomised to receive either 10 mg vit K or placebo. Data collected pre and post supplementation included: bone markers (total OC, Glu-OC), serum vitamin D 3 (D 3 ), BMD Z scores (femoral hip and lumbar spine),spirometry, number of courses of antibiotics, and oral steroids, dietary energy, protein and vitamin A, D, K and calcium intake and body mass index (BMI). Primary outcomes were Glu-Oc to OC ratios and BMD Z scores.Results: Supplementation with vit K improved carboxylation of OC (p=0.007); mean reduction in Glu-OC to OC of 14.02 % (SD\u00b115.94) in the treatment group compared to 3.69 % (SD\u00b120.59) in the placebo group. Z scores at the study start indicated low BMD. Twenty percent in the placebo group and 16.7% in the treatment group had Z scores <-1.0 (femoral hip). Thirty percent in the placebo group and 33.3% of the treatment group had Z scores <-1.0 (lumbar spine). One participant had a Z score consistent with osteoporosis at the lumbar spine.At 12 months mean change in the placebo group at the femoral hip was +0.053 g/cm 3 (SD\u00b10.19) and in the treatment group was -0.20 g/cm 3 (SD\u00b10.31) Mean change in Z scores in the placebo group at the lumbar spine was +0.041 g/cm 3 (SD\u00b10.15) and in the treatment group was -0.073 The effects of early derangements in glucose tolerance mechanisms on the nutritional status and respiratory function of cystic fibrosis patients are currently investigated. Starting from year 2003 patients who received routinely OGTT at the regional CF center of Milan were followed prospectively. The OGTT at recruitment was analysed for glucose tolerance and insulin secretory (beta cell glucose sensitivity) and insulin sensitivity parameters derived from modelling of glucose, insulin and c-peptide profiles.",

Presence of malnutrition at the childhood visit was defined as weight for age (WFA)< 10th percentile and at the adult visit as a body mass index (BMI) < 10th percentile. Initial comparisons were made using t-tests for linear and Chi square or Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables. Linear regression models were compiled to predict adult BMI percentile and adult FEV1. Childhood characteristics (gender, diagnosis suggested by meconium ileus (MI), pancreatic enzyme use, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, Pseudomonas infection, and Medicaid at diagnosis) were considered as potential predictors in a stepwise fashion with significance defined as p=0.10 for entry and p=0.05 to stay in the model. We also drew Kaplan-Meier survival curves to evaluate whether WFA < 10th percentile was a predictor of childhood death in order to rule out survivor bias in our primary analysis.Results: Data was analyzed for 91 patients, diagnosed between 1979-1994; 43% of patients were female, and average age of diagnosis was 6.7 months. At the childhood visit, 42% of patients were malnourished; 37% were malnourished at the adult visit. Diagnosis was suggested by MI in 19% of patients; the rate of MI was significantly higher in patients malnourished at the childhood visit (p=0.033) but not in patients malnourished at the adult visit. Although gender was similar between groups at the childhood visit, at the adult visit 26% of malnourished patients were female versus 60% of patients without malnutrition (p=0.002). In the linear model of adult BMI percentile, pancreatic insufficiency (p= 0.001) and female gender (p=0.011) were significant predictors; childhood WFA approached significance (p=0.060). In the model of adult FEV1, childhood WFA was the only significant predictor (p=0.011). In the survival analysis, Wilcoxon rank test of equality demonstrated a significant increase in mortality prior to age 20 in patients with malnutrition at the childhood visit (p=0.041).Conclusions: This study shows a significant association between early childhood WFA and adult FEV1. In our single-center analysis, the relationship with adult BMI is less clear-cut. This may be due to inadequate power. Since this and previous studies have suggested a causal relationship between nutritional status and later-in-life outcomes, further analysis is warranted. We plan to examine whether a critical age can be determined at which a more clear-cut predictive relationship exists between childhood status and adult nutritional and pulmonary outcomes. Furthermore, we believe that the question merits an analysis of the entire CF patient registry database.",

N Ireland Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre, Belfast, United Kingdom Introduction: CFTR-related disease (CFTR-RD) represents clinical entities associated with CFTR dysfunction that do not fulfil diagnostic criteria for CF. Distinguishing between CFTR-RD and CF may require technologies unavailable to clinicians outside a few reference centres. We sought to compare individuals with intermediate sweat chlorides suspected of CFTR-RD to individuals with H-F508del CF to determine disease trajectory and complication rates.Methods: Patients with suspected CFTR-RD are followed at a specialized clinic at the Northern Ireland Centre for Cystic Fibrosis. Patients are defined as having CFTR-RD by the following criteria; a relevant phenotype, sweat chloride values between 30-60 mmol/L and 0-1 mutation associated with CF but not meeting diagnostic criteria for CF. Patient records were reviewed, complications for the last five years documented and compared to H-F508del cohort.Results: Patients (n=29; 62% male) with CFTR-RD were compared to 80 individuals with H-F508del CF (61% male). Patients were identified by the following; bronchiectasis 12 (43%), recurrent chest infections 6 (21%), genetic screening and infertility 9 (31%), and 1 (3%) for each of nasal polyposis and recurrent pancreatitis. Thirteen (45%) had a single F508del mutation, 6 (21%) another single mutation and 10 (34%) no mutations.

            "text": "Methods: A total of 221 surveys were sent out to both adult patients (n=94) and parents of children (n=137) followed at our CF Center to assess their awareness and concerns with participation in clinical trials.Results: We received 88 (40%) responses from 57 parents (42%) and 31 patients (33%, 23 female, 8 male, mean age 29 years). Of these, 98% (56) of parents and 87% (27) of patients responded that they had received information and/or have been asked to participate in a clinical trial; 68% (21) of patients and 65% (37) of parents (on behalf of their child) stated they had participated in a clinical trial. The percentage of subjects who reported participating in a clinical trial was higher than the percentage actually enrolled.The top factors important when deciding whether or not to participate in a clinical trial included: the desire to help find a cure or better treatment (81%), understanding both the potential benefits and risks (45%), and the number and frequency of study visits required (41%). Patients valued compensation for time and travel (55%).The main reasons given for declining participation in a clinical trial included: concerns about the time commitment (42%), possible harm to health (22%), and possible side effects (20%). In addition, the need to stop a medication currently used to maintain health was a concern.Many preferred to learn about opportunities to participate in clinical trials from their CF doctor (80%) or the research coordinator (48%). In addition, 60% would like to receive updates on CF and research opportunities via e-mail, and 77% provided their e-mail addresses. Few of those responding relied on other venues (i.e., center newsletters or website) for information.Discussion: Over-reporting of participation in clinical trials may have occurred due to confusion with the large number of observational research studies conducted at our center (i.e., the CFF registry, EPIC). In addition, those who have actually participated in clinical trials may have been more likely to reply to the survey.As investigators and caregivers, CF physicians want to avoid a conflict of interest, but these results clearly indicate that patients and parents wish to hear about clinical trials directly from their doctor. We will continue our current practice which is to have the CF doctor discuss current trials with the patients in clinic, with the research coordinator following up to review the study details and participate in the informed consent process. In addition, patients and families prefer hearing about CF and research opportunities via e-mail; this should be utilized to disseminate information while adhering to regulatory and privacy standards. Distributing educational information such as newsletters or website links via e-mail also may increase the utilization and effectiveness of these resources.Conclusion: Patient and family concerns should be taken into account when designing a CF clinical research program. We believe that incorporating this feedback into practice will further improve recruitment into clinical trials.(25.2 vs 21.0 kg/m2, p<0.001). At baseline individuals with CFTR-RD had a higher percent predicted FEV 1 than H-F508del individuals (91 vs 59%, p<0.0001) but both groups deteriorated over time (-0.6 vs -1.32%/year, p=0.23) . Rate of pulmonary function decline did not differ in individuals with CFTR-RD by presenting complaint. CFTR-RD patients were more likely to have chronic respiratory track cultures positive for Haemophilus influenzae (OR 3.0) , only methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OR 2.3) , or grow no specific pathogen (OR 7.6) and none were chronically infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Burkholderia cepacia complex. Six patients did have transient positive cultures for P. aeruginosa which cleared with therapies of inhaled colistin and/or oral ciprofloxacin. There was an increased incidence of pancreatitis (17 vs 0%), asthma (28 vs 3%) and gastro-eosophageal reflux disease (24 vs 5%) in individuals with CFTR-RD relative to H-F508del. Complications such as osteopeneia (21 vs 27%), osteoporosis (30 vs 26%) and cancer (3 vs 0%) did not differ between groups. There was less complications of diabetes (0 vs 12%) and liver disease (0 vs 11%) in individuals with CFTR-RD. One patient developed pancreatic insufficiency after nine years of follow up confirmed by fecal elastase (<150 mg/g) and was subsequently re-classified as having CF.Conclusions: CFTR-RD represents a diverse collection of clinical phenotypes. While suffering a milder disease trajectory then individuals with CF, these patients do experience similar complications and a declining respiratory status albeit at a lower rate. Follow up at a CF centre remains warranted. Lack of dedicated structures seriously limits clinical research in the field of CF in Italy. Our CF Center in Verona (Italy) shared the same limitations: approximately 800 patients were followed up clinically, but enrolment in clinical trials was poor until a significant change was brought about by our decision to create a professional team fully dedicated to clinical research.",

            "text": "Our CF Clinical Research Center (CFCRC) was started in 2007 with its mission being to develop investigational methods and to conduct therapeutic trials and observational studies, in line with the aims of the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutics Development Network (CF-TDN).The team, led by a physician, comprised two full-time pharmacistswith previous experience in clinical trials, acting as Research Coordinators (RC) -one full-time laboratory technician and another physician, part-time.Preliminarily, the whole team underwent Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training. Each member was then trained in the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) specific to his/her area of competence: RCs assembled the documentation to be submitted to our hospital Investigational Review Board (IRB) and managed the approval process; they then organized the clinical trials and managed the logistics (clinical supplies, recording materials, etc.). RCs were also responsible for patient pre-screening, for ensuring protocol adherence and inputting data onto eCRF. A data manager was involved, on an as-needed basis, to design database and entry forms for each study.The team was successful in developing and validating nasal potential difference (NPD) measurement methodology for both diagnostic and experimental application.Achievements: From April 2008 to December 2009, the Center participated in 7 RCT and 5 observational studies enrolling a total of 68 patients in RCTs and more than 400 patients in observational studies (Table) .Costs: Total costs for the CF Center were about 150,000 US $/year, mostly supported by the local patients association (Lega Italiana Fibrosi Cistica-Associazione Veneta ONLUS), and partially by a 3-year grant of the North American CF Foundation.Conclusions: Having a dedicated team for clinical research led to impressive improvements. Patient acceptance was very high. Our experience shows that the main limitations were of organizational nature dispelling our original suspicion that enrolment was hampered by scepticism that prevented patients to volunteer. Investing in such infrastructure is essential to improve the quality of clinical research and the recruitment capacity of CF centers.Immediately after its formation, the CF Parent Advisory Board (CF PAB) at this pediatric CF Center set a priority goal to create a local, independent, evidence-based and reliable website for parents of children with CF. Initially, the CF PAB launched a basic website with low cost selfdesignware, then obtained external funding for professional website design and increased functionality.Concurrent with the initial website, surveys and focus groups identified parents' interest in receiving frequent, short, electronic updates or reminders about CF nutrition care, especially suggestions or recipes from other CF parents. CF parents were invited to join a weekly \"CF Nutrition Tip of the Week\" (\"Tips\") email list hosted by the CF Center dietitian. Subject matter for \"Tips\" was generated by interviews with parents or patients in CF clinic, research, or CF clinical staff suggestions.Approximately one year after the initiation of email \"Tips,\" the CF PAB website upgraded to include a newsletter function and \"Tips\" migrated to the website. With the migration, \"Tips\" expanded beyond nutrition to include more universal CF care. At present, weekly \"Tips\" are accompanied by a recipe and each is archived on the CF PAB website.Approximately 200 families (representing 250 children with CF) receive CF care at this center; 124 email addresses are registered on the CF PAB website for the newsletter. Eighteen individuals (14.5% of \"Tips\" recipients) responded anonymously to an electronic survey regarding preferences for future \"Tip\" topics. All child age groups were represented, but more parents of school age children responded (7 of 18) than other age groups. Of 18 respondents, 15 (83%) had read 10 or more \"Tips\" and 11 of 18 (61%) felt \"many\" or \"most\" contained useful information while 7 of 18 (39%) found \"some\" or \"a few\" of the \"Tips\" to be useful. Respondents indicated their",

Research Department, Helen DeVos Children's Hospital at Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, MI, USA; 2. Pediatrics, Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, Grand Rapids, MI, USA; 3. Pulmonary and Critical Care, Spectrum Health Hospitals, Grand Rapids, MI, USA Background: CF Registry Data reveals a low percentage of patient participation in clinical research trials. As a Therapeutic Development Network Center, we reviewed our performance on clinical trials. In an effort to improve research at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital and Spectrum Health Hospital CF Centers, we developed strategies to increase our Education, Efficiency and Enrollment.Objective: To increase enrollment and exposure to research at our CF centers.Methods: Focusing on Education and Efficiency, we utilized the following methods:Education: 1. Our CF Research Director presents a lecture on research participation and we have a research booth at our annual CF Family Education Day. We hire videography and share the DVDs with all CF patients/families.2. We mail out a bi-annual newsletter focusing on research topics. 3. We hold research education meetings with physicians and staff. 4. Regular attendance in Adult clinic to introduce research, identify subjects and encourage participation.Efficiency: 1. We schedule regular 15/30 min blocks of time with physicians for ongoing review of subject data and regulatory documents.2. We blocked research time slots within the clinic schedule for easy access to appointments to target visit windows and avoid over booking.3. We implemented a new team approach to enrollment. Each new enrolled patient is assigned to a single coordinator, which we refer to as the patient's primary coordinator. 4. A weekly list of patients is sent to the CF team, identifying them as potential or planned for research visits.5. Earlier Port CF query to promote faster enrollment in upcoming studies.6. New collaboration with other CF centers in Michigan. 7. Improved systems for processing outside referrals of potential subjects.Results: After review of our research database: Enrollment -Our plan led to a large increase in our adult patient enrollment. This stimulated further interest of the Adult CF Center providers in clinical trials. In 2009, 91% of our study patients were new to research. In 2010, we continue to match that new patient enrollment rate. We have become active as a referral center for research patients (self/private office/CF center). We successfully approached and enrolled patients outside of our center population.Conclusion: We implemented a diversified approach to improving our CF Center's role in clinical research. We noted a trend that patients are seeking out participation in new studies. We speculate this is due to increased awareness of the need for participation through efforts from the CFF and our focus on education.Discussion: The one key element in each of the \"three E's\" is the partnership that has been established at our site. There is a partnership between the research staff and the clinical staff, between the research staff and the physicians, between the CF team and patients/families, and between the CF team and the institution. This comprehensive and unified approach to expand research is woven into every strategy and has resulted in our success.",

            "text": "After discussion with CF physicians, we developed a protocol to assess hepatitis immunizations. First, a letter was sent to families explaining the project. Second, families provided immunization records or signed medical releases for these. Third, immunization records were reviewed to determine patient immune status to HepA/HepB. Patients who received 2 previous HepA shots were considered protected. HepA shots were given to patients who needed complete vaccine courses. Patients who previously completed full courses of HepB shots had quantitative HepB surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels measured. Anti-HBs values >10 IU/mL indicate protective immunity to HepB, values <8 IU/mL indicate inadequate immunity, and values of 8-10 IU/mL are equivocal. Patients with anti-HBs <8 IU/mL received a booster HepB shot, and anti-HBs levels were repeated at least 1 month later. Patients with anti-HBs levels <8 IU/mL after booster completed a full HepB vaccine course, and if anti-HBs levels remained <8 IU/mL, they were considered vaccine non-responders.Results: Through review of our CF clinical database, that includes 310 pediatric patients, we found 41 pediatric patients on ursodiol for presumed CFALD. In the first 4 weeks of this ongoing project, 20 children (mean age 14 yrs, range 8-20) were screened for HepA/HepB immunity. One child had completed a full HepA vaccine course at screening. Eighteen (90%) had completed a full HepB course at screening; 5 (25%) are protected against HepB, 14 (70%) have inadequate immunity, and 1 (5%) has equivocal immunity. At time of abstract, only 1 child received post-booster anti-HBs levels, with a protected result. All patients have negative HepC antibody.Conclusion: In one CF center, children with presumed CFALD have low rates of protection against HepA/HepB. Only 1 child has received HepA vaccination, and the rest are unprotected against this virus. While the accepted non-responder rate to HepB vaccination is 5-10%, our HepB non-responder rate is higher despite good HepB vaccine compliance. With HepB boosters, these children may have increases in anti-HBs levels. With the increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with preventable viral hepatitis in patients with existing liver disease, CF treatment protocols should include routine assessment of HepA/HepB vaccine status in CF children, particularly in those with presumed CFALD. Future expansion of this protocol to CF patients with repeat liver enzyme elevations, or to all CF patients in general, may be beneficial. Introduction: Parenteral antibiotic therapy remains the mainstay of management for CF pulmonary exacerbation which often requires hospitalization. This can be disruptive to patients and their families and is frequently undesired or even refused. Oral antimicrobials are recommended only for \"mild\" CF pulmonary exacerbations, but are often requested by families and patients. Our experience suggests that distinct patient characteristics are associated with failure of oral therapy leading to eventual parenteral treatment. We hypothesized that we could identify potential patient characteristics associated with oral antimicrobial failure by comparing cases of failed versus successful oral therapy management for CF pulmonary exacerbations seen in the CF clinic.",

Geography dictates that telemedicine is an essential practice at our center so we included phone \"encounters\" in which oral antibiotics were prescribed if the phone encounter was preceded or followed by at least one in-person clinical evaluation. After abstracting data such that all unique patient identifiers were removed, odds ratios (OR) were defined for several, readily available patient characteristics suspected of contributing to oral antibiotic failure using 2x2 contingency tables.Results: Sixty-two unique pulmonary exacerbations were identified from the encounters that we reviewed; 23 of these had no resolution of their pulmonary symptoms after oral therapy and went on to parenteral therapy, and were deemed oral antibiotic failures. By comparing patient characteristics between the 23 cases of failure and 39 successes, we found FEV1% predicted <75% (OR: 3.75, 95% CI of 1.285-10.929), FEV1% predicted drop 507\u0b19 CYSTIC FIBROSIS ACTION PLAN: CAREGIVERS AND HEALTHCARE TEAM PERSPECTIVE Willis, L.M. Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, AR, USA Introduction: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) recommends quarterly evaluation at accredited cystic fibrosis (CF) centers to monitor patient stability. The CF team at Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) developed and implemented a CF Action plan (CFAP) tool as part of routine clinic visits to help communicate health metrics to patients and caregivers. The CFAP lists patient's height, weight, BMI%, and FEV1% predicted, as applicable, at each clinic visit. It also provides information on airway clearance therapy, important reminders, and lists changes or new recommendations resulting from the clinic visit. After one year of use, we assessed caregiver/patient and CF healthcare team satisfaction with the implementation of the CFAP.Methods: This study was designed as a quality improvement initiative at the ACH CF Center (Little Rock, AR). Paper surveys, a letter of explanation, and a blank reference CFAP were given to caregivers (or patients if 18 years old) to complete during routine clinic appointments. A web-based survey was completed by CF team members. Both survey results were collected anonymously.",

Health Systems Management, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA, USA; 2. Analysis Group Inc, Boston, MA, USA; 3. Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA Background: Between 1986 and 1994, 9. 3% of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) were continuously enrolled in Medicaid while 66.1% were never on Medicaid (Schechter et al. 2001 ) with very few uninsured. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) introduction and Medicaid expansions in late 1990s may have crowded out private insurance and affected healthcare utilization and health outcomes. The recent Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will expand Medicaid coverage and more CF patients will likely shift to Medicaid.Objective: This study aimed to document children with CF who switched from private plans to Medicaid from 1996 to 2008 and to analyze the effects of this change on healthcare utilization and health outcomes of children with CF in comparison to those continuously enrolled in private plans.Methods: The sample was drawn from 19,899 CF children under age 20 years who were continuously observed in the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (NCFPR: 1996 (NCFPR: -2008 . Healthcare utilization was measured by hospitalization, home intravenous (IV) therapy use, number of outpatient visits and clinical encounters. Health outcomes were measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and mortality in subsequent year. We used fixed-effect logistic and negative binomial regressions and controlled for previous-period utilization and health outcomes.Results: Between 1996 and 2008, 27% of sampled CF children were continuously covered by Medicaid versus 38.6% who were never on Medicaid and only 0.5% percent continuously uninsured. Out of 12,987 children covered by private plans when first observed, 29% percent later switched to Medicaid for some period (38.3%) or switched permanently (61.7%) and 512 deaths occurred during a median follow-up of 7 years. CF children who switched to Medicaid had lower hospitalization rates than those who remained on private plans (odds ratio [OR] 0.868, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.784-0.962, P=0.007) after adjusting for prior year FEV1, age, and year fixed effects. No differences were found in other types of utilization. Moreover, the switch to Medicaid had no immediate effect on the probability of having a normal FEV1 (OR: 0.922,CI: 0.693-1.226, P=0.576) or of dying (OR: 1.054, CI: 0.795-1.396, P=0.717).Conclusion: A reduction in hospitalization rates was found among the CF children who switched to Medicaid. Further research of long-term effects on healthcare utilization and health outcomes is needed along with other types of healthcare services utilization, quality of care and health outcomes, such as type of drug treatment, being underweight, frequency of infection and complications. In 2004 we adopted a standard definition for a Pulmonary Exacerbation (PEx), the Pulmonary Exacerbation Score (PES). The details of this assessment tool were previously described. Its use is associated with improved lung function at our center. Currently, there are no formal guidelines for the comprehensive treatment of a PEx that include route of antibiotics, treatment duration, and follow-up. We present a comprehensive, standardized treatment algorithm (PExT) that uses the PES to identify patients experiencing a PEx, determine severity, guide treatment strategy and duration to ensure complete PEx resolution.Methods: PES thresholds were determined for the PExT from current practice by reviewing treatment strategies for all patients with a PEx from 6/1-12/1/2009. The PExT algorithm was developed by defining PES thresholds for PEx severity: mild, moderate, and severe. Severity subsequently Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among CF centers in the USA and the world. We have observed this same finding at our CF center with a large percentage of our population being identified as vitamin D deficient. The current treatment paradigm for vitamin D deficiency is flawed in that we wait for vitamin D levels to become low before treating instead of focusing on prevention. We believe that the focus should be moved to the prevention of vitamin D deficiency, especially in the CF population where it is well established that vitamin D deficiency is very common.Methods: From November through December 2009 all patients that came in for appointments at the Emory Clinic outpatient CF program were offered high dose vitamin D3 (regardless of previous vitamin D status). The dose of the vitamin D3 was 50,000 IU capsules to be taken once per week for a 12 week period at home during the winter months. Fifty-one patients participated in this QI project.Results: At the end of winter, we found that only 32% of our patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <30 ng/mL). This represents a dramatic improvement where 76% of our patients in the past were reported to have a vitamin D deficiency (1) .Conclusions: Based on this preliminary data, we feel that supplementing patients with a high dose of vitamin D3 during the winter months will help in preventing the natural seasonal decline of vitamin D levels in the CF population. Since not all of our patients were sufficient at the end of winter, a higher dose or prolonged course of vitamin D may be necessary. We are optimistic that a wintertime supplementation strategy may translate to optimal vitamin D status year round. The mucosal barrier of the gut is important to protect the body from the microbes that inhabit the intestines and the proinflammatory molecules they release. Transepithelial permeability, controlled by the junctional complexes between epithelial cells, is a major factor of the barrier. Another more recently recognized factor is that intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) detoxifies its natural substrate endotoxin (LPS). Loss of gut barrier function can allow LPS access to the circulation which may contribute to inflammation at distant sites in the body, such as the lung. In CF there is an excessive immune response to infection of the airways, and the airway damage that ensues is the eventual cause of mortality in CF. To assess intestinal mucosal barrier function in CF and its potential relationship to airway inflammation, we are using the Cftr knockout mouse model which has severe intestinal dysfunction, including small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.Methods: Cftr tm1UNC (CF) and wildtype (WT) littermate C57BL/6 mice were used. Three groups of WT and CF mice were used: (1) maintained on a liquid diet (Peptamen) as controls; (2) fed solid chow and given oral laxative to eradicate small intestinal bacterial overgrowth; and (3) treated with oral broad spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole) to reduce bacterial load in the intestine. Intestinal permeability was assessed by the passage of gavaged fluorescent-dextran into the blood, and levels of serum protein in the gut lumen. IAP was investigated by histochemistry, by qRT-PCR measurement of mRNA for mouse IAP (Akp3), and by enzyme activity. Lung inflammation was assessed by histology, by immunohistochemistry for neutrophils, and by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.All patients reported a greater freedom to eat high fat foods without adverse events.Conclusion: In PS patients with CF who experience adverse bowel symptoms a trial period of low dose PERT should be considered. In our 8 patients it markedly improved bowel symptoms. Interestingly introduction of PERT resulted in weight loss in patients with BMIs \u232a25 and weight gain or maintenance for patients with normal or low BMIs.Anecdotally, patients reported a greater freedom to eat without adverse bowel symptoms. Objective: Liver disease affects 20-50% of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Cirrhotic liver disease with or without portal hypertension, affects approximately 7% of individuals, who may require liver transplantation. Several studies have examined survival for CF patients who have undergone liver transplantation, as well as post-transplant lung function which was improved after liver transplant. However, many of these studies are small single center experiences with a limited number of patients. The aim of our study was to examine the lung function of individuals in the U.S. CF Registry who had undergone an isolated liver transplant between 1989 and 2007, compared to CF patients with no diagnosis of liver disease and who had not undergone a liver transplant.",

Cases were matched to controls at age of transplant. We examined the change in FEV 1 (percent predicted) for 3 years prior and post age at matching. We compared the FEV 1 slope between cases and controls 3 years prior to transplant, and 3 years post-transplant. We also compared FEV 1 slope pre-vs. post-transplant in both cases and controls separately.Results: Between 1989 and 2007, there were 193 CF patients with isolated liver transplant (approximately 60% male; mean age 15.5 years, SD: 7.28, range: 1.0 -39.6 years). The median age at CF diagnosis was 0.5 years (range: 0 -30.3 years). CFTR genotype was high risk in 64.3%, low risk in 0.5% and unknown type in 35.2%. A total of 72.0% of patients had a positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture and 4.7% a positive Burkholderia cepacia culture in the past 3 years. Liver transplant cases had significantly lower percent predicted FEV 1 3 years pre-transplant compared to controls (71.0 vs. 75.4, p=0.012). Liver transplant cases had a significantly slower decline in FEV 1 (0.05%/year) compared to controls (-1.35%/year) in the pre-transplant period (p = 0.001). There was no difference in FEV 1 decline in the post-transplant period in cases (-1.53%/year) vs. controls (-2.20%/year, p = 0.125). Both cases and controls had a significantly slower decline in the pre-transplant (cases: -0.05%/year; controls: -1.35%/year) compared to the post-transplant period (cases:-1.53%/year; controls: -2.20%/year; p-value for difference: cases = 0.002; controls < 0.0001).Conclusions: CF patients receiving a liver transplant have worse lung function 3-years pre-transplant but a slower rate of decline in lung function, compared to controls. Liver-transplanted patients have similar 3-year posttransplant lung function and rate of decline of lung function, compared to matched controls. The slower rate of decline in lung function pre-transplant is a novel finding and merits further exploration. , an FDA-approved pancrelipase formulation with 100% labeled lipase content without overage, has previously been shown to significantly improve steatorrhea (CFA) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 34 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) due to CF.",

In a subgroup analysis, symptom improvement was compared in patients previously taking, or not taking, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)/H 2 receptor antagonists.Methods: Enrolled patients discontinued PPIs/H 2 antagonists and were switched from unapproved PEPs to EUR-1008 during a dose-titration and stabilization period according to symptom control of EPI for 6-9 days prior to randomization (EUR-1008 or placebo). A total symptom score index (TSI) was calculated from patient-reported signs and symptoms of stool consistency, bloating, flatulence, pain, and visible oil in stool.Results: At comparable doses, patients experienced significant and rapid symptom improvement during the stabilization period when switched from previous PEPs (mean dose 5,100 U lipase/kg/day) to EUR-1008 (mean dose 4,600 U lipase/kg/day). Mean TSI decreased significantly from 11.2 (\u00b115.8) on previous PEPs to 4.3 (\u00b14.0) after 7 days of EUR-1008 treatment (P<0.004). Symptom improvement was observed as early as day 2 and was significant at day 4 (P=0.017). The variability in the severity of symptoms was markedly decreased during EUR-1008 treatment. Twenty of 34 (58%) patients were taking PPIs or H 2 antagonists prior to enrollment; there was no significant impact on symptom improvement during the dose-titration and stabilization period based on previous exposure to PPIs/H 2 antagonists.Conclusions: EUR-1008, tested as a single agent, provided enhanced EPI symptom control after patients were switched from unapproved PEPs, without additional reliance on PPIs/H 2 antagonists, suggesting the potential for reduction of costs and pill burden.Sponsored by Eurand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Yardley, PA, USA. It has been shown that many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have low vitamin D levels (25-OHD) despite routine supplementation with multi-vitamins specially formulated for cystic fibrosis. Hence, the CF Foundation recommends the use of 50,000 IU vitamin D2 once per week for 8 weeks for children \u22655 years and 12,000 IU once per week for 8 weeks for children <5 years whose 25-OHD level <30 ng/mL. Some studies have suggested that this regimen is inadequate to normalize vitamin D levels. It has been proposed that high dose Vitamin D supplementation daily for 4 weeks would be more effective in normalizing vitamin D levels. As a quality improvement project, we developed a protocol to monitor vitamin D levels and treat children with vitamin D deficiency.",

The current study seeks to identify serum markers that differ between CF and non-CF disease control children.Method: Serum was obtained in a standardized manner from 31 CF and non-CF children matched by age and gender. Serum was stored frozen until processing. Samples were extracted to remove protein and dislodge any small molecules in the precipitant. Metabolic analyses were performed using GC-MS, LC+MS/MS and LC-MS/MS for fragmentation and mass determination. Targets were identified using a proprietary software and library (Metabolon\u00ae). Statistical analyses included group-wise and paired comparison.Results: Mean age of both groups was 9.6 \u00b1 1 years, gender was 15 M/16 F. The main problems in Non-CF patients were cough, asthma, and lower respiratory infections. Only 1/31 children was on antibiotics at the time of serum collection and 25/31 had BMI% >25%. Lung disease in CF patients was mild to moderate (FEV 1 70 \u00b1 5% measured in 20/31 subjects), genotype included 7 hetero-and 22 homozygotes for \u2206F508.Fourteen patients were on antibiotics at time of serum collection. Nutritional status, as measured by BMI%, was >50% in 17, 25-50% in 9 and < 5% in 5 patients. Of note, 15/31 CF and 26/31 non-CF subjects were fasting (NPO 6-10 hours) at time of blood draw.Metabolic markers that differed between the two groups fell into 4 categories: 1) Decreased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and altered metabolism of branched chain amino acids. As a group, CF patients had lower levels of some ketone bodies deriving from metabolism of fatty acids and decreased products of amino acid metabolism. These findings could indicate overall worse nutritional status in CF or be a reflection of acute worsening of disease as 23/31 patients were sampled during an exacerbation. 2) Alteration in lipid profiles; and 3) Elevation of markers of oxidative stress. Such changes in lipid profile (e.g. essential fatty acid docohexaenoate = DHA) and increased oxidative stress (increased degradation products of glutathione and decreased \u03b3-tocopherol) have been described in CF and thus confirm the validity of our findings. 4) Finally, metabolites known to originate from bacteria in the gut were elevated or decreased compared to the non-CF group; many of these bacteria were anaerobic bacteria. This finding may be related to ongoing infection, bacterial intestinal overgrowth or alterations in gut microbiology secondary to antibiotics.Discussion: These data provide a first indication of sensitive metabolomic biomarkers and show measurable differences in serum obtained from children with CF compared to age and gender matched controls. Overall metabolic rate is known to be increased in CF, however specific alterations in various metabolic pathways need to be further explored and may be also helpful in longitudinal analyses and following CFTR specific changes.Supported by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.

Eligibility criteria specified that subjects could not be taking acid-suppressing medicines. Subjects on cycled inhaled antibiotics were mid-cycle during study periods. Eligible subjects ate a standardized meal bar (255 kcal), swallowed the WMC, and then went home with a receiver that stores data from the WMC. When WMC passed the subjects mailed the receiver back to the clinic where data was downloaded. All subjects repeated the study under the same conditions one month later. The area under the curve (AUC) of the pH profile in the small bowel was calculated for 5 minute increments from WMC gastric emptying (indicated by an abrupt rise in pH of 3 or greater units) until 60 minutes within a small bowel. pH AUC defines buffering of gastric acid in the proximal small bowel. Data points not captured by a receiver over a 5 minute period were excluded from the analysis. Data were analyzed using GIMS Data Viewer, Prism GraphPad and SAS version 9.1.3 statistical software.Results: Ten subjects (7 F) were recruited in each group. There was no difference between CF subjects and controls for age (mean=21.6 years vs. 22.5) or mean BMI (23 vs. 23.2). There was a statistically significant difference between CF subjects and controls for AUC of pH profile in the first hour after gastric emptying (p=0.03), with the most dramatic differences seen in the first 15 minutes (p=0.003). Analysis of small bowel 5 min pH AUC profiles did not demonstrate reproducibility in CF or control subjects.Conclusion: There were clear differences between subjects with CF and healthy controls in pH AUC in the first 15 minutes after gastric emptying, a critical time for microencapsulated enzyme dissolution and mixing of bile salts with digested triglycerides. Factors that affect reproducibility need to be explored further. WMC technology may be useful to study CF patients with difficult to control fat malabsorption.This study was sponsored by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics.Background: Pancreatic disease begins in utero in the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and progresses over time to complete destruction of the organ. Although inflammatory cells have been welldescribed in the pancreas of humans with CF and the CFTR-/-pig model, it is not known whether inflammation plays a role in the destruction of pancreas in CF.Hypothesis: Understanding the immune response in CF pig pancreas may offer clues to disease pathogenesis.Methods: Using four-color flow cytometry, we analyzed the surface phenotype of leukocytes in the pancreas, blood and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of CF pigs (4 CFTR-/-, 1 CFTR\u2206F508/ \u2206F508) and WT and heterozygous pigs (3 CFTR+/-, 3 CFTR+/+, 1 CFTR+/\u2206F508) immediately after birth. Cell suspensions were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies against CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD21, CD25, IgM, TCR \u03b3\u03b4 SWC1, SWC7, SWC8 and MHC-II antigens. Following incubation with secondary antibodies, measurements were made using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer. Microarray expression profiling was done to explore the differences in gene transcription between CF (4 CFTR-/-), WT (4 CFTR+/+) and heterozygous (4 CFTR+/-) pig pancreata using an Affymetrix Porcine GeneChip.Results: Leukocyte cell populations and microarray gene expression were not different between heterozygous and WT pig pancreas. However, CF pig pancreas had an increased proportion of B cells (IgM+); effector (MHC-II+) and cytotoxic (CD2+CD8+) \u03b3\u03b4 T cells; activated (MHC-II+ and/or CD25+) and effector (CD4+CD8+) \u03b1\u03b2 T helper cells; effector natural killer cells (MHC-II+CD3-CD8+); monocytes/macrophages (SWC8-CD14+) and neutrophils (SWC8+CD14+) compared to pigs without CF. Flow cytometry from blood and MLNs did not indicate that leukocyte populations differ between CF and non-CF pigs. Microarray gene expression profiling of newborn pigs showed significant upregulation of proinflammatory and complement pathway genes compared to non-CF pigs.Conclusion: Both the innate and adaptive immune systems were activated and proinflammatory and complement genes were upregulated in the newborn CF pig pancreas. Blood and MLN inflammatory cell populations were not different between CF and non-CF pigs, suggesting that the pancreatic immune response represents a localized rather than systemic inflammation. An activated immune response contributes to the pathogenesis of pancreatic lesions in CF. In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), pancreatic involvement is common and over time leads to pancreatic insufficiency in most patients. Pancreatic disease is evident in infants, and lesions have been observed in fetuses. However, the pathophysiological processes that occur in utero are unknown. Investigating this process in humans is not feasible, and CF mice show little or no pancreatic disease before weaning. We have found Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is increasingly recognised as an important complication of CF. Effective screening protocols are essential for early detection of glucose impairment. Screening and early detection may help prevent a decline in weight and/or lung function. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the \"gold standard\" for screening and diagnosis of CFRD and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), however it is not always logistically feasible for large CF clinics serving large geographical areas. As a result we have used annual random blood glucose levels (BGL) and increased monitoring during admissions for acute exacerbations, as indicators for referral to OGTT. Based on this monitoring, our prevalence of CFRD and IGT in our 10-19 yr age group was 4% and 6% respectively when recently audited, well below previously published results. (Moran et al, 1999) .",

            "text": "Glucose challenge tests (GCT) are routinely performed as a screen for gestational diabetes. A recent paper comparing OGTT to the GCT in adult CF patients found that the GCT could be used effectively as a screen to reduce the number of OGTTs required. (Lee et al, 2007) . The utility of the GCT in the paediatric CF population is unclear. Nine months ago we introduced a modified GCT screening tool on all patients \u226510 yrs performed at clinic during the annual check. BGL were checked at baseline, (patients are non fasted) and at 1 and 2 hours during which time they were fasted, after an oral glucose load of 1.75 mg/kg to max 75g. Any patient with an elevated BGL at baseline and any patient with a BGL reading of \u2265 7.8mmol/L at the 1 or 2 hour reading are referred for OGTT.To date 49 of 66 (74%) patients aged \u2265 10 yrs who have attended clinic for their annual review, were approached for screening. Of those approached, 41 of 49 (84%) completed the GCT, 13 (32%) patients had a normal GCT, 28 (68%) were referred for a formal OGTT (this includes 4 patients who had a baseline elevated BGL). Eight patients did not complete the test, 3 (6%) could not tolerate the glucose drink and 5 (10%) refused the test. OGTT have been performed on 27 of 28 (96%) patients to date. Based on current accepted international criteria, 15 of 27 (55%) were normal, 11 of 27 (41%) had IGT, 1 of 27 (4%) had CFRD.tic partner had disclosed their diagnosis to their partner; 69% of respondents reported telling all their close friends about their diagnosis. Only 15% had told all casual acquaintances, while 28% reported that they had disclosed to no casual acquaintances. Women were significantly more likely to disclose to all casual acquaintances than men (p<0.01). Comfort discussing one's CF experience with close friends was negatively correlated with medication adherence (p=0.02; Table) .Conclusions: The relationship between disclosure and adherence is complex, likely moderated by age, gender, and living circumstances, and warrants further research. Clinicians should consider assessing their patients' comfort with disclosing their diagnosis to and performing treatments in front of various audiences. Background: Perceived social support (PSS) is a known buffer of psychological distress and adverse medical outcomes, including morbidity. Progress in the treatment of CF now allows patients to live into adulthood, wherein the sources of support expand from family to include friends and a significant other. Research has only begun to characterize the sources and predictors of social support among adults with CF.",

Participant demographics: 56.5% were men, mean age=32.8 years (range 22-54), 96.8% were Caucasian, and 56.5% had a significant other (SO). With respect to education, participants were distributed as follow: 4.8% high school or less, 22.6% high school diploma/GED, 6.5% vocational school, 22.6% some college, 33.9% college degree,9.7% professional/graduate degree. Participant scores on the three subscales of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Fr, Fm, and SP were the primary outcome measures. We examined how these subscales were associated with gender, age, SO status and education. All reported results reflected statistically significant (p<.05) Pearson correlation tests or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).Results: MSPSS Fr was positively correlated with higher education and not having a SO. MSPSS Fm was positively correlated with being female and higher education. MSPSS SP was positively associated with being female, having a SO, and higher education. Age was not associated with MSPSS Fr, Fm or SP. To further clarify the relationship of gender and partner status on PSS, a repeated measures (MSPSS: Fr, Fm, SP) by gender (M vs F) by SO status (yes vs. no) ANCOVA with education as a covariate was conducted. The ANCOVA revealed a significant 3-way interaction such that for: 1) MSPSS Fr, females rated PSS equally whether or not they had a SO, whereas men rated PSS higher than women if SO no and lower than women if SO yes; 2) MSPSS Fm, women rated PSS higher than men overall, irrespective of SO status, whereas men, rated PSS much lower if SO yes, and 3) MSPSS SP, women overall rated PSS higher than men, and overall those with an SO rated PSS higher.Conclusions: MSPSS scores were remarkably similar to those obtained in numerous other healthy and clinical populations, suggesting CF patients are not unique in their perceptions of social support. However, ratings of perceived sources of social support were differentiated: Women rated PSS higher then men and were less influenced by SO status. Men rated PSS of friends and family lower if they had a SO, possibly related to relatively greater reliance on social support from a SO. More education was associated with greater PSS for Fr, Fm and SP. Given the importance of PSS on health outcomes, these findings suggest who may be most vulnerable, i.e., especially men who are less educated and without a SO.Supported by CFF. Objectives: To characterize 1) the need adults with CF have to talk about CF and to talk for emotional support and help (ESaH), 2) satisfaction with meeting these two needs to talk, and 3) how these needs and satisfaction with meeting them are associated with quality of life.",

Participant demographics: mean age=32 years (range 22-50), 57% men, 63% with some college education or more, and 56% with a partner. Participants rated their need to talk to another person during the last month from none (1) to extreme (5) and rated satisfaction with the talks they had from very dissatisfied (1) to very satisfied (7). To measure life satisfaction, participants completed the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). All reported findings reflect statistically significant (p<.05) Pearson correlation or \u03c7 2 tests.Results: Neither need to talk about CF nor need to talk for ESaH was significantly associated with age, education, or partner status. Sixty-seven percent of people reported needing to talk about CF, with 37% reporting this need was moderate to extreme. Fifty-nine percent of people reported needing to talk for ESaH, with 28% reporting this need was moderate to extreme. Men and women did not differ in their need to talk about CF. Women reported greater need than men to talk for ESaH. Sixty percent of people who talked reported they were satisfied with their talks about CF; similarly, 74% reported they were satisfied with their talks for ESaH. Demographic variables were not associated with satisfaction with either CF or ESaH talks.Negative correlations were found between need to talk about CF and the CFQ-R measures (higher scores are better) of: physical, role, social, and emotional functioning; health perceptions; vitality; treatment burden; and respiratory symptoms. Need to talk for ESaH yielded a similar pattern of negative correlations, with the exception that treatment burden and respiratory symptoms were unrelated to ESaH. SWLS was not correlated with the need to talk about CF or to talk for ESaH. Satisfaction with talks about CF and talks for ESaH were both positively correlated with CFQ-R measures of emotional functioning and health as well as with the SWLS.Conclusions: A majority of CF patients endorsed a need to talk about their CF as well as to talk for ESaH. For many this need was moderate to extreme. A majority reported satisfaction with their talks. Whereas need to talk was motivated by general/disease-specific distress, satisfaction with talking was associated with greater health, emotional functioning and overall life satisfaction. These findings underscore the importance of socially interacting (i.e., talking about disease-specific as well as emotional support concerns) to facilitate quality of life of adults with CF.Supported by CFF.Background: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) require both outpatient and inpatient care. Therefore, frequent and consistent communication among inpatient and outpatient staff is critical. In efforts to improve patient care, we identified needs for improvement in this area and developed an initiative to address these needs.Methods: We began our initiative by identifying the following goals: 1. Improve communication between inpatient and outpatient personnel regarding CF patient care.2. Establish ways to include inpatient staff as part of the extended CF care team.3. Provide (at minimum) annual up-to-date CF education to inpatient staff to ensure quality continuity of patient care.We established the following plan to accomplish these goals: 1. Phase 1: Offered CF education opportunities to inpatient staff presented by the outpatient team members, beginning with the dietitian and respiratory therapist.2. Phase 2: Established quarterly patient safety meetings with all disciplines including physicians, nurses, nurse educators, infection control nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, dietitians, social workers, case managers, palliative care team and child life specialists from the outpatient clinic and the pediatric and adult inpatient units. These meetings include an education component to address patient care topics, such as \"Encouraging Adherence in the Patient with CF\" and \"Infection Control Specific to CF,\" and an open forum to discuss updates and concerns from each unit as well as future meeting topic ideas.3. Phase 3: Included the pediatric and adult inpatient units in our annual CF Education Day for our patients and families. This provided an opportunity for attendees to ask questions of the inpatient staff regarding hospitalization and gave each unit the opportunity to present what they are currently doing to improve patient care. The inpatient staff representatives present were introduced to attendees as part of the extended CF care team.4. Phase 4: Established a transition program, led by the outpatient clinic social worker and the adult inpatient nurse manager, to coordinate the transition of our teenage patients from the pediatric inpatient hospital setting to the adult inpatient hospital setting. This includes opportunities for patients to meet the adult inpatient staff and tour the adult hospital facility prior to their first adult admission.Results: Preliminary polling yielded reports of an increase in knowledge of CF care and improved communication and collaboration between inpatient and outpatient staff. A formal annual survey is scheduled for September 2010 of inpatient and outpatient staff involved in the initiative to assess progress in achieving the goals established. Patients currently involved in Phase 4 are scheduled to undergo a post-program interview upon completion of the transition program to gather feedback.Conclusion: We have developed a multi-component initiative to improve communication and patient care between inpatient and outpatient units. Preliminary feedback for the program has been positive. Our future plans include an extension of Phase 1 to initiate a multi-disciplinary continuing education presentation by the outpatient CF team for inpatient staff. Background: Intensive behavioral intervention with nutrition counseling is recommended as an evidence-based treatment for children with CF ages 1-12 years below the 50th %ile BMI (1). The guidelines are based on research that has demonstrated behavioral interventions for nutrition to be effective at increasing calorie intake and weight gain (2, 3, 4) . Positive nutrition and growth outcomes were present at post-treatment for a cohort of toddlers and maintained at the 2 year follow-up time point, however outcomes declined for several children between follow-up years 2 and 4 (5). The declines suggested that ongoing booster treatment is needed. In order to develop appropriate treatment targets, it is important to understand the challenges associated with achieving CF nutrition recommendations and the strategies that parents use to achieve them during this developmental transition.",

Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and coded in the approach described by Braun and Clarke (6) . Themes were independently identified by three coders and then confirmed via consensus. Consensus themes were compared to themes identified by an independent reliability coder.Results: The mean age of the children at the time of the interview was 8.2 years (SD=0.8). Sixty-three percent of the participants were male. Four domains were identified that represented ten major themes (see Table 1 ).Conclusions: This is the first investigation conducted in order to understand what families recall from a brief behavior and nutrition treatment delivered when their children were toddlers, and which of these strategies families continue to use to achieve CFF nutrition recommendations. Parents reported that they continue to use behavioral and nutrition recommendations delivered several years ago, and have been able to apply them as their children have grown. Results suggested that families would benefit from anticipatory guidance about the transition to starting school or daycare and how to best engage in transfer of treatment responsibility. In addition, addressing the issues of ongoing parental distress and behavioral issues of picky eating and noncompliance were noted by parents as needing attention.Supported by NIH grants K24 DK059973 & T32 DK063929.12.6% Black, 11.2% Black Caribbean, 6.3% Pacific Islander, 1.4% American Indian, 1.4% Black Hispanic, and 2.8% other. A quarter of the survey respondents were male (25.7%). Results: Results indicated that approximately half the sample felt inexperienced in the following areas: communicating with dying patients, communicating with dying patients' families, and managing dying patients' pain (43.8%, 45.1%, and 50.7% respectively). A larger number of healthcare providers indicated feeling inexperienced in discussing end of life care and DNR status with pediatric patients (63.2% and 65.3%). The top five barriers to providing pediatric palliative care included the family's prolonged inability to accept terminal diagnosis, the family's unrealistic expectations, the family's level of education, the patient's level of education, and the family's culture.The majority of staff indicated that they were \"likely\" or \"very likely\" to consult the newly established pediatric palliative care team at the hospital (67.1%), with only a small percentage indicating they were unlikely to use the service (15.5%). Healthcare providers reported losing approximately six patients in the last year who were, on average, 8.64 (6.17 ) years old at the time of death. Slightly more than half the sample reported feeling that the hospital did not provide adequate support for those staff working with children with a life-limiting illness (52.5%).Conclusions: Overall, these results highlighted the need for additional education and support for pediatric healthcare staff in providing palliative care. While attempting to find a cure, it is also important to recognize that children with CF continue to experience worsening health and premature death. Palliative care teams can aid patients with CF, families, and staff in improving HRQoL. The aim of this study was to understand the influence of patient preference on physician prescribing practices. A second aim was to evaluate whether physician characteristics & beliefs are associated with prescribing a drug based on patient preference.",

Survey respondents chose a treatment regimen for a clinical case vignette in which the guidelines would support prescribing azithromycin, dornase alpha, hypertonic saline, & inhaled tobramycin (e.g., over 6 years old, chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, moderate to severe lung disease). Patient & illness characteristics, (including patient \"prefers not to take a lot of medication\") were then individually varied to assess their impact on prescribing practices. Respondents completed questions about their beliefs & barriers to following treatment guidelines, perceptions of the efficacy of each medication to improve lung function & reduce exacerbations & personal demographics.Results: A total of 122 physicians responded to the survey (73% males, 71% directors, 72% from pediatric clinics, time since medical school graduation: M=23 years (SD=10)). In the initial vignette, 79% of respondents prescribed all four drugs (Table) . When patient preference was added, only 27% prescribed all four drugs; physicians were significantly less likely to prescribe hypertonic saline (p<0.005; 44% of those who initially prescribed it removed it from the regimen), inhaled tobramycin (p<0.05; 30% removed it) and dornase alpha (p<0.05; 18% removed it). There was no difference for azithromycin (p=0.12; 17% removed it). In multivariate analyses, factors that predicted removing a drug in the patient preference vignette after prescribing it initially: male gender & more recent medical school graduate (hypertonic saline), being a center director (inhaled tobramycin), and lower perception of the helpfulness of the drug in reducing exacerbations (dornase alpha). No variable was significantly associated with removing azithromycin.Conclusion: In the initial vignette, most physicians prescribed all four CF guideline-recommended pulmonary medications; physicians were less Introduction: The natural progression of CF lung disease is one of progressive impairment eventually leading to disability. An analysis of the CFF Patient Registry (CFFPR) has shown an increase in the number of adults characterized as disabled despite improved health status in those patients. There are also patients with severe impairment who continue to work full time. We wanted to investigate the health status of adult patients using two definitions of disability.Methods: We analyzed the CFFPR (1999-2008) comparing the clinical status and adult milestone achievement of disabled patients defined by two different methods: (1) clinical criteria (e.g. lung function, exacerbation rate) used in the Social Security definition of disability, and (2) disability as recorded in the CFFPR. We specifically wanted to assess those patients who met one criterion but not the other. Patients meeting criteria for neither or both definitions were excluded. We compared health parameters (e.g. lung function, nutritional status) and milestone achievement (e.g. education level, marital status and parenthood) between the groups.Results: Patients characterized as disabled in the CFFPR only were older, had better lung function (FEV1), and better nutritional status (fewer patients with BMI <20) than did those patients who met criteria for disability by clinical criteria only. These differences were noted in all years investigated (Table shows data from 2008) . Despite being healthier, in those patients 23 years or older, completion of college was lower in patients disabled by the CFFPR than in those who met disability by clinical criteria. In addition the percentage of patients characterized as disabled in the CFFPR only has nearly doubled since 2000.Discussion: There is a difference in overall health status and adult milestone achievement when comparing patients with disability as reported by the CFFPR and using criteria from a clinical definition of disability. Patients disabled by the CFFPR only may have better health because they are able to focus on their treatment regimen, or there may be other factors not captured in the CFFPR as to why patients are disabled. Although, some patients may benefit from improved transition programs to better prepare them for adulthood. These groups deserve further investigation. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis survival continues to improve, with an estimated median survival of 50 years if born in the year 2000. Consequently, reproductive and sexual health (RSH) issues and the relationship between lung function, hormone levels and sexual activity are of increasing importance.Objective: To investigate awareness and attitudes of adult male CF patients towards RSH issues in a designated adult CF centre in Ireland. Secondary objectives were to address the relationship between sexual well being, predicted FEV1% and testosterone levels in adult males with CF.Methods: A RSH survey was developed based on published literature and a descriptive cross sectional study was undertaken in the Cork Adult CF centre. Questionnaires were posted to all male CF patients over the age of 16 (n=62). Best FEV1% and testosterone levels in the previous year were recorded from the medical notes. Data was analysed using SPSS (version 17.0).Results: Thirty-five men replied with a mean age (SD) of 27.2 (6.84). Of these, 34 patients (97%) were aware that male fertility is affected in CF; 65.7% provided the correct explanation how. Men reported first hearing about fertility issues from a variety of sources: CF healthcare professional 62.1%, parent 13.8% and other 24%. Over half the patients felt \"not bothered\" on initial discussions about infertility; 57.6% reported that the knowledge of infertility affected them more with increasing age. Eleven patients (31.4%) have undergone semen analysis testing, at a mean age (SD) of 28.7 (5.3) . Assisted fertility techniques were attempted by 6 patients (17.1%), with 4 (66.67%) successful. There is an inverse relationship between selfreported impotency rates and testosterone levels (p<0.05). Lower FEV1 levels are associated with self reported affected sex life (p<0.01). Twenty patients (57.1%) desire further written information on RSH issues.Conclusion: Irish males are well informed about infertility. This study reinforces findings in previous studies, where feelings about infertility become more significant with increasing age. This was predominantly due to a desire to father children. The relatively low rates of semen analysis are not dissimilar to other male CF cohorts.Further information is required. Based on the effect of patient FEV1% predicted and testosterone levels on sexual health, testosterone replacement studies need to be considered.",

Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA Objective: The clinical encounter is at the core of care delivery and thus has great potential as a context for adherence promotion over a lifetime of CF care. Little research exists, however, to guide providers in how to make the best use of scarce time to promote adherence. Our objective was to identify clinical behaviors related to adherence determinants (self-efficacy, agreement on treatment plan) in routine CF visits.Methods: Video recorded clinical encounters of 30 patients (3-12 y; mean=7.2) and parents with their pediatric pulmonologists (MD; 4 MDs in study). Each verbal behavior was coded and categorized as \"relationship building,\" \"information exchange,\" or \"treatment planning.\" Surveys, following the encounter, measured parent self-efficacy to adhere, and parent and provider reports of the treatment plan (for enzymes, aerosol treatment, airway clearance). Agreement between parent and MD understanding of the treatment plan was calculated for airway clearance (whether prescribed, type of clearance, number of times per day, treatment length), aerosol treatments (whether prescribed, type of medication, times per day), and enzymes (whether prescribed, type, dose).Results: Clinical encounters averaged 31 minutes (range=16-55). While 58% of MD time talking was spent in information exchange (asking questions, giving information), parents spent very little time asking questions (average=12 sec).

Mean age of participants was 10.36 years (SD = 3.83), 40.3% were female, mean FEV1% predicted was 88.9%, and mean BMI percentile was 47.4%. School attendance rates were obtained retrospectively from participants' schools.Results: Preliminary results indicated a wide range of absenteeism among children and adolescents with CF. The mean number of school days missed over one year in this sample was 18, with a range of 2-61 days. No significant difference in school attendance was found for gender or age. Although not statistically significant, a negative trend was found between school attendance and disease severity, as measured by FEV1% and BMI percentile, with more absences associated with worse lung function and nutritional status, respectively (r=-.23, p= .12 and r= -.20, p = .17).Conclusion: Findings from the current study indicated that school absences vary substantially in this population. Further, the number of missed days was negatively associated with disease severity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess school absenteeism, as measured by school attendance reports, in children and adolescents with CF. Future analyses will examine school absenteeism in relation to other outcomes, such as coping skills and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the CFQ-R. As life span for children with CF increases, more attention should be paid to their pursuit of age-appropriate activities, such as school attendance. Mental health of CF patients and caregivers is closely related to quality of life and health outcomes. In an effort to improve patient care, a pediatric psychology practicum placement was developed at a mid-size CFF accredited care center, enabling this clinic to participate in a psychosocial screening study in partnership with Dr. Quittner and the University of Miami. This questions for every 1 open-ended question. And while 24% of MD time talking was spent on relationship building, most of that time was spent in social chit chat as opposed to more sophisticated strategies to build a working alliance.

Agreement on treatment plan scores were averaged across the 3 domains of treatments and a median split was used to form two groups: high (n=12) and low agreement (n=15). There was no difference in visit length between the high and low agreement groups. A higher ratio of closed-to open-ended questions and a higher number of closed-ended questions were associated with less agreement, as was more time spent in social chit chat. Despite the small amount of time spent in treatment planning overall, the more time spent by MDs proposing and clarifying treatment plans, the higher the likelihood of agreement.Discussion: This study demonstrates feasibility and utility of using video recording to empirically describe the CF clinical encounter. These data suggest that MD behavior during routine CF clinic visits is related to parent self-efficacy, and treatment plan concordance, both key determinants of adherence behavior. These data as a whole suggest that there may be missed opportunities to utilize the clinical encounter to promote adherence. In order to make the best use of the clinical encounter for adherence promotion, MDs should ask more open-ended questions (versus closed-ended questions), spend less time in social chit chat, and spend more time in discussing and clarifying treatment plans.",

            "text": "Background: Parent Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) have become an integral component of patient care yet there is little evidence supporting the role of PROM and their benefits. We are conducting a single centre study to assess the impact of a PROM on the Self Efficacy (SE) of parents/carers of children with cystic fibrosis (CF). The SE of a person is their expectation of personal success in a given situation. In this study it refers to the parent's/carer's faith in their ability to deal with the challenges that a child with CF brings to family life.Methods: The Challenges of Living with Cystic Fibrosis-Questionnaire (CLCF-Q) is a 10-part, 62-item questionnaire which measures the burden of care on a parent/carer. It was developed with the input of parents/carers and previously piloted for sensitivity. To explore the feasibility and effect of incorporating the CLCF-Q into the annual review process we are conducting a parallel randomised controlled pilot study using the SE-Questionnaire (SE-Q) as an outcome measure. All participants complete the SE-Q at 2 time points. Between these time points, participants in the intervention group complete the CLCF-Q. They receive feedback at their next clinic appointment from the team in the form of colour coded tables illustrating both the positive and negative issues raised in the CLCF-Q. They are invited to talk to members of the CF team and others (consultants, CF nurses, dieticians, physiotherapists, psychologists, pharmacists, family doctors and the school) about the issues raised in the CLCF-Q. Select participants (n=3+3) are also invited to participate in narrative interviews.Findings: Preliminary data from 10 cases; parents/carers of children aged 2-13 years (7\u02db, 3\u02c7) are reported, (5 control, 5 intervention) . From the intervention group 20% were single parents and 80% were lone carers. Twenty percent were carriers of Aspergillus and 20% of Pseudomonas and 100% encountered hospital admissions in the last 3 months. Sixty percent were unhappy about the support they received from family and friends and 60% found the family doctor uncooperative and unhelpful. Forty percent were not coping with the added expenses that a child with chronic disease brings and 80% had admitted sacrificing paid employment to care for their child. Sixty percent were very worried about the future and 60% were overwhelmed by the burden of care. The SE score ranged from 26/40 to 35/40 at baseline. In the control group the SE score remained relatively static whilst the intervention group has shown an increase in SE. CF patients greater than 20 years of age (see table) . This identifies 5 domains of sexual health (erectile confidence, erection firmness, maintenance frequency, maintenance ability and intercourse satisfaction). The maximum score is 25 and ED is classified into 5 severity levels; none (22-25), mild (17-21), mild to moderate (12-16), moderate (8-11) and severe (5) (6) (7) .Results: A total of 109 questionnaires were sent out with 32 responses (29%). ED was found in 9 patients (28%). Of these 7 (78%) had mild ED, 3 of them (43%) attributed the lack of erectile confidence being the cause for ED but none reported the inability to maintain an erection. There were 2 patients (22%) with severe ED and they struggled with all domains of sexual health. Twenty-three patients (72%) did not report any erectile dysfunction.Discussion: This survey showed that ED is prevalent in the male CF cohort. The poor response rate may have underestimated its true prevalence. The high proportion of patients who lack erectile confidence indicates a possible psychological component. However, the aetiology may be multifactorial and could be secondary to chronic infection/inflammation, diabetes, medication side-effects and hormonal imbalance. A more detailed study is warranted to investigate the exact factors and manifestation of ED in CF.1. Rosen R et al.

            "text": "Background: Daily medical treatment regimens for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are intensive and time-consuming. Unlike other chronic diseases, they involve multiple modalities that include oral and inhaled medications and mucous clearance techniques. Research shows that many patients with CF are poorly adherent to recommended medical treatment plans but does not explain why patients become non-adherent and offers little guidance into treatment of this issue. Motivation to follow prescribed treatment plans is likely due to internal influences that could be explained through an individual's personality. Recently, there has been an influx of research in education illustrating improved learning when teaching is tailored to personality type.Objective: Identify the correlation of Myers-Briggs personality type to treatment adherence in patients with cystic fibrosis.Methods: This ongoing, pilot study is a cross sectional survey of seventy patients with cystic fibrosis, ages 16 and older, recruited from our institution. Two standardized tools and a demographic survey are administered to each patient. Personality types are identified via the Self-Scoring Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and patients are given a four letter categorical personality type. The Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) is a self-reported measure of volitional and non-volitional adherence. Patients are asked to report on their adherence to inhaled medications, pancreatic enzymes and airway clearance. A numerical score is given, based on MAQ responses, and designates the degree of non-adherence. Standard statistical analysis will be used to assess for any significant correlations.Results: Twenty patients have been accrued since March 1, 2010 . Early data indicates a preliminary trend between several MBTI types and poor adherence. This data is early and may change as full recruitment is attained. The study team plans for a full data set to be completed and presented at conference.Conclusion: We believe our study is a novel way to identify a plausible cause and potential treatment strategy for non-adherence. A correlation between non-adherence and MBTI type could have large implications for the potential development of effective communication and education programs for patients with chronic disease.",

The current study sought to examine the relation between physical health and both health anxiety and trait anxiety in an outpatient sample of youths with CF.Methods: Participants (ages 7-23; current n = 40) attending a regularly scheduled CF clinic visit completed measures of health anxiety (Health Anxiety questionnaire, Lucock & Morley, 1996) and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children, Spielberger, 1973). Youths and their parents each completed the Modified Health Perception Questionnaire (Pridham, 1994) to assess their perceptions of child health. As youth and parent ratings of child health were significantly related, scores were standardized and summed to create a perceived health composite score. In addition, objective health was assessed by standardizing and summing measures of lung function (FEV1), nutrition (Shwachman & Kulcyzcki, 1958) , and pancreatic sufficiency.Results: Perceived child health was related to both health anxiety (r = -.33, p < .05) and trait anxiety (r = -.53, p < .001) such that youths with relatively poor physical status had more anxiety symptoms. Moreover, a trend was found for health anxiety to mediate the relation between perceived physical health and trait anxiety (sobel test = 1.81, p = .07). Although perceived health was related to objective health status (r = .31, p < .05), the objective health status score was unrelated to anxiety symptoms.Conclusion: Subjective, but not objective, ratings of physical health were related to increased anxiety symptoms. Longitudinal research is needed to examine whether relatively poor perceived health precedes increased health anxiety, which in turn leads to increased general, or trait, anxiety symptoms.HADS-Depression were designed for patients with chronic illnesses and do not assess somatic complaints. The CES-D, in contrast, was developed for community samples and includes these items. These measures were administered to CF patients 12 years of age and older and to parent caregivers. Data on 623 patients, 492 mothers, and 131 fathers were analyzed using established clinical cut-off scores.Results: The mean age of participants was 17.76 years and 55% were female; 92.9% Caucasian, 3.9% African American, and 4.0% other. Elevated symptoms of anxiety on the HADS were found in 35% of patients (ado-lescents= 29.6%; adults= 37.7%), whereas 8.5% had elevated depression scores on the HADS (adolescents= 3.5%; adults: 11.0%). On a measure including somatic items, (CES-D), 27.1% of patients had elevated depression scores (adolescents= 21.7%; adults= 29.2%). Among mothers, 51.4% had elevated anxiety scores, 12.8% had elevated depression scores on the HADS and 25.6% on the CESD. In fathers, 43.8% had elevated anxiety scores, 14.3% had elevated depression scores on the HADS and 20.0% on the CESD. Paired sample T-tests suggested that the CES-D was significantly more sensitive to symptoms of depression in patients and mothers compared to rates of depression on the HADS. Small, but statistically significant inverse correlations were also found between FEV1 % predicted and patients' HADS-Depression scores (r =-.18, p<.01), with worse lung function related to more depressive symptoms.Conclusions: Overall, clinically elevated symptoms of anxiety were found in about one-third of adolescent and adult patients, with parents reporting even more anxiety, affecting about one half of all parents. Elevations in depression were also found on both the HADS and CESD, however significantly higher clinical rates of depression were found when somatic items were included in the assessment. Given these prevalence rates, annual screening of these symptoms and referrals for those in the clinically elevated range are recommended. The CF Foundation Infection Control Guidelines acknowledge the paucity of studies on the guidelines' impact on socialization among patients with CF. Isolation of patients with CF from each other has led internet-savvy individuals to use new media to create social networks while avoiding the risk of person-to-person transmission of pathogens. CF-specific web-based opportunities remain scarce. The impetus for this survey was the development of a friendship between two patients as a result of our recognition of a common interest; these two never met. Their four-year email friendship was posted as a blog with the aim of inspiring young adults who feel they are struggling with illness alone. Our hypothesis was that adults with CF use newer social media to create and maintain CF friendships as a means to overcome social isolation.",

Most commonly listed as \"somewhat important\" were creating non-CF friendships (41%) and seeking information about clinical trials (31%). Interestingly the least important reasons for using the newer media included \"create CF friendships\" (49%); \"share thoughts and feelings with other CF patients\" (47%); \"maintain established CF friendships\" (45%); \"contact other CF patients with similar health issues\" (42%). Forty percent indicated frustration by restrictions imposed by the guidelines and 60.3% indicated a desire to stay in contact with social networks during hospitalization. Only 42% wanted CF Families Day re-initiated.Discussion: The data suggest that adults with CF frequently utilized these internet-based social networks to create/maintain friendships which were not restricted to other patients with CF. Our population placed little Research has shown that individuals with CF living in households with no smoke exposure have consistently higher pulmonary function measurements than individuals of families who smoke. Further, there is some evidence to suggest that the incidence of parental smoking is higher in the CF population when compared to other chronic respiratory conditions. There is a paucity of research examining the attitudes of parents of children with CF about smoking, as well as parental level of education about smoking and CF. This kind of information is an important first step in helping to improve lung function in children with CF through decreased exposure to tobacco smoke.",

Disease-related variables and demographic information are collected for each patient.Procedure. Parents are approached about completing the survey during routine CF outpatient visits. Patients who will not be seen in the next month will be sent a letter, together with a consent form and the survey to complete. Parents complete the survey either in clinic or at home and return them to a research assistant.Data Analysis. Data are currently being collected, reviewed and analyzed. For this presentation, descriptive statistics will be reported for the sample. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients will be computed to examine the relationship between disease severity and smoke exposure, parental knowledge of how smoke exposure impacts children with CF and smoking behaviors, and parental attitudes toward smoking and smoking behavior.Hypotheses.1. Based on prior research, CF patients who are exposed to tobacco smoke will have poorer respiratory function, as measured by FEV1.2. No significant relationship will be observed between parental knowledge of how smoke exposure impacts respiratory function in CF and smoking behaviors.3. A significant relationship will be observed between parental attitudes toward smoking and smoking behavior, such that parents who smoke will have less negative attitudes toward smoking.

Through multiple experiences of miscommunication, faculty from the different fields came to realize that both education and healthcare have processes referred to as \"transition.\" These processes are different within each field and frequently professionals in one field are unaware of the parallel process in the other. ICHET includes interdisciplinary representatives from the UF College of Medicine (physician, social worker, family partner), the UF College of Education and the UF Institute for Child Health Policy.With the realization that fundamental change in professional behavior is most often effected at the graduate student level, ICHET faculty developed and provided a semester long, interdisciplinary online graduate course on Healthcare Transition through the UF College of Education. The course was offered to UF and distance students and was primarily designed to help graduate students in education learn about healthcare transition needs of teens with chronic health conditions. However, the course was also taken by graduate students in health professions fields and served the purpose of having each profession learn about the others' definitions of and activities towards \"transition.\"The course consisted of six, two-week modules: Young Adults with Special Health Care Needs; Education View of Transition; Healthcare View of Transition; Family View of Transition; Young Adult Transition; Action Plan. Each module included an online summary of material, structured discussions, readings and a collaborative activity. Post-course surveys indicate that, students moved from an average of 1.5 to 4.0 (on a five point scale) in their knowledge of education/healthcare transition. Students identified the main course strengths as the interdepartmental collaboration and the amount of information and knowledge provided and unanimously indicated that they would recommend this course to friends.Additional ICHET activities have included collaborative presentations at a national education conference (Division on Career Development and Transition) and submission of a book proposal. ICHET faculty members plan to publish their experiences and to apply for funding for a pilot research project in the fall of 2010. In spring 2010 we will re-teach the course and provide a one day collaborative transition conference for school personnel and healthcare providers.",

This study examined both adolescent and parent perceptions of parent-teen conflict at an initial visit prior to beginning an adherence intervention. Asso-ciation between demographic characteristics, disease severity and conflict were also evaluated.Methods: Participants included 117 youths with CF (mean age = 13.03 years; 39% female) and their parents who were part of a larger randomized clinical trial. Pulmonary function (FEV1 % predicted; mean = 85.03%) and BMI percentile (mean = 45.76%) at the Baseline assessment were used as markers of disease severity. Participants reported their perceptions of parentadolescent conflict on the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ; Robin & Foster, 1989) , which was rated from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater conflict.Results: Preliminary analyses indicated that parent and teen conflict behaviors were significantly correlated (r = .39, p < .01) at Baseline. Parents tended to report more conflict (mean score= 7.32) than adolescents (mean score= 5.81; t(116)= -3.6, p < .01). There were no gender differences between boys and girls in the magnitude of their reported conflict with parents. However, boys reported significantly less conflict with their parents than girls (t(60)=-3.65, p<.01). Older adolescents also reported more conflict with parents than younger adolescents (r = .32, p < .01). Disease severity (pulmonary function and BMI percentile) was not associated with conflicts reported by teens and parents. However, when the relationship was examined by gender, we found that disease severity was inversely related to conflict only for males; adolescent males who had better lung function reported less conflict with their parents (r = -27, p < .05).Conclusions: Findings suggested that adolescents who have conflicted relationships with their parents may be at a greater risk for poor health outcomes. Interventions aimed at improving parent-teen relationships should be considered given the tremendous impact that CF and its associated treatments have on family functioning. Future analyses will examine associations between treatment adherence and extent of conflict between parents and adolescents, with a focus on adherence as a potential mediator of this relationship.Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health (HL#47064).

            "text": "Background: Treatment adherence is a significant issue for adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). Research suggests that although CF team members provide education to increase adherence behaviors, adolescents often lack the skills to enact these recommendations. Parental coping has also been linked to adolescent adjustment and health outcomes in other chronic diseases; however, these studies have primarily used self-report measures that are not context or disease-specific, limiting the clinical utility of the results. Quittner and colleagues developed the Role-Play Inventory of Situations and Coping Strategies (RISCS) to evaluate the frequency and difficulty of common situations faced by parents of adolescents with CF and assess the efficacy of parent-generated coping strategies. The current study utilized the Parent RISCS to: 1) determine the association between parent and adolescent coping, 2) evaluate the relationship between parent coping strategies and adolescent health outcomes, and 3) identify whether caregivers within the same household demonstrated similar levels of coping efficacy.Methods: As part of a larger randomized trial, 161 caregivers of adolescents with CF, comprising 103 families, completed the RISCS at the Baseline assessment. Twenty-six common, problematic situations faced by families with CF were grouped into 5 scales: Treatment Adherence, Parent-Teen Relationship/Discipline, Growing Up/Long-term Health Issues, Medical Procedures/Symptoms, and Financial Issues. Adolescents completed the Adolescent RISCS. Health status variables were also collected.Results: Results suggested that parents and their adolescents do not demonstrate similar coping skills across equivalent domains; however, effective parent coping on the Growing Up domain (e.g. responding to fears that your teen may miss out on life due to CF) was positively related to adolescent coping on the Eating (e.g. frustration due to lack of weight gain) and School Issues (e.g. catching up on schoolwork) domains. Adolescent age was positively associated with the frequency of parent-reported Treatment Adherence problems (e.g. deciding to skip treatments to see friends). Better lung function was correlated with more parent-reported difficulty on the Treatment Adherence, Parent-Teen Relationship and Medical Procedures scales. Similarly, higher adolescent BMI percentile was associated with increased difficulty ratings by parents on situations comprising the Treat-ated with CF care. The objective of this two-phase study was to assess the overall economic burden of disease associated with CF for patients and their caregivers. The first, qualitative phase of the study explored the full range of possible CF costs and unpaid time. The second, quantitative phase measured the specific categories of out-of-pocket costs and time estimates for households, including such direct costs as prescription and physician co-pays, OTC medications, medical equipment, and specialized childcare. Administration of home therapy, traveling to healthcare providers, office, clinic, and hospital/ER time, financial management, and housekeeping were identified as categories of unpaid time. \"Opportunity costs\" included missed work days or school days, and vacation costs/losses. An expense diary and brief survey were distributed to 133 households, which included CF patients under 6 years of age (n=27), 6-12 years of age (n=18), 13-17 years of age (n=26), and patients 18 years of age or older (n=62). The diary covered a 16week period from November 2009-February 2010 and was timed to capture \"big\" and \"small\" expenses, such as vests and nebulizer tubings, respectively. A wide range of disease severities, geographies, and family structures were included and analyzed in the study. Most respondents fell within the \"mild or moderate\" range of severity based on their most recent self-reported FEV 1 status (40-89% predicted). The CF patients also represented a mix of mild and severe CFTR genotypes. Approximately 57% of CF households were covered under private insurance, although 18% had no insurance for either some or all CF-related expenses. In 24% of households, Medicaid, Medicare, or another state or federal program served as the primary source of coverage. In this study, all patients had relatively high out-of-pocket costs, although the costs for certain CF patients were higher than others. Significant amounts of time were spent caring for CF patients. These hours were converted into dollars using the market value replacement wage rate approach, and when monetized, increased the economic burden even further.",

Sufian & Passamano, L.L.P., Houston, TX, USA Introduction: Children and adults with CF without health insurance coverage or inadequate coverage visit CF centers less frequently and are unable to obtain prescribed medication. Consequently, their health declines. Those with CF who lose coverage or have inadequate coverage need an immediate solution. Assistance with efforts to obtain coverage can result in improved access to medical treatment and improved health outcomes.Method: The CF Insurance Access Project (\"IAP\") was established in March 2009 to provide pro bono representation to people with CF who need insurance coverage. The CF Patient Assistance Foundation (CFPAF) provides grant funding. The IAP is staffed by attorneys in the law firm of Sufian & Passamano, LLP. The IAP represented 100 individuals between March 2009 and March 2010 whose income was at or below 400% of Federal Poverty Level and who met eligibility criteria for a government program that provides insurance coverage. Individuals were referred to the IAP by the CFPAF, the CF Legal Information Hotline or a CF center. IAP clients reported that loss of coverage meant no funds to pay for clinic visits or medication resulting in a substantial decline in health. IAP clients with insurance coverage indicated that high co-pays resulted in missing CF center visits and reducing the amount of medication taken each day. Medication assistance programs provided access to a limited number of medications but did not meet all of the IAP clients' medical needs.Results: Individuals represented by the IAP in their application for government benefits were approved for benefits 90% of the time. Nationally, only 10% of all initial applications for benefits are approved. Benefit appeals may take 6-24 months. Representation by an attorney familiar with CF and eligibility for government benefits led to strong applications which were approved within 1-3 months. Eligibility for government benefits and insurance coverage resulted in improved access to care for the client. Health outcomes improved after medication and clinic visits resumed.Discussion: CF centers need to concentrate their time addressing patients' complex medical issues. Many CF centers do not have a dedicated social worker or the time to assist with government benefit applications. While the assistance of an attorney makes a difference for applicants there are only a few attorneys who handle initial applications due to inability to receive a fee for services. One half of all IAP clients had limited or no cov-erage for the year prior to contacting the IAP and had an FEV1 below 40%. Obtaining government benefits resulted in coverage which allowed the IAP client to access medical care and medication. Individuals whose application for Social Security benefits was approved gained access to Medicaid or Medicare coverage and a monthly financial benefit which assisted in obtaining housing or purchasing food.Conclusion: Individuals who do not have health insurance coverage will not have access to the care they need to treat CF. Income disparities should not result in people with CF being denied access to care when the person may be eligible for government benefits. CF centers should identify patients who may be eligible for government benefits and refer them to the IAP for assistance. The theory of reasoned action (TRA) is frequently used to study health behaviors. In addition to elements of intentions to adhere, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and attitudes related to treatment, TRA acknowledges background factors' influence on adherence behaviors. This study's purpose was to develop preliminary data concerning the relationship between certain background factors (spiritual and religious constructs) and adherence determinants.",

Data distribution was non-parametric so Spearman's correlation coefficients between spiritual variables and adherence determinants were calculated.Results: The sample was 100% Caucasian; 43% male. The body sanctification scale Sacred Qualities of the body significantly correlated with self-efficacy in performing two daily treatments: airway clearance (rho=0.44; p<0.05) and aerosolized medications (rho=0.49;p<0.01) under numerous circumstances. Sacred Qualities and Manifestation of God in the Body scales showed a trend toward significance in their correlation with Attitudes (expected treatment value; rho=0.35; p=0.06 and rho=0.34; p=0.06, respectively); a large effect size (q=1.84) indicates these trends would likely have reached significance in a larger sample. No significant correlations were found between Sacred Qualities and self-efficacy for administering pancreatic enzymes, nor between the Manifestation of God in the body scale and self-efficacy for any of the three treatments.Conclusion: These data show a moderate relationship between parental sanctification of their child's body and parents' self-efficacy ratings to accomplish daily CF treatments. There may also be a correlation between parental sanctification of their child's body and attitudes towards the expected treatment value. This study is the first to link spirituality and self-efficacy in a pediatric chronic condition, expanding the potential importance of at least one of the TRA's background factors. Two other noteworthy aspects of this study are: first, Sacred Qualities significantly correlated with parental self-efficacy when the family was stressed in some way and not during \"typical\" weekdays or weekends. Spirituality appeared more operative when parents were stressed. Clinically, parental self-efficacy's correlation with intentions to adhere suggests it may be possible to influence adherence intentions by addressing a spiritual construct. Second, it was a spiritual and not religious construct that correlated with parental self-efficacy. This is important because religion denotes a set of corporately expressed, while spirituality denotes an individually-held set of internal beliefs and is therefore thought to be a more proximal determinant of adherence. Understanding parental sanctification (and perhaps other unexplored spiritual constructs) opens new and potentially important avenues to address adherence for many parents.",

Division of Child Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; 3. CHICAS, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom Background: The rate of decline of FEV1 in people with cystic fibrosis is one of the most important predictors of death. Low socioeconomic status has been linked with poor outcomes in CF. We have explored, for the first time in a UK-wide cohort, longitudinal rate of decline in FEV1 and its relationship with socioeconomic status (SES) and other risk factors.Methods: We undertook a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 3587 people with CF aged less than 20 years, and explored relationships between predicted FEV1 and SES, demographic characteristics, genotype and other clinical characteristics using the UK CF registry between 1995 and 2006. Mixed model linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of fixed and time-varying covariates on the mean FEV1 at age five (intercept) and the rate of lung function decline (slope). Census based indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) from the UK constituent counties were used as small area measures of SES.Results: The mean population change per year of % predicted FEV1 was -1.55 (95%CI -1.44 to -1.66), with a mean FEV1 at age five (intercept) of 93.1% (CI 92.2 to 94.1). Table 1 outlines significant risk factors in univariate analysis. All of these factors remained significant in multivariate analysis with the exception of screening and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. There was no difference by genotype comparing those carrying at least one F508 mutation to other genotypes. The most deprived SES quintile had a mean difference in population FEV1 at age five of -4.71% (95% CI -7.88 to -1.53), but SES did not have a significant effect on subsequent rate of decline of FEV1 in this population. This suggests that low socioeconomic status may have health damaging effects in CF in the first five years of life.Conclusions: Important risk factors for lung function decline are female sex, birth cohort pre 1990, P. aeruginosa or B. cepacia colonisation, receipt of supplemental feeding and CF related diabetes. Low SES is associated with a lower mean FEV1 at age five.We acknowledge the support of the MRC and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Background: Disparities in health outcomes such as lung function and BMI have been shown in cystic fibrosis patients. Previous studies have shown that socioeconomic status (SES), as defined by median income by zip code, is related to lung function, BMI, and health-related quality of life. However, median zip code is an imprecise measure of SES when compared to family-reported household income. Furthermore, most of the previous research has focused on maternal education but there is no data on the role of paternal education.Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between caregiver-reported income, maternal and paternal education level on health outcomes (FEV1% predicted (FEV1), BMI percentile (BMI %), and health related quality of life (HRQOL) in a pediatric CF patient sample.Methods: We recruited 50 adolescents and their caregivers (mean age =13.8, range 11-20 years, 56% male; 78% caucasian) from 5 CF care centers as part of a multi-site randomized trial (iCARE). Participants completed a baseline assessment, which included measures of baseline demographics and Cystic Fibrosis Quality of Life-Revised. Baseline health outcome data including FEV1 % predicted and BMI percentile were abstracted from the medical records. T-tests were conducted to examine mean differences in health outcomes by household income, maternal and paternal education level. A multivariate model was conducted to control for gender and race on the relation between SES and health outcomes.Results: Preliminary results indicated that participants who were below the median income, or had less maternal and paternal education had lower lung function results (p<0.05). Furthermore, paternal education was related to higher BMI percentile (p <0.05). Multivariate analyses that controlled for gender and minority status indicated that household income was the strongest predictor of both BMI percentile and FEV1 % predicted (p<0.01, accounting for 10% of the variance). There were no associations between household income, maternal and paternal education and any of the subscales of the CFQ-R.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that household income and parent education was related to lung function and BMI but not to measures of health related quality of life in this sample. This study is unique because it utilized caregiver report of income as opposed to median income by zip code, which may not be as sensitive a measure of SES and it included measures of paternal level of education. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that caregiver report of income was the strongest predictor of health outcomes compared to maternal and paternal level of education, even after controlling for minority status and gender.Supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Genentech, Inc. and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.Introduction: An increasing number of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) reach adulthood in relatively good health. As a result, many female patients become pregnant and have babies. Prior studies have found that women with CF who become pregnant are healthier than non-pregnant patients before pregnancy, and therefore tolerate pregnancy well.Methods: We performed a two center case-control study in women with CF who became pregnant and carried fetuses beyond the 2nd trimester from 2002 and 2008. All patients were matched to controls who were the same age and had similar lung function just before pregnancy. Lung function, body mass index (BMI), number of exacerbations, presence of diabetes and pancreatic insufficiency, demographic and microbiology data were collected. The Student t-test or its non-parametric equivalent was utilized to compare the groups. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate predictors of loss of lung function in the cohort of patients.Results: During the study period, 36.7% of female patients in the adult clinic had prior pregnancies or became pregnant. There were 22 matched pairs of patients (pregnant vs. non-pregnant) 20.5\u00b11.7), diabetes (31.8% vs. 50.0%) before pregnancy. There were no differences in the rate of exacerbations before, during and after pregnancy between the two groups. There was a trend towards decreased rates of pancreatic insufficiency in the pregnant group (66.7% vs. 90.9%; p=0.057). There were no differences in the change of BMI between the two groups at the end of pregnancy ( . On multivariable analysis pregnancy had no effect on change in lung function from pre-pregnancy to last follow-up. The only significant predictors of decline were higher lung function prior to pregnancy (p<0.001 and pancreatic insufficiency (p=0.036). There were no significant peripartum complications in this cohort.Conclusions: Pregnancy is common among adult cystic fibrosis patients. Patients that become pregnant tend to have mild to moderate disease. Pregnancy leads to no adverse events immediately or in the long-term for CF patients when compared to similar controls. Larger studies are needed to determine whether any subgroups of patients have increased morbidity with pregnancy. Limitations: Small differences between the groups could have been missed because of the small size of the study. The purpose of this study was to describe the total and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) related annual healthcare costs and resource utilization among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients enrolled in commercial health plans.",

            "text": "Methods: Data for this study were derived from MarketScan claims database which captures person-specific direct medical utilization, expenditures, and enrollment from approximately 100 payers. A retrospective crosssectional study design was used. CF patients with an initial claim for a PA infection (ICD-9:482.1) were identified during 2005-2008 using international classification of diseases diagnosis codes from their medical claims of 277.0 and 482.1, respectively. First medical claim for PA infection served as index date and demographic information from administrative claims and healthcare utilization and costs from medical and pharmacy claims were extracted for 12 months pre and post this initial claim. Descriptive and pairwise non-parametric statistical analyses were conducted to describe the study sample and compare healthcare resource use and costs before and after PA infection using SAS version 9.2.Results: A total of 358 CF patients with PA infection met the study criteria with mean age 20.1 (SD:15.5) years and 48% females. Approximately 67% had pancreatic insufficiency, followed by chronic sinusitis (20%) and diabetes (15%) as comorbid conditions. Annual per-patient PA-related costs were estimated to be $18,167 (median: $9,305) for overall healthcare resource use, $3,113 (median: $478) for outpatient care, $10,123 (median: $0) for inpatient care and $4,928 (median: $443) for pharmacy services, respectively. Overall inpatient visits (0.5 vs. 1.3), outpatient visits (18.3 vs. 21.7) and unique pharmacy prescriptions (11.0 vs. 12.7) increased significantly (p<.01) 12-months before and 12-months after the initial claim for PA. Similarly, related healthcare costs also were statistically higher (p<.01) in the post period compared to baseline.Conclusions: PA infections place a significant economic burden to payers among cystic fibrosis patients. Future studies need to determine whether this PA-related burden varies across demographic and comorbid illnesses. In an effort to change the nursing annual visit education from a lecture with handouts to more interactive sessions, the nurses at the CHS/UAB pediatric CF center developed a multiple choice questionnaire to assess knowledge about CF. This questionnaire included 2 demographic questions regarding who completed the survey, parent or child, and age of child. The next 10 questions covered the topics of pathophysiology, lung health, infection control, nutrition, transition, CFRD, and knowledge of lung microbiological flora. The final question requested topics about which the patient or family wanted to learn more.",

There was no significant difference The life expectancy of people with CF has steadily increased to more than 37 years of age. While the majority of adults with CF have reduced fertility, it is possible for them to have children with CF and become caregivers. Also, older siblings with CF may take on the role of caregiver for younger siblings. In 2009, we had 2 cases where the caregivers of admitted patients also had CF. Several concerns arose during these hospitalizations including 1) application of CF infection control practices to the caregiver; 2) how to legally intervene with symptomatic caregivers not under our medical care; 3) caregiver utilization of services intended for patients; and 4) staff confusion as to which person was the patient.",

            "text": "Case 1: The first case involved a mother with CF who stayed with her child. This was the mother's first role as caregiver during an admission due to her own health issues. The mother brought her own medications and equipment to perform her care which confused staff. A nurse tried to hook up mother's feeding pump to the patient. RTs were unsure of which vest unit belonged to the hospital. The staff was also unsure as to which person was the actual patient since the mother was symptomatic. Staff was uncertain how to apply the infection control policy to a caregiver with CF who needed access to the cafeteria and laundry facilities.Case 2: The second case involved a caregiver with CF who assumed the caregiver role of her younger sibling with CF. This situation was further complicated in that the caregiver was a pediatric patient herself only a year ago. It was confusing for staff to treat her as a caregiver since they provided medical care to her over the last 20 years of her life. The caregiver also had personal confusion in her role as she would utilize services intended for her sibling such as ordering extra food for herself or asking staff for assistance in her care. Staff was concerned about not providing food as they were aware of the caregiver's financial barriers and medical condition. As a previous patient the caregiver was familiar with infection control practices, but these were not enforced since she wasn't a patient.Discussion: The infection control team was consulted to address whether caregivers with CF would fall under our hospital's CF isolation policy. It was decided caregivers with CF may stay with children in the hospital unless they have contagious conditions, such as flu or TB, which are harmful to the general public. However, the CF infection control policy couldn't be applied to caregivers since 1) they aren't under our direct medical care; and 2) legally they don't have to disclose their medical condition. Also, we couldn't enforce room restriction since in-room amenities for caregivers aren't provided, such as meal or laundry services. Finally, caregivers were encouraged to practice good infection control measures including hand washing, staying in room as much as possible, traveling only to essential areas, and practicing good cough etiquette.Conclusion: New challenges arise when individuals with CF become caregivers. We encourage CF centers to review their current policies to be prepared to encounter similar scenarios.",

Pulmonary/Critical Care, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA Introduction: CF patients are living longer and there is a growing adult population. We now have established adult programs to provide age-appropriate care to this growing population. Transition programs have been recommended to prepare patients not only for the movement from a pediatric to adult healthcare system but also to provide tools necessary for adult development. We would anticipate with implementation of these programs there would be a subsequent increase in achievement of adult milestones.Methods: We analyzed the CFF Patient Registry (CFFPR) comparing patients aged 25-30 years in 1999 and 2008. In 2000, the CFF mandated there be adult care programs at each CF center, therefore patients were analyzed prior to and after this mandate. These ages were chosen to allow for completion of education. We evaluated clinical parameters as well as adult milestone achievement (i.e. education, employment, and marital status).Results: There were differences between the two groups (1999 vs. 2008, respectively) in their employment status with a decrease in those working full-time (51% vs. 45%) and an increase in those characterized as disabled (14% vs. 22%). There were no differences in the milestones of education (completion of college; 40% vs. 41%) and married status (48% vs. 49%). Overall health had improved over time in all groups, with better lung function and nutritional status, including in those patients characterized as disabled (Table) .Discussion: Clinical outcomes of adult CF patients (i.e. nutrition and pulmonary function) have improved over the last decade. Despite the implementation of adult programs, there is no evidence of improved adult milestone achievement, and there has been an increase in the number of patients characterized as disabled. Patients characterized as disabled have also realized improvement in overall health, possibly because they are better able to attend to their healthcare needs. However, we should consider that the lack of an increase in milestone achievement may be because transition programs have not fully matured and require further development. The Johns Hopkins Adult CF Program cares for approximately 250 adults with CF. During hospital admissions for CF exacerbations, peak and trough tobramycin levels are obtained as part of routine monitoring to optimize effectiveness and limit toxicity. Because these levels require precise timing and close coordination between nursing and phlebotomy staff, inappropriately timed levels can be a frequent problem. A survey of CF adults who had recently been hospitalized identified efficiency of tobramycin monitoring as one of the main areas for potential inpatient care improvement. A QI project to optimize tobramycin monitoring using a combination of an established monitoring protocol, regular physician and staff education, and continual assessment of monitoring outcomes commenced and was led by the nurses of the Johns Hopkins Adult Cystic Fibrosis Inpatient Unit (Nelson 4).Methods: The QI initiative included the following components: 1) Establishment of a standardized order set for tobramycin dosing and monitoring; 2) Changing the dosing time for tobramycin to 9 a.m. to avoid competition with nurse report and with other medications usually given at 10 a.m.; 3) Development of a tobramycin monitoring education packet for house staff and nurses; 4) Monthly educational meetings with rotating house staff, led by nurse coordinators; 5) Transfer of responsibility for coordinating drug administration and timed blood draws from house staff to the inpatient nursing staff; 6) Redesign of tobramycin level tube labels to include both time of blood draw and time of drug administration; 7) Monthly meetings with nurse and physician representatives to review monitoring outcomes.Results: Retrospective review of two years of tobramycin monitoring data prior to these interventions revealed that 734 inpatient tobramycin levels had been drawn, of which 142 (19.3%) were deemed not interpretable due to inappropriate timing of the blood specimen or lack of exact details on the timing of tobramycin infusion, and therefore termed \"futile sticks.\" In the six months following initiation of the QI project, only 11 of 204 (5.3%) of levels were futile sticks (p<0.0001, t-test of means using quarterly data). This resulted in elimination of approximately 28 futile patient needle sticks over the 6 month project period. In addition, the percentage of interpretable peak levels increased from 69% to 88% (p<0.0009), and interpretable troughs from 82% to 96% (p=0.03).Conclusion: A QI project focused on improving inpatient tobramycin monitoring by more actively involving nursing significantly improved quality of monitoring data and also reduced patient discomfort. Background: As the cystic fibrosis population ages, there will be more patients who should be candidates for screening as part of healthcare maintenance as done for the general population. This would include screening for cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer and colon cancer. Since CF clinics may play a major role in the primary care of adult CF patients, we wanted to investigate the attitudes and practices of the adult centers in the United States towards preventive health maintenance.",

            "text": "Methods: An internet based survey was created and all adult program directors were invited to participate. The survey first queried as to whether the CF center served as a primary care provider for some or all of their patients. We included questions regarding healthcare maintenance asking about cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate and colon cancer screening. In addition, we asked the methods by which the centers screened for these cancers and if referrals were made to other specialists such as OB/GYNs or urologists. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed.Results: There were 33 responses from programs providing care for 4332 adult patients (51% male and 49% female). A large percentage (36.8%) was reported to be greater than 40 years of age. The adult clinics estimated they provide primary care for 45.4% of their patients. Female patients routinely screened for cervical cancer ranged from 25-100% with the average being 65.6%. No CF physicians reported performing cervical cancer screening and referred all female patients to a gynecologist. Breast cancer screening is also generally deferred to the gynecologists; however, several centers routinely discuss self breast examination with their patients. Male patients routinely screened for prostate cancer ranged from 5-100% with an average of 29.5%; all male patients are sent to urologists for prostate examinations. Thirteen (39%) centers order PSA screening for their male patients. For colon cancer screening, 17 centers (50%) order routine colonoscopy for patients over the age of 50 years of age, and 6 centers (18%) in addition order Hemoccult test for the patients. Interestingly, some centers begin colon cancer screening at ages 35 years (4 centers), 40 years (4 centers) and at 45 (1 center).Discussion: While many patients and centers indicate that the adult CF center is the primary care physician, the data indicate there is no uniform approach to routine preventive healthcare maintenance. Often the centers admitted being unaware of whether the patient was up-to-date on screening examinations.Conclusion: As many adult cystic fibrosis clinics assume a role as primary care provider for their patients, they should begin routine preventive health maintenance in appropriate patients. There are currently not any guidelines set for preventive health maintenance in the CF patient population. This may be an opportunity to investigate further what preventive health maintenance screening is appropriate for the cystic fibrosis population.We reviewed our Respiratory Care procedures and developed educational materials for proper use and care for each of them. During clinic we provided complete aerosol and airway clearance therapy, and then repeated the spirometry. We found significant improvement in some of them leading to a discussion in our quality initiative group. We recognized some inconsistencies in our care instruction and identified this area as an area of focus. We then developed a questionnaire that covered all areas of respiratory care such as aerosol use, secretion movement, device use, and care and cleaning of items. Within 2 months, we were able to employ this questionnaire to our entire CF population of 414. Using the response to questions, an educational plan was developed and implemented individually for each patient.Results: We are now starting to repeat the annual questionnaire and have seen some significant improvements on the results of the questionnaire. We feel that patients are more aware of the proper way to complete their therapy. Unfortunately, we have been able to identify a few patients who admit to non-adherence even with comprehensive education. These patients have been targeted for enhanced education.We also discovered that our team, both in the hospital and clinic have some variability in how we were teaching our patients. This program required us to review the new procedures with each team member to support consistency for our patients in all clinical settings by rotation of inpatient and outpatient personnel. Patient and parent satisfaction appears improved.Conclusion: In addition to informal reviews with each visit, we are now assessing each of our patients formally every year and documenting the results in our electronic medical record. The assessments are utilized to develop individualized education plans to meet the needs of each patient. We have also assured that each patient is presented with consistent education and re-training of Respiratory Care procedures that meet their specific needs.Clinical Implications: Providing consistent education and eliminating confusion should result in better outcomes, improvement in pulmonary function, and reduction in frequency of antibiotic use. We will continue to look for ways to improve the compliance of our non-adherence patients.",

MMP Pediatric Specialty Care, Maine Medical Center, Portland, ME, USA Background: Individuals with cystic fibrosis require a complex and well coordinated plan of care. After reviewing the 2007 center specific registry data, it was our belief that we could improve patient outcomes by focusing on the CF Foundation guidelines for care and then addressing targeted areas for improvement in outcomes. The CF team is responsible for providing tools and education to families in order to improve wellness and overall health as part of chronic illness care. Optimizing communication and providing clear, consistent expectations to families was thought to be a key factor in achieving our goals. By partnering with families and setting measurable goals, improved outcomes should follow.Methods: Our CF center director and program coordinator recognized the need to develop a plan to improve the quality of our patient care by encouraging patients to be seen in clinic four times annually, and ensuring that our patients received annual chest x-rays, pulmonary function tests, labs, and visits with members of our multidisciplinary CF team. A plan was developed to increase patient and family awareness of the CFF guidelines for outpatient care. A letter was written to each family, inviting them to participate in the \"Wii\u00ae Can Win\" initiative for 2009. The CF Foundation guidelines for care were clearly stated and a copy of CFF consumer fact sheet, \"It's all about Sally\" was included. A spread sheet was developed to track all patients at our center for 2009 clinic visits and annual requirements for care. Rewards were built into the program to encourage the kids to be involved. Educational materials including posters and written materials were used throughout the year to increase awareness of goals for the project. Patients were given cards that were stamped at each visit and when all requirements for the year were complete, they were entered in a contest to win a Wii\u00ae Game System and Wii\u00ae Fit game! Surveys were done at the conclusion of the project to obtain feedback from families. Transitioning from pediatric to adult cystic fibrosis (CF) care requires the active involvement of adolescent patients in the medical management of their chronic disease. We aim to improve our median body mass index (BMI) percentile and prepare adolescent patients for transition to the adult CF center by measuring CF-specific knowledge and providing targeted nutrition education. Based on 2008 CF Foundation patient registry data, our median BMI is less than the national average. We hypothesize that improving the median BMI in adolescents ages 13 through 19 could be achieved by providing targeted education on CF nutrition.",

Each study participant (n=25) was provided this questionnaire either during clinic or during their hospital admission. After completing the questionnaire, the dietitian or nutrition graduate assistant reviewed the 14 nutrition questions with each participant. The results of the questionnaire were shared with each participant by providing them with their answers marked on an answer key. The answer key included the survey questions, the correct answer in bold, and an explanation on why it is the correct answer. Study participants were then provided with a CF nutrition education two-page handout 4-6 weeks after their initial study visit via email or mail. Participants will be asked to repeat the Knowledge of Disease Management questionnaire at their follow-up CF clinic visit. Data collected on study participants included weight, height, BMI percentile, and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percent predicted.Results: There was no statistical significance between an adolescent's questionnaire test scores when compared to their baseline BMI percentile using the Pearson correlation. On average, adolescents scored fairly well on the Knowledge of Disease Management questionnaire (M=75%, SD=11). Based on individual sections, adolescents scored the highest in the Pulmonary (M=82%, SD=15) and Treatment (M=82%, SD=10), then Nutrition (M=70%, SD=15), followed by General Health (M=67%, SD=15). Results on the effect of the initial questionnaire, targeted education, and follow-up nutrition education have on the follow-up questionnaire, BMI percentile, weight, height, and FEV1 percent predicted are pending.Conclusions: By administering an initial and subsequent CF knowledge questionnaire, we seek to determine if knowledge regarding CF care and providing targeted nutrition education has a positive effect on an adolescent's BMI percentile, weight, height, or FEV1 percent predicted. Measuring knowledge and remediating gaps may strengthen our adolescent transition program to the adult clinic by providing participants with individualized education regarding CF care, improving adolescents' self-care independence. from 87% to 93%.

For patients with CFRD, overall, higher knowledge scores were associated with lower age (r = -0.44, p=0.01) and lower BMI (r = -0.46, p=0.008). However, when stratified by gender, knowledge scores were negatively correlated with BMI only in females (r = -0.72, p=0.0005). Knowledge scores were not correlated with HgbA1c, FEV1%, or duration of CFRD. In patients without CFRD, no correlation was found between knowledge scores and age, BMI, FEV1% or HgbA1c. With regard to specific CFRD knowledge, 1 \u20444 of CFRD patients did not recognize weight loss as a symptom of high blood glucose levels. Similarly, 1 \u20444 of CFRD patients did not identify high blood glucose levels to be associated with acute pulmonary exacerbations. Nearly 1 \u20443 of CFRD patients did not appreciate that declining PFTs could be related to poor CFRD management. All but one of the CFRD patients indicated they received formal diabetes education, the majority of which was performed by an endocrinologist (84%), an endocrine nurse (75%), and/or a CF dietitian (72%). While almost all patients received education of CFRD symptoms, management, and complications, 1 \u20443 of patients with CFRD were not instructed in diagnosis of CFRD and 1 \u2044 4 were not instructed in how CFRD relates to pulmonary status.Conclusions: We developed a novel survey to evaluate diabetes knowledge in CF and CFRD patients. We have identified gaps in diabetes knowledge, especially relating CFRD to weight and pulmonary status, which will guide improvements in CFRD education. Our survey identified that diabetes knowledge was not correlated with better glycemic control, suggesting that other factors impact CFRD management. Future studies will include multivariate models and will assess the impact of adherence to diabetes care and barriers to care on CFRD management. Background: Before newborn screening (NBS), cystic fibrosis (CF) was often diagnosed by clinical suspicion and frequently required hospitalization at time of diagnosis. Thus, initial \"CF education\" occurred as an inpatient, even for those patients who required no hospital care. However, NBS for CF often results in the diagnosis of asymptomatic infants. This shift offered the CF center the opportunity to assess the methods and efficacy of the education provided to new families.",

Participants were given the option of choosing the OPE or IPE tracks. The content of the education and team members that provided the education were the same for both tracks. Information was given in verbal, written and audiovisual formats for multiple learning styles. All information emphasized the benefits of early diagnosis and NBS. Upon completion of education, parents were given a 10-item questionnaire to assess knowledge retention and a 16-item questionnaire to assess satisfaction with the education process. Similarly, CF team members were given a survey to assess satisfaction with the education tracks.Results: The families of 12 ND babies consented to participate in the study. The participants were 11 mothers, 8 fathers, and 1 paternal aunt (N=20). Average age at diagnosis was 26.2 days (IPE) and 26.7 days (OPE); current average wt/ht percentile is 52% (IPE) and 59% (OPE). Five families completed the IPE track; 3 chose this track while the patient was asymptomatic and 2 received education during an admission for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Seven families chose the OPE track. Statistical analysis (chi square) showed that knowledge retention and satisfaction with the education provided between the two groups were not statistically different. However, for the question: \"If given the choice, would you choose this educational track or would you prefer another track?\" families in the IPE group would have chosen the OPE track (p= 0.0307). Furthermore, families in the OPE group were more satisfied with their overall experience (p= 0.038). Eighty-six percent of the CF team was more satisfied with OPE. Finally, hospital charges were significantly higher in the IPE group: $4,572 vs. $1,324 for OPE (p <0.05; includes only infants who were asymptomatic).Discussion: In our experience, a structured OPE session achieves the same success as the traditional IPE method with educational goals and knowledge retention in families of ND, mostly asymptomatic infants with CF. The families and CF center staff clearly were more satisfied with the OPE track and costs of providing the required services were significantly lower. We speculate that OPE should be the preferred method for initial CF education and will decrease the distress that a hospitalization can add to a new diagnosis. Methods: A self-administered anonymous questionnaire was given to 199 CF patients followed in 13 CF Care Centres and to 1 physician of each centre. Questions concerned the characteristics of the patients and their nebulized treatments used at home (type of drugs used, duration of treatments, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite, Atlanta, GA, USA Background: Upon diagnosis, patients and families from our care center are seen by the cystic fibrosis (CF) nurse practitioner and a gastroenterologist or pulmonologist for an initial office visit and basic CF education. Since 2007, when CF newborn screening (NBS) was introduced in Georgia, 41 NBS patients have been assigned to our care center. An additional 14 patients (non-NBS) have been diagnosed with CF in that time. Due to the increasing number of new patients and limited time for education during a routine clinic visit, our care center staff developed a program called Building Blocks of Cystic Fibrosis (BBCF) as a supplement to basic CF education. Program objectives include assessing families' primary knowledge of CF, discussing concepts of CF care in more detail and increasing caregiver confidence in providing for their newly diagnosed child.",

            "text": "Methods: Each BBCF session is presented by the CF team registered dietitian, respiratory therapist, pharmacist and social worker and is two hours in duration. At the beginning of the class, caregivers are given a 10question pre-test related to CF care. The nutrition presentation describes the importance of nutrition and its relation to lung function, basics of CF digestion, absorption, treatment with enzymes, importance of fat soluble vitamins and high calorie, high protein diet. The respiratory therapist covers potential treatments, how inhaled medications are administered, the rationale for airway clearance, the importance of proper cleaning and maintenance of equipment, and an outline of pulmonary function testing. The pharmacist discusses CF medications, including bronchodilators, mucous thinners, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, pancreatic enzymes, vitamins and acid suppression therapy. The need for brand name pancreatic enzymes is emphasized, as is the importance of avoiding cough suppressants. Finally, the social worker discusses team roles and clinic dynamics, as well as resources that are available for CF families, including resources on grief and loss. In order to determine the effectiveness of this multidisciplinary educational program, a 12-question satisfaction survey is given at the end of the class to evaluate both the presenters and the material provided.Results: Since October 2009, 20 caregivers representing 10 families have completed the class. All caregivers completed the pre-test, and the average score was 92.5 out of 100. Additionally, 12 caregivers completed the post-class survey; 97% of survey respondents indicated \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" on the 12 satisfaction measures, indicating high caregiver satisfaction with the class and confidence in providing care for the newly diagnosed CF patient.Conclusion: The BBCF program has been well received by patient families and staff, and we have met our initial objectives. The pre-test results suggest that many caregivers understand basic CF care principles. BBCF builds on that knowledge and further prepares caregivers. Goals to further develop the caregiver education program include assessing retention of material taught during the class and developing a refresher course for existing patients called Stepping Stones of Cystic Fibrosis. frequency of delivery per day, efficacy, maintenance of nebulizers, and easyto-use feeling).Results: The mean age of the patients (49.5% males) was 26 years. Sixty-five percent of patients considered that they had moderate and stable CF. Ninety-three percent were daily treated with nebulizations.RhDNase wa used in 95%, 83% used inhaled colimycine, 80% inhaled tobramycine, 46% hypertonic saline. Most of them already stopped treatment because of a feeling of inefficiency, or deleterious effect, but treatment was re-initiated in 55% of them because of a decrease in lung function. Fifty-nine percent of patients described an ongoing benefit with their treatment, 28% no daily benefit, and 14% side effects.Eighty-five reported that the treatment was easy to manage except for colimycine, and during holidays. Nevertheless, 64% of the patients treated with RhDnase said they take their treatment every day versus 60% for inhaled antibiotics, and 43% for hypertonic saline serum.Seventy percent of the patients declared they clean their nebulizer every day, and 7% only once a month or never. Thirty percent of patients never used soap. Confusion was perceptible between cleaning and sterilization of the nebulizer.Patients considered they were well informed about inhaled treatments.Physicians were more optimistic about potential efficacy of nebulised therapies than the patients, but were pessimistic about compliance and ease of use.Conclusion: This study confirms the need for clear and unvarying information, an adequate education explaining the purpose of each treatment. This should improve the patient adherence and management of such a chronic treatment.Supported by Roche Inc., Neuilly, France.

            "text": "A survey was developed within the model published by Cabana et al. (2) , a framework designed to assess how knowledge level and attitudes towards a given set of guidelines impact guideline adherence.Of the 159 responses received from physicians practicing in CF centers, 65% were directors of their respective centers. Directors see an average of 14 patients with CF per week; non-directors see an average of 10 per week.Findings from this study suggest that the guideline recommendations were generally well received by a majority of both director and non-director physicians treating patients with CF at CF centers. Outcomes expectancy varied with the specific recommendations; better outcomes were expected with the chronic use of inhaled tobramycin and dornase alfa than inhaled hypertonic saline or azithromycin. Neither group found it difficult to decide when to initiate any of the four therapies, although use of inhaled hypertonic saline was perceived as more difficult than the other recommendations. Respondents who did not fully agree with these recommendations were most likely to cite lack of clinical evidence as the reason for lack of agreement. Future efforts to disseminate evidence for the specific recommendations may be warranted to reinforce and improve adherence. Highlighting key recommendations in combination with underlying evidence-base and data demonstrating a favorable impact on outcomes may help overcome the limited resistance to using these valuable resources.This study was supported by Novartis and assisted by the CF Foundation. 1 Background: For 50 years, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) has worked to ensure that people with CF and their families benefit from the best possible clinical care, in addition to scientific and clinical research. In 2002, the CF Foundation launched a national strategic initiative to accelerate the rate of improvement in CF care. This initiative has resulted in the following: Learning and Leadership Collaboratives (LLC), Benchmarking, Data Transparency, and Mentoring Programs. Mentoring involves teaching and the application of learning to the clinical setting. It is a relationship that pairs an experienced colleague (mentor) and a new or new to role (apprentice) professional.Purpose: The purpose of the CF Respiratory Therapy (RT) Mentoring Program is to provide resources and information for respiratory therapists new to CF with the desired goal of improving the quality of care delivered.Development: The CF RT Mentoring Program began in 2008 with the development of the program's \"RT 101\" document and pilot program. The 101 document is a comprehensive review of the respiratory care delivered to CF patients. After successful completion of the pilot program, the Mentoring Metric was developed as a tool to measure the CF RT's knowledge base. It is used to quantify the benefits of partnering an apprentice with a well established RT and their CF center.Process: \u2022 The Metric, or knowledge base measuring tool, consists of 13 questions that are pulled from the RT 101 document and the answers are scored using the following modified Likert rating scale:Strongly disagree: -2 Disagree: -1 Agree: 1 Strongly agree: 2 Not covered: Blank \u2022 Apprentices complete a pre-visit metric and after visiting their mentor's CF center, they re-evaluate their knowledge base by completing a postvisit metric.\u2022 Mentors complete a post-visit metric that scores their perception of the apprentice's knowledge base after the visit. The apprentice's and mentor's post-visit metrics are compared for agreement on the level of acquired knowledge.Measurement definitions and scoring computations were developed for the above responses and ratings.Conclusions: To date, there have been 22 completed paired metrics and 5 remaining scheduled apprentice visits.\u2022 Apprentice pre-visit metric is used as a tool for identifying areas of strength and weakness, which can guide/aid in establishing improvement goals for the mentoring site visit.\u2022 Goal of visit: Try to make every apprentice pre-visit rating/assessment that is a Disagree (i.e., the apprentice feels they do not possess the skill) an Agree (a \"New Competency\").\u2022 We found a high degree of agreement between mentors and apprentices.\u2022 All of the apprentices demonstrated improvement in one or more areas. Eighty percent (182/227) of the time there was agreement about Improvements (including New Competencies).\u2022 Eighteen of 22 apprentices demonstrated New Competencies (79%, 75/95, of survey responses) that were agreed upon by mentor.\u2022 Apprentice-Mentor Competencies Disagreement is used as an action item(s) for follow-up. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a demanding multi-system chronic disease. Optimal control requires patients and their families to become expert CF selfmanagers. Self-management (SM) includes monitoring and treatment behaviors (Bartholomew LK, et al. Patient Educ Counsel. 1993; 22:15-25) . Evaluation of the CF Family Education Program (CF FEP) showed positive results compared to usual care in health status, knowledge, SM behaviors, and coping (Bartholomew LK, et al. Health Educ Behav. 1997; 24(5) :652-66). The CF FEP is designed to provide training in CF SM with materials for parents, young children, elementary children and teens. It is a self-paced print curriculum based on social cognitive theory. This study describes updates to the CF FEP and its performance objectives in light of advances in CF medical care and to make use of web-based dissemination and better integration of SM concepts.",

Revisions included the addition of new therapies, newborn screening, infection control, and more content on objective monitoring such as pulmonary function and glucose tolerance tests. The Communication and Coping parent modules were integrated into a new Becoming a CF Manager module. Using Self-regulation Theory, the content is organized around a SM framework -Watch & Discover, Think & Act to guide monitoring, decision-making, problem-solving and communication. Watch & Discover to find CF related health or quality of life problems early and Think & Act to treat and manage problems. Interactive worksheets and the glossary were expanded and refined. More role model stories, CF written action plans, and use of a CF travel folder were added. New graphics have been added such as the relation between body mass index and lung function and rating exercise exertion. All materials are formatted to allow for web-based access and printing. All updates are reviewed by multi-disciplinary CF health care team members, CF parents, and the CF Foundation Education Committee. Developmentally appropriate patient materials for the three age groups will be reviewed and updated as well.Conclusion: The CF Family Education Program will continue to serve as a valuable tool to promote CF SM skill development for CF patients and families. Watch & Discover, Think & Act embodies principles of self regulation and can help guide monitoring and decision-making to address new CF related problems and to judge the effectiveness of treatment.
