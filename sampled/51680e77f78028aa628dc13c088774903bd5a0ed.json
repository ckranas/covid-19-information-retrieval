Venous to arterial carbon dioxide difference (Pv-aCO 2 ) could reflect the adequacy of blood flow during shock states. However, time-course of Pv-aCO 2 and their relationship with organ dysfunction has not been widely characterized. We proposed to describe the association between Pv-aCO 2 evolution during early phases of resuscitation and multiorgan dysfunction in septic shock. METHODS. Patients with a new septic shock episode admitted to ICU were included. Early resuscitation and general management were guided according Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations. Time 0 (T0) was set when a central venous catheter was inserted to guide reanimation. We draw blood samples for arterial-venous gases at T0 and 6 h after (T6). Pv-aCO 2 was calculated as the difference between venous CO 2 and arterial CO 2 . A value of Pv-aCO 2 [ 6 was considered as high. SOFA score at day-2 and day-3 were described for 4 groups: 1. Persisting high Pv-aCO 2 (high at T0 and T6) 2. Increasing Pv-aCO 2 (normal at T0, high at T6) 3. Decreasing Pv-aCO 2 (high at T0, normal at T6) 4.Persistently low (normal at T0 and T6). Evolution over time was assessed by analysis of variance followed by a Student's t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS. Sixty septic shock patients were analyzed. Mortality rate was 36.7%. There were no differences in the amount of fluids or vasoactive dose administered at T0 and T6. No significant differences in ScvO 2 for the 4 groups at T0 were found (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.68). Patients with persistent high Pv-aCO 2 at T0 and T6 had a significant higher SOFA score at Day-2 and Day-3 than patients with normal Pv-aCO 2 at T0 and T6 (one-Way ANOVA, day-2: p = 0.03; day-3: p \\ 0.01) (Figs. 1, 2). CONCLUSION. Persistence of high Pv-aCO 2 difference during the early reanimation of septic shock is related to significant higher multiorgan dysfunction. Pv-aCO 2 could be used as perfusion goal during early phases of resuscitation of septic shock. 18) , 583 (55%) were male. The mean MET score was 5.9 (SD 2.2).

In October 2008 a Medical Emergency Team (MET) was set up in our 770 bedded hospital, driven by the realisation that our acutely ill patients needed to be rapidly identified and reviewed.

On average the MET team is at the bed-side for 30 min during a mid-week daytime call and 60 min out-of hours. Survival to discharge data was analysed after dividing patients into 4 main groups, based on whether they remained on the ward, (with or without a DNAR order), were admitted to a high dependency unit or were admitted to ICU.Admission to a level 2 or 3 area was considered a surrogate marker of a reversible critical illness in a patient with potential for recovery. 30 patients were admitted to ICU following the target MET call, of which 19 (63%) survived to discharge from hospital. 85 patients went to level 2 care (high dependency) of which 51 (60%) were discharged from hospital. Of 552 patients who stayed on the ward with no DNAR or critical care admission at the time of the target MET call, 292 (52%) were discharged from hospital.

We are now targeting further educational programmes to feedback information to parent teams. Anecdotal evidence suggests the high mortality amongst patients who remain on the ward without DNAR order reflect the it not only contains relatively well patients with minor physiological abberations but also a significant proportion of patients in whom the MET felt survival was unlikely and escalation of treatment would not influence outcome. INTRODUCTION. Sepsis is common in hospitalised patients and contributes to morbidity and mortality. Severe sepsis is associated with an in-patient mortality of approximately 40%. Hospital Medical Emergency Teams (MET) were introduced to identify and treat acutely unwell ward patients in order to reduce serious adverse events. We hypothesised that the MET might play a role in triaging septic patients. Accordingly, we performed a retrospective observational study to evaluate what proportion of MET calls was associated with septic patients, and their disposition after MET review.",

Table 1 summarizes major epidemiological findings after exclusion of patients with limitations of medical treatments (LOMT) in non septic MET patients and in septic patients. The three most common MET triggers in septic patients were respiratory distress, multiple physiological derangements and neurologic impairment, accounting for more than three quarters of activations in septic patients. Fluid resuscitation was performed in 44 patients, vasopressors were used in 13 patients. Non-invasive ventilation was commenced in 10 patients. Pneumonia was the most common cause of sepsis and it was diagnosed in 45 patients. INTRODUCTION. Respiratory mechanics are monitored at the bedside and provide useful information about disease evolution and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Ventilatory settings are adjusted in order to ameliorate patient-ventilator synchrony. In this interaction, the role of the Endotracheal Tube (ETT) Resistance (R ETT ) is often overlooked, since traditionally pressure is measured from the Y-piece of the ventilatory circuit. The issue of R ETT has been evaluated in the past years through several methods, among which the rapid end-inspiratory occlusion method was not included.",

Following approval of the local ethics committee, we studied 54 postoperative ventilated cardiac surgery patients after alveolar derecruitment, i.e. open endotracheal suctioning, and alveolar recruitment (RM). Patients were ventilated with biphasic positive airway pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH 2 O, and a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg. All patients received a standard suctioning procedure with disconnection of the ventilator (20 s, 14 F catheter, 200 mmHg negative pressure). The patients were randomized into two groups, receiving either a RM (PEEP 15 mbar, PIP 35-40 mbar for 30 s, group RM) or no RM, in which ventilation was resumed without a RM (group NRM). Measurements were conducted at the following time points: Baseline (T1), after suctioning (T2), after RM or NRM (T3), and 15 and 30 min after T3 (T4 and T5). We measured FRCO 2 using the oxygen washout technique (LUFU System, Dr\u00e4ger Medical AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) [3] . By means of EIT (EIT Evaluation kit, Dr\u00e4ger Medical AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) we measured global impedance tidal variation (TV) and end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI). FRC EIT was calculated in two ways: 1. at each time point using TV and simultaneous measured tidal volume (V T ): FRC EIT_Vt = EELI 9 V T /TV; and 2. using absolute FRC values at T1: FRC EIT_T1 = EELI Tx 9 FRCO 2 (T1)/EELI(T1). FRC EIT_Vt and FRC EIT_T1 were compared with FRCO 2 using Bland-Altman analysis. OBJECTIVES.

There was a weak positive correlation between BG variability and APACHE II scores, APACHE II risk of death and both renal and neurological support days. There was no effect upon mortality. This may be explained by insufficient sample size and the use of robust non-parametric analysis, both of which may have under-powered this study. These findings are in contrast to recent evidence [1, 2] . [1] there was a move to tight glucose control in critically ill patients with anticipation of a reduction in mortality. Many centres were unable to replicate the results leading to the international, multi-centre randomized control trial, NICE-SUGAR, comparing intensive versus conventional glucose control in critically ill patients [2] . This showed a statistically significant increase in mortality in patients managed with intensive glucose control. A meta-anlysis has shown an increased risk of hypoglycaemia with intensive insulin control and no overall mortality benefit [3] . Consequently many have returned to more conventional glucose control. Evidence supports standardisation of intravenous insulin therapy to improve efficiency and safety of blood glucose control in critically ill patients [4] .",

Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is one of the most serious acute complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of HHS is smaller than diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), mostly it affects elderly people and it might be the first manifestation of undiagnosed DM. Unlike DKA (mortality rate \\ 5%), mortality rate in HHS is reported higher (5-20%), mostly due to comorbidities [2] . The treatment of HHS can cause cerebral oedema, slow correction of metabolic disturbance is crucial to avoid a possibly fatal complication. The highest so far reported plasma glucose level in a diabetic patient is 106 mmol/l (1,909 mg/dl) in a diabetic patient with HHS [3] . The absolutely highest reported plasma glucose level is 311.3 mmol/l (5,600 mg/dl), it was published in 1990-a case of a young man presenting after drinking 12 l of coca cola, six cans of pineapple juice, several liters of orange juice and sugared water in a hot weather [1] .",

The nurse in charge of the unit was surveyed using a predefined questionnaire. The questions assessed current practice with regards to IIT for Intensive Care patients. Unpaired t tests were used for statistical analysis. Very few have abandoned a policy for IIT. However, overall there has been a significant relaxation of target ranges and higher target limits for blood glucose, suggesting that whilst there is continued confidence in the merits of IIT, practice is changing in response to recent research. INTRODUCTION. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients requiring cardiac surgery is rapidly increasing. These patients have higher perioperative morbidity and mortality, significantly reduced long-term survival, and less freedom from recurrent episodes of angina. The postoperative care is complicated by the glucose control regimes maintaining optimal levels of blood glucose and avoiding the harmful effects of hypoglycaemia. Trials examining the effects of tighter glucose control have had conflicting results. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also led to differing conclusions and there is currently no clearly defined optimal blood glucose level peri operatively.",

Oxygen saturation gradients among different territories (as central to mixed venous circulations) are widely known and, recently, lactate gradients between central to mixed venous circulation were also described. Little is known about the pathophysiological meaning of these gradients, but their role may be a key understanding factor in how progression of organic dysfunctions develops in intensive care patients. Glucose, besides a central energetic source to live organisms, may not be a preferential ATP substrate to all tissues or organs as occurs with cardiomyocytes. Therefore, regional differences in glycemic concentrations may exist and their behavior may contribute to our understanding about cell death and organ disfunction in shock and hypoxia states.",

Other complications include anaphylaxis, malignant hyperthermia, prolonged paralysis, bradycardia, raised intracranial pressure, raised intraocular pressure and myalgia. Critical care patients are much more vulnerable to an unpredictable hyperkalaemic response and it is not confined to patients with burns, neuromuscular disorders, renal failure and/or severe muscle trauma but septic patients as well.

The median SAPS2 score was 46 (43-76) and their median duration of mechanical ventilation was 31 days (25-72). All patients had a peripheric paralysis confirmed in electromyography. In five cases the tongue paralysis was associated with others cranial nerves block whose three with an homolateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (Tapia's syndrome). The aetiology of the paralysis was obvious in three cases: two Tapia's syndrome due to an homolateral jugular thrombosis after a central venous jugular catheter and one post infectious Guillain-Barre syndrome. In the sevenother cases, we found three ICU acquired neuromyopathy and two HSV seroconversion without any clinical sign of infection. For two patients, we were not able to find any abnormality that could be related to the isolated tongue paralysis. One year after discharged, seven patients had a complete recovery.",

Because of the unexpected significant incidence reported in this study, we suggest that a systematic clinical evaluation of cranial nerves (specially hypoglossus) should be associated with the currently performed swallowing test for further SD studies. [1] . OBJECTIVE. To determine hospital mortality and associated risk factors of unselected, ventilated patients in reference to the treating institution. METHODS. In a sub-study from the 2nd International Study on Mechanical Ventilation (ISMV) [2] , ventilated patients who had been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in May 2004 in Germany were included, if ventilated for more than 12 h invasively or at least 1 h non-invasively. Patients were compared for treatment in a non-university hospital (NUH) or university hospital (UH), and analysed separately for having developed ARDS (NUH: n = 111; UH: n = 87) or no ARDS (NUH: n = 357; UH: n = 473). Multivariable logistic regression was performed separately for the patient group with or without ARDS to define risk factors independently associated with increased hospital mortality. Both models included the same variables concerning the setting of care (e.g. hospital-and ICU-size, NUH, UH), baseline factors (e.g. age, SAPS II-Score, main reason for ventilation), ventilator settings and gas exchange values averaged over the first week of ventilation or after ARDS-onset and complications occurring over the course of ventilation (e.g. sepsis, shock, acidosis, organ failures). CONCLUSION. Although the mean SAPS II scores were higher in our entire patient group with ARDS, the hospital mortality was 8% lower than in the ALIVE study [3] and 13% lower compared to ARDS patients from the other countries of the second ISMV [2] . The hospital mortality of ARDS patients was remarkably higher in NUH than in UH and, treatment in a NUH was the most important risk factor for ARDS patients but less important for patients without ARDS. (GOLD III-IV) is poor, after invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV), the hospital mortality appears to be around 50% [1] . In addition weaning can be difficult and patients may end up being ventilator-dependent [2] . Patients with severe COPD are often rejected for iMV because of a presumed difficult and prolonged weaning period and poor prognosis. However there is little evidence supporting this treatment strategy and ICU treatment has improved over the last decade.",

Primary diagnosis at admission was exacerbation COPD in 44%, exacerbation COPD plus cardiac failure in 20%, pneumonia and sepsis in 36%. A previous history of congestive heart failure was present in 37%, 23% used oxygen at home and 32% were housebound. The ICU mortality was 12% and hospital mortality 16%.

Barotrauma is a feared complication of mechanical ventilation and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality 1 . Incidence of barotrauma in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to range between 0 [2] to 76% [3] . Many authors recognize that experimental pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome are not identical, with different response to ventilatory therapies [4] .",

They were randomizad into two groups: a group control, where PEEP was set according to the FiO 2 applied as in the ARDS-Network study [6] , or a interventional group, where PEEP was set according to the method proposed for Suter [1] , which consist in setting PEEP level according to static compliance. In both groups PEEP level was set daily [7] . We defined organ failure as a punctuation of 3 or 4 in the Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assesment (SOFA) [8] , and number of organ failure-free days to day 28 as the number of days alive and free of organ failure at day 28. CONCLUSIONS. IAH is common in MV patients. APP seems to be a better outcome predictor than IAP. Maximal, mean and the trend in EVLWi values correlated well with outcome. We hypothesize that there is a strong correlation between capillary leak (CLI and PVPI), positive fluid balance, increased IAP, increased EVLWi and organ failure with poor prognosis. Future studies should look at the effect of aiming for a negative fluid balance on these parameters. CONCLUSIONS. We report the interim results of the largest multicentre study on the epidemiology of IAP and APP. IAH occurs frequently in MV patients and is associated with longer MV, ICU and hospitalization periods, but not with higher mortality. On the other hand, APP below 55 mmHg is associated with significantly higher 28-day mortality, but is often related to a low MAP rather than a high IAP. The APP increases less over time in patients with IAH during their first week in ICU. INTRODUCTION. Extubation failure is common in intensive care unit and has been associated with poor outcomes like increased morbity, higher costs, higher ICU length stay and mortality. These adverse outcomes highlight the importance of predictors of extubation failure.",

The mortality of ALI/ARDS is comparable of the mortality of large randomized controlled trials, which shows that lung protective ventilation strategies are well embedded in our daily clinical practice. Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant nosocomial infection. There are several devices now available that have been recommended to reduce its incidence. These include silver coated 1 and continuous sub-glottic drainage [2] endotracheal tubes. These devices incur a cost which has to be offset by the economic savings that could be made by prevention of VAP. OBJECTIVES. We undertook a retrospective audit in an Adult ICU of a London teaching hospital over a 6 month period to determine the incidence and costs of antimicrobial therapy in patients developing VAP. The cost of antibiotics used for treating patients with a positive BAL was \u20ac6,868.36, or \u20ac236.84 per episode [3] . As expected, patients who had VAP will use up more resources than those with a significant BAL only. Endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff inflation provides a mechanical barrier to the passage of oral contents into the trachea and subsequently reduces the risk of pulmonary aspiration. The integrity of this seal is related to ETT cuff pressure and therefore to the ability of the cuff to reduce aspiration. ETT cuff pressure should be maintained between 20 and 30 cmH2O to reduce the risks of aspiration and tracheal mucosal damage [1] . Aspiration has been reported at cuff pressures up to 60 cmH2O [2] . OBJECTIVES. We compared three different designs of Mallinckrodt ETTs: Hi-Lo \u00d2 (polyvinyl chloride, barrel shaped cuff), SealGuard TM (polyurethane, tapered cuff) and Taperguard TM (polyvinyl chloride, tapered cuff).",

OBJECTIVES. Aim of our paper was to confirm the effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as bridge to recover in patients suffering of fulminant respiratory failure due to H1N1 infection. METHODS. From October 2009 through January 2010, 16 patients were referred to our ICU because of severe ARDS secondary to virus A/H1N1 infection; in 12 cases ECMO was required as rescue therapy [3] . Among patients requiring extracorporeal oxygenation, three were pregnant or recently post partum women; one patient was bearing twins siblings. In one case our ECMO team had to place the extracorporeal support in the referring Institute [4, 5] . RESULTS. All three patients after a mean of 16 days were weaned from ECMO and required percutaneous tracheostomy to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. The pregnant woman had the cesarean delivery done while still on ECMO. The mean LOS was 37 days; all patients were discharged home in good general conditions and not requiring oxygen supply. None of the four newborns got flu infection; all infants required NICU admission; invasive mechanical ventilation was necessary for the infant born while the mother was on ECMO support. CONCLUSIONS. ECMO treatment is still a debatable therapeutic option for refractory respiratory failure in adults because of results and costs [6] . Our very small case series demonstrates ECMO to be an efficacious bridge to recover, despite an underlying clinical condition burdened by mortality of 80% or greater. ECMO treatment should be considered in high specialized centers to reach such good results. The next future will rely on so advanced and biocompatible extracorporeal oxygenation technology that this therapeutic option might be validated for increasing numbers of ICUs and might become so popular such as CRRT is now.

H1N1 infection was therefore expected to have a higher than average impact. There is no provision in Wales for ECMO but the tertiary hospital (UHW) does provide a HFOV and NO service. HFOV was planned as primary rescue for refractory hypoxaemia rather than ECMO but at the discretion of the on-site clinician. A proforma for referral for HFOV was used and was very similar to the ECMO referral proforma for Leicester. H1N1 infection came in two waves with the first wave predominantly affecting two hospitals and the second wave affecting all. Despite a vaccination programme, with a good uptake, between the first and second wave the requirement for critical care services was high. This likely reflects a population at higher than average risk of severe complications of infection. Despite this, mortality was low with a comparatively lower use of ECMO and the use of HFOV and NO as primary rescue therapy for refractory hypoxaemia.",

Functional hemodynamic variables (pulse pressure variation-PPV; stroke volume variation-SVV; systolic pressure variation-SPV) have been constantly used to evaluate hemodynamic status and fluid responsiveness in the ICU. However, during conditions into which respiratory system compliance may vary, such as Acute Lung Injury (ALI), the role of these parameters to evidence fluid responsiveness is less understood.

Graphical depiction of the patient's position in relation to clinician-determined pressure and flow targets within a ''state'' diagram allows continuous appreciation of the next therapeutic course to target.

To evaluate the graphical volume, resistance and heart performance guidance of the Navigator TM cardiovascular decision support system in high risk perioperative patients undergoing major surgery. METHODS. Continuous sampling from patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures of cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were processed by the Navigator TM and displayed as result of heart efficiency, vasomotor tone and volume state. These three parameters are amenable to intervention to reach physician set targets of CO (or DO 2 I) and MAP. A clinical example of pharmacological intervention is demonstrated in terms of the cardiovascular parameters. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) variability is lowered by sedation and is almost absent in brain death patient.

The concept of goal-directed hemodynamic therapy should be the basis of hemodynamic intervention in intensive care medicine. In the last decade parameters such as stroke volume variation (SVV), centralvenous oxygenation (ScvO 2 ), cardiac index (CI) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) have been used increasingly to monitor adequate hemodynamic treatment. However, it still remains challenging to identify patients with assumed adequate circulatory status quantified by the parameters above that suffer from microcirculatory hypoperfusion.

METHODS. 43 patients (pts) having various degrees of sepsis admitted to Critical Care Department at Cairo University from October 2007 to February 2009 were recruited in the study, in addition to ten healthy volunteers served as a control group for BNP, cTn-I levels and echocardiographic parameters. All pts were subjected to APACHE II, SOFA score O/A and day 2, echocardiography O/A, as well as BNP and cTn-I sampling O/A, and day 2. The studied pts were divided into group I with sepsis (23pts, 12 males; mean age 46.7 \u00b1 21 year) and group II with severe sepsis and septic shock (20 pts, 11 males; mean age 54.6 \u00b1 17 year). RESULTS. BNP level O/A was significantly higher in group I and group II than control (p = 0.048); BNP level on day 2 was significantly higher in group II than group I (p = 0.004). cTn-I in day 2 was higher in group II than control (p \\ 0.001).

Recent research has evaluated potential therapies but has not addressed a fundamental problem: in whom is it worth to perform a microcirculatory assessment? In fact, the place of microcirculatory monitoring has not been established, nor a specific subpopulation with higher probability of presenting severe derangements has been identified. Our aim was to evaluate potential risk factors associated with the finding of severe microcirculatory flow abnormalities.",

Mortality was 63.4% in our infected patients despite early initiation of appropriate antibiotics and this was more than the predicted mortality based on APACHE IV scores [2] . MDR forms of Acinetobactor are a known independent risk factor for mortality [3] . Newer early diagnostic techniques and treatments are needed. To reduce CDI, a reduction in the use of ceftriaxone was advocated. However, this has been the first line antimicrobial for many patients with severe sepsis admitted to our ICU. Hence, there is pressure to change our antimicrobial policy despite conflicting studies regarding the risk of CDI in relation to specific antimicrobials 1 . The ICU is a nine-bedded, adult, mixed surgical/medical unit in a district general hospital. Our practice is to use broad spectrum drugs, then de-escalate after microbiological results and avoid prolonged courses of antimicrobials.",

Patients with known MRSA prior to ICU admission and those with a positive test within the first 48 h were excluded. Patients who became MRSA-positive 48 h after admission were included as new acquisitions. Bed occupancy was based upon the number of hours patients were nursed on ICU each day, and was summed and expressed as a percentage of the maximum available (i.e. 24 9 9 = hours per day 9 maximum number of beds). Bed availability changed during the study period and is accounted for in the analysis. High occupancy was defined as greater than 87.5% as used in a previous study [1] . When occupancy exceeded 100%, patients were nursed elsewhere in the hospital until an ICU bed was available. The ICU layout remained the same throughout the study period, with no reduction in bed spacing when occupancy was high. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. We would also like to thank Suzanne Lloyd for her statistical input. METHODS. At a given day ICU surfaces were screened and included ventilator tube surfaces, bedrails, bedside monitors, cardiograms, dressing trolleys, sinks, telephones, wall oxygen humidifiers etc. Environmental sites were cultured by using sterile cotton swabs inoculated into thioglucolate broth and were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. At the same day, hand impressions were taken from all ICU staff and also blood, bronchial secretions and urine were cultured from all patients. Microorganism identification was performed by the VITEK-II method and susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion testing according CLSI. Some were further evaluated by E-test.

Human plasma is used to replace moderate coagulation factor deficiency e.g. due to acute bleeding. For some years a pool plasma treated with a solvent/detergent step for virus inactivation is available on the market (Octaplas, Octapharma GmbH, Germany) that is associated with a reduced risk of transfusion related lung injury [1] . Recently, a new plasma (Octaplas LG, Octapharma GmbH, Germany) was introduced to the market, which is treated with a modified solvent/detergent step and additionally treated with a prion removal step (ligand gel) to gain even more safety in plasma therapy [2] .",

Diaphragmatic paralysis is a non common complication of cardiac surgery that may cause further deterioration of pulmonary function, and may lead to secondary hypoxemia, prolonged ventilator use, pneumonia and atelectasis leading to increased ICU and hospital stay, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. The causes of the diaphragmatic paralysis during cardiac surgery are not clearly understood. Direct injury during harvesting of the internal mammary artery, cold injury owing to pericardial ice slush and inadvertent stretch injuries during intra-pericardial manipulation of the heart are some documented causes, but the injury may occur without an apparent reason.",

High quality performance in emergency situations is dependent upon technical and nontechnical skills. A number of national bodies recommend team training to promote good teamwork and improve the quality and safety of healthcare [1] . Simulation training offers an authentic, low-risk environment for teaching technical and teamwork skills [2] . Simulations can be delivered in many different ways from low fidelity ''part task'' simulators, to integrated fully immersive simulation environments. Immersive simulator environments are, however, extremely expensive to develop, relatively inaccessible to clinicians and trainees, and struggle to achieve realism. In recent years a new phenomenon of ''in situ'' simulation has been described, in which simulation activity takes place in a clinical setting [3] . Given that a degree of ''buy in'' is required by those undertaking simulation training, in situ simulation has great potential as the environment, equipment and team are all genuine, at a fraction of the cost.",

There has been no system in place to share information about harm associated with airway misadventure in critical care. The risks may therefore go unrecognised. The adoption of capnography into critical care may be more expensive than in anaesthetics. This is in part because of the requirement for humidification of inspired gases.

Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is nowadays an established procedure in the management of the critically ill patient. The ease of performance and the availability of bronchoscopic control contributed to its safety in the hands of experienced operators and to its widespread acceptance. Routine post-procedural chest X-ray (CXR) has been used as a standard means of quality control for a long time. However, retrospective chart reviews and prospective observational studies have concluded that routine radiologic control is unnecessary. However, prospective randomised studies have not yet been published.",

In South West England geographical distances have meant that many children are initially managed in general/adult intensive care units (ICUs). These children are then transferred to a central specialist paediatric intensive care (PICU) or remain in the general/adult ICU if stable, and if likely to be discharged within 24 h. Transfer is usually by a centralised specialist service.",

It is more difficult to see these patients in the follow-up because they have a higher morbid-mortality rate. This is a retrospective study of a single ICU. Among patients aged 75 or over who were selected to ICU admission, survivors reported significantly more problems only on the physical dimensions. These findings should encourage the admission of elderly patients in the ICU, however the results must be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample of survivors. Some of the conclusions should also be considered after adjustment to a sample of the general population matched on age. There were no differences in the presence of hyperlipidemia, previous coronary heart disease and renal disease. Women were less likely to have ST segment elevation (39 vs. 54% for men; p= 0.010). Women had a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock (Killip IV) on admission after STEMI. There were no differences in the thrombolysis in patients with STEMI. Women, after adjustment for baseline differences, did not have a different pattern of access to coronary angiography (in both ST elevation and non-ST elevation ACS), but men had greater frequency of percutaneous coronary revascularization (50.87 vs. 34.65%; p \\ 0.010). Normal coronary arteries were much more common in women (20 vs. 5.6% in men; p = 0.001). Women were more likely to develop a higher in-hospital HF (32, 67 vs. 25, 94%; p \\ 0.05) and in-hospital mortality (17.64 vs. 4.78%; p \\ 0.001). Mortality at 1 year were similar for women and men (40.48 vs. 33.21%; p = 0.221).

            "text": "CONCLUSIONS. We confirm the wide variability in outcome among hospitals even after adjusting for severity, but found no relationship between ICU volume and outcome. The universal intensivist coverage in our healthcare system may explain these results. Welch reported data from a UK national database (ICNARC) suggesting increased mortality with increasing deprivation in general ICU [1] and elective surgery [2] . Latour [3] explained his findings of excess mortality in the socially disadvantaged because they were sicker. Triggers for ICU admission are beyond the control of the intensivist. In order to assess social prejudice within the ICU itself, we examined SOFA scores on discharge or death as unlike APACHE scoring, SOFA provides 'sickness' data throughout a patients ICU stay. OBJECTIVES. To examine whether prejudice exists in our ICU by testing whether patients from poorer backgrounds have different SOFA scores upon discharge or death. METHODS. We examined 9,740 admissions ([3 days) between April 2000 and August 2009. In addition to admission and discharge SOFA, we examined age, sex, LOS, admission type (elective, emergency or transfer). The Carstairs index is a measure of social deprivation divided by postcode. For ease of analysis, Carstairs data were grouped into quintiles (1 = patients from poorest background). Data were analysed using Generalised Estimated Equations as there is interdependency between factors. RESULTS. Factors associated with changes in SOFA were admission type (p\\0.001), LOS (p\\0.001), age (p = 0.017) and admission SOFA (p\\0.001). Sex and Carstairs quintile were not significant. There was no difference between the group of patients who died and the patients who survived. Although raw mortality rates were lowest in Carstairs Quintile 1 and 2, these were not statistically significant once other factors had been considered (OR 0.95, CI = 0.85 to 1.1, p = 0.87) CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that social status does not influence withdrawal of therapy or discharge. Patients were more likely to have a higher SOFA score on discharge if they had had elective surgery and were younger. INTRODUCTION. The recording of date and accurate time for entries in patient case notes is an essential part of documentation with implications for ongoing medical interventions, case note reviews, audits and not least for medico-legal proceedings. Time accuracy is even more important in acutely ill patients where a great number of medical interventions are carried out in a short space of time with effective treatment dependent on delivery at exact points. The timing of critical procedures is often subject to intense scrutiny to assure delivery of the highest standard of care. The recognition of the role of hand hygiene in the reduction of hospital acquired infections resulted in a ban of wristwatches for medical staff in England. Teams delivering medical care for critically ill patients therefore rely on the accurate time being displayed by wall mounted clocks and monitors.",

Overall mortality rate was 30.5% and the reoperation rate was 22%.Among those who had a reoperation the case fatality rate was 77%.The mortality rate and reoperation rate increased progressively with increasing numbers of the score. Elevated levels of arterial lactate at admission is significantly (p \\ 0.05) associated with higher reoperation and mortality. The higher the score at admission the greater the duration of mechanical ventilation and the stay in ICU. The ability of the APACHE II score and HVP score in predicting mortality in this group were compared using ROC curves. The APACHE II (AUC 0.781 \u00b1 0.064, p = 0.001, at a value of 12 there was 68% specificity and 70% sensitivity) was found to predict mortality accurately while the HVP score (AUC 0.515 \u00b1 0.078 p = 0.84) did not, in this group of patients.

Compared with the modified POSSUM score, the modified SOFA score was more simple and useful for predicting hospital mortality in elderly patients requiring emergency surgery for CP. CONCLUSIONS. The evidence of huge discrepancy between Dr Foster's spell and actual hospital ICU admission rate suggest a lack of validation of data used by Dr Foster for ICU patients. This lack of accuracy renders HSMR for ICU using Dr Foster's tool meaningless for majority of London hospital. We believe that the lack of completeness (coding of procedure and diagnosis, co-morbilities) and the quality of the data acquired by Dr Foster could cause unexpected departmental stigma and unnecessary concern to patients. INTRODUCTION. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are common causes of intensive care unit (ICU) admission. However, patient profile and ICU resources utilization vary worldwide. This makes crude morbidity and mortality comparisons between patients or different ICUs difficult. Prognostic models are necessary to accurately predict patients' outcomes, as benchmark for ICUs performance and for comparisons between units. Nowadays there are two kinds of prognostic models: ''non-specific'' models, like APACHE and SAPS, which were developed in a wide variety of patients, including those with ACS, and ''specific'' models, like GRACE, which was developed exclusively in a large cohort of ACS patients.",

Endothelial cell is a front-rank target during ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) phenomenons that occur during shock states. Ischemic phase leads to energetic failure whereas reperfusion phase involves burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may be deleterious for cellular integrity. Epinephrine is frequently administered during shock state and could worsen I/ R injuries due to its capacity to enhance metabolism while oxygen is lacking. We aimed at exploring in vitro effect of epinephrine on energy balance and intracellular ROS production in a model of endothelial cells submitted to I/R.",

This prospective study shows a significant decrease in CI and GEDVi during CVVH, regardless of catheter position, while EVLWi increased. We hypothesize that this may be due (amongst other causes) to the relative position of CVL and dialysis catheters. Patient management should be based on parameters obtained without CVVH (ideally before start or after restitution). Moreover, irrespective of CVVH, PiCCO calibration via a femoral CVL increases CI, EVLWi and GEDVi significantly and thus cannot be recommended. We hypothesize that this may be influenced by IAP and venous return hence altering mean transit times. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm ARF as an independent factor for mortality. We found no differences in mortality related to fluid therapy, use of diuretics, or continuous versus intermittent RRT. We found no benefits for high flow RRT, but higher mortality for early RRT compared to standard timing. Earlier studies have demonstrated that that the requirement for renal replacement is in itself a risk factor for poor outcome in Intensive care.Primary pathology, severity of critical illness, requirement for respiratory support and vassopressors are independent risk factors for poor outcome in patients requiring renal support.

OBJECTIVES. We presume that long time treatment with CRRT produces high serum concentration of ionized calcium, as concentration of calcium in the dialysis bags is 1.75 mmol/l (Hemosol \u00d2 and Prismasol \u00d2 ), causing a positive balance of calcium during CRRT. In some cases substitution of those bags to 0 mmol/L calcium concentration (Prismocal \u00d2) is needed to normalize ionized calcium. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective study with patients admitted in the ICU of a tertiary care academic hospital who were treated with CRRT using commercial dialysis bags between December 2008 and November 2009, during at least 24 consecutive hours. The CRRT techniques used were veno-venous hemofiltration and hemodialysis, using a Prismaflex \u00d2 system. Bags substitution was performed when serum calcium concentration reached 1.21 mMol/L to prevent from hypercalcemia. RESULTS. 30 consecutive patients were included in the study. 60% were male, median age 66.73 (\u00b19.6), APACHE 26.57 (\u00b18.74) and SAP 52.76 (\u00b118.03), maximum ionized calcium 1.26 (\u00b10.13) and maximum total calcium 8.08 (\u00b12.14). Range of duration of CRRT was between 1 and 35 days. 50% of patients required change to dialysis bags without calcium, 80% before 6 days of CRRT. 73% of these patients presented ionized calcium over 1.25 mMol/L, 47% over 1.30 mMol/L and 27% over 1.35 mMol/L. Mortality rate was 66%, no significant differences between patients who needed bag susbstitution and patients who did not. OBJECTIVES.

The initial assessment was that one of three buildings of the hospital was fully engaged in flames. The hospital staff had already started a horizontal evacuation of approximately 70 patients from the burning building to one adjacent. When the chief emergency physician arrived on scene, he began patient triage by determining victim's conditions, and organized the scene by separation into 3 sections, (1) inhouse, (2) outside, and (3) transport section, each section lead by a physician. Additional medical personnel were requested, and a second triage was performed to update the situation. The total duration of the evacuation was 7 h 46 min. One hundred nineteen patients were triaged into internationally used categories (I = 0, II = 7, III = 112, IV/V = 0 patients). The seven patients in category II suffered smoke inhalation injury, without burns. Of the 119 patients, 29 were transferred to a different building of the hospital (horizontal evacuation), 90 were transported to other hospitals within a 30 km radius. The number of personnel used was 154 (14 emergency physicians, 19 paramedics, and 121 EMTs), using 2 mobile intensive care units, one rescue helicopter staffed with a physician, as well as 15 ambulances and 31 other vehicles from the Red Cross fleet.",

            "text": "CONCLUSIONS. Difficulties faced on scene were (1) a lack of patients' paper records, aggravating the situation by a lack of knowledge of patients history, diagnosis, and medication, and (2) the initial horizontal evacuation was confused and uncoordinated, resulting in a lack of knowledge on the amount of patients that had been evacuated by nursing staff. However, with arrival of the chief emergency physician, an established disaster plan and logistics were initiated, which proved crucial for the final success of the evacuation. The critical lessons learned from this experience, included the following: 1. appointment of a chief emergency physician; 2. appointment of section commanders; 3. adequate communication systems on-scene as well as with the dispatch center, organizing hospital beds in surrounding counties; 4. patient assignment to ambulances and helicopters; 5. identification and assignment of transport personnel responsible for patient care, and 6. triage, including patient registration. The authors encourage physicians, as essential members of the health care team, to become prepared to respond to disasters. Patients admitted in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from general wards are more severe and have a higher mortality than those admitted from emergency department as reported [1] . The majority of them develop signs of instability (e.g. tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, decreased oxygen saturation and change in conscious state) several hours before ICU admission. Considering this fact and that in-hospital cardiac arrests and unexpected deaths are usually preceded by warning signs, immediate on site intervention by specialists may be effective. This gave an impulse to medical emergency team (MET) implementation, which has been shown to decrease cardiac arrest, morbidity and mortality in several hospitals. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS. In order to verify if the same was true in our hospital and to determine if there was a need for MET, we prospectively collected all non elective ICU admissions of already hospitalized patients (general wards) and of patients remaining more than 3 h in emergency department (considered hospitalized). Instability criteria leading to MET call correspond to those described in the literature. The delay between the development of one criterion and ICU admission was registered. RESULTS. During an observation period of 12 months, 321 patients with our MET criteria were admitted to ICU. 88 patients came from the emergency department, 115 from the surgical and 113 from the medical ward. 65% were male. The median age was 65 years (range 17-89). The delay from MET criteria development to ICU admission was higher than 8 h in 155 patients, with a median delay of 32 h and a range of 8.4 h to 10 days. For the remaining 166 patients, an early MET criterion was present up to 8 h (median delay 3 h) before ICU admission. These results are quite concordant with the data reported in the literature (ref [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . 122 patients presented signs of sepsis or septic shock, 70 patients a respiratory failure, 58 patients a cardiac emergency. Cardiac arrest represent 5% of our collective of patients. CONCLUSIONS. Similar to others observations, the majority of hospitalized patients admitted on emergency basis in our ICU have warning signs lasting for several hours. More than half of them were unstable for more than 8 h. This shows there is plenty of time for early acute management by dedicated and specialized team such as MET. However, further studies are required to determine if MET implementation can reduce in-hospital cardiac arrests and influence the morbidity, the length of stay and the mortality. Trans venous pacing in the critically ill patient is commonly done for life threatening bradyarrythmias. This procedure is ideally done under fluoroscopic guidance in the cardiac catheter lab, or by the bedside with the ecg leads as a guide for placement of the transvenous pacing wire. Ultrasound guidance remains a very underused tool for emergency purposes and can be used quite effectively for the above procedure. There are also many safety issues and medicolegal issues with blind procedures in the intensive care unit. The use of ultrasound has now found mention in acls protocols(pea differential diagnosis) and also the fast/e-fast survey for a trauma patient. OBJECTIVES. To confirm that ultrasound placement of trans venous pacing wire is a safer and more definite method than previously used methods METHODS. Ultrasound machine, sonosite was used for the above linear high frequency probe was used. the pacing wire was introduced via the femoral route, jugular and subclavian route in patients views utilised-subcostal 4 chamber view, view for the inferior vena cava, apical 4 chamber view, parasternal long axis views were all used to get a better visualisation of the anatomy during the insertion process. The tip of the pacing wire in the right ventricle when visualised was taken as a successful placement. A total 14 patients were included, who presented to the ICU requiring tvp (transvenous pacing) age of patients varied from 27 to 80 years. 4 patients had complete heart block with shock, the others included all types of bradycardic rhythms and pea's 10 of the ''pacing sheaths were inserted via jugular and 4 via femoral route. Pacing was successful in all patients. 1 patient required repositioning of wire. RESULTS. Trans venous pacing under sonographic guidance was successfully performed in more than 90% of patients.",

Aguilera PA, Durham BA. INTRODUCTION. Major trauma is associated with complex hemodynamic and microcirculatory changes. Volume depletion resulting from blood loss and inflammation triggered by tissue trauma, besides the systemic tissue ischemia, are the main factors leading to these changes. Hypertonic saline hyperoncotic (HHS) and pentoxifylline has been proposed as options in the resuscitation of hemorrhagic shock, showing the effect of modulation of the inflammatory response and efficacy in the restoration of hemodynamic parameters OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the progression of inflammatory mediators and oxidative burst during 4 h after initial resuscitation in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock, with three different solutions: Ringer lactate, hypertonic hyperoncotic solution (HHS) and hypertonic hyperoncotic solution associated with pentoxifylline (PTX)",

In an experimental model of hemorrhagic shock during the observation of 4 h, hypertonic saline hyperoncotic used as a solution for volume replacement in volume 4 ml/ kg weight, shown to cause less activation of neutrophils and decreased production of inflammatory mediators when compared to Ringer's lactate.

Preeclampsia is a serious medical disorder (hypertension, proteinuria and oedema) of a pregnant with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a neuroclinical pathology expressed by cortical and subcortical changes localised in posterior regions of cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. A rapidly increased blood pressure altering autoregulation of cerebral blood flow produces cerebral oedema and ischaemia of brain tissue. Controversial issue is the use of subarachnoid block for Caesarean anaesthesia in this patients. The major concern is the low cerebral perfusion with exaggerated hypotension with onset of the block.",

The patients were evaluated by the pediatric anesthesiologist-reanimatologist (intensivist) at the time of admission and categorized due to clinical judgment by illness severity (mildly ill, moderately ill, severely ill, very severely ill or critically ill)-see Table 1 . We compared the groups depending on requirement for therapy onboard the helicopter and mortality in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS. Triage of victims in regional hospitals allows using medical helicopter for patients in severe conditions, who more often require immediate interventions and intensive therapy. Considering cost of the medical helicopter usage, it is expedient to use it primarily for interfacility transfers. INTRODUCTION.

INTRODUCTION. Since mortality of sepsis increases with the progression of the disease and early detection improves clinical course and outcome, early recognition of sepsis is of major importance [1] . Hence, there is a need for sensitive and specific diagnostic markers to identify sepsis quickly and accurately. In the recent years various new inflammatory markers have emerged, including lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), the long pentraxin (PTX3) and procalcitonin (PCT). Although early reports of the use of these biomarkers seem promising, relatively little is known about the kinetics of these hormones, especially with regard to possible differences between sexes. Females have been reported to show a more pronounced proinflammatory innate immune response. Although the gender differences in the inflammatory response are clearly recognized, there are no data on the possible differences in kinetics of the previously mentioned later markers of inflammation LBP, PTX3 and PCT.",

In model 3, the absolute number of PRBC units \\14 days old were counted for each patient and entered as an independent variable as a percent of total PRBC transfusion. Models 2 and 3 were repeated using blood age of 21 days as a break point. Dependent variables were death, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and infection.",

The patients who received hANP (hANP group) were compared with those treated before without hANP infusion as historical control (control group). Trends for serum concentration of creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) were recorded during hospital days (on ICU admission, just before hANP infusion, on ICU discharge and hospital discharge). We have investigated mortality at 30 days, renal function, the percentage of introduction for maintenance hemodialysis and ventilator free days (VFD).",

Except the percentage of ventilator use (higher rate in hANP group), there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between two groups. The mean serum concentration of creatinine in both groups exceeded 2 mg/dl and was not significantly different at ICU admission. Trends for mean serum concentration of creatinine and e-GFR improved day by day, but there were no significant differences between hANP group and control group (p=0.86 and 0.30, respectively). Furthermore there were no patients who were introduced maintenance hemodialysis in both groups. On the contrary, VFD tended to be longer in hANP group than control group (p=0.069). Univariate analysis did not identified predictors of survival, but multivariate analysis showed that hANP infusion, APACHE II and mean serum concentration of creatinine at the last time tended to be associated with 30 days mortality (odds ratio: 0.20, 1.10 and 5.45, respectively; p=0.125, 0.056 and 0.002, respectively).",

There was no difference in serum protein C level (41.5 \u00b1 15.8% vs. 44.7 \u00b1 25.5%, p=0.816) between RFO group and LFO group, respectively. There was no difference in serum procalcitonin level (43.0 \u00b1 46.8 ng/ml vs. 31.5 \u00b1 48.0 ng/ml, p=0.392) between 28-day mortality group and 28-day survival group, respectively. There was significant difference in serum protein C level (43.9 \u00b1 23.2% vs. 62.0 \u00b1 30.2%, p=0.029) between 28-day mortality group and 28-day survival group, respectively. There was significant difference between bacteremic group and non-bacteremia group in increased serum procalcitonin level ([10 ng/ ml, 84.2 vs. 26.5%, p \\ 0.001) and serum procalcitonin level (71.4 \u00b1 49.7 ng/ml vs. 20.0 \u00b1 38.6 ng/ml, p \\ 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest elevated serum procalcitonin level might predict rapidly fatal outcomes and bacteremia in septic patients. Decreased serum protein C level might predict 28-day mortality and bacteremia in septic patients. However, the case numbers could be increased for further evaluation. REFERENCE(S)",

NAC did not also show any significant effect on length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or incidence of new organ failure. In a planned subgroup analysis early NAC treatment did not affect outcome, however late administration of NAC (after 24 h of initial presentation of symptoms) was associated with increased mortality OR 1.59 95% CI 1.05-2.38. CONCLUSIONS. Overall, this meta-analysis puts serious doubt on the safety and utility of intravenous NAC as an adjuvant therapy in SIRS/sepsis. At best NAC is ineffective in reducing mortality and complications in this patient population. At worst, the sensitivity analysis suggest that it can be harmful, especially when administered later than 24 h after the onset of symptoms. Unless future RCTs provide evidence of treatment effect, clinicians should not routinely use intravenous NAC in SIRS/sepsis and academics should not promote its use",

As previous studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of Sesupplementation during septic shock [3], we hypothesized that the pre-emptive administration of Se in cardiac surgery attenuates perioperative systemic inflammation.

METHODS. 100 patients [mean age (\u00b1SD) 65 \u00b1 12 years;EuroScore: 5.8 \u00b1 3.8] who underwent cardiac surgery with the use of CPB were enrolled in this prospective open-label trial.

The safety of the product was evaluated by performing ECG and venous echoDoppler ultrasound of the lower extremities and by measuring troponin I. RESULTS. At baseline the hematoma volume was 59.2 \u00b1 27.4 and 71.5 \u00b1 32.1 ml in the rFVIIa and placebo group, respectively. Hematoma evacuation resulted in significantly smaller ICH volumes, which, however, at 18-30 h after surgery were similar in the rFVIIa and placebo group (15.9 \u00b1 14.2 ml and 18 \u00b1 15.1 ml, respectively; mean difference 2.1 ml, 95% confidence interval -12.1 to 16.2, p=0.76).

Rapid reversal of oral anticoagulation with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) is essential in acute life threatening bleeding and emergent surgery. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) has proved to reverse it faster and safer in terms of volume overload than Fresh Frozen Plasma. Although European Guidelines have approved PCC for urgent reversal of VKA, just 19% of all physicians apply PCC instead of FFP. Thromboembolic risk is their major disadvantage. Prothromplex Immuno Tim 4 contents coagulations factor II, VII, IX and X, inhibitors: Protein C, Antithrombin III and Heparin.

Driessen 1 1 VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, NetherlandsINTRODUCTION. CPR registration is often incomplete because of the hectic during resuscitation, which can result in a possible loss of data due to late registration. Records show that in 2009 there were in the Intensive Care Unit VU University medical center (VUmc), 13 CPR records directly found in the database, but there was only one mention in the written reports. This resulted in an unreliable review of the actual number of resuscitations and there was confusion about duration of CPR, given medication and executed actions. By developing a specific mode for the resuscitation in the PDMS from the ICU, you have a reliable registration of the duration of the resuscitation, which medication was given and who participated in the CPR.METHODS.MetaVision is a PDMS with the possibility of speed keys for recuscitation, making quick registration possible. This configuration has taken place within MetaVision by the functional manager of the ICU VUmc.RESULTS. The tab ''CPR'' contains a form which after pressing a start button shortcuts to a speedkey on the screen. At this point in time the recording starts and a timer pops up on the screen.

O'Donnell 1 1 NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Western Infirmary Department of Anaesthesia and ICM, Glasgow, UK INTRODUCTION. Increased centralisation and demand for critical care services in the UK is increasing pressure on Intensive Care Units (ICU) to accommodate patients when existing facilities are full. The non-clinical transfer of a critically unwell patient to another intensive care unit is sometimes required. Previous guidance from the UK Department of Health 1 and Intensive Care Society [2] has recommended each hospital should have escalation policies to prevent nonclinical transfers for capacity reasons. The decision to transfer a critically ill patient between hospitals often causes ethical dilemmas. Patients and families often voice concerns regarding such transfers.OBJECTIVES. We sought to survey lead consultants current plans for capacity problems, their opinions regarding non-clinical transfers and their experiences of complaints.METHODS.A postal questionnaire was designed to ask what contingency UK ICUs had to ventilate an extra patient, lead clinicians opinions regarding the transfer of critically ill patients and their experiences of complaints. 239 lead consultants working in UK general ICUs were surveyed.",

Central venous catheters guarantee a reliable access to the blood stream. For this reason, providing venous access in infants and children is a persistent problem. OBJECTIVES. We performed a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of the internal jugular vein catheterization using ultrasound navigation and anatomical landmarks in the Department of anesthesiology and intensive care of the Children's Republican Clinical Hospital of Tatarstan from 2008 to 2009 years. METHODS. Design of study: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical. Randomization-computer-generated table (http://www.randomization.com, seed 11564). In total, the analysis included data on 209 of the internal jugular vein catheterization. The main group (n = 107): the use of ultrasound real-time guidance in the jugular vein catheterization, control group (n = 102): catheterization vein using anatomical landmarks. The median age of patients undergoing catheterization procedure in the main group-53 months, in the control group-52 months, median weight in the main group-15 kg, in the control group 16.4 kg. All catheterization performed on the well-known Seldinger technique. In the study group, venous catheterization was carried out under direct ultrasound (U.S. navigation in real time, cross-scanning, linear, multisensor 10 MHz), in the control group used the classical technique of catheterization for anatomical landmarks. Quantitative data are expressed with mean and standard deviation, and qualitative data with percentage. Statistical significance was determined using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests.RESULTS. Successful catheterization was completed in the main group in 99.2%, in control of 65% (p = 0.00001). For one reason or another do not remove install central venous catheter in the main group: 2 cases of catheterization, in control group-36. Percentage of successful catheterization from 1 attempts: in the main-82.2% (n = 88), in control-39.2% (n = 40). The average number of attempts it took to execute the procedure was significantly lower in the group of ultrasonic real time guidance: of 1.28 \u00b1 0.07, in the group of anatomical landmarks-2.7 \u00b1 0.17 attempts (p = 0.003). The median time spent on the implementation of catheterization in the study group was 32 s, in the control group-108 s (p = 0.005). The frequency of complications (puncture of the artery) in the main group was 0.9% (n = 1), in the control group 27.4% (n = 28) (p = 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS. In order to reduce the frequency of complications, increasing the frequency of successful catheterization of the internal jugular vein catheterization in pediatric practice is advisable to use ultrasonic control. 0757 VALIDATION OF ULTRASOUND DILUTION CARDIAC OUTPUT METHOD IN CHILDREN FOLLOWING CONGENITAL HEART SURGERY A.

Average length of stay was 1.39 days. 250 (50%) patients were ventilated. 295 (60%) had arterial lines and 145 (31%) had central lines. 102 (21%) were planned admissions largely for kyphoscoliotic surgery 98 (20%). 395 (79%) admissions were unplanned. Diagnostic groups were epilepsy 25 (5%), broncholitis 25 (5%), brain injury 23 (5%), sepsis 21 (4%), asthma 20 (4%), croup 15 (3%), diabetic ketoacidosis 13 (3%) and septic shock 11 (2%). PIM scoring (for 2001-2008) predicted 8 deaths, but only 3 occurred with a Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) of 0.27.CONCLUSIONS.A wide case mix of children are admitted to our general/adult ICU with a broad range of ages from newborn to adult. Despite fears of deskilling from centralisation our outcomes are excellent. The present South West UK model of transferring those children who are seriously ill to the PICU, by use of a specialised transport service, and keeping those children less ill for short periods appears to be performing well.

To evaluate: factors influencing short-and long-term survival in medical patients aged 80 and over following admission to an intensive care unit; and health-related quality of life in hospital survivors. METHODS. All patients aged 80 years or over and admitted between 2001 and 2006 were included in this study. Survival was evaluated between the time of admission and June 2009; factors associated with mortality were determined.

Mean ICU stay ranged from2.3 to 4.7 days and hospital stay from 10.9 to 21.4 days for patients of 81-90 in different years.ICU mortality ranged from 22.1 to 33.1% and hospital mortality from 33.5 to 48.6%.There were no clear changes over time. CONCLUSIONS. We could find no evidence in our practice of a steady increase in demand for Intensive Care from patients aged 81-90 over the 10 years from January 2000 to December 2009.Approximately similar numbers and proportions presented and received similar treatment over the 10 year period.In the light of the high hospital mortality, the absence of any information on patient morbidity and long term outcome makes judgements of the value of Intensive Care to patients of 81-90 years of age difficult.

Although advances in the diagnosis and treatment of ACS have resulted in a decrease in coronary heart disease mortality during the course of the last decade among men, but not among women.OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of gender in hospital outcome in patients with ACS.METHODS.Prospective study of a cohort of patients consecutively admitted to the Coronary Unit of a secondary hospital in the period of 18 months with diagnoses of acute coronary syndrome, both ST elevation and non-ST elevation ACS. Consecutive sample of 396 patients with ACS divided into two groups based on sex: 294 men and 102 women. This groups were also divided into four subgroups based on the diagnosis/clinical presentation: 159 men with a ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 40 women with a STEMI, 135 men with a non-ST elevation ACS, 62 women with a non-ST elevation ACS. We analyzed the baseline clinicaldemographic characteristics, coronary reperfusion, extension of the coronary disease, appearance of heart failure (HF), in-hospital mortality and predictors of mortality in a multivariate model.RESULTS.The women were older (70.92 \u00b1 11.92 vs. 64.48 \u00b1 12.06; p\\0.001) and had more comorbidities such as hypertension (70.59 vs. 53.74%; p = 0.003) and diabetes (51 vs. 33.33%; p= 0.003) than men, while men had greater frequency of smoking (54.42 vs. 13.73%; p\\0.001).",

The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in lungs, kidneys and liver was evaluated as an indirect measurement of accumulation of granulocytes.RESULTS.In this study renal i/r showed elevated levels of IL-1 and IL-6 (34004, p\\0.05) as compared to the four other groups. As for MPO there was a higher activity in kidney and in liver (1212 ng/ml) as compared to hind leg i/r. The highest levels of MPO were found in the lungs and liver of the groups with LPS only and in the group with nefrectomy ? LPS.CONCLUSIONS. With a two-hit model renal i/r attenuates the inflammatory response more profoundly than hind leg i/r. The high levels of MPO in nefrectomized mice might be explained by a reduced clearing of inflammatory mediators in the kidney.0817 OBESITY AGGRAVATES MICROVASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION IN SEPSIS THROUGH ADIPOCYTE-ENDOTHELIAL CROSSTALK M. van Meurs 1 , P.

Microarray analysis of stimulated THP-1 monocytes and endothelial cells identified some interesting factors, which are so far unknown in endotoxicemia.OBJECTIVES. Aim of this work was to investigate the function of these unknown factors in a 2-step cell culture model of endotoxicemia.METHODS. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as a stimulant for THP-1 monocytes [4 h] to produce a conditioned medium in a first step. In a second step this conditioned medium was used for the stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [16 h] and changes in gene expression of stimulated THP-1 monocytes and HUVECs were analyzed by microarray analysis. SVEP-1, SRPUL and KIAA, were selected for further analysis due to their different expression pattern after stimulation. Pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines and complement factors were investigated after transfection of HUVECs with complementary siRNAs.RESULTS. Soluble E-selectin revealed a significant increase after transient gene silencing of SVEP-1 and SRPUL transfection of 19 and 14% respectively. Additionally, soluble ICAM-1 showed a slightly increased expression of about 10 and 11% in KIAA and SRPUL transfected cells. No differences were investigated in IL-6, IL-8, sVCAM-1, C3a and C5a concentrations compared to the untransfected control. To confirm aforementioned results we performed quantitative RT-PCR and FACS analysis. CONCLUSIONS. In conclusion, SVEP-1 and SRPUL seemed to be involved in the inhibition of ICAM and E-selectin shedding, since the concentration of soluble factors of ICAM and Eselectin increased in the absence of either SVEP-1 or SRPUL. 0819 PLASMA FROM PATIENTS WITH SEPSIS CARRIES A HIGH OPSONIC ACTIV-ITY, ENHANCING BACTERIAL PHAGOCYTOSIS BY NEUTROPHILS C.R.A.

Over sedation increases the morbidity and mortality in ICU [1]. The use of an algorithm is recommended but not yet widely spread [2]. OBJECTIVES. The main end point of our study was to audit the real practices of sedation on a single day in 66 ICUs in the South East of France.METHODS. This 1 day study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Units were audited from January to April 2009. The patients present in the Unit were included if they were receiving sedative drugs (hypnotics or morphine derives without muscular blockade). For each patient, the Ramsay score, the existence of analgesia and consciousness assessment and the existence or not of a nurse applied algorithm were noted. The sedation was considered as adequate if the Ramsay score was between 2 and 4, or at 5 for patients with a PaO 2 / FiO 2 \\ 200 mmHg or intracranial hypertension. The sedation was considered too deep for Ramsay scores at 6 or at 5 for patients without ARDS/ALI or intracranial hypertension and insufficient for Ramsay scores at 1.CONCLUSIONS. Sedation assessment remains under used, leading to over sedation in 39% sedated patients. Over sedation is more frequently encountered in the most severe patients and in those who have arrived in ICU since less than 1 week, and even more so if no written nurse applied algorithm of sedation exists in the unit.",

Identificate decannulation-related variables by classifying tracheostomized patients into two groups based on the indication for tracheostomy, founded on variations in time to wean tracheostomized patients among subgroups of critically ill patients.RESULTS.A total of 227 patients were tracheostomized in the ICUs, of which 151 were finally included in the study. Variables were analyzed in relation to the time period from weaning to decannulation. Time to decannulation was identified with multivariate analysis in Group 1 CONCLUSIONS.

Only there was a serious one being bleeding during the performance of PT in a patient with a previous history of laryngeal malignancy that required conversion to ST. The incidende of early complications was 0.047% (total 0.1%).CONCLUSIONS.To conclude, CDU can be a very useful instrument when deciding the most suitable IC technique in ICU patients as well as helping reduce the risk of possible complications.ET-VIEW \u00d2 FOR PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY: AN ALTERNATIVE TO FIBEROPTIC BRONCHOSCOPIC GUIDANCE? C.P. Guido 1 , S. Pieri 1 , A. Zeffiri 1 , C. Pelagatti 1 , A.R. De Gaudio 1 1 Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Florence, ItalyINTRODUCTION. Percutaneous Dilational Tracheostomy (PDT) is a common procedure for airway management in critically ill patients requiring long-term ventilatory support. Although infrequent, some of the early complications related to the procedure may lead to hypoxia, such as false passage, pneumothorax, guidewire dislodgement, difficult tube placement and tracheal laceration. Performing PDT under fiberoptic bronchoscopic guidance reduces the number of complications even though it may cause a decrease in oxygen tension due to the difficulty to properly ventilate the patient.",

No episode of hypoventilation occurred and peripheral oxygen saturation was always maintained between 94 and 100%.CONCLUSIONS. Compared to fiberoptic bronchoscopy, ET-view enables the operator to perform PDT under continuous endoschopic surveillance as well, but may be at lower risk of hypoventilation and hypoxia. The full management of airways is in fact ensured for the whole duration of procedure, since control of ventilation is guaranteed through the ET-view tube. ETview may be a safe device to perform PDT, alternative to fiberoptic bronchoscope, particularly in those patients who cannot tolerate (e.g. neurosurgical patients) or are at greater risk of hypoxia (e.g. septic patients, one-lung patients).NATIONAL SURVEY TO ASSESS THE CONTENT AND AVAILABILITY OF DIFFICULT AIRWAY CART IN CRITICAL CARE UNITS IN THE UNITED STATESINTRODUCTION.

A\u00f1\u00f3n 1 1 Hospital Virgen de la Luz, Intensive Care Medicine, Cuenca, Spain BACKGROUND. Since Ciaglia et al. first described percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) in 1985, percutaneous tracheotomy (PT) has gained widespread acceptance to control the airway in patients requiring prolonged ventilatory support. Since then, new techniques for PT have been described. Ciaglia Blue Dolphin (CBD) is the latest modification upon the technique of PT by dilatation in which the tracheotomy is performed by balloon dilatation.METHODS. Prospective, observational study, carried out in a medical/surgical ICU. Nineteen critically ill adult patients were undergoing to CBD technique under endoscopic guidance. Description: once skin incision, tracheal puncture and predilatation have been performed, a ballooncannula apparatus is passed over a guidewire until the tip of the balloon mounted at the distal end of the apparatus is seen in the trachea. Afterwards, the balloon is inflated with saline until 11 atm for 10-15 s, then deflated and the tracheotomy cannula is placed by advancing the entire apparatus into the trachea. The apparatus and guidewire is then removed, leaving only the cannula in place.CONCLUSION. In spite of our small serie, (due to the recent introduction of this technique), we conclude that CBD is a safe and easy method of percutaneous tracheotomy.INTRODUCTION. Tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation is a well established procedure commonly performed in critically ill patients. Of all the described postprocedural complications, Tracheostomy Tube Dislodgement (TTD) is a relatively common and potentially serious complication. Incidence of TTD following Surgical (ST) versus Percutaneous Dilatational Tracheostomies (PDT) varies across studies partly due to differences in the definitions used[1, 2].",

Garc\u00eda del Palacio 2 1 Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Intensive Care Department, Toledo, Spain, 2 Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Chest Department, Toledo, Spain INTRODUCTION. Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) face greater surgical risk.Anatomical and funcional abnormalities in the upper airways associated with this condition increase the risk of difficult intubation (DI) and problems with permeability of the upper airway, both during anaesthesia and post-surgery.In routine preoperative assessment, indices based on various anatomical features can be used to estimate the risk of difficult intubation. Of these morphometric indices, the most commonly used in clinical practice are: thyromental distance (TMD) and Mallampati score (MS). Since OSAS is, in itself, an indicator of DI, OSAS patients more frequently present with high DI indices.CONCLUSIONS. In the study population, there was a high proportion of patients presenting with DIRF (42%), mainly owing to the Mallampati scores. It can be seen that patients with DIRFs tended to present with a higher AHIs, however, this did not reach a level of statistical significance.Patients with severe OSAS also presented with more predictive indicators of difficult intubation than those with mild-moderate OSAS.INTRODUCTION. Standard indicators for endotracheal suctioning are often based on clinical judgement which relies on the deterioration of the patient's condition and/or routine suctioning. TBA Care \u00d2 , a secretion detector, analyses airway sounds and indicates the need for suctioning.OBJECTIVES. In a prospective randomized trial we studied the efficacy of TBA Care \u00d2 in detecting the presence of retained secretions compared to standard indicators.METHODS. 72 general ICU patients were randomized at intubation into two groups differing only from suctioning indications. Control group indications: at least three times a day or clinically driven. Secretion detector group indications: device signal or clinically driven. For each suctioning procedure we recorded the indication and amount of secretions removed. Patients were followed until ICU discharge or extubation. Diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) was confirmed through tracheal aspirate.CONCLUSIONS. TBA Care \u00d2 seems a valid indicator for timely suctioning, anticipating clinical deterioration due to secretion retention and reducing unnecessary suctioning procedures.NATIONAL SURVEY OF FENESTRATED AND NON-FENESTRATEDTRACHEOSTOMY TUBE USE AND OCCURRENCE OF SURGICAL EMPHYSEMA IN UK ADULT INTENSIVE CARE UNITS H.R.F.

EXPERIENCE WITH THE BONFILS SEMI-RIGID STYLET ASSISTED PERCUTANEOUS DILATIONAL TRACHEOSTOMY V. Khridin 1 , N.A. Pedersen 1 1 Copenhagen University Hospital Glostrup, Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Copenhagen, DenmarkINTRODUCTION. Through the recent years a fiberscopic control has being increasingly used during percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) in order to observe the needle insertion and to stabilize the endotracheal tube under retraction. It is shown that a Bonfils semi-rigid stylet (BSS) (Karl Storz Endoscope) has several advantages compared to a flexible endoscope[1]. We report a frequency of usage of the fiberscopic control, particularly BSS, during PDT in our hospital's six-beds general and nine-beds neurosurgical intensive care units in 2009, as well as our experience with BSS.OBJECTIVES. All tracheostomy procedures performed in 2009 were registered and described as surgical, PDT with flexible fiberscope and BSS.METHODS. The curve of the tip of BSS was reduced from 45\u00b0to 30\u00b0in order to make a passage through the endotracheal tube easier. The BSS was connected to a Karl Storz Medi Pac TM video monitor. Usage of BSS during PDT was compared a flexible endoscope. 9%) were performed without usage of any fiberscopic control. 10 cases have shown that a modified Bonfils semi-rigid stylet comparing to a flexible scope provides better stabilization of the larynx and the trachea, better stabilization of the tube when the tube is retracted above the vocal chords. Besides, only one hand is needed to keep both the tube and the stylet. There is no risk of fiber damage under needle insertion. Connected to a video monitor, the BSS makes it possible for a PDT performing doctor to visualize and adjust the needle insertion into the trachea as well as observe the entire procedure.CONCLUSIONS. PDT guided by BSS provides several advantages compared to a flexible endoscope and can be recommended as a routine technique. REFERENCE. 1. U. Buehner, J. Oram, S. Elliot, A. Mallick, A. Bodenham.

METHODS. We retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to our medical-surgical ICU during a period pre-ASP and post-ASP introduction (April-May 2008 and 2009, respectively). Parameters collected included demographic data, antimicrobial regimens, culture results, ICU chart documentation of antimicrobial therapy, mortality, antimicrobial costs and defined daily doses (DDD) per 100 patient days. Culture results were separated into SSC and non-SSC specified a priori. Regimens were analyzed using Chi Square tests. Documentation practices were analyzed for inclusion of treatment dates, de-escalation, and details on clinical decision-making. RESULTS. There was no significant difference in age distribution, sex, APACHE II score, or types of ICU admissions between the pre-ASP (n = 139) and post-ASP groups (n = 139). 82.7% of pre-ASP patients versus 77.7% of post-ASP patients received antibiotics during their ICU stay. There were 215 positive cultures (42.3%) pre-ASP versus 179 positive cultures (40.2%) post-ASP. Post-ASP, there was a statistically significant trend to treat more SSC and less non-SSC. Pre-ASP 65 SSC and 88 non-SSC were treated (v 2 = 0.005, p = 0.941) versus 60 SSC and 58 non-SSC post-ASP (v 2 = 25.47, p \\ 0.05). The decision to treat positive non-SSC dropped significantly post-ASP (v 2 = 4.026, p = 0.045). A higher proportion of detailed antibiotic regimen documentation in the ICU chart was noted post-ASP (70.5 vs. 26.4%), with a 19% (72 vs. 53%) increase post-ASP in the number of regimens with documented stop dates, and a 8% (23 vs. 15%) increase in treatment deescalation.There was a 3.0% decrease in overall ICU mortality post-ASP. There was a 35% reduction in antibiotic cost per ICU bed-day ($44.03 vs. $28.45), resulting in a reduction in total antibiotic costs of $14 898. Furthermore, there was a 9.2% reduction in mean antibacterial DDD/100 patient days (142.26 vs. 129.2).CONCLUSIONS. The collaborative ASP team minimized unnecessary use, tailored spectrum of activity, decreased cost, and promoted better patient care practices. The ASP implementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in treated non-SSC, an increase in treated SSC, and more transparent chart documentation practices. Appropriate and judicious antimicrobial use guided by an ASP is associated with significant benefit in ICU patients.CRITICAL CARE ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP AND POLICY PROMOTE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBINGT. Leary 1 , R. Rajpurohit 2 , H. Williams 2 1 Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Foundation Trust, Critical Care, Norwich, UK, 2 Norfolk and Norwich University NHS Foundation Trust, Microbiology, Norwich, UK INTRODUCTION. As part of a Critical Care antimicrobial stewardship program, a new antibiotic policy was introduced in 2008. The policy focussed on the restriction of cephalosporin and quinolone use.OBJECTIVES. To review antibiotic administration over the 18 months before and after policy introduction to establish adherence to policy. To review whether the recommendations in the policy and use of antibiotics were appropriate for the antibiotic sensitivity patterns in critical care. METHODS. Defined daily doses (DDDs) for antibiotics were obtained for the period 2006 to 2009. For 2008, results from blood culture and respiratory isolates, with their antibiotic sensitivity pattern, were obtained from the microbiology department. Antibiotic sensitivities were compared with DDDs graphs to ensure that recommendations were appropriate.",

SDD is a preventative measure that reduces mortality (20%), the incidence o ventilator associated pneumonia (65%) and Gram-negative bloodstream infections (60%) in ICU. Some authors claim against SDD use because concerns about its potential impact in antibiotic resistance acquisition.OBJECTIVES. 1. To assess the impact of continuous long-term use of SDD on antibiotic resistance acquisition in ICU; 2. To evaluate the impact of this practice in the development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection (BI) caused by ICU acquired MMO METHODS. Type of study: Cohort prospective study: Setting : 18-bed medical/surgical ICU. Period of study: 5 consecutive years. Patients: All consecutive patients with expected mechanical ventilation C 72 h. Interventions: 1. SDD (tobramycin, colistin, amphotericin in oropahryngeal paste and digestive solution, plus 4 days i.v. cefotaxime); oral and digestive vancomycin was added to patients coming from other hospitals or other wards. 2. Surveillance samples (oropharynx, rectum) were taken on admission and once a week. Diagnostic samples were taken according to clinical prescription. Definitions: A new case was considered a patient with MMO in surveillance or diagnostic samples who was not known as a previous carrier. ICU acquired MMO was considered when the first sample with MMO growth was obtained after a negative sample on admission. Statistical analysis: time-trend was estimated by Spearman coefficient. Frequency of sampling and incidences were reported per 1,000 patient-days.RESULTS. 1,588 patients were included. The frequency of sampling was 1,1087. During the study period there was an increase in the consumption of ceztadime and imipenem. The prevalence of patients with multi-resistant MMO at ICU admission was 22%. The incidence of MMO acquired in ICU was kept stable, 18.91. The acquired resistance of Enterobacteriaceae was kept stable. There has been an increase of acquired P. aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime (3.3-6.5)and imipenem (6.1-9.5). The incidence of non-fermenter Gram negative bacilli and MRSA acquisition was \\ 3 The incidence of VAP and BI caused by acquired MMO was B 1.CONCLUSIONS. Long term use of SDD is not associated to an increase in acquired resistance carriage. The incidence of severe infections caused by ICU acquired MMO is very low in patients treated with SDD.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT. CIBERES.PREDICTOR FACTORS OF INADEQUATE CONCENTRATIONS OF CONTINU-OUS INFUSION OF VANCOMYCIN IN SEPTIC PATIENTSF.S. Taccone 1 , E. Ocampos-Martinez 1 , L. Penaccini 1 , A. Abdelhadii 1 , F. Jacobs 1 , J.-L. Vincent 1 1 Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, BelgiumINTRODUCTION. Continuous infusion (CI) of vancomycin is frequently used in critically illpatients to treat severe infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. However, sepsis can alter drug pharmacokinetics (PKs), resulting in insufficient drug concentrations. Inadequate antimicrobial concentrations, especially during the first days of treatment, may have potential deleterious effects on morbidity and mortality of septic patients. Recent recommendations suggest a loading dose of 15 mg/kg followed by a CI of 30 mg/kg of vancomycin, but data on the efficacy of this strategy in sepsis are scarce.OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to identify the predictor factors of inadequate vancomycin concentrations in septic patients.METHODS.Retrospective analysis of all patients admitted in the ICU from January 2008 to December 2009 in whom a vancomycin was given as a CI. Patients were included if they (a) were [ 18 years old, (b) had sepsis according to standard criteria, (c) received at least 28 mg/kg daily for the first 48 h. Demographics, microbiological and treatment data were collected. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated from 24-h urine collection and normalized to body surface area (BSA). Concentrations below 20 mcg/mL were considered as inadequate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using all variables showing a significant association (p \\ 0.2) with inadequate vancomycin concentrations at day 1 or day 2 of therapy in univariate analysis. of therapy. Multivariate regression analysis showed that high CrCl was the only variable that indipendently predicted inadequate vancomycin concentrations at day 1 and 2 of therapy. Hence, CrCl [ 120 ml/min m 2 had a sensitivity of 91%, a specificity of 40%, a positive predictive value of 82% and a negative predictive value of 60% for inadequate vancomycin concentrations at day 1. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for CrCl showed an area under the curve of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-0.85).CONCLUSIONS.In ICU septic patients treated with a CI of vancomycin, drug concentrations were found insufficient in nearly half of cases, even when standard recommended regimen was applied. CrCl was the strongest variable to predict inadequate drug concentrations.ANTIBIOTIC PRESCRIBING IN A MIXED GENERAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: A SEVEN YEAR AUDIT OF PRACTICE S.J.

Simpson 2 , A.I. Amin 3 1 NHS Lothian, Department of Anaesthesia, Livingston, UK, 2 NHS Fife, Department of Intensive Care, Dunfermline, UK, 3 NHS Fife, Department of Surgery, Dunfermline, UKINTRODUCTION. Peritonitis is a common cause of critical illness requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and is associated with high mortality[1, 2]. Multiple laparotomies are frequently required during treatment[3]. OBJECTIVES. To determine whether use of topical negative pressure (TNP) with a VACADS, facilitating a second look laparotomy, was associated with a reduction in mortality. METHODS. Patients admitted to ICU with peritonitis between 1/1/02 to 31/12/09 were identified using the Scottish national database of ICU admissions (Ward Watcher). A locally held surgical database was then used to identify a subgroup of patients where the abdomen was left open for a 'second look' laparotomy. The decision to leave the abdomen open was made independently by the surgeon at the time of surgery. Patients with peritonitis secondary to biliary sepsis or appendicitis were excluded. Patient demographics including age, sex, APACHE II score, unit stay, ventilator days and hospital stay were collated. The patients were divided into those who had received TNP and those who had not. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for both groups and hospital mortality outcomes were compared RESULTS. 244 patients were admitted to the ICU with peritonitis during the study period. 11 with biliary sepsis and 12 with appendicitis were excluded. 26 patients were treated with a VACADS (TNP group). Of this group 13 had a perforated viscus, 9 anastamotic leaks, 2 iatrogenic bowel injury and 2 had pelvic sepsis. (33% female, mean age 62.46 years, mean APACHE II score 17.27). 195 patients had standard treatment without TNP (non TNP group). Of this group 144 had a perforated viscus, 22 anastamotic leaks, 20 iatrogenic bowel injury and 9 had pelvic sepsis. (57.9% female, mean age 67.41 years, mean APACHE II score 17.93). The unit mortality rate in the TNP group was 3.8% compared with 15.9% in the non TNP group. The SMR was 0.41 in the TNP group compared with 0.66 in the non TNP group. The TNP group had more ventilated days (mean 8.96 vs. 4.46) and longer hospital stays (mean 11.3 vs. 5.84) but a shorter ICU to discharge time (mean 23.8 vs. 28.16). The hospital mortality in the TNP group was 15.4% compared with 27.2% in the non TNP group. CONCLUSIONS. The use of TNP with a VACADS in critically ill patients with peritonitis could be associated with improved outcomes. There was a risk reduction in the TNP group but this was not statistically significant. Ongoing data collection should be continued and this trend would have to persist in order to show significance.

To analyze the rates, types of infection and etiology of invasive devices-related infections that occurred during the patients' stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) in cardiac surgery patients as compared with the remaining surgical patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Observational, prospective and multicenter study in which patients participated voluntarily. Patients included in the ENVIN-HELICS registry between 2005 and 2008 (both years included) were assessed, and the subgroups of cardiac surgery patients and the remaining surgical patients were selected. Mechanical ventilation-related pneumonia (MVP), urinary catheter-related infection (UC-I), primary bacteremia (PB), and PB related to vascular catheters (PB-VC) were assessed. Frequencies are expressed as incidence density.RESULTS.A total of 46,930 patients were included in the study. There were 4,348 (9.3%) patients in the cardiac surgery group and 10,012 (21.3%) in the general surgical group. Infections occurred in 206 (4.7%) cardiac surgery patients and in 355 (6.3%) general surgical patients (p = 0.0013). Incidence density by type of infection were lower among cardiac surgery patients (MVP: 12.5 vs. 13.5 episodes per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation, p = 0.467; UC-I: 2.9 vs. 4.4 episodes per 1,000 days of urinary catheter inserted, p = 0.0033; and PB-VC: 3.5 vs. 4.6 episodes per 1,000 days of vascular catheter inserted, p = 0.0418). Differences in the etiology of infections were not found. The mortality rate in cardiac surgery patients with one or more infections was 24.4% as compared with 2.8% in non-infected patients (p \\ 0.001). ICU stay increased from 4.7 to 21.4 days (p \\ 0.001).CONCLUSIONS. Cardiac surgery patients accounted for 9.3% of patients admitted to the ICU for more the 24 h. In this group, invasive devices-related infections were lower than in the remaining surgical patients. Mortality and ICU length of stay in cardiac surgery patients with one or more infections increased significantly. Prevention of such infections should be a priority objective in ICUs taking care for cardiac surgery patients.USE OF A SELECTIVE DECONTAMINATION OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT (SDD) PROTOCOL IN A POLYVALENT INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU): PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDYA.

SETTING: Polyvalent ICU with 8 beds, 478 patients treated in 2009. 1 year study period from January to December 2009.METHOD.Prospective cohort study. The SDD protocol was administrated to all patients with an estimated mechanical ventilation needed for more than 48 h, and to nonintubated patients with risk factors (Glasgow Coma Score B 11; severe acute Pancreatitis or Neutropenic patients). It was used a combination of Cefotaxime iv (4 days) with oropharyngeal and digestive Polimixin solution, Tobramycin and Nystatin. We analyze the ICU and hospital outcome and the infections associated with devices in ICU and nosocomial infections to ICU's discharge. The information is described as average (range) or as percentages.RESULTS. 81 patients were included in SDD protocol during the study period: women 38%, age 61 (26-89), SAPS III 61.6 (36-100), predicted survival 61%, survival to UCI 84%, survival hospital 79%, time of SDD employment 10 days (1-49). The reason for using SDD were: in 91.4% of the patients mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy 4.9%, pancreatitis 2.5% and neutropenic 1.2%. The infections associated to ICU devices in all the patients were: Pneumonia associated to mechanical ventilation (0 for 1,000 mechanical ventilation days); Bacteriemia associated to catheter or primary (1.45 for 1,000 days of venous central catheter) and urinary infection (2.09 for 1,000 days of urinary catheter). From the group of patients who received DDS and were trasladated to conventional guard, just 7 were diagnosed with nosocomial infection, 2 of them suffered non condensative respiratory infection, 1 was diagnosed with pneumonia, 1 was diagnosed with surgical injury infection and 3 were diagnosed with urinary tract infections. The time from the discharge of the UCI to the appearance of nosocomial infections was 11 days(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19).",

Recent studies have suggested that preoperative statins use is associated with a reduction in infectious complications after cardiac surgery.OBJECTIVES. To assess the effect on morbidity of preoperative statins use in cardiac surgery.METHODS.Prospective and observational cohort study. We evaluated all of 124 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery at our hospital between November 30, 2007 and, February 28, 2008. We described general characteristics and comorbidities (age, gender, weight, height, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipemia, chronic kidney failure), pharmacological treatments (betablockers, ACE, statins), type of cardiac surgery (CABG and/or valve replacement) and postoperative complications (pneumonia, bacteriemia, sternal wound, leg vein harvest site infection, urinary tract infection, stress ulcer, acute cardiac failure and length of stay at hospital). The time of monitoring was 90 days. Differences in categorical variables were calculated using two-sided likelihood ratio Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and the Mann-Withney U or Student t test was used for continuous variables, when appropriate. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to assess the impact of statins use on infectious complications across the time. Data analysis was done using SPSS for Windows 15.0.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).RESULTS.A total of 124 patients were included. The 48.4% (60) were women, the mean age was 65 \u00b1 11 years. The frequency of preoperative statins use were 40% (50 patients). In total, 61 (48%) patients developed an infectious complication. In our study, preoperative use of statins was not associated with a statistically reduction in any individual infection on its own (p [ 0.05 for all).CONCLUSIONS.

Catheter-related blood stream infection (CR-BSI) presents severe morbidity and potential mortality in intensive care units. We have recognized a high rate of this adverse event in our unit and implemented the catheter bundle in the year 2007. OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the effect of systematic implementation of the catheter bundle protocol on the rates of CR-BSI in a busy cardiac surgery post-operative unit.METHODS. The catheter bundle implemented included: (1) choice of catheter site insertion, using preferably the subclavian or jugular vein approach (2) use of topical chlorexidine in the site of insertion (3) full paramentation of the involved physician, including a large sheet to place on the patient (4) early removal of the catheter. This was a prospective cohort study, of consecutive patients. Two periods were evaluated: period I-6 months prior to intervention (December 2007 to May 2008); period II-from September 2008 until February 2009. Months of June, July and August were excluded from analysis, since this was considered the implementation period. CR-BSI was considered, when positive blood cultures, with no other focus of infection, was detected in a patient with a central venous catheter. Rate was per 1,000 catheter days. Statistical analysis was performed with Epi info (STATCALC) program, using the Chi-square test for comparison of proportions between periods I and II. Yates correction was used. RESULTS. There was a total of 4,239 catheter-days in the unit during the study periods. Period I included 2,095, and 2,139 in period II. CR-BSI rates were 16 cases pre implementation, and 5 post implementation. Odds ratio was 3.27 (confidence interval 1.12-10.20) with p = 0.026 (p \\ 0.05). Number of CR-BSI per month is presented in graph 1. Microorganisms identified are shown inTable 1.BSI-RATE/1000 CONCLUSION. A systematic, bedside approach to reduce CR-BSI proved effectiveness in the scenario of a postoperative cardiac surgery unit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A statistically significant decrease in CR-BSI was observed in a relatively short period of intervention, improving health care quality.ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Nursing and Physitians staff of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is often complicated by infectious complications-both pancreatic and extra-pancreatic. Infected pancreatic necrosis in particular is an important source of morbidity and mortality. Multicenter data on the use of antibiotics, the frequency of infectious complications, and the microbiology in patients with SAP are desirable.OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the infectious complications (location of infection, antibiotics used, microbiology, use of prophylactic antibiotics) in this setting.METHODS. The EPIC2 study was a 1-day point prevalence study performed onMay 8, 2007. A total of 1,265 ICUs from 76 countries participated and included data on 14,141 patients present on the study day. Demographic, physiologic, bacteriological, and therapeutic data were collected, along with outcome data at ICU and hospital discharge. From this database, we extracted data from patients who were admitted to the ICU because of SAP.RESULTS. Of the 14,141 patients, 159 (1.12%) were admitted to the ICU for SAP (65% male, mean age 57 \u00b1 15 years, SAPS2 score 33.4 \u00b1 14.2). SAP patients stayed in the ICU for a median of 25 (10-53) days; ICU mortality was 22.7%. Of these, 116 patients (73%) were considered to be infected: 50 (31.4%) patients had intra-abdominal infections (IAI), 25 (15.7%) extra-abdominal infections, and 41 (25.8%) a combination of the two. For antibiotic treatment, penicillins and other beta-lactams were used most frequently (31.1 and 44.4%, respectively). In patients treated for IAI, 28 different microorganisms were recovered.

An acute non-infectious condition was diagnosed in 175 (40.9%) patients, and was more frequent in FUO patients or those with clinically documented infection (52 and 47%, respectively) than in patients with microbiologically documented infection (35%). ICU and hospital mortality rates were, respectively, of 40.1 and 49.8%. Six months and 1-year mortality rates were 59.5 and 63.3%, respectively. Hospital mortality rate ranged from 58.7% between 1998 and 2003 to 43% between 2004 and 2008 (p = 0.006). By multivariate analysis, nine independent predictors of hospital mortality were identified. Six were associated with mortality, namely, increased age, need for vasopressors, neurologic, respiratory or hepatic dysfunctions and presence of acute non-infectious condition. Three factors were associated with reduced mortality, namely, ICU-admission after 2003, initial antibiotic combination using aminoglycosides and early removal of the indwelling catheter.CONCLUSIONS. In neutropenic patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, survival improves over time. This study identifies two potential targets for improvement that are aminoglycosides administration in combination with betalactam antibiotics and early catheter removal. Acute non-infectious conditions are associated with increased mortality underlining the need for complete clinical assessment allowing identification of infectious and non-infectious aetiologies of newly developed organ dysfunction.INVASIVE ASPERGILLOSIS IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS: UNDERLYING CON-DITIONS, CLINICAL PRESENTATION, MEDICAL IMAGING, AND MORTALITY N.

Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a fungal infection particularly affecting immunocompromised hosts. In the past decade, however, several reports indicate an important occurrence rate of IA in apparently immunocompetent ICU patients. Little is known about the specific risk profile of ICU patients to develop IA.OBJECTIVES. To describe characteristics and outcome in ICU patients with IA.METHODS.We report an interim analysis of the AspICU project (http://www.aspicu.org), a multicenter (n = 24) observational survey (November 2006-November 2009) of all ICU patients with a positive Aspergillus culture. IA was defined according to an algorithm that discriminates Aspergillus colonization from probable or proven IA[1].RESULTS.At time of interim analysis 390 patients were included in the AspICU project. Of these, 183 cases (46.9%) were classified as IA (of which 44 proven and 139 probable IA). The lung was the most frequent site of infection (97.8%) and A. fumigatus the most common isolated species (93.0%). The median APACHE II score at admission was 26 (IQR 18-30) and the median SOFA score at time of diagnosis of IA was 9 (IQR 6-13). IA was generally diagnosed in medical ICUs (82.0%). The most frequently observed co-morbid conditions or underlying diseases were COPD (37.2%), ARDS (19.0%), diabetes mellitus (13.7%), and chronic heart failure (8.7%). There were 26 patients (14.2%) with solid organ transplantation (12 liver, 7 kidney, 5 lung, and 2 heart transplants). Only 35.0% of patients had classical host factors as defined by the EORTC/MSG, such as neutropenia (6.6%), hemato-oncological malignancy treated with cytotoxic agents (8.7%), bone marrow transplantation (2.7%), or chronic use of corticosteroids (15.3%). Clinical signs suggestive for IA were dyspnea (63%), worsening respiratory insufficiency in spite of antibiotic therapy and ventilator support (56%), and fever refractory to at least 3 days of antibiotic therapy (34%). Medical imaging (either by CT or on Chest X-ray) showed non-specific infiltrates (72%), pleural fluid (26%), diffuse ''ARDS-like'' infiltrates (20%), nodules (21%), wedge-shaped infiltrates (5%), cavitation (4%), Halo sign (3%), and air crescent sign (2%). Mortality at 12 weeks after diagnosis was 69.8% in proven IA and 67.2% in probable IA.CONCLUSIONS. IA in ICUs is associated with high mortality. Classical host factors and medical imaging suggestive for IA were rather rare. COPD is the most frequent underlying condition.REFERENCE(S). 1.

MANAGEMENT OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT: A SURVEY OF UK PRACTICE C.M. Chalmers 1 , A.M. Bal 2 1 Crosshouse Hospital, Department of Anaesthesia, Kilmarnock, UK, 2 Crosshouse Hospital, Department of Microbiology, Kilmarnock, UK INTRODUCTION. Candida species are the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection[1]. Such infections commonly affect patients in the intensive care unit (ICU)[1]  and carry a high mortality of up to 42%[2]. There are published guidelines for the management of fungal infections[3, 4]  but to date there is no literature documenting their usual management in ICUs in the UK.OBJECTIVES.To document usual management of fungal infections in general and candidaemia in particular in UK ICUs. To compare this management to published guidelines.METHODS. An electronic survey was sent to 212 ICUs across the UK (approximately 90% of all UK units). Questions related to empirical treatment of fungal infections, the management of proven candidaemia and more general management practices.RESULTS.A total of 72 responses were received (30.6% response rate). 57.7% of units have no local policy on the use of antifungal agents. Microbiology advice is usually sought before commencing antifungal therapy. 85.9% of units use antifungal agents empirically, usually only for certain groups of patients perceived to be at high risk. These include patients with gastrointestinal perforations, abdominal surgery, immunosuppression and liver failure. Risk factors contributing to a decision to commence empirical therapy include fever unresponsive to antibiotics and rising inflammatory markers. 76.4% of those who use empirical therapy perceive this to be beneficial. Fluconazole is the antifungal agent of choice in most units for both empirical therapy (81.4%) and proven candidaemia (64.1%). Duration of therapy is 14 days in 47% of units and dependent on clinical response or advice in 23.3%. Central venous catheters (CVC) are removed within 48 h frequently or always in 73.9% of units and ophthalmological examination arranged frequently or always in 15.1%.CONCLUSIONS. Few units have a local policy on the management of fungal infections but close liaison with microbiologists is usual. Empirical therapy is often employed for patients deemed to be at high risk, although evidence for this approach is lacking[5]. Adherence to published guidelines could be improved, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality from these common infections.HIGH FREQUENCY OF RESPIRATORY VIRUSES DETECTED BY MULTIPLEX POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION IN THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED WITH ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURED. Schnell 1 , J. Legoff 1 , B. Schlemmer 1 , \u00c9 . Azoulay 1 1 H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis, Paris Diderot University, Paris, France INTRODUCTION. RT-PCR is more sensitive than standard methods for respiratory viruses (RV) detection. However, this has not been evaluated in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF). Moreover, the exact clinical significance of a positive PCR assay remains unknown.OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the sensitivity of RT-PCR in immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF).METHODS. Prospective single-center study in immunocompromised patients with ARF. Multiplex RT-PCR sensitivity was compared to immunofluorescence.RESULTS. Hundred immunocompromised patients (65 hematologic malignancies including 14 hematopoietic stem cell transplantations, 22 iatrogenic immunosuppression, and 13 with solid tumours) were included in the study. A RV was detected in 47 (47%) patients with multiplex RT-PCR compared to 8 (8%) with immunofluorescence (P = 0.006). Patients with and without a positive PCR assay had similar clinical and radiographic presentations. The need for ventilatory support (57 vs. 75%, P = 0.09), the occurrence of shock (43 vs. 53%, P = 0.41), the need for renal replacement therapy (26 vs. 23%, P = 0.92), time spend in the ICU (6 vs. 7 days, P = 0.35), and ICU mortality (17 vs. 28%, P = 0.27) were comparable between groups. The PCR assay results according to diagnostic categories of acute respiratory failure are displayed inFig. 1.PCR assay results according to diagnosis CONCLUSIONS. In our immunocompromised patients with ARF, multiplex RT-PCR was far more sensitive than immunofluorescence for the detection of RV. However, further investigations are needed to clarify the exact clinical significance of a positive PCR assay.ASSESSMENT OF CANDIDA SCORE TOGETHER WITH SERUM PROCALCITO-NIN IN ICU PATIENTS: PREDICTOR OF INVASIVE CANDIDIASIS? X. Li 1 , R. Wu 1 , J. Chen 1 , X. Guan 1 , S. Huang 1 1 The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Guangzhou, ChinaINTRODUCTION. Invasive candidiasis (IC) was associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Thus, how to effectively predict IC has become a challenge in clinical practice. Given the conventional microbiological, histological and radiological methods are insensitive, time-consuming and not generally accessible, rapid, specific and culture-independent predictive method of IC is needed.OBJECTIVES. This study was performed to assess the implementation of Candida Score (CS) together with serum procalcitonin (PCT) as predictor of IC in ICU patients.METHODS.Retrospectively analyze clinical data and laboratory examination from 2008-2006 to 2009-2012. Using CS together with PCT/G test as predictor in succession.RESULTS.Overall 155 patients were included and invasive candidiasis group (IC) was confirmed in 54 cases. Average PCT and G test were significantly higher in IC group compared to non-IC group (p \\ 0.05). The AUROC of 48-h PCT and 48-h G test were 0.960 and 0.859, respectively. The cutoff of 48-h PCT was 0.55 ng/ml. There was significant difference of 48-h PCT between survival group and death group (p \\ 0.05).CONCLUSIONS. CS together with PCT can be used to predict IC in ICU patients. The predictive value of CS together with PCT is better than that of CS together with G test.REFERENCE(S). 1.

Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) has very high mortality in Critically Ill Patients (CIP) and requires early treatment. The frequent isolation of Aspegillus fumigatus (AF) in patients without IA and the slowness of its cultivation make diagnosis difficult.

Armaganidis 1 1 Athens University, ICU, Athens, Greece, 2 Athens University, 4th Department of Internal Medicine, Athens, Greece,3  Athens University, Microbiology Laboratory, Athens, Greece INTRODUCTION. Invasive candidiasis and candidemia are frequently encountered in the nosocomial setting, particularly in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) causing considerable morbidity and mortality. The increasing incidence of non-albicans Candida species could also be important.BACKGROUND. The aim of the present study was to record the epidemiology, risk factors, mortality, strains susceptibility to antifungal drugs, and to evaluate Ostrosky rule's capability to predict invasive candidiasis in patients with candidemia in the ICU.METHODS. This is a retrospective study of all candidemia episodes which were registered in our medical-surgical ICU in a 5 year period. The records of the research laboratory of the fourth Internal Medicine Department and the Microbiology Laboratory of Attikon University hospital were used in order to identify patients. Medical records were then retrieved. Only the first candidemia episode was evaluated. Special forms were completed for each patient including demographic information, concomitant conditions, severity scores on the day of ICU admission, risk factors, data of colonization and candidemia-related information.RESULTS. Our hospital is a 640-bed teaching tertiary care hospital with a 25-bed medical and surgical ICU. During the study period a total of 1,098 patients were hospitalized in the ICU. Among them 39 patients developed fungemia, i.e. (3.55 per 1,000 admissions). The population study consisted of 23 men and 16 women. Mean patients' age was 69 years while median ICU length of stay was 36 days (range 1-240). Medical cause of admission was present in 22 cases and surgical in 17 cases. Species isolated were C. albicans (25.6%), The majority of the nonalbicans cases were caused by C. parapsilosis (20.5%).The rest were equally divided between C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. glabrata. Three candidemias were ''imported''. Median time between ICU admission and candidemia was 25 days (3-75). Mean Apache II score was 16, 4 (range 12-20) on the day of admission and overall mortality was 66.6%. Attributable mortality was 35%. Ostrosky prediction rule was positive in 20 patients. Urine or lung colonization was present in 20.5%, and multiple site colonization in 29%. Seven (18%) patients were submitted to an intraabdominal operation. Twelve patients (31%) received TPN prior to candidemia episode. Seven patients were receiving steroid therapy for several reasons. Risk factors analysis between Candida and non-Candida showed that corticosteroid use was associated with non-Candida species. Caspofungin was the most commonly introduced treatment.CONCLUSIONS. Compared to other blood infections fungemias are not common among ICU patients but they are often lethal. A high Apache II score at admission, multiple site colonization and abdominal surgery should raise a high suspicion index and a prophylactic therapy should start. Non Albicans species are on the rise and they may be associated with corticosteroid use.CONTROL OF A NOSOCOMIAL OUTBREAK DUE TO ASPERGILLUS FUMIGA-TUS AT A INTENSIVE CARE UNITJ.V.

Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) is one of the most frequent causes of nosocomial pneumonia, and the mortality from infection by this pathogen is 80%. This fungus is commonly isolated from the environment (soil, organic debris, decaying vegetation, and water), and it releases conidia which can be inhaled by immunocompromised hosts. It has several pathogenic mechanisms that differentiate it from other species: the capacity to grow at 37\u00b0C, spores are very resistant to environmental etc.",

To assess whether infection/colonization by Acinetobacter baumannii has an influence on hospital mortality and what is the impact of the different demographic and clinical variables on hospital mortality.CONCLUSIONS. In our ICU the use of SDD has been associated with a highly significant reduction in acquisition of previously endemic MRAB and a trend to reduced acquisition of MRSA. The slight rise in ICU acquired RGNB and VRE in the first 6 months of 2009 may be partly due to increasing compliance with microbiological surveillance.

Patients without EF developed larger caloric deficit during the first 4 days, but also the patients receiving EF did not reach their caloric needs. Next to different GI symptoms, shock and procedures including weaning and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are common reasons for withholding the EF during the first days in ICU.Energy requirement/day of ICU admission CONCLUSIONS. Mean CalVCO 2 differs from ESPEN recommendations for caloric requirements, especially in the early course of disease. During recovery, 25 kcal/kg is a reasonable average estimate. However, CalVCO 2 may provide a useful tool for individual estimation of energy requirements because it reflects actual metabolism. The method can be refined by adjusting RQ to the type of feeding.INTRODUCTION. Critical illness myopathy (CIM) contributes to ICU and hospital mortality, significantly delays weaning from ventilation and prolongs rehabilitation. Although pathogenic factors such as the systemic inflammatory response have been identified, the exact mechanisms leading to CIM remain unclear.

To compare enteral nutrition (EN) timing in our intensive care unit (ICU) with ESPEN guidelines recommendation. METHODS. Prospective observational study from January to December 2009, in an ICU with coronary, cardiac postoperatory, heart transplant and trauma unit. This study has been performed by the Support Nutritional Unit (SNU) and ICU. Time from ICU admissions to initiation of EN was recorded. RESULTS. 431 patients were involved. 91 of them were cardiac surgery patient. EN was started, in general, before 24 h from ICU admissions in 75% of the patients. But when we analyzed by the different units we could observed that in the trauma ICU only 17% of the patients received EN after the first 24 h from admission, in contrast with the cardiac surgery unit where 51.6% of the patients wait more than 24 h to get it. Global median time was 19, 9 h (SD \u00b115 h), in trauma ICU 17 h (\u00b111.9 h) and in cardiac surgery unit 30, 73 (\u00b120.6) (p[0.001).

Russell 1 1 Ulster Hospital, Belfast, UKINTRODUCTION. The utility of focused echo (FE) in ICM has now been well described and accepted. Training courses are widely available. However, the development and delivery of formal clinical training has been slow and FE has not been added to the ICM curriculum in the UK. The development of competency in FE has been slow for ICM trainees.OBJECTIVES. To characterise the current state of FE training in ICM trainees in Northern Ireland and identify barriers to training and competency development.METHODS.We conducted a survey to investigate trainee experience and training in FE.CONCLUSIONS.There is a training void in FE. The majority of trainees feel FE training should be incorporated into the ICM curriculum in the UK. Many ICM Consultants have attended courses and do perform FE. The lack of clinical training may be due to lack of confidence amongst Consultants who are themselves still learning. There is little scope for further training beyond these courses. Formal accreditation such as the British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) certification is unobtainable in most cases and lacks specificity for ICM. Previous studies have shown that novices can be taught to perform a focused echo after focused training. We propose that a 3 month programme be adopted. This should include didactic teaching on basic machine function and image acquisition followed by bedside teaching, independent learning and use of multimedia resources. Then a 3 month period for the trainee to perform and interpret 25 scans which are reported on a standardised training report form. The images and reports should be reviewed by an ICM consultant and a BSE certified echocardiographer.",

Although a non-significant increase in the time spent on documentation after the ICIS introduction was observed, there was no difference at all in nursing time spent on direct patient care documented.INTRODUCTION.Central venous catheterization is a hazardous but necessary intervention in critically ill patients with a catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rate estimated at 3-8% and a mechanical complication rate between 10-20%. Nearly all of this published data applies to catheters inserted via the internal jugular, sub-clavian and femoral routes. Peripherally (multiluminal) Inserted Central (PICC) Catheters inserted via the brachial veins are a promising new method of central venous catheterization that have the same capabilities as traditional central lines, but may be associated with fewer complications. Our institution has gained considerable experience with their insertion under ultrasound guidance by a dedicated vascular access team and have become a national leader in both their use and audit of outcomes in both critical care and hospital wide settings.OBJECTIVES. We report our PICC insertion rate, days and incidence of adverse events and compare this to similar data from traditional CVC placement.METHODS. Data from all PICC or CVC line insertions were prospectively recorded onto dedicated databases between January 2008 and December 2009. No. of central catheters per patient, indication for use, no. of days in situ, adverse events including associated bacteraemia was interrogated for all patients. Rates of bacteraemia were cross checked with microbiological departmental databases on a named patient basis. In addition, time from referral to insertion was recorded for all PICC lines. SPSS version 12 was used for statistical analysis. Difference in means was assessed by Mann Witney U or Student t test depending on normality of data.CONCLUSIONS. PICC lines have a comparable rate of CRBSI with short term traditional CVC line placement despite a longer dwell time.They have a significantly lower rate of other adverse events such as blockage, haemorrhage and malplacement compared to local and published CVC data. PICC placement may avoid multiple short term CVC catheterisations with an associated reduction in infection rate and other adverse events. Overall, Brachial PICC insertion by a dedicated vascular access team is feasible, prompt and at least as safe as CVC insertion. Critical care physicians should consider brachial PICC access as a safe alternative when the need for central access is prolonged, at first line change or on a non-emergent basis.",

Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Several risk scores have been developed to predict the need for RRT after cardiac surgery from pre-operative risk factors.OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to compare and verify the external validity of the three main available scores for RRT prediction: the Thakar score (TS), the Mehta tool (MT) and the Simplified Renal Index (SRI), in a regional European cohort.METHODS.In a cohort of 1,084 adult patients who underwent open-heart surgery in 24 Spanish hospitals in 2007, postoperative RRT was necessary in 248 patients. Data on pre-operative risk factors for all patients were obtained retrospectively from hospital databases and medical records. For each patient, the risk scores were calculated on the basis of the original publications.RESULTS. The predictive indices had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in TS, MT and SRI of 0.82, 0.76 and 0.79, respectively. After probability calculation, the three scoring systems had significantly reduced tested values, suggesting they were poorly calibrated, they tended to underestimate the actual RRT need.CONCLUSIONS. Using a multicenter cohort of open-heart surgery patients, we have externally validated three scoring systems for the prediction of postoperative RRT. TS and SRI discriminated well between low-and high-risk patients in our cohort, and both outperformed MT. In addition to preoperative renal function, heart failure, reoperation and emergent surgery are important variables to consider whenassessing RRT risk.INTRODUCTION. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important problem in the ICU. The use of consensus definitions and protocols for detection and management of these patients could be crucial for patient safety.OBJECTIVES. We survey the clinical practice of different ICUs in Spain regarding AKI definition and prevention as well as renal replacement therapies (RRT) safety issues.METHODS.Prospective, observational, multicentre study on the prevalence of AKI in UCIs that will be held on 2009-2010, COFRADE Study. We asked all recruited ICUs to answer a survey on operational characteristics at the start of the study. Data are presented as percentages. Chi-square and non-parametric methods were applied for analysis.RESULTS.We received 41 surveys out of 50 ICUs recruited. The participants were from First level hospitals in 4 (9.8%) cases, Second level in 5 (12.2%) and Third level in 32 (78%). Regarding ICU size, 16 (39%) had up to 12 beds, 11 (26.8%) up to 24 and 14 (34.1%) more than 24 beds. The vast majority of ICUs were polyvalent (70.7%), 6 (14.6%) medical and 6 (14.6%) surgical specialized units. Method used for estimating glomerular filtration rate was serum creatinine in 15 (36.6%) Units, creatinine clearance in 17 (41.5%) and equations [7 CG and 2 MDRD] in 9 (22%) Units. None reported using cystatin-C. Only 16 (39.1%) ICUs reported the use of stratification scores (13 RIFLE and 3 AKIN), almost all of them were polyvalent Units. Specialized medical units did only in 16.7% and surgical Units did not report on their use. Twenty (48.8%) Units had no written protocols for AKI prevention, 13 (31.7%) reported using them just for contrast nephropathy, 3 (7.3%) for nephrotoxic drugs and 5 (12.2) for both. In contrast, 26 (63.4%) participants had written protocols for TDE management, 29 (70.7%) had implemented a training program and 22 (53.7%) had some method for adjusting doses of drugs when on TDE. The size of the Unit or the Hospital did not supposed a clear difference between ICUs regarding AKI or TDE management.",

To evaluate changes in continuous renal replacement (CRRT) use and define prognostic factors for mortality and long-term prognosis in these patients.METHODS.Preliminary results of a prospective single centre observational study. We included in a dedicated registry all patients treated since we started the CRRT program and defined three periods: P1 (from 1994 to 1998, when we used an isolated blood pump [AK, Gambro \u00d2 ]); P2 (from 1999 to 2001, when we used a two-pump system [BSM-32\u00d2]) and P3 (2002 to 2005, with a four-pump system [Prisma \u00d2 ]) and did follow-up survivors 5 years after discharge. We applied ANOVA, Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank for univariate analysis and logistic regression for ICU mortality and Cox regression for 5-year survival.RESULTS. Included 347 patients: 71 in P1, 105 in P2 and 171 in P3. CRRT differed in dose (27.2 \u00b1 6.6 mL/kg/h in P3, 19.8 \u00b1 5.4 in P2 and 15.1 \u00b1 6.1 in P1, p\\0.001) but no in previous renal function. Delay in initiation was shorter for P3 and then P2 but without statistical significance. Patients profile was similar but differed in severity (Apache II at admission 22.1 \u00b1 7.1 in P3, 23.3 \u00b1 8.3 in P2 and 20.9 \u00b1 6.1 in P1, p\\0.05). ICU mortality was 74.6% for P1, 80% P2 and 59.1% P3, p \\ 0.05), but after ICU discharge mortality in follow-up was similar for all periods. After discharge, survival was 92.3% for P1 patients, 100% P2 and 86.7% P3. Intermittent haemodialysis was used in 13.5% patients after CRRT but 87.2% were successfully weaned during follow-up. In the logistic regression, Apache II, number of failing organs and oliguria were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Higher initial creatinine, previous history of renal dysfunction and higher CRRT dosage were protective factors. A Cox regression for survival at 5 years gave similar result.CONCLUSIONS. Number of CRRT treatments has risen steadily as well as severity of patients treated, but mortality has decreased significantly and this improvement seems related to CRRT dosage. Patients surviving the acute episode have a very good prognosis both for survival and for kidney function.A SERVICE EVALUATION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM PROPHYLAXIS WITH LOW MOLECULAR WEIGHT HEPARIN (LMWH) IN INTENSIVE CARE PATIENTS RECEIVING CONTINUOUS RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY L.S. Brown 1 , R.S. Bourne 1 , S. Kitchen 1 , J. VanVeen 1 , S. Byrne 2 1 Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Sheffield, UK, 2 University College Cork, Cork, Ireland INTRODUCTION. Few data exist to guide the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with LMWHs in patients on CRRT. UK guidelines 1 recommend LMWH as first line for prophylaxis of VTE, acknowledge the risk of accumulation of LMWHs in renal impairment, and risk of unpredictable and potentially excessive anticoagulation, but do not provide any further guidance. Furthermore, the co-administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) to anticoagulate the CRRT filter in such patients may result in a degree of systemic anticoagulation. OBJECTIVES. To determine the degree of systemic anticoagulation in patients receiving CRRT (systemic Activated Partial Thromboplastin Ratio (APTR) C1.5); if there was evidence of enoxaparin (40 mg SC daily) accumulation in patients on CRRT (trough anti-Xa levels[0.4 iU/ml); and whether current local practice of CRRT filter anticoagulation with UFH, and enoxaparin VTE prophylaxis were in line with national guidelines and practice.METHOD. All patients receiving CRRT on the General ICUs in Sheffield Teaching Hospitals during a 12-week study period were eligible for the service evaluation unless fulfilling exclusion criteria. Systemic and filter APTRs were recorded 4-hourly and trough plasma anti-Xa levels taken between 1400-1800 h daily. To determine national practice an electronic questionnaire was distributed through a national Critical Care Pharmacists message board (UK Clinical Pharmacy Association).RESULTS. All patients included received CVVH 30 ml/kg/h (n=12). 118 (69.4%) systemic APTRs were\\1.5; of which 27 (93.1%) of those recorded with a trough anti-Xa level were\\1.5. Twenty-nine anti-Xa levels were recorded ranging from 0.01-0.41 iU/ml (mean 0.14 (SD 0.11) iU/ml). Twenty-one anti-Xa levels were suitable for group analysis and ranged from 0.01-0.27 iU/ml (mean 0.11 (SD 0.07) iU/ml). All but one of the observed anti-Xa levels were below the pre-determined anti-Xa level (0.4 iU/ml) to indicate accumulation, this level was excluded from group analysis for clinical reasons. No correlation was seen between anti-Xa level and number of days of enoxaparin therapy on CVVH (r=0.116 p=0.613). The questionnaire results identified a wide variety of practice which may reflect the lack of national VTE thromboprophylaxis guidance in patients on CRRT.CONCLUSIONS. The systemic APTR results in patients on CRRT support the requirement for additional VTE prophylaxis according to local guidance, available evidence and national practice. There was no evidence of bioaccumulation of enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily in patients receiving CVVH C30 ml/kg/h based on the anti-Xa level results, supporting local thromboprophylaxis guidelines and practice. The survey results suggested that national practice is highly variable and often not in line with available evidence, or recommended guidelines.REFERENCES. 1. Hunt B, Retter A.

Huguet 1 , R. Ma\u00f1ez 1 1 Hospital Universitario de Bellvitge, Servei de Medicina Intensiva, Barcelona, SpainINTRODUCTION. Acute renal failure (ARF) in septic shock patients is common and worsens prognosis. When CRRT are required mortality rises reflecting disease severity. Recent studies have questioned high ultrafiltrate dose and hemofiltration does not seem to be superior to hemodiafiltration even in the scene of septic shock patients. However we still dont know when to start CRRT and if this timing could affect prognosis.OBJECTIVES. Analyze survival impact in SS and ARF patients of early CRRT (timing) in terms of time from admission to initiation of therapy.METHODS. Prospective observational single center study from 2007 to 2009. We studied 196 patients with SS and ARF admitted in our critical care medicine department (ICU), all of them requiring CRRT for more than 24 h during evolution. We excluded all those patients in which CRRT was started more than 5 days after admission to avoid confussion. We also excluded patients with chronic renal failure. Mean age was 61 \u00b1 13 a\u00f1os, APACHE II score was 26 \u00b1 8. Baseline situation (when TCRR was started): 100% were on vasopressor support, 89% were on mechanical ventilation, 45% presented liver failure, 27% had hyperkaliemia. Urea 23 \u00b1 10 mmol/L, creatinine 322 \u00b1 154 umol/L, lactate 5 \u00b1 4 mmol/L.RESULTS.Mean time fron admission to CRRT was 1.8 \u00b1 2.1 days. According to RIFLE ARF score we initiated CRRT at Risk-Injury stage in 26% of our patients. 74% received CRRT at Failure stage. 62% of our patients were started on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and 38% were started on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). Mean convective dose was 36 \u00b1 12 ml/kg/h in CVVH patients. Mean total dose was 38 \u00b1 14 ml/kg/h in CVVHDF patients. Mean CRRT duration was 7.7 \u00b1 7.5 days. Mean ICU stay was 21.7 and 28 day mortality was 52%. We could not found differences in terms of survival according to technique, ultrafiltration dose or RIFLE stage. However we found an statistically significant survival improvement (p\\0.034) in those patients in which CRRT was started within the first 24 h of admission to our ICU compared to the[24 h group with no baseline group differences and independent from technique, dose and RIFLE stage.CONCLUSIONS.-Septic shock patients with ARF who need CRRT present high mortality.-Neither technique, nor ultrafiltrate dose, nor RIFLE stage seem to change prognosis. -In our patients initiation of CRRT within the first 24 h from ICU admission seems to improve survival. QUANTIFICATION OF SYSTEMIC DOSE OF SUBSTRATES FOR INTERMEDI-ATE METABOLISM DURING CITRATE ANTICOAGULATION OF CONTINUOUS RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY M. Balik 1 , M. Zakharchenko 1 , M. Otahal 1 , J.

Citrate anticoagulation is associated with metabolic side effects which are linked to a portion of citrate reaching systemic circulation. Patient might also receive doses of lactate as a buffer and glucose if 2.2% ACD solution is used. OBJECTIVES. Data on significance of systemic dose of metabolic substrates are missing. The authors tested the method of quantification of citrate load with the aid of unmeasured anions (UA). METHODS. Prospective observational study comparing critically ill anticoagulated with 2.2% citrate (ACD Fenwal, Baxter) with lactate buffer (n = 41) and control patients on unfractioned heparin (n=17) with lactate (n=7) or bicarbonate (n=10) buffer. 23 of the citrate study group were on standard CVVHDF and 18 on standard CVVH. All heparine controls were on CVVHDF. Both groups were treated on Baxter Aquarius, polysulfone filters Aquamax 1.9 m2. Samples for acidbase, iont, albumine and citrate analysis were taken from central venous catheter, ports pre and post filter and from dialysate/filtrate 24 h after commencing with CRRT (T0) and 60 min later (T1). The settings were kept constant between T0 and T1. Citrate levels were measured with capillary zone electroforesis. RESULTS. The load of citrate in CVVH (42.8 \u00b1 17.9 mmol/h) was not different from CVVHDF (33.5 \u00b1 13 mmol/h, p=0.17). Mean dose of citrate was 37.4 \u00b1 15.7 mmol/h, i.e. 898 mmol of citrate/24 h. Controls on heparin lost endogennous citrate (0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mmol/h, p\\ 0.0001). The systemic load of lactate in CVVH (34.5 \u00b1 18.4 mmol/h, 828 mmol/24 h) was lower than in CVVHDF (52.4 \u00b1 19.4 mmol/h, 1258 mmol/24 h, p\\0.02). Control subgroup on heparin with bicarbonate lost 5.53 \u00b1 2.51 mmol/h of endogennous lactate (p \\ 0.00001). The load of glucose (29.2 \u00b1 11.4 mmol/h) in CVVH was similar to the load in CVVHDF (25.0 \u00b1 9.9 mmol/h, p=0.27). Mean dose of glucose was 26.9 \u00b1 10.7 mmol/h, i.e.116 g/24 h. Controls showed insignificant losses of glucose (2.6 \u00b1 3.9 mmol/l, tj. 11.3 g/24 h, p\\0.0001). The mean difference between post and pre filter UA (DUA 11.7 \u00b1 2.8 mmol/l) correlated significantly with mean difference of citrate concentrations (Dcitrate 4.1 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/l, r=0.80, r 2 =0.63, p \\ 0.00001). Regression analysis revealed mean prediction error Dcitrate 0.60 \u00b1 0.4 mmol/l using DUA. CONCLUSIONS. Systemic dose of citrate is not negligible and can be predicted using difference of UA in the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate CRRT might represent significant load of substrates for intermediate metabolism particularly if administered with lactate buffer. 2.2% ACD causes also significant load of glucose. INFLUENCE OF CONTINUOUS VENOVENOUS HEMOFILTRATION (CVVH) AND CATHETER POSITION ON TRANSPULMONARY THERMODILUTION DERIVED PARAMETERS WITH PICCO A. Van Craenenbroeck 1 , A. Van Ingelgem 1 , P.-J.

Malbrain 1 1 ZNA Stuivenberg, Intensive Care Medicine, Antwerpen, Belgium INTRODUCTION. Interpreting hemodynamic parameters obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution (TD) techniques can be a challenge during CVVH. Previous studies showed that CVVH lowers cardiac index (CI) and global end diastolic volume (GEDVi) while it increases extravascular lung water (EVLWi) [1]. Others showed no influence [2] OBJECTIVES. To study the effects of CVVH and catheter position on PiCCO measurements. METHODS. In 30 mechanically ventilated pts (18 male), 107 paired PiCCO calibrations were performed without/during CVVH. Age 66.1 \u00b1 5.24, BMI 25.4 \u00b1 4, SAPS II 60.2 \u00b1 12.3 and SOFA score 14.3 \u00b1 4.2. For each calibration 3 consecutive injections of 20 mL cold saline via central venous line (CVL), giving 642 TDs. Abdominal pressure (IAP) measured via bladder. Values mean \u00b1 SD.RESULTS. Blood flow 129.7 \u00b1 35 ml/min, ultrafiltration 123.7 \u00b1 107.6 ml/h, pre-and postdilution rates 1913 \u00b1 478 versus 996 \u00b1 352 ml/h respectively. Regardless of catheter position, CI decreased from 4.4 \u00b1 3.1 to 3.8 \u00b1 1.1 L/min.m2 (p \\ 0.0001) and GEDVi from 1,001 \u00b1 240 to 846 \u00b1 164 ml/m 2 (p \\ 0.0001) during CVVH while EVLWi increased from 11.4 \u00b1 4.6 to 12.4 \u00b1 5.1 (p=NS), and from 12.9 \u00b1 4.7 to 14.1 \u00b1 5.3 when indexed to predicted body weight (p=0.08). The results of a subgroup analysis comparing correct catheter position (CVL jugular or subclavian and dialysis catheter femoral, 67 paired measurements in 25 pts) and wrong position (dialysis catheter positioned in between thermodilution injection and detection site, 40 paired measurements in 14 pts) are summarized in theTable 1.",

To report on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of acute renal failure (ARF) and on renal replacement therapies (RRT) in Spanish ICUs.METHODS. The 27 ICUs participating in the ''Sabadell Score Validation Study'' (1) completed a questionnaire about the routine management of ARF and RRT. We contrasted these results with the Sabadell Score database for every ICU to obtain a profile of clinical practice and patient outcomes. Variables were described by means and SD and analyzed for mortality by the Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests.RESULTS. We analyzed data from 3670 patients, 764 (21%) of whom developed ARF. Hospital mortality was slightly higher than predicted in ARF patients (45 vs. 37%) and lower than predicted in patients without ARF (12 vs. 16%). Serum creatine was used to diagnose ARF in 100% of the ICUs, oliguria in 96%, and urea in 55%. Fluid therapy was based mainly on crystalloids in 70% of centers, on colloids in 11%, and on both in 19%, without impact on mortality (21 vs. 20%, p=0.7). Diuretic therapy in established ARF was reported by 89% of ICUs, with no significant impact on mortality (43 vs. 46%, p=0.3). The threshold for starting RRT was 189 \u00b1 52 mg/dl for urea, 3.3 \u00b1 1.44 mg/dl for creatinine, and 546 \u00b1 200 ml/day for oliguria. Based on the RIFLE/AKIN classifications, 16 ICUs were defined as ''early RRT'' because RRT was applied before phase F/3. Mortality was significantly higher in ''early RRT'' (48 vs. 42%, p=0.04). Continuous RRT was used in 92% of centers and intermittently in 11%, with no significant differences in mortality (45 vs. 52%, p=0.2). High flow RRT was applied in only 26% of ICUs, with no significant differences in mortality (47 vs. 44%, p=0.3).",

Nandha 2 1 Fortis Hospital, Critical Care, Mohali, India, 2 Dr. H.S.J Institute of Dental Sciences, Pharmacology, Chandigarh, India INTRODUCTION. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common problem in Intensive Care Units (ICU) and large proportion of these patients require Renal replacement therapy(RRT). In India early recognition and treatment of AKI itself is a big challenge because of scarcity of resources OBJECTIVES. We sought to evaluate the outcome of these patients with AKI who received RRT. METHODS. Out of 625 admissions to multidisciplinary intensive care unit in northern India between 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2009, we retrospectively reviewed the data of the patients with AKI who recieved RRT. 70 patients, 47 (67%) males and 23 (33%) females were included in the study. Demographic data, co-morbidities, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, aetiology of AKI, degree of AKI at admission according to RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease) classification, timing of RRT, number and modality of dialysis used, source of admission, length of stay (LOS) in ICU and hospital along with Outcome were documented. RESULTS. The overall hospital mortality in these patients was found to be 70%. The most common factor contributing to AKI was sepsis, 54 (77.1%) patients and Nonseptic group had 20 (22.9%) patients. Patients with sepsis related AKI had higher in-hospital mortality as compared to non septic AKI (72.22 vs. 62.5%).Patients who were admitted directly from emergency room (ER) had a lower mortality compared to those admitted from wards in the same hospital, (59.45 vs. 81.8%,P= 0.042). The mortality of patients in Failure group (61.36%) was lower than the Risk (85.7%) and Injury group (81.1%). This may be attributed to early institution of RRT in the Failure group, 90.9% received RRT within 24 h of ICU admission as compared to 64% in Risk and 63.6% in Injury group (P = 0.003). The mean(\u00b1SD) APACHE II score of non survivors 26.69 (8.95) was higher than the survivors 21.86 (4.62) with P=0.022. The mean (\u00b1SD) ICU and hospital LOS of survivors 13.00 (9.57) and 19.86 (13.16) days respectively were higher than non survivors 8.20 (9.56) and 10.37 (11.08) days. CONCLUSIONS. Our results showed that that mortality of patients with ARF requiring hemodialysis remains high. Direct admission from ER and Early intervention with RRT is associted with improved survival. Higher APACHE II score is associated with higher mortality. In survivors ARF is associated with prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. REFERENCE(S). 1.

CRRT treatment parameters were: blood flow 205 \u00b1 48 ml/min; replacement flow 1,892 \u00b1 648 ml/h; dialysate flow 380 \u00b1 372 ml/h and fluid balance -136 \u00b1 80 ml/h. Twenty-one filters were removed because of filter clotting or alarm ''tendency to clotting'' (group 1), fourteen because of alarm ''high TMP'' (group 2), and fifteen for other heterogeneous reasons. TMP and ultrafiltration coefficient showed good inverse correlation at T 1 (r = -0.723; p\\0.001) and T 2 (r = -0.633; p\\0.001). TMP showed significant differences between group 2 and 1 at T 1 and T 2 (276 \u00b1 51 vs. 211 \u00b1 61 mmHg; p \\ 0.002 and 240 \u00b1 52 vs. 162 \u00b1 49 mmHg; p \\ 0.001 respectively). However, ultrafiltration coefficient did not showed statistical differences between both groups at T 1 (8.9 \u00b1 2.9 vs. 9.6 \u00b1 3.8 ml/h/mmHg; p=0.569) or T 2 (10.4 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 11.9 \u00b1 3.4 ml/h/ mmHg; p=0.206). When replacement flow was[2000 ml/h (n=23), TMP showed higher values compared with others (n=27) both in T 1 (247 \u00b1 62 vs. 195 \u00b1 76 mmHg; p=0.011) and T 2 (224 \u00b1 58 vs. 150 \u00b1 51 mmHg; p\\0.001). On the contrary, ultrafiltration coefficient showed no statistical differences comparing same groups and times respectively (10.4 \u00b1 3.7 vs. 9.3 \u00b1 3.6 ml/h/mmHg; p=0.287 and 11.6 \u00b1 4.2 vs. 11.4 \u00b1 3.3 ml/h/mmHg; p=0.852).CONCLUSIONS. Our data suggest that TMP is not always reliable as an indicator of filter clotting. The calculation of ultrafiltration coefficient may be a useful tool to decide remove the filter, especially in patients with higher volumes of replacement.REFERENCE(S). None.

Despite advances in dyalisis technology, many questions remain about how best to provide renal replacament to patients with acute renal failure (ARF).OBJECTIVES. To describe patients profile admitted in our intensive care unit (ICU) with ARF that have been treated with renal replacement therapies (RRT). We analyzed treatment variation over a period of 10 years. METHODS. Prospective observational study of all patients treated in our medical-surgical ICU (26 beds) with ARF that needed RRT. Patients were treated with intermittent hemodyalisis (IHD), continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), continuos venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) or high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF). We collected epidemiological data, risc factors, severity using APACHEII score and RIFLE classification, ARF etiology, RRT and days of technique, ICU mortality and renal function recovery. We divided the period in two parts according with a change in our treatment protocol that includes HVHF techniques in the last one; part1  (2000-2004)  and part2 (2005-2009). Data are presented as median or percentage.We have compared the two periods using student test for continuous variables and Chi-square for categorical ones. RESULTS. A total of 304 pacients were treated (part 1 n= 126, part 2 n= 178).Age was 64.7 \u00b1 13.8 years and 66 \u00b1 14.2; (p 0.43) respectively, with an APACHEII score 24 \u00b1 10 and 22 \u00b1 8; (p 0.13).Sepsis was the principal etiology of ARF (61%), mainly respiratory and abdominal.A total of 85.5% patients had risc factors for ARF with an increase in the part 2 (81.7 vs. 88.2%;p 0.08).Importantly we have noted an increase in patients with neoplasms treated with RRT in the last one.Its surprising that in the second period community ARF was by far more prevalent that in the first one (28 vs. 72%; p\\0.005).RIFLE classification was Failure in 86.5% of patients. ARF was prerenal in 94%. Related to RRT method, IHD was applied (as unique technique or combined with others) in 49% of patients.Continuous RRT were used in 75% of patients with an increment of patients that combines more than one technique (16.7 vs. 30.9%; p 0.01).We have observed that in continuous techniques, CVVH and HVHF have significantly increased in the last period (p 0.013 and\\0.001, respectively) with an important decrease of CVVHDF (p 0.04).They were less days of therapy in the second period (19.7 vs. 12.3 days; p 0.015).Total ICU mortality was 52.3% found a decrease in the last period mortality (61.9 vs. 45.5%: p 0.003). Survivors have normal renal function at ICU discharge in 56.7% in the part 2 versus 72.9 in the first with more patients treated with IHD in the second period (10.4 vs. 26.8%). CONCLUSIONS. In the second period of study, we observed an increase of patients treated, using more convective techniques with less days of therapy duration. It was observed a significant reduction in ICU mortality in the last period with more patients under replacament theraphy at ICU discharge.IMPLEMENTATION OF ILCOR GUIDELINES ON THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHER-MIA AFTER CARDIAC ARREST INA UK DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITAL: A FOUR-YEAR EXPERIENCE M. Wakatsuki 1 , A. Keeton 1 , B. Harris 1 , K. Shammas 1 , F. Noble 1 , D. Pogson 1 1 Queen Alexandra Hospital, Department of Critical Care, Portsmouth, UK INTRODUCTION. International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) guidelines on therapeutic hypothermia (TH) [1] following Out of Hospital (OOH) cardiac arrest due to Ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) were published in 2003. At our institution, these were implemented in 2005 and have subsequently audited our performance against ILCOR standards. The developments in our hospital include an introduction of the local guidelines in 2007 [2] and the use of intravascular cooling device (IVCD) in 2009. OBJECTIVES. To review the performance of our institution between 2005-2009 on TH after cardiac arrest. METHODS. Three non-consecutive 12 months of retrospective data between 2005-2009 were collected from the patients admitted to our ICU presenting with cardiac arrest. [3, 4] The following were reviewed: the number of cardiac arrests and their initial presenting rhythms; number of those who met the criteria for TH and subsequently cooled; survival rate of TH and their neurological outcome. RESULTS. There were 211 patients in the 3 years who were admitted to the ICU following cardiac arrest [68 (32%) OOH VF/VT, 16 (8%) in hospital (IH) VF/VT, 55 (26%) OOH non-VF/ VT, 72 (34%) IH non-VF/VT]. Of the OOH VF/VT patients, 67% underwent TH in 2005-2006 and after the introduction of a local guideline in 2006, this rate rose to 100% in 2008 and 2009. Altogether we have instituted TH in 77 patients which includes rhythms other than OOH VF/VT. The survival and neurological outcomes of the TH patients are shown inTable 1.CONCLUSIONS. Introduction of a local guideline has led to an improved compliance for TH in all eligible patients presenting with cardiac arrest. Our survival figures following TH are similar to those from the published data",

In this university teaching hospital Intensive Care Unit, therapeutic hypothermia is delivered using an intravascular catheter (Coolgard 3000 TM or Thermogard XP TM , Alsius Corp, USA). Our protocol is to cool to 34\u00b0C within 6 h post cardiac arrest for 24 h, then re-warm at B0.25\u00b0C/h.OBJECTIVES.To assess adherence to this protocol, outcomes and complications following the introduction of intravascular cooling.METHODS. Data on patient characteristics, presenting rhythm, time to initiate cooling, time to reach target temperature, time at target temperature, time to re-warm, length of time catheter left in situ, complications, mortality and morbidity were prospectively collected on all patients treated with intravascular cooling following out of hospital cardiac arrest between January 2008 and December 2009.RESULTS. 25 patients (20 male) underwent therapeutic hypothermia [median age 64 years (range 38-82)]. 23 had a presenting rhythm of VF and 2 pulseless electrical activity (PEA). 13 (52%) of the catheters were inserted in the emergency department (ED), 12 in ICU. The median time from arrival at hospital to transfer to ICU was 3.03 h (0.6-8.9).Table 1. summarises the results. 7 (28%) patients reached 34\u00b0C within 6 h of arrest. Target temperature was maintained until decision to rewarm in 19 (76%) patients. Re-warming to 36\u00b0C at a rate of 0.25\u00b0C/h was achieved in 14 (56%) patients. 4 (16%) patients died before re-warming. Complications included arrhythmias [7 (28%)], pneumonia, coagulopathy and arterio-venous fistula (1 of each).The catheter was used to control pyrexia after re-warming in 9 (60%) of the pyrexial patients. 15 (60%) patients survived ICU and all of these survived to hospital discharge, of which 8 (53%) had normal neurological status and 3 (20%) had mild cognitive impairment.",

The primary endpoint coagulation status at the time of a thromboembolic stroke or in the preceding 2 weeks compared with coagulation status in patients without a thromboembolic stroke (controls) was assessed by means of logistic regression analysis.RESULTS. Forty-one strokes occurred in 24 patients. Except for preoperative cardiac index there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Patients in group II (RR 7.8; 95% CI 1.1-56) and III (RR 4.4; 95% CI 0.6-33) had an increased risk for thromboembolic stroke compared with patients in group I, but this was only borderline statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS. We could not detect a decreased risk for thromboembolic stroke in patients with an intermediate or high coagulation status, which suggest that the use of coumarines or heparin has no additional value to antiplatelets. No clear differences were seen between the type of VAD and incidences of stroke.AN AUDIT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF POST CARDIAC ARREST PATIENTS ADMITTED TO INTENSIVE CARE IN A DISTRICT GENERAL HOSPITALC.L.

Of the 18 out of hospital (OOH) arrests, 13 had a shockable rhythm, while two-thirds of in hospital (IH) arrests were nonshockable. 76% of patients had a GCS less than eight. Primary cardiac disease accounted for 21 arrests, 10 met intervention criteria. Six had lysis or stenting, while four received antiplatelet agents and enoxaparin. 82% of patients required inotropes; an adequate blood pressure was achieved in 91% of patients. Carbon dioxide and blood glucose were difficult to manage with only 25 and 20% consistently achieving recommended targets. In total 16 patients were cooled, this included all OOHVF arrests as per guidelines, 50% of IHVF/VT and one IHPEA. An intravenous cooling catheter was used in half of cases. The catheter cooled more patients to the desired temperature (100 vs. 50%), achieved the required temperature faster (1.3 vs. 3.9 h) and maintained temperatures more reliably than conventional methods. Survivors were younger, had less co-morbidities and more shockable rhythms but had similar inotrope requirements and GCS. They had longer ICU (2.6 vs. 3.6 days) stays.Catheter versus conventional cooling CONCLUSIONS. Our post cardiac arrest care can be improved, despite this outcome was similar to published data. Attempted cooling met current guidelines but conventional methods were less satisfactory than the catheter technique. Introduction of care bundles may improve our overall care.REFERENCE(S). 1.

Suzuki 1 1 Yokohama City University Medical Center, Critical Care and Emergency Center, Yokohama, Japan INTRODUCTION. Although guidelines for CPR teach us to do 100 times of chest compression (CC) per minute, all types of out-of-hospital emergency technicians such as paramedics or emergency life support technicians (ELSTs) are known to tend to perform CC more quickly and ventilation more slowly. The ratio of CC and ventilation they have been taught was changed from 15:2 to 30:2 after 2005 according to the change of international guidelines. However, it is unclear how this change effect the appropriateness of the frequency of CC and ventilation on the scene and in the ambulance.OBJECTIVES. The object of this study is to clarify the effect of the change of educational strategy for CPR according to the change of the guideline on the quality of CPR by ELSTs in the ambulance.METHODS.We recorded the frequency of CC and ventilation performed by Japanese ELSTs during CPR in the ambulances, and the frequency of CC and ventilation were compared between the first period when ELSTs performed CPR according to the guideline 2000 (15:2 CPR) and the second period when they perform CPR according to the guideline 2005 (30:2 CPR). In our special out-of-hospital EMS system for CPA patients in Yokohama, 12 hospitals have been selected to receive and to treat CPA patients, one emergency director (medical doctor) belongs in these 12 hospitals is always conducting his duties in the ambulance operation center in shift, and he/she advices some treatment to ELST and notifies the transfer of the CPA patients to these 12 hospitals, and he/she continue to talk with ELSTs from the contact with the patients to the arrival on the hospital. The emergency director can detect the frequency of CC and ventilation by ELSTs in the ambulance during his/her work.RESULTS.In the first period, ELST performed CC 15 times per 7.2 s, (125 times per minute), and performed 2 ventilations for 4.5 s. 36% of patients underwent appropriate CC (100-120) whereas 43% underwent high-frequency CC (120-150) and 13% too quick CC (more than 150). In the second period, they performed CC 30 times per 18.1 s (99 times per minute), and performed 2 ventilation for 4.3 s. CONCLUSIONS. Although ELSTs performed inappropriate CPR (rapider CC and slower ventilation) in ambulances in the time when they were taught to do 15:2 CPR, according to the concept recommended in the guideline 2000, they now perform more appropriate CPR according to the guideline 2005. To educate the concept of 30:2 CPR described in the guideline 2005 can lead ELSTs to do more appropriate CPR.

CORRELATION BETWEEN ARTERIAL AND VENOUS LACTATES AND BLOOD GASES IN ACUTE POISONINGS TREATED WITH EXTRACORPOREAL LIFE SUPPORT FOR REFRACTORY CARDIAC FAILURE OR ARREST B. M\u00e9garbane 1 , C.

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been proposed as an alternative rescue method to treat patients suffering from cardiac failure or arrest if not responding to conventional treatment and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.OBJECTIVES. Our aims were:(1)  to study the correlations between arterial and venous lactates and blood gases in these poisonings associated with extremely poor cardiovascular conditions and (2) to assess their respective predictive values regarding survival at 24 h in case of cardiac arrest and ICU discharge in case of cardiac failure.METHODS.We designed a prospective study including all ECLS-treated patients in our toxicological ICU with arterial and venous samplings obtained at the time of femoral vessel cannulation to measure lactates and blood gases. We calculated the inotropic score, roughly representing the severity of myocardial dysfunction [IS (lg/kg/min)= dopamine ? dobutamine ? isopr\u00e9nalinex100 ? adr\u00e9nalinex100 ? noradr\u00e9naline 9 100]. Results were expressed as median [25-75%-percentiles]. Correlations were performed using Pearson tests, univariate comparisons using v 2 and Mann-Whitney tests, and multivariate analysis using logistic regression with Odds ratio (OR) and 95%-confidence interval determination.RESULTS. Twenty-eight patients (14 M/18F, 42 years [34-51], SAPSII: 82 [72-89]) were included. Among these patients, 23 were in refractory cardiac arrest (low flow: 150 min [105-172], 24 h-survival rate: 47% and ICU survival rate: 11%), while 19 in severe cardiac failure (inotropic score: 145 lg/kg/min [105-243] and ICU survival rate: 67%)]). Poisonings involved sodium-channel blockers (21/28), meprobamate (2/28), and calcium-channel blockers (1/28). Whatever the indication of ECLS was, correlations between arterial and venous lactate (R 2 =0.78), bicarbonate (R 2 =0.85), base excess (R 2 =0.92), pH (R 2 =0.88), and PCO 2 (R 2 =0.49) were good (p \\ 0.0001). In contrast to the low-flow duration, none of these parameters were significantly associated with the 24 h-survival rate in cardiac arrest patients. Based on a multivariate analysis, the arterial lactate concentration measured at the time of cannulation (9.4 mmol/l [6.3-12.2]) was the only predictive factor of survival in ECLS-treated patients for cardiac failure (OR: 16 [1.1-234.3] for lactate concentrations[8 mmol/l).CONCLUSIONS. Despite good correlations between their corresponding parameters, arterial and venous samplings remain complementary in case of extremely poor cardiac conditions to better evaluate oxygenation level as well as the respiratory/metabolic acidosis parts.EARLY INITIATION OF THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AFTER CARDIAC ARREST AND CORRELATION WITH SURVIVAL AND NEUROLOGIC OUT-COME: AN ITALIAN REPORTS. Alongi 1 , F. Polli 1 , M. Panigada 1 , for the ICE Group (Italian Cooling Experience)1  Fondazione IRCCS 'Ca Granda' Policlinico, Milan, ItalyINTRODUCTION. Therapeutic hypothermia should be part of standardised treatmentstrategy for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The optimal timing of initiation has not been clinically defined, corrent consensus is to initiate cooling as soon as possible[1]    OBJECTIVE. To evaluate the effects of early initiation of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) after cardiac arrest (CA) on survival and neurologic outcome.METHODS.We enrolled all patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after a CA (22 participating Italian ICUs). We recorded the time (minutes) from CA to the beginning of basic life support resuscitation manoeuvres (CA-BLS) and that from CA to the return of spontaneous circulation (CA-ROSC). Patients who had received TH were divided into two groups: early TH (group 1: TH initiated \\2 h from CA) and late TH (group 2: TH initiated 2-6 h from CA). Survival at ICU discharge and at 6 months after CA was recorded. Favourable neurologic outcome was evaluated according to the Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category (CPC). Good neurologic outcome occurred with CPC 1 (good cerebral performance) or CPC 2 (moderate cerebral disability).RESULTS. FromJanuary to September 2009, 149 patients were admitted to the participating ICUs after experiencing CA (age 64 \u00b1 15 years; M/F = 103/43; 67 out-of-hospital CA [OHCA]). One hundred patients underwent TH (70 in group 1 and 30 in group 2). The main results are shown in theTable 1below.",

Maldonado 2,3 1 Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, USA, 2 Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Trauma Center, Neptune, USA, 3 Maimonides Medical Center, Surgical Critical Care, Brooklyn, USAINTRODUCTION. Percutaneous tracheostomy is a common procedure in many Trauma Intensive Care units. Concerns about the safety of percutaneous tracheostomy in patients without cervical spine clearance or with cervical spine injury limited its adoption for some surgeons. Most experts recommend the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy during percutaneous tracheostomy.OBJECTIVES.To determine the safety of performing percutaneous tracheostomy in trauma patients with either no cervical spine clearance status or with cervical spine injury.METHODS. : From 1/1/2001 to 12/31/2007 we retrospectively evaluated the medical records of all patients with blunt trauma who required tracheostomy in a Level II Trauma Center. Data was gathered from a trauma registry database and medical records. Patients were divided in two groups, Open Tracheostomy (OT) and Percutaneous Tracheostomy (PT). Patient age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), type of tracheostomy insertion method, cervical spine clearance status prior to tracheostomy, presence of cervical spine injury, use of bronchoscopy assistance in percutaneous tracheostomy, and immediate complications post tracheostomy were recorded for each patient. The results: The total number of tracheotomies during the study period was 220 of which 125 (56%) were PT and 95(44%) were OT. Both groups were similar in age, sex and ISS distribution. Of the OT group, 60 (63%) were done in patients with no cervical spine clearance or cervical spine injury. No immediate complications were reported in the OT group. The PT group had 63 cases (50.4%) done with no pre-operative cervical spine clearance or positive for cervical spine injury. The PT group underwent the procedure without bronchoscopy assistance in 95% of the cases. Two cases (1.5%) in the PT group were reported with postoperative bleeding from the insertion site that did not required intervention. Both cases were PT done without bronchoscopy assistance and did not have pre-operative cervical spine clearance. No other immediate complications were reported.RESULTS.The results of this study suggest that PT is safe in trauma patients without preoperative cervical spine clearance or with cervical injuries as compared with the OT group. Most of the PT cases were done without bronchoscopy assistance (95%).CONCLUSIONS. Percutaneous tracheostomy without bronchoscopic guidance is safe and efficacious in trauma patients even if cervical spine injury has not been excluded.INTRODUCTION. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a great problem of Public Health and the first cause of mortality and dysfunction in youth and adult live.

Demographic, epidemiologic and clinical data were recorded. Validated measurement scales such as Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and the quality of life questionnaire PAEEC (Project for the Epidemiological Analysis of Critical Patients), considering basic physiological activities, normal daily activities and emotional state, at discharge and 1 year after by phone contact, were used. Comparison between groups was made using the Chi-square and t Student tests.RESULTS.We included in the study data from 447 patients (Table 1). TBI were usually caused by traffic accidents. Cranial computed tomography (CT) scan most frequent findings were diffuse injury II and III (51%) following Marshall classification. GOS 2-3 at discharge from ICU and 1 year postinjury were, respectively, 85.1 and 45.9% in the GCS B 8 group, and 76.3 vs. 21.2% in the GCS C 9 group (in both cases, p\\0.0001). One year after discharge 245 of the 323 surviving patients answered the questionnaire (75.85%): severe physiologic dysfunction, great dependence in daily activities and emotional disturbances were detected when leaving ICU and marked as 60.1, 89.9 and 70.9%, while 1 year after they were 19.3, 33.3 and 38%, respectively (p=0.0001) in the GCS B 8 group. The results in the GCS C 9 group were 30.4, 68.6 and 42.2% when leaving ICU and 11.2, 13.3 and 27.6% after 1 year follow up, respectively (p=0.0001).",

Jim\u00e9nez 1 1 Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru\u00f1a, A Coru\u00f1a, SpainINTRODUCTION. Abdominal trauma is frequently associated in patients with multiple injuries. It is frequently under-diagnosed initially by coexistence with other injuries, so it is important to know the characteristics of these patients.OBJECTIVES. In our study we describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and specific management of the patients with abdominal trauma.METHODS.Retrospective study of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) for 6 years (January 2004-December 2009). Epidemiological variables were studied, mechanism and type of trauma, APACHE II, Injury Severity Score(ISS), Revised Trauma Score(RTS), Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS); laboratory values, therapeutic management, complications and mortality. We made a descriptive analysis: estimation percentage with 95% confiance interval (CI) to define cualitative variables and mean \u00b1 standard desviation (SD) for cuantitative variables.RESULTS. 209 patients were included. The mean age was 40.9 \u00b1 18.5 years. Male were 79.4% (CI 74.2-85.6). The most common injury mechanism was circulation accident: cars 40.2% (CI 31.5-45.5), motorcycles 19.6% (13.8-25.2). 88% were closed (CI 81.5-91.5). 29.4% showed peritonism (CI 23.5-37.0). The most frequently injury associated was chest trauma (61.7% CI 52.3-66.5) followed by Traumatic Brain Injury (38.8% CI 29-43). Mean initial GCS was 13.4 \u00b1 3.7. Hemoperitoneum was present in 49.8% (CI 44.8-59.2).The most commonly organ affected was the spleen (45.9%), severe splenic injury was more frequent (52.1%) than mild (grades I, II, III AAST).The second one was the liver(35.8%), mild more frequent than severe(71.1 vs. 28.9%). The most frequently diagnostic test used was the CT (78.5%). The mean pH was 7.31 \u00b1 0.79, hematocrit 35.9 \u00b1 7.8, GOT 270 \u00b1 380, GPT 277 \u00b1 491, total bilirubin 0.7 \u00b1 0.8, CPK 1,410 \u00b1 1,548.2, Amylase 103.5 \u00b1 178.9, PT 17 \u00b1 11.5, APTT 30.4 \u00b1 14.1. 49.8% needed surgical treatment (CI 40.8-55.2). Cathecolamines were used in 32.2% (CI 26.8-40.5), more in the medical group(42.3 vs. 22.1%). 48.1% needed mechanical ventilation(CI 37.5-51.9). 51.8% needed blood transfusion. 90.7% of the patients received nutrition in ICU, preferently by enteral route. 16.8% of the patients presented late complications. The scores were: ISS 34.5 \u00b1 16.9 (survivors 33 \u00b1 15.5 vs. dead men 56.7 \u00b1 21.1), RTS 10.1 \u00b1 1.9, APACHE II 14.9 \u00b1 7.9 (medical: 11.8 \u00b1 8.1 vs. surgical 17.9 \u00b1 6.3).The mean ICU length of stay period was 12.5 \u00b1 15.4 days and in the hospital 39.8 \u00b1 51 days. The global mortality in ICU was 6.2% (CI 3.6-11.1): medical 2.9 versus 9.6% surgical patients.CONCLUSIONS. Abdominal trauma occurs in young patients, especially in traffic accidents. The initial physical examination is unreliable for diagnosis. There is frequent association with chest trauma. The most frequent lesion is the spleen, followed by the liver. More than half received conservative treatment, especially in the spleen. We found higher mortality in the surgical group.W. Yichun 1 , L.

To assess the effectiveness of the implementation of Mepentol milk \u00d2 versus Mepentol oil \u00d2 in the prevention of pressure sores (PS) in critically ill patients with poor tissue perfusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Pilot randomized clinical trial. Patients admitted without pressure ulcers and capillary refill time [2 s were enrolled. A standardized PS prevention protocol was implemeted in all ICU patients. The control group was prescribed with Mepentol oil \u00d2 and the intervention group was prescribed Mepentol milk \u00d2 . Patient's follow up was assessed every 24 h over 5 consecutive days. Independent Variables: age, sex, comorbidities, APACHE II score, risk of pressure sores (using EMINA score), preventive measures, capillary refill time. A descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed to assess the homogeneity of the two groups, using SPSS 15.0. (a = 0.5) RESULTS. 34 patients [median age of 56 (26-84) years] were included, being 28 (82.35%) men. Thirty-one (91.2%) completed the study, and three died. The mean global capillary refill time was 7.06 s (DE: 3.7). Both groups were found to be homogeneous. The incidence rate of PS in the control group was 47.1 versus 14.2% in the experimental group. OR for PS was 0.18 (95% CI 0.03-1.10). CONCLUSIONS. Hyper-oxygenated fatty acids in the milk formulation may have a protective effect, reducing the risk of pressure sores in patients with severely compromised tissue perfussion when compared with an oil formulation.

When examining the absolute number of PRBC units\\14 days old as a percentage of total transfusion burden, the protective effect of age was no longer significant (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-1.00, p=0.13) nor was it after dichotomization at 14 days (OR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.03-1.04, p=0.06). Odds ratios for a protective effect of increasing PRBC age that did not reach significance were universally seen through all analyses of MODS and infection. Modelrepetition using a 21 day break point showed the same results as the 14 day analysis. AUCs for models 1-3: survival: 0.85, MODS: 0.75, infection: 0.72. CONCLUSION. These results duplicate our group's previous work by finding a small protective effect of advancing mean PRBC age on survival and at a minimum an abrogation of the detrimental effects of age on transfused PRBCs.

Pulse Pressure Analysis refers to monitors that can track stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) continuously from the analysis of the arterial pressure waveform. There are different monitors available on the market: PiCCOplus (Pulsion, Munich, Germany), LiDCO TM plus and LiDCO TM rapid (LidCO, Cambridge, UK), Flotrac Vigileo System (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, USA) and PRAM (Vytech, Padova, Italy).OBJECTIVES. To analyse validation data for devices based on pulse pressure analysis algorithms. METHODS. We searched on Medline and EMBASE for cardiac output validation studies on pulse pressure analysis. We collected data on bias, limits of agrement (2SD) and where available percentage error (PE). Analysis of the PE based on different levels of precision of the reference technique were performed as described by Cecconi et al.[1]  For PiCCOplus and LiDCO TM plus studies assessing the accuracy and the precision of the calibration technique against the pulmonary artery catheter were also analysed. RESULTS. 75 articles were initially identified: 21 articles for the PiCCO system, 18 for the LiDCO system, 13 for the PRAM and 23 for the Vigileo. After exclusion of studies not reporting Bland-Altman Analysis in adult patients the following number of studies were selected: 9 for PiCCO system transpulmonary thermodilution, 6 for the PiCCO system pulse contour analysis, 4 for the LiDCO lithium dilution, 5 for the LiDCO PulseCO pulse power analysis, 21 for the Vigileo pulse pressure analysis, 4 for the PRAM pulse pressure analysis. Number of patients and of observation, mean CO, 2SD, PE for each monitor are summarized inTable 1. Estimated coefficient of variation (CV) of the technique based on different levels of CV of the reference technique (5, 10 and 15%) are also reported. CONCLUSIONS. There was acceptable bias for all techniques. PiCCO and LiDCO systems showed the best percentage error.

Postoperative analgesia regimens commonly employ opioid analgesics, which often result in varying degrees of respiratory depression and sedation. Clinically worrisome respiratory depression or sedation owing to opioid therapy is typically reversed with intravenous naloxone. While the use of naloxone rescue has been examined in a number of small studies, there is no current national estimate of its incidence or associated outcomes. We hypothesize that the use of naloxone rescue after abdominal surgery is uncommon but associated with adverse outcomes and resource use.OBJECTIVES. The objectives of this study are to estimate the burden of postoperative respiratory depression and sedation following abdominal surgery.",

            "text": "We selected patients undergoing intra-abdominal surgery from the Premier Perspective database between 2005 and 2008 using Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes 1 . Data extracted included demographic characteristics, International Classification of Disease ver. 9 (ICD-9) codes, discharge disposition, length of stay, and total hospital patient cost. Administration of parenteral opioids and naloxone rescue was determined for each admission using hospital charge codes. Incidence of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was identified using ICD-9 code 93.90. Comparison of means and proportions were determined using independent-samples T tests and Pearson's Chi-square test, respectively.RESULTS. There were 894,076 surgical discharges after abdominal surgery, 809,340 (90.5%) of which received parenteral opioids during their stay. The incidence of naloxone rescue in this cohort was 3.7% (30.244). Inhospital mortality for the naloxone group compared to the nonnaloxone group was 8.4 vs. 3.3%, respectively (p\\0.001). Incidence of noninvasive ventilation (2.69 vs. 0.96%, p\\0.001), mean hospital length of stay (16 vs. 8, p\\0.001), and mean hospital cost ($37,293 vs. $18,971, p\\0.001) varied similarly.CONCLUSIONS. Postoperative naloxone rescue following paraenteral opioids after abdominal surgery is surprisingly common (3.7%) and is associated with significant increases in mortality, hospital length of stay, resource use, and use of ventilatory support. Strategies aimed at earlier detection of respiratory distress, prior to the need for rescue, may lead to greatly improved outcomes and substantial savings. OBJECTIVES. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cumulative effective dose (CED) of radiation resulting from computed tomography, (CT), X-rays and others radiologic studies in critically ill patients.METHODS. This was a prospective study describing radiation exposure associated with all types of diagnostic studies performed on 102 consecutive adult patients, with diverse admission diagnosis, at 12 bed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a large metropolitan hospital in Athens, between 1 November 2009 and March 30 2010. The study period was from the admission until the exit from the ICU.RESULTS. Sixty-seven of the subjects (65.68%) were males, the mean age was 56.38 \u00b1 7.22 years and the mean length of stay were 39.2 \u00b1 17.3 days. Disease severity was assessed by the MOF (mean score: 5.3 \u00b1 1.4), MODS (mean score: 8.4 \u00b1 2.3) APACHE II (mean score: 19.2 \u00b1 7.3) and GCS (mean score: 5.4 \u00b1 1.4) scoring systems. We indentified a total of 956 imaging procedures associated with radiation exposure with a mean number of 13.3 \u00b1 6.0 plain X-rays, 1.3 \u00b1 0.5 CT of the head or brain, 0.7 \u00b1 0.3 CT of the abdomen and of the chest and 0.09 \u00b1 0.04 CT angiography, performed, per patient respectively. The mean CED was 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 millisieverts (mSv) per patients and the mean time period for equivalent effective dose from natural background radiation were 298.9 \u00b1 220.3 days.CONCLUSIONS. Ionizing radiation needs to be considered in the light of total radiation risk to the patients over their lifetime. At this time, risk to benefit ratios of suggested radiologic techniques has yet to be established. INTRODUCTION. There has been a recent emphasis for healthcare organisations to allocate levels of care to patients according to individual clinical need rather than location or other traditional factors [1] . This has in part been responsible for a revision of the Intensive Care Society guideline: Levels of Critical Care for Adult Patients [2] . Previous work has shown that patients managed in closed units have lower mortality, fewer complications and shorter ICU and hospital stays [3, 4] . To our knowledge this is the first report based on the new ICS guideline.",

The outbreak of influenza 2009 A H1N1 had influenced intensive care units all over the world. We describe the characteristics of patients with confirmed A H1N1 influenza requiring admission to intensive care in Regional Hospital Liberec and analyse the impact on intensive care in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS. We retrospectivelly rewieved medical data from all patients admitted to ICU with a positive RT-PCR for pandemic influenza A H1N1. RESULTS. Our hospital is a tertiary care hospital with 800 beds. The estimated population covered for the influenza outbreak was around 250,000 inhabitants. Patients were admitted to a mixed/medical intensive care unit with 16 beds. All patients with a suspicion of influenza A H1N1 were tested on admission by RT-PCR and started on oseltamivir. RT-PCR was performed from nasopharyngeal smear or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). As several patients tested negative from nasopharyngeal smear and positive from BAL and not every patient with a suspected A H1N1 infection had BAL performed, a certain percentage of patients probably went undetected. From November 1st 2009 until February 28th 2010 13 patients required admission to intensive care in Regional Hospital Liberec. All except one were adults, one was a child admitted to a pediatric ICU. Median age was 60, 9 patients were under 65 years of age (69%). Ten patients required intubation, one was only on non invasive ventilation, two did not require ventilation.One patient was pregnant. One patient required ECMO. Three patients died, none from respiratory failure (mortality rate 23%). Median duration of ICU stay was 31 days, median duration of ventilation was 30 days. The median APACHE II score was 20.5. Total number of ICU beddays in our hospital was 286, total number of days on ventilator in our hospital was 223 days. INTRODUCTION. There is compelling data to suggest that intensive care given by dedicated intensivists makes an impact on outcome (1) (2) (3) (4) and that reducing working hours is beneficial to enhance individual performance and to reduce medical errors (5) . Since intensive care is extremely resource demanding, and often coupled with chronic bed and staff shortages, it is paramount that these limited resources are used effectively.OBJECTIVES. To optimize medical and human resource utilization in the ICU, we introduced LEAN concept thinking (LC) in ICU and investigated its effects on outcome parameters and working conditions.",

Using the LC, daily tasks were organized using ''value stream mapping'' and implemented over a 90 day period. All staff, including intensivists, was organized in multi-professional teams with synchronized working hours. Nightshifts were reduced from 16 to 9 h and a three shift work schedule for doctors was applied.Evaluations were done at 90 day and 1 year using unit performance data and questionnaires. The outcome parameters assessed were 1. Unit performance 2. Resource utilization 3. Adherence to departmental guidelines and staff satisfaction.RESULTS. Unit performance showed improved risk adjusted outcome pre versus post intervention (Standard mortality ratio, SMR). This was also seen during weeknights and weekends admissions where risk adjusted outcome improved and reached the same result as daytime admissions. In the same time, time on mechanical ventilation decreased and no change in night discharges, LOS or re-admission rates were seen. No change in demography were seen during the observation period. Work environmernt evaluation index (WEEI) improved and overall adherence to routines was good. As longitudinal risk adjusted outcome improved simultaneously with the reduction of cost per admission in high risk groups and survivors, we interpret this as improved cost effectiveness. Thus, resource utilization improved as well as work satisfaction among all personnel. At the same time, the LC allowed us to utilize 24% of working hours for R&D activities, increased capacity for 4 HDU beds and extended outreach services without additional funding.CONCLUSIONS. In our ICU, introduction of the LC improved unit performance, resource utilization, staff satisfaction and adherence to guidelines. INTRODUCTION. We recently identified near identical shortcomings in performance by young staff members during simulated cardiac arrests in two centres from different nations, and despite different health care delivery models. Chest compressions, when needed, were frequently at too shallow a depth, and at very variable rates. The importance placed on chest compressions, relating to survival from cardiac arrest, means any technique to improve quality of compressions might be beneficial, and is therefore worth exploring. Given the popularity of the iphone, (and its association application aka ''Apps'') we wished to see whether this technology could be used to improve performance. However, what is not known is whether an improvement in quality of chest compressions (i.e. rate and depth) might come at the expense of a delay in their initiation.",

There was also no difference in depth of chest (mean depth of 4.0 cm using iphone application versus 4.1 cm without (p=0.85)). However, there was a statistically significant delay in the initiation of chest compressions associated with use of iphone, (mean of 16.8 s with the iphone vs. 4.8 s without (p\\0.01). Of note, more physicians (42.1 vs. 12%) and more nurses (33.3 vs. 7%) were found to be carrying an iphone compared to pocket CPR guidelines. Staff also reported high levels of comfort and familiarity with this device.CONCLUSIONS. Despite the availability of, and familiarity with the iphone, there was no clear benefit in terms of rate or depth of chest compressions. In addition, despite its suggested benefits (ref), we found the iphone app was association with a delay in the initiation of chest compressions. In short, while clinicians might make the claim that ''Resuscitation, there's an App for that''., our results offer an important caution before changing from the use of pocket guidelines to unproven, albeit popular, technological gimmicks.

The underlying mechanisms include a systemic inflammation related to a whole-body ischaemia/reperfusion syndrome [1] . This inflammation could be due to endotoxinemia linked previously to high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines [1] . We hypothesized that endotoxinemia was related to an ischemic gut injury. Plasma citrulline (Cp), which reflects the functional enterocyte mass [2] , and urinary intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (Iu), which is released in case of intestinal permeability [3] , have been validated to assess gut function. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to examine the release of these biomarkers in the post-CA setting and to search for a correlation with endotoxinemia. METHODS. Following resuscitation after a CA, 21 patients were prospectively included and data were recorded according to Utstein recommendations.

This multicenter prospective cohort study included adult comatose patients admitted after CPR and treated with induced mild hypothermia (32-34\u00b0C RESULTS. The most common diagnosis in our study were brain injuries (29%), followed by subarachnoidal hemorrhage (21%), hemorrhage stroke (18%), brain tumours (11%), ischemic stroke (10%), spinal injuries (6%) and other diagnoses in 5% patients. The average duration of the ventilatory support to tracheostomy was 4 days (rating from 1 to 20). The duration of the procedure averaged 20.5 min (10-75 min). A surgical manipulation with tyreoid gland was necessary in 49% procedures.Majority of the tracheostomed patients were afterward transported into their regional hospitals (42%), 27% patients died in our ICU, 12% patients were transferred in other department within our hospital, 11% patients were decannulated in our hospital after stabilisation of their health condition, 7% were transferred in nursing home or long-term medical care department and 1% in spinal care department.The most common complication we met was bleeding (usually from tyroid gland's bed, in 4.8% procedures), discission of the tracheal ring during tracheal fixation to skin (3.4%) and endotracheal tube cuff perforation (2%). One patient suffered cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation during procedure.CONCLUSIONS. Performing an early tracheostomy (within 7 days of intubation) helps to decrease the level of sedation needed for tracheal tube tolerance, makes weaning from ventilatory support easier, improves pulmonary toilet, and in emergency transport conditions enables easier handling in contrast with intubated patients. Regarding neurointensive patients, at our department we definitely prefer early tracheostomy. Employing the surgical technique with tracheal fixation to the skin facilitates coping with possible periprocedural complications. ",

Actual mean caloric intake was just over half (52%) of the target caloric intake. There was a substantial delay in commencing feeding. Upon subsequent feeding, the reasons for interruptions were predictable and care needs to be taken to emphasise restarting feeding following interventions. Mean caloric intake from propofol only contributed 8% of daily caloric intake. Future work in our ICU will include an assessment of adherence to feeding protocol which has been shown to improve delivery of enteral feeding in critical care 3 OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study is to clarify the usefulness of gauze packing for hemostasis as a DC surgery in patients with thoracic trauma.METHODS. Medical records of 10 patients with chest trauma with uncontrollable intrathoracic hemorrhage who were performed intrathoracic packing as a DC surgery. The change of circulatory condition, volume of discharge from thoracic tube were evaluated and compared between survivors and non-survivors.RESULTS. Five cases survived to discharge (50%) and 5 died. Cause of injuries were traffic accident in 4, free fall in 4, gun shot wound in 1 and struck by falling object in 1 case. All 4 cases due to free fall died. Four cases underwent symultaneous resuscitative laparotomy, and 20 of them survived to discharge. Major origins of hemorrhage in the thoracic cavity was thoracic wall in 5, lung in 6, vertebrae in 1 and descending aorta in 1. Gauze packing were performed for thoracic wall in 3, lung in 4, vertebrae in 2 and descending thoracic aorta in 1; 2 (67%), 1 (33%), 1 (50%) and no patient of them, respectively, survived to discharge. In surviving cases discharge of thoracic drain decreased in 250 ml/h within 5-6 h ( Fig. 1 ).CONCLUSIONS. DC is thought as one of the most useful strategy for thoracic trauma with uncontrollable hemorrhage same as for abdominal trauma, particularly for hemorrhage from thoracic wall or thoracic vertebrae. Chest trauma patients who have been performed intrathoracic packing as a DC surgery and whose thoracic hemorrhage does not decrease in 250 ml/h in 6 h may require re-packing.",

Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is important for survival in acute illness, such as severe trauma. Critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) might be suspected in hypotensive patients that respond poorly to fluids and vasopressor agents. However, the temporal pattern of cortisol secretion after trauma has not been extensively studied [1] . INTRODUCTION. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is an established safe measure for airway management in critically ill patients after acute brain injuries. Tracheostomy in these patients provides a safe airway, facilitates airway suctioning and prevents oral and laryngeal decubitus. In order to achieve early neurorehabilitation, patients are often transferred to a rehabilitation unit with a tracheal canula still in place despite successful weaning from the ventilator.",

This observational study was performed in a mixed surgical and trauma ICU in a university hospital and in a neurorehabilitation ward over a period of 4 years (2006-2009). These are especially patients after acute traumatic brain injuries, ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes and others. Patient charts were reviewed for demographic data and time of tracheostomy, reason of admission, comorbidity and severity of illness were evaluated.RESULTS. From 2006 through 2009, 64 patients requiring tracheostomy in our ICU were discharged with a tracheostomy and observed after acute brain injury. The duration of tracheostomy in the ward was 43 days. According to our data, patients being off the ventilator can early be transferred to a rehabilitation unit with a tracheal canula inside. Minor complications associated with tracheostomy however may occur, but none led to hospital readmission. It also was astonishing to see, that none of the patients could feeded successful oral before decanulation, after decanulation the success rate was nearly 90%, 49 days after PDT. ",

            "text": "Patients with severe TBI, [postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) \\9], were subjected to daily CO 2 vasomotor reactivity testing, starting within 24 h after trauma. CO 2 vasoreactivity was obtained with transcranial Doppler (TCD) on both hemispheres, where the change of cerebral blood flow velocity in response to hyperventilation (reduction of et CO 2 of 6-10 mmHg for 10 min) was measured. The vasomotor reactivity index (VMR index) was calculated as the ratio of percent decrease in averaged mean flow velocity (MFV) and the difference between PaCO 2 measurements before and after hyperventilation. Once the patients needed the vasopressor norepinephrine to maintain a cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) [55 mmHg, additional VMR index was assessed before and after addition of dobutamine. CO was measured with pulse contour analysis (Vigileo\u00d2).RESULTS. 13 patients (mean age 44 \u00b1 18 years, 85% male) were included, 8 patients required norepinephrine and subsequently received dobutamine to increase CO from 6.3 to 8.9 l/min. Dobutamine did not alter ICP significantly (13.9 \u00b1 7.0 vs. 15.0 \u00b1 10.2 mmHg). In 7 of 8 patients who had VMR index assessment without norepinephrine in the first 24 h after the insult, VMR index was below normal in least one hemisphere. Patients who subsequently did not receive norepinephrine had a significant improvement and normalization of VMR index in the following 2 days (see Table 1 ). In contrast, VMR index remained impaired in patients receiving norepinephrine. Augmentation of CO had an unpredictable impact on VMR.CONCLUSIONS. CO 2 vasomotor response is impaired in patients after severe TBI. In patients receiving vasopressor treatment to maintain CPP, recovery of the imparied VMR seems to be delayed. Because the effect of augmentation of CO with dobutamine on CO 2 dependent autoregulation is not predictable, measurement of VMR in these patients is recommended. [1] . Fine motor skills such as intubation are known to be adversely affected by CBRN-PPE but nothing is known about the impact of the patients position (e.g. on the floor) nor the clinical background of the intubator. METHODS. 75 clinicians intubated a manikin on the floor whilst wearing CBRN-PPE as part of major incident training. 54 hospital and 21 prehospital clinicians were timed from picking-up a laryngoscope until ETT placement was confirmed by two independent checks (Positube & EasiCap) (actual position confirmed by researcher). RESULTS. Over a quarter of intubation attempts resulted in failure; either being abandoned (11) or resulting in an oesophageal intubation (9) . The presences of a number of abandoned attempts resulted in the use of 'undetermined in the analysis (Table 1) . Intubation times were analysed using he Mann-Whitney test, with failed intubations assigned the highest rank. Despite a difference of almost 30 s, median intubation times were not significantly different between the two groups (p [ 0.1). Although hospital clinicians had a two-fold higher failed intubation. Although not statistically significant (p[0.1) it would pose a clinical challenge. DISCUSSION. The combination of CBRN-PPE and patient position on the floor has a negative impact on times to intubate resulting in a clinically significant median intubation time exceeding 120 s. Prehospital clinicians tended to perform intubation quicker and with fewer failures but this study lack statistical power to demonstrate a significant difference but serves to demonstrate the potential of a clinician specific difference. CONCLUSION. This subgroup analysis highlights that further investigation is required with regards to patient position and its affects on intubation whilst wearing CBRN-PPE. These results can inform a power calculation for future studies. OBJECTIVES. We aimed to observe critically ill patients with neurological injury receiving Perfalgan \u00d2 as part of their clinical management. The nature and degree of haemodynamic changes were examined using an electronic record.METHODS. Formal REC requirements were waived for this purely observational pilot study. Patient data were logged electronically from bedside monitors at 1 min intervals, as described previously [2] . Twelve separate episodes (one in each of 12 patients) of IV Perfalgan \u00d2 (1000 mg/100 ml over 30 min) administration were captured. Data were manually examined retrospectively, and nonsense values excluded. Demographics are described as medians (range). Patient data are described as means (with 95% CI for the mean on the graph), rounded to meaningful significant figures. As there was a large dataset, repeated measures ANOVA was used to investigate the relationship between the outcome of interest and the time of measurement (30 min pre-paracetamol and four 30 min epochs during and after). Where there was a significant time effect, post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) were performed with the pre-paracetamol epoch as reference. Adjusted p values represent comparisons between first and last epoch.",

The recent growth of mountain sports in Spain has led to an increase of incidents every year. Traditionally, rescues have been carried out by multidisciplinary first aid teams with different medical skills, resources and equipment. In the field of pre-hospital emergencies, the idea of moving patients from the incident scenario to medical assistance facilities (scoop and run) has been replaced by in situ health assistance. This new approach has been developed under different conditions depending on the autonomous community, especially regarding mountain incidents. In situ health care often means that health (rescue) teams have to work in hostile and hazardous environments, not always easily accessible. Advanced technical, physical and psychical training is needed in order to allow for a perfect integration of health professionals into mountain rescue teams.OBJECTIVES. The main objective of this study is to assess the current situation of medicalization in mountain rescue teams in Cantabria and to determine the need of specialized health professionals in those teamsMETHODS. An ecological research survey was developed. All mountain rescues that took place in Cantabria during 2008-2009 were studied. Information was collected from official data coming up from secondary sources.",

In situ health care was provided to 13% of the rescued subjects and 31.4% injured individuals needed fist aid help. No health professional was present when mountain conditions were difficult. Rescues (70%) and patient transfers (60%) were mainly undertaken by the Grupo de Rescate Especial de Intervenci\u00f3n en Monta\u00f1a (GREIM) (70%), a rescue team specialized in mountain incidents with no health professional among its staff. Incidents were mainly caused by falls (33%) and losses (33%), followed by lack of skill and/or lack of appropriate material (16%). 15% of the injures were due to dehydration, hypothermia, and exhaustion, 11% due to fractures in low extremities, 11% to sprain and contusions, and 6% of the injures resulted in deaths CONCLUSIONS. In the Autonomous Community of Cantabria, a high percentage of mountain casualties do not receive in situ health care. Additionally, in a relevant percent of incidents no health care is provided during the patients' transfer to health facilities. Findings from this study highlight the need of medical teams specially trained in mountain rescue. We consider that the public professional model should include the medicalization of mountain rescue services. This approach has already been developed in other autonomous communities for several years and the characteristics of our community are suitable for adopting it. METHODS. During the period from August 2007 to January 2009 151 patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism underwent complete history taken, physical examination chest X-ray, ECG, arterial blood gases analysis spiral CT chest, Echocardiography, and perfusion lung scan (in patients with normal spiral CT chest with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism).RESULTS. 1. The most common risk factors for pulmonary embolism were obesity, bed ridden, vasculitis, trauma, and in 4.6% there was no apparent risk factor. The most common presenting symptom was dyspnea in 43.1%, combination of cough hemoptysis and dyspnea in 25.8%, chest pain and cough in 18.54% and syncope was in 12.58%. Sign of pulmonary embolism included, tachycardia in 58.9%, hypotension (BP less than 90/60 mmHg) in 13.25%, fever and tachycardia in 8.6%, Sign of deep venous thrombosis was present only in 93 patients (61.58%) which included swelling in 78 patients (51. 7%) and leg pain in 15 patients 9.9%. 2. In patients with pulmonary embolism, ECG was normal in 12.8%, sinus tachycardia in 58.11%, S1Q3T3 pattern in 19.65% and right bundle branch block in 9.7%. 3. Chest radiography was normal in 17.94%, pleural effusion in 52.9%, pulmonary infarction in 13.67% and segmental atelectasis in 15.38%. 4. D-dimer was positive in 94% and negative in 6%. 5. Lower limbs duplex ultrasound was normal in 29% and DVT in 71%. 6. Echocardiography was normal in 29%, right ventricular dilatation in 38.46%, main pulmonary artery and right ventricular dilatation in 28.2% and right atrial thrombus in 4.2%. 7. Spiral CT was normal in 4.27% saddle shape embolism in 4.27%, unilateral lobar branches filling defect in 35.8%, bilateral lobar branches filling defect in 15.38%, segmental branches filling defect in 23.9%, and sub segmental branches filling defect in 16.23%. 8. In 39 patients with normal CTPA, perfusion lung scan was done which showed nondiagnostic in 34 (87.17%)patients (with normal D -dimer and normal lower limb duplex) and high probability in 5(12.83) patients with positive D-dimer, so consider as pulmonary embolism. Mortality rate in our study was 4.27% CONSCLUSION: Our finding indicates that spiral CT pulmonary angiography. D-dimer and duplex lower limb ultrasound can diagnosed or exclude pulmonary embolism in 146 of 151 patients (96.6%) without need for pulmonary angiography. So spiral CT can be use as first step in-patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. OBJECTIVES. Evaluation of outcome in patients with abdominal trauma and predictors of mortality. METHODS.

Composition and training of medical teams manning this platform were also determined.RESULTS. The C135FR strategic tanker was chosen as a suitable vector. Eleven Aircraft have been modified to accommodate the medical solution. The technical platform includes patient care modules and logistical modules (2 racks, 1 preparation table and 1 centralized monitoring area). The Module Seriously Injured or Intensive Care Module allows the management of a patient on a respirator. The Module Slight Injury or Light Care Module allows the support of two lightly wounded. The medical team includes 11 to 12 people. This is a mixed team composed of medical and paramedical staff from hospitals, medical services unit and pooling of air conveyors. It consists of two intensivists, two air forces physicians, three anesthetist nurses, two air conveyors and two nurses. All have been trained on the ground and in flight. A twelfth place is reserved for a specialist (neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, cardiologist\u2026) or a liaison officer as part of a mission for the benefit of another nation. The team is sized to ensure its ability in taking charge of about 6 to 12 injured people during about 10 h for a mission lasting a total of 30 to 50 h.

Periorbital edema consists of subgaleal fluid collection in the palpebrae following anterior craniotomy. It may impair or impede pupil assessments when it gives rise to resistance to manual opening of the palpebra. Patients undergoing craniotomy may evolve with complications that cause intracranial hypertension. Herniation of the uncus of the temporal lobe resulting from decompensation of intracranial hypertension may cause pupil anisocoria or mydriasis. These abnormalities can be detected at an early stage by nurses through pupil assessments in the ICU following the operation.OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the interference of periorbital edema on pupil assessments made by nurses on patients who underwent craniotomy, in the intensive case unit (ICU) during the first 48 h after the operation.METHODS. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in an ICU at a university hospital in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from February 2007 to March 2008. Patients of both sexes aged over 18 years who underwent elective anterior craniotomy were included. Patients with oculomotor nerve lesions prior to surgery were excluded.

Among these patients, pupil assessments were performed without difficulty on 55 (56.7%) and with difficulty on 19 (19.6%), while it was impossible for 23 patients (23.7%).CONCLUSIONS.

OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study was to determine the patients' sleep quality and associated factors in early postoperative period after open heart surgery, and during hospitalization.METHODS. This was a prospective study, conducted in Cardiovascular Surgery Department between September 2009 and February 2010 in a research and trainin hospital in Turkey. After the consent, the study was carried on 52 adult patients undergoing elective open heart surgery, without a history of sleep disorder and who were not use any medications affecting sleep. Data were collected by a demographic questionnaire (age, gender, education, employment, chronic illness), and a sleep questionnaire (preoperative duration of sleep-T1, postoperative duration of sleep-T2, daytime sleep, other factors affecting sleep and sleep quality scoring 0-worst, 10excellent). The sleep data were collected until discharge. Demographic data were demonstrated as frequencies and percentages. Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis were used for comparing groups.METHODS. One night's sleep was registered by polysomnography on five medical and 16 surgical patients. Patients with neurological problems or continuous sedation were excluded from the study. Nurses recorded simultaneously all nursing care that required touching the patients. INTRODUCTION. In many ICU's patient temperature monitoring is performed by rectal temperature (Tr) measurement. Bladder temperature (Tb) measurement may have a number of advantages in the ICU. It has been demonstrated that the reliability of Tb is higher than that of rectal (Tr) or inguinal and axillary temperature measurements [1] . It is not known if the same holds true during the direct post-operative phase in patients admitted after cardiac surgery. This may be particularly relevant given the large regional changes in temperature that occur during cardiac surgery.OBJECTIVES. In a prospective study we compared Tb with Tr and Tpa (pulmonary artery catheter temperature). We also looked at the effect of diuresis on Tb.METHODS. 20 consecutive patients admitted to the department of critical care after cardiac surgery were studied. To be included, patients had to have three temperature sensors in place upon arrival at the ICU: in the urinary bladder (Tb), in the pulmonary artery (Tpa) and in the rectum (Tr). Diuresis was recorded every hour. Data were collected until 24 h after admission or until ICU discharge.",

Correlation coefficients between Tr, Tb and Tpa were 0.92, 0.92 and 0.92 respectively (p \\ 10E-9). The offsets for (Tb-Tr), (Tb-Tpa) and (Tr-Tpa) were -0.10\u00b0C, ?0.01\u00b0C and ?0.11\u00b0C respectively. The 6 largest offsets with lower Tb than Tr were observed in a single patient undergoing renal replacement therapy. Apart from this effect, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated no relation between temperature and the (Tb-Tr) offset. No relation of diuresis with (Tb-Tr) or (Tb-Tpa) was observed.CONCLUSIONS. Also after cardiac surgery, bladder temperature measurements performed as well as the currently standard rectal temperature measurements. Diuresis appeared to have no effect on temperature differences. We believe that the bladder temperature measurement has sufficient advantages to be used instead of rectal temperature measurements in these patients. OBJECTIVES.

Mean duration of hospital stay was 7.2 \u00b1 1.9 days. In the first observation, 43.7% (n=14) of the patients were determined to be in the low risk group and in the second observation 56.2% (n=18) of the patients were determined to be in the high risk group for pressure ulcer development. The third observation of the patients were determined to be highest risk group for pressure ulcer development. In spite of the fact that patients had a high risk for pressure ulcer development, it was determined that the percentage of regularly performed nursing measures for prevention of pressure ulcer development was low and that the percentage of independent nursing actions regularly performed was low. Documented interventions regarding prevention were: changing the position of patient and observation. The lack of nursing documentation regarding prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers may indicate that nurses did not identify pressure ulcers as a prioritized nursing problem for this patient group.CONCLUSIONS. This study demonstrates that orthopedic nurses do not consistently provide preventive care for pressure ulcers. After identifying the patients risk of pressure ulcers by using a validated risk assessment tool for each group different nursing care should be planned and implemented.Epidemiology and clinical course of sepsis: 0891-0900 OBJECTIVES. Study was conducted on patients of sepsis with ARDS. 70 patients meeting the entry criteria were randomized to TPN using commercial solution with identical amounts of glucose, amino acids and fat but different fatty acid composition. Group 1 received fish oil based solution and Group 2 was supplemented with Soyabean oil based solution.METHODS. Arterial blood gases were measured and ventilator settings were recorded at baseline and study days 4 and 7 to enable calculation of PaO 2 /FiO 2 , a measure of gas exchange. Clinical outcomes were recorded.RESULTS. Significant improvements in oxygenation from baseline to study days 4 and 7 with lower ventilation variables (FiO 2 , PEEP, and Minute ventilation) occurred in patients on Omega-3 fatty acids compared with controls. Patients on omega 3 fatty acids required significantly fewer days of ventilatory support (10 vs. 14.8 days, p=0.01) and has decreased length of stay in ICU (12.5 vs. 17 days, p = 0.16) compared with controls. Only 3 of 35 (8.5%) patients on omega-3 fatty acids versus 10 of 35 (28.5%) control patients developed new organ failure during the study (p=0.015).CONCLUSIONS. Omega-3 fatty acids has beneficial effects on gas exchange, weaning from mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and reduction in new organ failure. OBJECTIVE. The objective of the study is to evaluate the source control incidence and techniques that are used for this in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, as well as their implication on the global management of these patients.",

All adult patients admitted to the ICU between years 2006-2009 with severe sepsis and septic shock were consecutively included. Epidemiologic and treatment data using sepsis bundles, frequency of source control and techniques used for this were collected. The incidente of source control in these patients was studied using 92 and Student's t test. The results were expresed as percentages, medians and standard deviations.RESULTS. 334 patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were included (age 67 \u00b1 15 years, men 65%, septic shock 90%, initial lactate 44 \u00b1 29 mg/dl, APACHE 19 \u00b1 8). A total of 48% of these patients required source control and the techniques more frequently employed were: laparotomy 45%, nephrostomy 14%, debridement of soft-tissue 11%, biliar percutaneous drainage 9%, chest tube 6%. 18% of patients with source control needed a rescue procedure, specially laparotomy and debridement of soft-tissue. Comparing patients that required source control with patients that did not require source control we found the following differences: they were mainly women (44 vs. 26%; p = 0.001) with abdominal (64 vs. 7%; p = 0.001) and softtissue (8 vs. 2%; p = 0.001) sepsis and were less compliant with the resuscitation bundle: early antibiotic therapy (38 vs. 54%; p = 0.005), initial fluid resuscitation (70 vs. 79%; p = 0.079) and to achieve correct SvcO 2 (11 vs. 20%; p = 0.043).

In our experience, and against others previous reports, in septic patients a higher level of CRP at admission can be a marker for better prognosis but is the decrement in the next few days what better predicts a good outcome. This trend is also shown by PCT but in this case the relationship is less evident INTRODUCTION. Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (DHP-PMX; Toray Industries Inc., Tokyo Japan) was first developed 1994 and has been used for the treatment of septic shock. Positive clinical data, such as an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and an improved PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, have also been reported. And most general effect is an increase in SBP.OBJECTIVES. 43 septic shock patients using DHP-PMX were retrospectively reviewed to examine improved rate of any sepsis related factors after DHP-PMX and to analyze relationship between increase of SBP and sepsis related factors.METHODS. The patients were separated into two other groups for analysis: those whose SBP increased by more than 30 mmHg immediately after DHP-PMX (25 cases), and those whose SBP did not increase by more than 30 mmHg after DHP-PMX (18 cases).",

We investigated correlations between DNI and C-reactive protein(CRP), procalcitonin(PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR), prothrombin time(PT), activated partial thromboplastin time(aPTT), antithrombin III(AT III) and mortality. A small percentage developed severe pneumonia leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged stays in intensive care units (ICUs) and resulting in high (17-54%) mortality. Many severe cases occurred in healthy young adults, an age group rarely seriously affected by seasonal influenza [1] . The roles of the host immune response and of simultaneous co-infection with bacterial pneumonia in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory symptoms in H1N1 infections are poorly understood. Many inflammatory parameters have been studied to predict the etiology (bacterial vs. viral) and the severity of pneumonia in critical ill patients. Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) has been reported in patients with H1N1 pneumonia, but is a nonspecific marker that is also normally increased in bacterial pneumonias. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has been studied in a variety of patients with pneumonia. PCT levels are lower in viral infections than in bacterial infections and correlate well with the severity and evolution of pneumonias [ INTRODUCTION. The cytokines released in critically ill patients have been related to corticotroph cells damage leading to diminished adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production and adrenal insufficiency. Refractory hypotension and persistent hyponatremia should raise the suspicion of adrenal insufficiency. Previous studies have tried to determine the prognostic value of adrenal hormones levels. It is important to evaluate the association between serum cortisol levels (SCL) and severity indexes used for critical care patients.",

This observational study was conducted in an intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . The choice of sedation with midazolam and either ketamine or sufentanil was decided by the attending physician in charge of the patient. Among 200 patients with septic shock, 38 patients treated with ketamine were matched to 38 patients treated with sufentanil according to SAPS II at admission. The hemodynamic data have been collected over the first 48 h after septic shock onset. The volume of intravenous fluids and doses of norepinephrine were recorded every hour within the study period. Agitation was assessed through administration of antipsychotics and anxiolytics after the arrest of sedation. Tolerance of enteral nutrition was assessed by the volume of gastric residues. The results are expressed as median and interquartile differences. The interpretation of differences was assessed using a Wilcoxon test or Fisher's test on the variables. A p value\\0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS. The two groups were comparable in age, body mass index, severity score (SOFA and SAPS II at day 1). The volume of fluid administered during the first day (4 L [3] [4] [5] vs. 5 L [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , p = 0.02) and during the shock (6 L [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] vs. 10 L [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , p = 0.003) were significantly reduced in the ketamine group. The duration of sedation was similar in both groups (2 days [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] ketamine group vs. 3.5 days [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] sufentanil group (p = 0.5)). The doses of midazolam administered were similar in both groups (p = 0.8). There was a trend toward a reduction of the doses of norepinephrine in the ketamine group. No difference was found between the groups in terms of oxygen consumption, compared PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, incidence of agitation, and volume of gastric residues. The duration of ICU stay and mortality were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONS. The use of ketamine for the sedation of patients in septic shock reduces the volume of fluid and seems to decrease the dose of vasopressors. No significant side effect was observed in our cohort. INTRODUCTION. We previously found that beta adrenergic blockade could regulate the excessive inflammatory responses in a septic animal model (1), but due to its negative inotropic effects, the clinical use for septic patients still remains controversial. In an effort to reduce tachycardia in septic patients requiring inotropic therapy, we have been using landiolol, an ultrashort acting beta1 blocker, with care.OBJECTIVES. This retrospective analysis aimed to clarify the feasibility, and safety of landiolol administration for septic patients with tachyarrythmia.METHODS. Twenty-nine septic patients who were given the infusion of landiolol during at least 24 h were investigated. Hemodynamic data and variables from blood gas analysis in all patients were extracted from medical charts and documented before and 12 h after the landiolol infusion. At that time, prevalence of atrial fibrillation (Af) and/or ventricular tachycardia within previous 6 h was also documented for patients without the history of Af. Adverse cardiovascular events (decline in blood pressure and bradycardia) during the period of landiolol infusion were documented. Categorical and continuous variables were compared using Fisher's exact test and paired t test, and a p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

            "text": "CONCLUSIONS. Patients with severe sepsis who receive only crystalloid solutions do not have a much higher fluid need than patients receiving synthetic colloids. This confirms previous studies [1, 2] . INTRODUCTION. The vascular effects of magnesium therapy relate to its ability to induce endothelium independent vasodilation by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle and endothelium dependent vasodilation by release of NO from endothelium cells. Schauf and colleagues showed that intravenous magnesium therapy increases RBC-deformability in pregnancies. Also intravenously administered magnesium reduced platelet aggregation. But magnesium infusion effect on the septic patient's vessels, especially small ones, is unknown. However Boerma's et al. randomized double-blind clinical trial fall to show any additional microvascular blood flow improvement as a result of treatment with nitroglycerin in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.OBJECTIVES. We hypothesized that nitroglycerin additional infusion after the start of magnesium sulphate infusion can potentiate improvement of microcirculation in patients with septic shock.METHODS. Prospective randomized study. Twenty septic patients who had already been fluid resuscitated randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group receives magnesium sulphate 2 g/h infusion alone. Another group receives magnesium sulphate infusion 2 g/h with nitroglycerin 1 mg/h infusion added after 30 min. If required we added crystalloids and norepinephrine. Sublingual microcirculation was evaluated using side dark field videomicroscopy (MicroScan \u00d2 , MicroVisionMedical). Simultaneously we assessed systemic hemodynamic parameters (MAP, mean arterial pressure, HR, heart rate, CVP, central venous pressure, CI, cardiac index). In all patients measurements were obtained at baseline, at 30 min. and at 60 min. Each patient's microcirculation was evaluated by examining 5 different sublingual areas (10-20 s/image). Images were analyzed by semiquantitative scores of flow (MFI, Mean flow index; PPSV, proportion of perfused small vessels) and density (TVD, total vascular density; PSVD, perfused small vessels density). Capillaries were defined as microvessels with a diameter \\20 lm. Data are presented as median values (percentiles 25-75).RESULTS. HR, MAP, CI, noradrenaline dose did not change significantly intragroup and between groups during study's time periods. All groups at 30 min. study time with magnesium sulphate alone has tendency to be higher in microcirculatory flow and density. In comparison at 60 min. magnesium alone group to magnesium with nitroglycerin group TVD and PSVD was significantly higher (TVD, 10.8 (9.8; 11.0) n/mm vs. 12.0 (11.9; 13.6) n/mm, p=0.03; PSVD, 6.8 (5.9; 7.4) n/mm vs. 9.3 (8.6; 11.0) n/mm, p=0.002) in magnesium with nitroglycerin group, but there was no significant difference between groups in PPSV and MFI.CONCLUSIONS. Nitroglycerin additional infusion after the start of magnesium sulphate infusion can potentiate improvement of microvascular density and does not influence flow state in patients with septic shock. Further studies are needed to obtain more detailed results. INTRODUCTION. Synthetic colloids hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and gelatin are often used in septic patients. Occurrence of renal impairment did not decrease after we changed our standard colloid from HES to gelatin [1] .OBJECTIVES. We therefore abolished synthetic colloids altogether and used only crystalloids on our ICU. We hypothesized that rates of AKI (acute kidney injury) would drop. ",

RVEF was calculated using pulmonary artery thermodilution, GEF and CFI were assessed by transcardiopulmonary thermodilution. Measurements were performed before and after withdrawal of 20 ml/kg bodyweight blood. After re-transfusion and hemodynamic stabilization cardiac contractility was acutely impaired by continuous infusion of verapamil. Thereafter measurements were repeated during normo-and hypovolemia.

Qualitative analysis of the level of suffering was evaluated by means of directed interviews by 2 psychologists. Interviews were recorded and transcribed [1] . The caregiver was invited to develop on their personal experience, and their point of view on 3 predefined themes, namely: 1. Experience of work organisation; 2. Experience regarding their most difficult emotional situations and how they adjust psychologically; 3. Improvements that could be made at work, according to their own positive/negative experience.RESULTS. For theme 1, 55% of caregivers expressed a feeling of pressure at work, requiring a significant capacity to adapt, and considered to be particularly difficult at the beginning of their career (\\3 years), or a feeling of tiredness and saturation after 10 years' experience. The remaining 45% felt that the pressure at work was a source of motivation for positive energy. Communication among the healthcare team was considered very important by 95% of caregivers. For theme 2, 100% of caregivers expressed a feeling of emotional suffering arising from their implication in the care of patients who subsequently die, as well as with the families, notably linked to a strong sense of identification. The adjustments used by the caregiving team to deal with this suffering were: need to talk (77%), need to perform sporting activities (44%), need to ''get away from it all'' (44%), rationalisation and intellectualisation (33%), and getting more involved with the families (27%). Regarding theme 3, 100% of caregivers said they would like to be more involved in the process of care, particularly the decision-making process, whereas 55% were desirous of further training in order to better understand the therapeutic strategies. Lastly, 39% would like to have debriefings with a psychologist after highly stressful emotional situations.CONCLUSION. Working in the critical care environment appears to be especially difficult due to the high emotional burden, which likely requires training more particularly adapted to this discipline. OBJECTIVES.

Screening of non infected (Nin-MV) and infected MV patients (In-MV) was performed prospectively weekly during the pandemic period in each ICU. To calculate the occupation rate of available days-beds by In-MV patients (OR-In-MV), we compared per week the number of day-beds available in each ICU and the number of day-beds occupied by In-MV patients. For each ICU and French region we computed the OR-In-MV for every week of the pandemic period (week 44, 2009 to week 5, 2010), reported the maximal OR-In-MV and the corresponding week. For each region, we also reported the regional maximal OR-In-MV (calculated by averaging OR-In-MV of the different ICUs of the region) and the corresponding week.RESULTS. Data were collected during at least 3 consecutives weeks around the pandemic peak in 72 ICUs from 22 French regions. The median number of ICU beds per units was 12 (min 12max 30). The median value of maximal OR-In-MV for each ICU was 10 (min 2-max 32). The median value of the maximal regional OR-In-MV was 8 (min 5-max18). A maximal OR-In-MV above 20% observed in 12 ICU and 8 regions CONCLUSIONS. The maximal OR-In-MV observed during the pandemic flu period varied markedly from one ICU to the other (2-32%). It also largely differed within the different regions.A maximal OR-In-MV above 20% observed in 17% of the ICUs participating to the study reflects the important burden on ICU beds of the French pandemic.GRANT ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
