            "text": "Hyperactivation of the host immune system during infection by SARS-CoV-2 is the leading cause of death in COVID-19 patients. It is also evident that patients who develop mild/moderate symptoms and successfully recover display functional and well-regulated immune response. Whereas a delayed initial interferon response is associated with severe disease outcome and can be the tipping point towards immunopathological deterioration, often preceding death in COVID-19 patients. Further, adaptive immune response during COVID-19 is heterogeneous and poorly understood. At the same time, some studies suggest activated T and B cell response in severe and critically ill patients and the presence of SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies. Thus, understanding this problem and the underlying molecular pathways implicated in host immune function/dysfunction is imperative to devise effective therapeutic interventions. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the emerging immunopathological determinants and the mechanism of virus evasion by the host cell immune system. Using the knowledge gained from previous respiratory viruses and the emerging clinical and molecular findings on SARS-CoV-2, we have tried to provide a holistic understanding of the host innate and adaptive immune response that may determine disease outcome. Considering the critical role of the adaptive immune system during the viral clearance, we have presented the molecular insights of the plausible mechanisms involved in impaired T cell function/dysfunction during various stages of COVID-19.",

            "text": "Following reports of severe pneumonia cases of unknown etiology from Wuhan, China, multiple groups identified the pathogenic agent responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic as the SARS-CoV-2 virus Zhu et al., 2020) . The last several months have seen an unprecedented surge in research efforts to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, immunogenicity, and pathogenesis. Since it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 employs the same set of receptors and host cells, previously utilized by SARS-CoV, various disease models were developed to understand the molecular networks implicated in viral evasion, host immune response, and immuno-pathogenesis. Multiple factors and pathways are already known based on previous knowledge from other coronaviruses, which have shown promising potential as therapeutic targets (Tay et al., 2020) . But a more comprehensive understanding to develop highly effective therapies is yet to emerge, which demands better molecular details at various stages of the virus propagation and disease progression in the host cells. In the initial early mild phase of infection (Stage I), the virus remains confined to the upper respiratory tract (nasal cells, some areas of pharynx and larynx) which elicits low levels of the innate immune response (if any). This asymptomatic state lasts for a couple of days (generally one or two days) before the virus propagates to the conducting and terminal airways (Stage II). During this stage of the disease, an optimal but controlled adaptive and innate immune response will help to combat the infection. Successful viral clearance from recovered patients, show the presence of adequate adaptive immune cells along with the immunomodulatory molecules and neutralizing antibodies (Cao, 2020; Tay et al., 2020) . However, an impaired adaptive immune response at this stage, with concomitant overactivation of the innate immune system (inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils) can lead to severe disease symptoms in \u223c20% of COVID-19 patients (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) . Recent clinical and histopathological data from deceased patients suggest adaptive immune dysfunction and heightened proinflammatory response with inflammatory cell infiltration into the lungs (Stage III). Further, the disease severity positively correlated with increased levels of proinflammatory IL-6 and an increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio Tan L. et al., 2020b; Tan M. et al., 2020c) . Between 3 and 17% of COVID-19 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a result of hyper inflammation (excessive infiltration of activated innate immune cells and cytokine release syndrome) and lymphocytopenia (reduced levels of CD4+, CD8+, and B cells) (Gibson et al., 2020) . These changes are followed by cell death and tissue destruction, which ultimately leads to airway collapse, multiple organ failure and death in 67-85% of ICU patients, based on the available data so far (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Xu Z. et al., 2020; . Here, we discuss the molecular determinants implicated in the success or failure of recovery through various phases of immune response generated by the host cells. We have built an immunological trajectory of COVID-19 patients who have successfully cleared the virus against those who have developed severe symptoms, with emphasis on virus sensing and evasion mechanisms, and the spatiotemporal role of the innate and adaptive immune system. Further, we provided cellular and molecular details of cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2, like its predecessor SARS-CoV, employs spike (S) protein to enter into the eukaryotic cells by binding to the surface-expressed ACE2 receptors. Upon binding, S protein priming takes place by the membrane expressed protease TMPRSS2 or endosomal proteases such as cathepsin, elastase, and furin (which is specific to SARS-CoV-2) to induce fusion between the viral and host cell membrane Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; . Following these well-coordinated events, viral genetic material will release in a biphasic manner, i.e. either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or by following the endocytic route as shown previously for SARS-CoV (Belouzard et al., 2012; Shang et al., 2020 ; Figure 1 ). An increasing list of cell types appear directly infected by the SARS-CoV-2, which include the alveolar epithelial type II cell (ATII) as the principal targets, and other cell types lining various tissues such as bronchial epithelial cells in lungs, goblet cells in the nasal cavity, macrophages, esophageal cells, pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and gastrointestinal epithelial cells (Li M.Y. et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020) . All these cell types express the S protein target receptor ACE2, albeit with lower expression. However, ATII cells remain the predominant targets for SARS-CoV-2 as for SARS-CoV, which are involved in the sensing of the various viral proteins.",

These inhibitory signals affect a range of host defense pathways to allow the propagation of CoVs. Some inhibitory signals may even activate cell death pathway to induce a robust proinflammatory state.

ATII cells are known to express key endogenous PRRs like Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS); and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). Among these, cytosolic RLRs and endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9) have a prominent role in initiating the antiviral response by sensing RNA from SARS-CoVs (Lester and Li, 2014; Chan and Gack, 2016) .",

            "text": "RLRs are a complex of sensor proteins that include RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and the more recently discovered probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DHX58 (also known as LGP2) (Jiang et al., 2011; Leiva-Ju\u00e1rez et al., 2018) . RIG-I binds to 5'-PPP RNA and short dsRNA, while MDA5 binds to longer RNA fragments . Binding of pathogenic RNAs induces conformational changes in RIG-I and MDA5, and after that post-translational modifications activate these proteins. Importantly, RIG-I is activated by E3 ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) via polyubiquitination at K172 residue (Sanchez et al., 2016) ; MDA5 is proteolytically inactivated by the polyubiquitination mediated by poly (rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) with assistance from AIP4/ITCH (Atrophin 1 Interacting Protein 4; also called ITCH) (You et al., 2009). LGP2 acts as a facilitator to enhance viral sensing by RIG-1 and MDA5 (Satoh et al., 2010) . Activated RIG-I and MDA5 then mount the downstream signaling cascade via centrally placed mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and eventually lead to the coordinated activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors (Figure 2) . Activated IRF3/7 translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of IFNs via IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) reviewed by West et al. (2011) and Rehwinkel and Gack (2020) . Thus, centrally placed MAVS activation induces expression of IFN genes via IRF3 and IRF7 pathways and recruitment of other innate immune cells, majorly by proinflammatory molecules secreted via NF \u03baB signaling (Figure 2) . Similarly, activation of endogenous TLR pathway induces expression of IFN type I, type III, and more specifically, proinflammatory molecules via the NF \u03baB pathway . Blocking of either IRF3/7 or NF \u03baB pathway has a detrimental effect on host cells that invariably allows propagation of the virus (Lazear et al., 2013; Schmitz et al., 2014; Totura et al., 2015; Chiang and Liu, 2019) . In animal studies, FIGURE 2 | Molecular and signaling pathway implicated in host cell antiviral response. (A) After the viral contents are released into the cytoplasm, the viral RNA is recognized by host cell NASs like RIG-I and MDA5. Counter-defense may be provided by the viral proteins, NSP14 and NSP16 to shield the viral RNA from sensing by the NASs. However, if successfully recognized, RIG-I and MDA5 get activated and subsequently activate the centrally placed MAVS located on mitochondria. MAVS acts as a molecular adaptor that further recruits TRAF2/3/5/6. Association of the type of TRAF with MAVS is suggested to determine the type of downstream signaling, i.e., IRF3/7 and/or NF-\u03baB. At the MAVS junction, the association of TRAF5/6 with TRADD, FADD, and RIPK1 activates NF-\u03baB. Whereas, binding of MAVS with STING activates TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 by interacting with TRAF2/3, which eventually results in the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 . Activated IRF3, IRF7, and NF-\u03baB translocate to the nucleus and induce the expression of IFN genes. (B) The transcribed IFNs act on the respective IFN receptors (IFNRs) present on the host cells as well as on other innate immune cells, thus signaling in a both autocrine and paracrine manner. Signaling via IFNRs activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and subsequently induces the expression of ISGs. These molecular events were recently reviewed (Rehwinkel and Gack, 2020) . ISGs transcribed will eventually inhibit viral propagation. However, SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 have developed counter-defense mechanisms to interfere at various steps in the NAS signaling pathway. NSP4a inhibits TRIM25, which is required for RIG-I activation. N protein inhibits MDA5, NSP14 inhibits MAVS, ORF9b inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 activation complex, M protein interferes with TANK, IKK\u03b5, and TBK1 signaling, and PLpro inhibits various RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVs downstream signaling steps. SARS-CoV-2 proteins acting at various steps in blocking NAS and IFN signaling are shown in the red box. NAS, Nucleic acid sensors; RIG-I, Retinoic acid-inducible gene I; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; STING, ER-associated stimulator of interferon genes; FADD, FAS-associated death domain protein; IRF, Interferon regulatory factor (IRF3/7); TRADD, TNFR1-associated death domain protein; IKK\u03b5, I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5; RIPK1, Receptor-interacting protein 1; TANK, TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; ISG, Interferon stimulatory gene; TRIM25, Tripartite motif-containing protein 25. mice that are deficient in TLR signaling exhibit robust infection and severe pathological condition during SARS-CoV infection. TLR3 and TLR4 knockout mice exhibited increased viral titers associated with lung damage and a higher mortality rate (Totura et al., 2015) . Mice with a knockout of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88), which acts downstream of TLR signaling had increased damage to the lung parenchyma with a 90% mortality rate (Sheahan et al., 2008) . Conversely, activation of endogenous TLR signaling by TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 or cell surface-expressed TLR4 signaling was associated with a significant decrease in viral propagation, attenuated lung damage, and increased the survival rate in SARS-CoV infected animals (Zhao et al., 2012) . These findings thus point to an integral role of these molecular sensors in mounting early protective antiviral response and aiding viral clearance.",

The immunoinformatic approach revealed the presence of a wide range of ssRNA SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments as potential molecular PAMPs which were presumed to mediate signaling via endogenous TLR7/8 pathway. Further, it is appearing that the number of PAMPs (genomic fragments) was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may drive relatively more robust immune response (Moreno-Eutimio et al., 2020) . Singlecell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study in PBMCs derived from ICU patients revealed extensive upregulation of NAS pathway genes including RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, suggesting an invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells . However, no direct assays were performed in these cells to find the presence or absence of viral RNA. These findings may imply that that the SARS-CoV-2, does not directly infect PBMCs and thus this upregulation of NAS genes may be through passive uptake of the virus, most probably by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), as will be discussed later. Similarly, endogenous TLR7 and TLR8 upregulate along with an increase in expression of MAVS, IRF3, and IRF7. The functional importance of this upregulated expression of NAS pathway genes remains unclear and hence more research in this direction will clarify the specific role of these molecular sensors in the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2.",

As mentioned earlier, TRIM25 mediated ubiquitination activates RIG-I. Whereas, the N protein of SARS-CoV, which binds to TRIM25 and thereby prevents its association with RIG-I and hence activation. The ubiquitin usurped RIG-I is unable to mount the antiviral response, thereby disabling IFN-\u03b2 production (Hu et al., 2017) . N protein also antagonizes IFN signaling by directly interacting with IRF3, thereby inhibiting its phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006; Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . Similarly, M protein inhibits IRF3/IRF7 signaling by interfering with RIG-I, TBK1, IKK\u03b5, and TRAF3 activation complex formation (Siu et al., 2009) . Acting at multiple pathways on host cells, Nsp1 inhibits IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity and STAT1 phosphorylation which led to a decrease in the expression of various antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs; Wathelet et al., 2007) . Chen et al. (2014) showed that papain-like protease (PLpro) directly associates with TRAF3, TBK1, IKK\u03b5, STING, and IRF3 and hence inhibits downstream IRF3/IRF7 signaling. In another study, Devaraj et al. (2007) showed that PLpro inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and its subsequent nuclear translocation. ORF3b, ORF6, ORF8a, and ORF8b also play prominent roles in inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation and its subsequent nuclear translocation (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2006; Freundt et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2018) . ORF9b was shown to be associated with mitochondria and induced degradation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), thus altering mitochondrial function and sequestering MAVS into small puncta. Further, ORF9b was associated with recruitment of ubiquitin ligases PCBP2 and AIP4 E3 which led to ubiquitination of MAVS and eventually its degradation, as a result inhibiting IFN-\u03b2 production (Shi et al., 2014) . Thus, by associating with multiple proteins involved in NAS signaling, SARS-CoV antagonizes IFN signaling and synthesis of protective molecules like ISGs.",

An extensive proteomic study by Gordon et al. (2020) , showed multiple SARS-CoV-2 protein and host cell protein interactions. A proteome map of 26 SARS-CoV-2 proteins predicted 332 viral proteins interacting with host cells. Among these, Nsp9, Nsp13, Nsp15, ORF3a, ORF9b, and ORF9c interacted with proteins in downstream NAS signaling, IFN response, and NF-\u03baB pathway. Similarly, Nsp5 interacted with HDAC2, which may be thus involved in limiting the IFN signaling and inflammatory response, but the specific functional role of these proteins was not determined (Gordon et al., 2020) . In two recent studies, the functional relevance of some of these proteins was tested in vitro. In the first study, Li J.Y. et al. (2020) tested the effects of ORF6, ORF8 and N protein on the antiviral response in HEK293 cells and found these proteins inhibit IFN-\u03b2 and NF-\u03baB signaling. Similarly, Yuen et al. (2020) showed that IFN antagonizing effect of ORF6 was due to its association with the interferoninducible nuclear export complex (NUP98-RAE1). The study further showed that Nsp13, Nsp14, and Nsp15 could also antagonize IFN response, but the mechanism was not explored .",

Viral RNA is unprotected and open to cellular degradation; however, some RNA viruses have evolved a capping process to evade recognition by the host. In SARS-CoV, Nsp16 provides ribose 2 -O-methylation at the 5 end of the RNA to protect its degradation and prevent sensing by MDA5 (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011) . Similarly, Nsp14 had N7 methyltransferase activity and methylated the 5 end of the RNA (Chen et al., 2009) . Other SARS-CoV proteins involved include -Nsp4a, which prevents stress granule formation by inhibiting PKR mediated antiviral signaling (Rabouw et al., 2016) . N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is also known to interact with the proteins implicated in stress granule regulation (Gordon et al., 2020) . Electron tomography studies in SARS-CoV infected cells revealed a unique replication network derived from ER to organize viral replication while simultaneously hiding the viral RNA from recognition by host NASs (Knoops et al., 2008) . Other RNA viruses have also developed similar strategies to evade sensing by forming double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and replication organelles to prevent access to the NASs (Blanchard and Roingeard, 2015) .",

SARS-CoV S protein also interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF3f and inhibit host cell translation by preventing its nuclear import (Xiao et al., 2008) . Studies from other respiratory viruses have shown that cells which activate early apoptosis prevent further spread of the viruses, whereas viruses that successfully inhibit this pathway exhibit strong infectivity (Orzalli and Kagan, 2017) . Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) distinctly rely on this mechanism to successfully replicate within the host cell by inhibiting apoptosismodulatory proteins such as Bax and Bcl-2 (\u00c7am et al., 2010) . However, whether SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 are also directly involved in inhibiting early apoptosis remains to be tested, but it is evident that these viruses induce host cell death after successful propagation and dissemination. SARS-CoV Nsp7a was shown to interact with prosurvival protein Bcl-X and induce apoptosis in cells in vitro (Tan et al., 2007) . Similarly, ORF3a leads to fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus, and induction of apoptosis (Waye et al., 2005; Freundt et al., 2010) . Besides this, ORF3a also implicates necroptotic cell death by interacting with and activating the main necroptosis protein RIPK3 (Yue et al., 2018) . Owing to its role in cell death pathways, the ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 was also explored in this context.

Previous studies in animal models have shown that early IFN response was the determining factor in inhibiting viral propagation and attenuating disease condition (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . In line with this, a recent study has shown that COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate conditions possess functional type I and type III IFN response. Specifically, patients with mild/moderate symptoms have adequate levels of IFNA transcript and protein in the plasma. The presence of detectable IFN levels in these subsets of patients was also associated with the expression of downstream signaling receptors and molecules like IFNAR1, JAK1, and TYK2, suggesting functional IFN response. However, no IFNB mRNA or protein was detected, while optimal levels of IFN-\u03bb were detected both at the mRNA and protein levels. Expectedly, the levels of type I and type III IFNs positively correlated with the viral load and severity of the disease (Hadjadj et al., 2020) .",

Similarly, 3D culture organoids pre-treated with either IFN\u03b2 or IFN-\u03bb led to reduced viral infection. Cells depleted for either IFNAR1 or IFNLR1 had an overall increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting the integral role of IFN signaling in attenuating viral propagation (Stanifer et al., 2020) . Further, IFN response was adequate in younger patients compared to older ones, which may partly explain the higher risk of infection in older people . Additionally, people with comorbid conditions like diabetes -a condition associated with impaired IFN response, are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which further points toward the critical role of IFN signaling in the early clearance of the virus (Erener, 2020) . However, a comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the IFN response in mild/moderate patients is warranted to understand the functional consequence of this immune response throughout the disease and recovery. Overall, considering the relatively better IFN response and ISG expression induced by SARS-CoV-2, one can argue that this functional immune response is a probable reason for the relatively lower mortality rate seen in COVID-19, compared to previous SARS-CoV and MERS infections (Meo et al., 2020) . However, these early findings warrant further proof.",

While the levels of cytokines and chemokines are well-regulated during this phase of infection, a check on the activation profile and recruitment of these innate immune to the sites of infection is critical. Thus, a regulated and controlled release of cytokines and chemokines in the early phase of infection is not necessarily proinflammatory but drives the successful viral clearance and the probable reason behind the limited propagation of infection as seen in the majority of the COVID-19 cases exhibiting mild symptoms Tay et al., 2020) .",

One such recent elegant study using scRNAseq and cluster analysis revealed the activation status of AMs in BALF fluid derived from COVID-19 patients. The analysis is based on the signature genes expressed by these cells, which are markedly different from recruited inflammatory macrophages . Surprisingly, the number of these cells declined in patients with severe disease symptoms, and the presence of proinflammatory macrophages can take their place .",

By looking at the clinical samples, a large body of data suggests impaired IFN signaling in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Blood analysis from across the studies reveals low or undetectable levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb levels in patients exhibiting severe disease symptoms or patients admitted to the ICU with in a critical condition (Hadjadj et al., 2020) . Of note, an elegant study was conducted to explore the functional role of IFN signaling during various stages of COVID-19 disease severity. The study found robust impairment of IFN signaling in critically ill and severe patients in comparison to mild/moderate and healthy individuals. IFN\u03b2 mRNA and protein were undetectable in all patients, whereas IFN-\u03b12 protein was highly reduced in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients, corroborated with reduced IFN activity. In line with the impaired IFN signaling, robust downregulation of some of the ISGs (MX1, IFITM1, IFIT2) observed in severe and critically ill patients suggest an overall reduced IFN response (Hadjadj et al., 2020) .",

In the first study, the presence of IFN neutralizing auto-antibodies found in patients who exhibited more severe disease condition . These autoantibodies were more prevalent in men than women, that partly explains the susceptibility of men to COVID-19. None of the asymptomatic or mild cases had detectable auto-antibodies. In the other study, mutations in 13 key genes implicated in TLR3and IRF7-dependent exhibit loss-of-function . Patients or the cells derived from these patients with loss-of-function in these genes had inadequate IFN response and vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a similar study on four patients with severe disease symptoms, the whole exome-sequencing revealed loss-of-function of TLR7, which is essentially involved in IFN signaling. These patients exhibited decreased expression of IRF7, IFNB1, and ISG15, along with reduced production of IFN-\u03b3 (Van Der Made et al., 2020). Thus, impaired IFN signaling, mediated either directly by the virus by interfering at various steps in the IFN signaling, or genetic predisposition of some individuals to inadequate IFN response and presence of IFN neutralizing auto-antibodies are some of the significant factors which determine the COVID-19 disease severity. The dysfunctional IFN response in conjunction with other innate and adaptive immune responses may thus decide the path to recovery or progression to more severe form of the disease (Hadjadj et al., 2020) . Impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients (Hadjadj et al., 2020; Park and Iwasaki, 2020) . A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes impaired IFN response is still lacking, and future studies may help us to understand this.",

HMGB1 after binding to TLR4 induces activation of NF-\u03baB signaling and release of proinflammatory molecules. Additionally, HMGB1 also activates receptors like TREM1/2, and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) which are also involved in NF-\u03baB activation (Yang and Tracey, 2010) . S100 initiates similar downstream signaling after binding with TLR4 and RAGE receptors (Ma et al., 2017) , these studies were recently reviewed by Gong et al. (2020) . Previous animal studies with other respiratory viruses have shown a close correlation of increased serum HMGB1 levels with lung injury and disease severity (Patel et al., 2018) . Similarly, elevated expression of S100A9 was present in patients during acute lung injury mediated by the respiratory syncytial viral (RSV; Foronjy et al., 2016) . Although as of now, presence of HMGB1 has no report in COVID-19 patients, the damage in the lung parenchyma in post-mortem biopsies suggests that it is highly likely that this protein may implicate in disease pathogenesis and hyperinflammation (Andersson et al., 2020; Zhang Q. et al., 2020) .",

Interestingly, depletion of these inflammatory macrophages in animals infected with SARS-CoV was associated with a high recovery rate, thus suggesting their critical role in disease pathogenesis (Channappanavar et al., 2016) . Similarly, SARS-CoV infection in animals with STAT1 knockout in alternatively activated macrophages displayed attenuated lung damage and protection from disease (Page et al., 2012) . Besides, a large number of clinical studies support an integral role of IMMs in SARS-CoV infected patients (Wong et al., 2004; Tisoncik et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019) . Recent studies from BALF from COVID-19 patients have also demonstrated the critical role of circulating monocyte-derived macrophages in the induction of robust proinflammatory reaction . Blood cell analysis of 18 COVID-19 patients revealed an activated status of inflammatory macrophages . In line with these findings, scRNA-seq followed by immune cell profiling of blood cells revealed an increased number of CD14++ monocytes . Severe and critically ill patients also exhibit macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in some cases (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) . Thus, all the evidence directs towards a critical role of inflammatory macrophages in disease severity during COVID-19 and a potential therapeutic target. Intervention which reduces the impetus to induce MAS like antibodies directed against IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 has shown promising clinical outcomes, reviewed by Otsuka and Seino (2020) .",

Previous clinical studies have shown decreased NK cell number in SARS-CoV patients, which was more pronounced in severe cases (Wang and Xia, 2004) . A recent blood profile of COVID-19 patients suggested a similar decline in the number of NK cells in severe cases, along with an increased expression of exhaustion markers Tan L. et al., 2020b; Zheng H.Y. et al., 2020) . On the contrary, no significant difference was found in the number of total NK cells, in non-ICU vs 10 ICU admitted patients . This discrepancy in number could probably be due to differential temporal immune response and the underlying prevailing disease conditions in some patients. Immune cell profiling data from early recovery stage (ERS) and late recovery stage (LRS) COVID-19 patients revealed a biphasic effect, with fewer NK cells during early recovery ERS, which recovered during LRS . Thus, besides the underlying disease state, the NK cell number may also be sensitive to the time of sample collection and hence may not serve as a potential disease marker. Further, these studies could also suffer from the limitation of the variation in the age of the patients studied which may make it difficult to provide a definite role of these cells concerning COVID-19 disease severity (Nikolich-Zugich et al., 2020) , necessitating more conclusive studies.",

Under the influence of PAMPs, DAMPs, and inflammatory cytokine signaling, lung resident dendritic cells are conditioned and migrate to the draining lymph node under the influence of CCR7 where they prime na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Braun et al., 2011; Thaiss et al., 2011) . In contrast, monocyte-derived dendritic cells generate under the influence of GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-4, along with other proinflammatory signals (Qu et al., 2014) . Previous studies have shown elevated secretions of CCL3, CCL5, MCP-1, IP-10, TNF\u03b1, and IL-6 by activated inflammatory dendritic cells (DCs) in response to SARS-CoV . Recent reports also suggest the presence of activated dendritic cells in COVID-19 patients. Notably, meta-transcriptomic sequencing of BALF obtained from 8 COVID-19 patients revealed an activated status of these cells along with neutrophils, as compared to other innate and adaptive immune cells (Yang A.P. et al., 2020; . Thus, based on previous clinical studies on SARS-CoV infection and recent emerging studies on SARS-CoV-2, it is evident that hyperinflammatory immune response in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients is mainly mounted by infiltrated innate immune cells at the site of infection with a substantial contribution by the adaptive immune cells as discussed below in the section on the dysfunctional adaptive immune response.",

Cytokines, chemokines, PAMPs, and DAMPs released by infected ATII and activated AMs in the lung are adequate to mount a well-coordinated and regulated adaptive immune response by priming lung resident DCs. After encountering the antigen-presenting DCs, naive CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector and memory CD4+ T cells. At least five different CD4+ T cell lineages are known (TH1, TH2, TH17, TFH, and TREG cells) with prominent roles of TH1 and TFH cells in mounting antiviral response during SARS-CoV infection (Channappanavar et al., 2014) . Additionally, some studies have also shown a functional TH2 response in PBMCs derived from COVID-19 patients. Release of TH2 specific cytokines like IL-4 and IL-5 was observed in vitro after these cells were stimulated . Similarly, these patients show enhanced production of IL-17 along with other TH17 cell-specific cytokines Wu and Yang, 2020) . These findings suggest that the TH cell response in COVID-19 patients is complex concerning other infections, and this complexity may partly depend upon the prevailing pathophysiological state of a patient.",

Whereas IL-6 secreted by DCs influence TFH differentiation to aid in antibody secretion by B cells (Tang et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2012) . Under the influence of chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8), TH1 cells are recruited to the site of infection and are distinguished by the secretion of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and TNF\u03b1 as the main effector cytokines during SARS-CoV infections (Li et al., 2008) . Similarly, naive CD8+ T cells are activated by DCs by engaging MHC-I and TCR receptors, along with CD28-B7 co-stimulatory signaling and cytokines released by CD4+ T cells. IL-2 secreted chiefly by CD4+ T cells is also implicated in their long-term maintenance and proliferation (Eickhoff et al., 2015; Hor et al., 2015) . Notably, CD8+ T cells could also be activated independently of help from CD4+ T cells under conditions where a robust IFN Type I response is present (Wiesel and Oxenius, 2012) . These activated CD8+ T cells [also referred to as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)] get subsequently recruited to the effector organ under the influence of chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10) (Nolz, 2015) . At the infected site, CTLs mount an antiviral response by directly killing the infected cells via secretion of cytotoxic molecules like granzymes, perforins, granulysin, and other cytotoxic granules. Very recently, a study shows that CTLs secrete the granzymes and perforins as supramolecular attack particles (SMAPs) in a glycoprotein complex along with over 283 other proteins (including cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) (B\u00e1lint et al., 2020) . It will be interesting to know whether infection by CoVs also influences the release of SMAP by CTLs.",

B cell response is highly specific, mounted by the virus-specific antibodies and other effector cytokines secreted by these cells. B cell activation can be follicular helper T (TFH) cell-dependent, or in some instances, independent of helper cells; both instances are prevalent in COVID-19 (Mathew et al., 2020) . Under the influence of antigen-presenting dendritic cells, na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiate into TFH cells, which are marked by high expressions of CXCR5 and IL-21, and low expressions of CCR7, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and IL-17 (Rasheed et al., 2006; Nurieva et al., 2008; Morita et al., 2011) . The activated TFH cells interact with B cells via CD40R-CD40L and other associated receptors to induce the production of antigen-specific antibodies in a well-coordinated and regulated process. This CD40R-CD40L interaction along with the secretion of IL-21 also allows the formation of long-lived memory B cells, while B cell-derived IL-6 and IL-27 help in reciprocal maintenance of TFH cells (Nurieva et al., 2008 (Nurieva et al., , 2009 . A previous animal study has shown the essential role of these helper cells in mounting an adequate antibody response against SARS-CoV infection . The depletion of these cells was associated with a decline in antibody response and reduced viral clearance. Thus, virus-specific antibodies produced by B cells are critical for an effective immune response mounted by the host. These antibodies facilitate the clearance of the virus by either directly activating phagocytosis, opsonization, or activation of the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via effector NK cells. Cytokines released by the activation of innate and adaptive immune systems also activate the complement system. Viruses coated with the secreted antibodies from plasma cells eventually get eliminated by the complement system, reviewed by Risitano et al. (2020) .",

The study found the presence of newly generated and pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 specific cells with the positive response seen in 88.4% of patients who had mild disease symptoms (n = 26). The most substantial response was found against N protein and ORF3a. Further, CD8+ T cells response was shown persistent even in the individuals who became seronegative. In a patient studied longitudinally (70 days), CD8+ T cell response prolonged but antibody did not persist. All these three studies taken together point toward the presence of functional and long-lasting reactive T cells in convalescent individuals, while others also suggest the presence of reactive T cells in critically ill patients . Thus, based on these studies, it appears that COVID-19 patients who exhibit mild disease symptoms and successfully recover, display functional and long-lasting T cell response. However, these findings may not be definitive to provide a coherent functional view of these cells during recovery, as none of these studies compared the T cell response to disease severity. A further difference in the time of sample collection may also complicate the findings. In the study by Grifoni et al. (2020) samples were collected throughout 20-35 days after symptom onset, whereas Weiskopf et al. (2020) , used samples collected after 14 days of ICU admission. Thus, more studies under controlled clinical settings and large cohort size are warranted.",

These reports were consistent with the reports from in which neutralizing antibodies were detected starting from day 10. An elaborate antibody profile of 285 COVID-19 patients revealed 100% IgG and 94.1% IgM antibody response with a peak around the 3rd and 4th week after symptom onset, respectively (Long et al., 2020a) . Thus, for a successful viral clearance, an adequate adaptive immune response is generated around 2nd week after symptom onset and peaks around the 3rd week for IgM and at the beginning of 4th week for IgG (Ni et al., 2020; Thevarajan et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . Based on these and several other studies, it is evident that the antibody response is very dynamic in COVID-19 which may be dependent on the age, sex, genetic factors, underlying disease condition and most importantly, the type of assay used for serological testing (Guan et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2020) . Overall, these initial reports unequivocally suggest an integral role of the regulated adaptive immune response in the early clearance of virus and thereby attenuation of the disease condition in almost 80% of the patients who show mild/moderate symptoms. On the other hand, in the rest, 20% severe and critically ill patients, disease symptoms positively correlate with the degree of lymphocytopenia, as will be discussed later in section C. A schematic representation of the functional immune response during COVID-19 is depicted in Figure 3 .",

This dilemma can be partly explained based on the effective functional early immune response generated by the T and B cells. Mathew et al. (2020) used a multidimensional immunoprobing study and functionally characterized clinical features with immunological features. This study defined three immunotypes based on 50 clinical and 200 immune parameters. The immunotype 1 was positively associated with disease severity and had hyperactivated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with concomitant expression of exhaustion markers, indicating robust activation followed by the exhaustion of these cells. This immunotype may thus be vulnerable to cytokine storm, as discussed later in section \"Cytokine Storm in COVID-19 Patients.\" Immunotype 2 was associated with the presence of proliferating memory B cells with the optimal activation status of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This immunotype did not associate with disease severity. The immunotype 3 had no activation status of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and thus exhibited an inverse correlation with the disease severity. Overall, this study addressed some of the above questions that suggested that the presence of a regulated and functional adaptive immune response is key to preventing immunopathology. In a similar study, the activation status of T cells associated with disease severity (acute, moderate, and severe) (Sekine et al., 2020) . The activation status of these T cells correlated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in these patients.",

Considering the age, gender and other associated factors, a large number of other studies have now confirmed that COVID-19 patients have increased levels of TH1 specific cytokines, with more robust levels seen in severe than mild cases FIGURE 3 | Clearance of virus infected cells by engaging adaptive immune cells. Virus infected ATII cells activate the neighboring lung resident AMs by minimizing the CD200-200L interaction. Additional requisite activation signals are provided by DAMPs, viral derived PAMPs, and cytokines like IFN-\u03b3. Activated AMs along with infected ATII derived molecules activate and recruit other innate immune cells, like circulating monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, and neutrophils which act in a coordinated manner to eventually recruit the adaptive effector immune cells like CTLs and CD4 + T cells. These adaptive immune cells then specifically eliminate virus infected cells while minimizing the damage to the nearby uninfected cells. Thus, a well-coordinated and regulated adaptive immune response with help from innate immune cells is critical for initial antiviral response to limit the further spread of the virus. Green arrows indicate the cytokines released by the respective activated immune cells which activate other immune cells as well as mount an antiviral response by acting on lung epithelial cells. Xu Z. et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b) . Similarly, CD8+ T cell-specific cytokines increased in COVID-19 patients, more pronounced in severe than mild condition . Increased expression of GM-CSF was found in CD8+ T cells from ICU patients than non-ICU, while no difference was observed in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. PBMCs derived from COVID-19 patients and stimulated in vitro showed an increase in expression of CCL2, CXCL10, Eotaxin, and IL-1RA, and stimulation of CD8+ T cells were associated with an increase in IFN-\u03b3 levels, which indicates the functional responsiveness of these cells (Mathew et al., 2020) . These studies thus suggest a robust activation of TH1 specific and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients.",

Exhaustive states of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also present in patients requiring ICU . The exhaustive state was apparent by an increase in PD-1 and Tim-3 expression, which was more pronounced in CD8+ than CD4+ T cells. These studies along with others thus suggest that robust activation followed by the exhaustion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be responsible for the disease progression, while therapies like checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 antibody; NCT04268537) which may prevent T cell exhaustion and restore their functional state may benefit some patients. More studies are necessary before using such an approach can be used for therapeutic intervention.",

These activated T cells are further recruited at the sites of infection (initially lungs) in the presence of their respective chemokines. The activated CD4 + T cells are marked by the presence of cytokines like IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12, IL-6, and GM-CSF, whereas activated CD8 + T (cytotoxic T cells) are marked by the secretion of granzymes, perforins, and IFN-\u03b3.

However, most studies showing exhausted T cells were confined to the peripheral blood, while lungs were mostly shown to have activated T cells but with concomitant expression of some exhaustive markers, suggesting that the activation state is followed by exhaustion. The exhaustive T cells are marked by the reduced expression of respective chemokines and cytolytic granules. (C) Similarly, antibody-producing B cells (plasmablasts; PB) were shown to exhibit activation status as reflected by the expression of IL4R, TNFSF13B, and XBP1, while at the same time, the exhausted status of these cells was also reported in the peripheral blood.

These cells express proliferation (Ki67+), differentiation (CD27+ CD38+), as well as exhaustion markers (PD-1+). More robust expression of these markers was observed in severe cases compared to mild-moderate, with an overall decrease in memory B cell number (Mathew et al., 2020) . Further, 70% of the patients reported have IgG and IgM S protein-specific antibodies, suggesting activation status of the antibody-secreting plasmablasts. Thus, this study shows that B cells, in severe cases, display concomitant activation and exhaustion markers, while mild cases or healthy controls showed a normal response. However, how this activated status of B cells had an impact on disease severity was not studied. By looking at the alleged relationship of activated B cells with disease severity, Woodruff et al. (2020) showed robust activation status of extrafollicular B cells which resembled their behavior in autoimmune condition. The activation status of these cells was found more pronounced in critically ill patients (n = 10) than non-critical (n = 7) and healthy control (n = 17), which correlated with SARS-CoV-2specific antibody production and disease progression. Further, an increase in antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) was found in critically ill cases compared to non-severe cases along with an increase in S protein-specific antibodies, probably with a non-neutralizing property. This study shows that in some patients with a critical disease condition, robust B cell response and presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibodies may be associated with worsening of the disease condition. The ASCs were identified as the population of cells with CD138+ and CD21low expression. However, no comparison was drawn between various age groups concerning disease severity. While across studies, B cell activation is apparent in severe cases, it is subsequently associated with a sharp decline in their number. Various mechanisms may be responsible for this decline, among which B cell exhaustion is one, but still poorly understood (Yi et al., 2010) .",

(2020) studied the post-mortem samples (n = 11) of thoracic lymph nodes and spleens and found that Bcl-6+ germinal center (GC) B cells highly reduced in these patients in comparison to non-COVID-19 control (n = 6). This decline in GC was also associated with a decrease in TFH cell differentiation and an increase in the number of TH1 cells (Kaneko et al., 2020) . Further, an increase in expression of TNF-\u03b1 levels was found in the follicles. Based on previous studies that TNF-\u03b1 inhibits the lymphoid follicular development, and high levels of this pleiotropic cytokine is the hallmark of COVID-19, the authors attributed the reduction in GC to high levels of this cytokine. In addition to the study in post-mortem samples, the authors conducted B cell analysis in peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease. In line with the post-mortem data, patients with severe disease condition (n = 25) had a significant decrease in the number of na\u00efve B cells, CD19+ B cells, and follicular B cell subsets in comparison to the healthy controls (n = 4), convalescent patients (n = 39), and moderate patients (n = 4). Thus, this study provides a probable cause for the B cell decline in severe cases of Covid-19. However, there was a significant difference in the mean age of severe patients (higher between 58 and 60) than the control, convalescent, and moderate group (30-45 years). Thus, the effect of age on the decline in B cells cannot be undermined in this study. More studies are needed to specifically look into the B cell number and activation status in COVID-19 patients concerning the disease severity to get a clear understanding of the role of these cells.",

Further, like previous SARS-CoV infections, antibody response may not always favor viral clearance, instead of contributing to the underlying immunopathology in some instances Newton et al., 2016) . This immunopathological state may thus attribute to factors such as robust and unregulated activation of B cells, ADE, presence of cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies, and failure to mount a controlled B cell response. Across studies, higher antibody titers detected in patients with severe and critical condition in comparison to non-severe cases (Long et al., 2020a; Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020) . One can argue that higher antibody titer should be beneficial to provide an adequate antiviral response but can be countered by the finding that higher antibody titers found in a large number of severe cases and patients requiring ventilation (Kaneko et al., 2020) . This contradiction is yet to resolve, and the emerging data suggest that higher antibody response may reflect the over-activation and uncontrolled B cell response. showed the presence of RBD-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in patients with severe disease condition.

Antibody titer was higher in the critical patients as compared to non-critical. This higher titer of antibodies was not reflected by the clearance of the virus, thus suggesting that antibody response in critical cases may be associated with worse disease outcome rather than protective effect. However, like other studies, this study also suffers from the same limitation of low sample size. In line with the notion that antibody response is higher in severe patients, a large population study (n = 30,576 persons from Iceland) (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) conducted in Iceland revealed similar observation. The study provided a comprehensive account of the relation of antibody response concerning age, sex, body-mass index, drugs habits like smoking and the use of anti-inflammatory medication. Results show that patients with smoking habit and who were on anti-inflammatory medication, had lower antibody levels, while body mass index had a positive association. The data thus suggest that antibody response may not always favor clearance of the virus, but in some instances, higher antibody levels may make the patients more vulnerable to the disease.",

In a study on the sera samples obtained from SARS-CoV infected patients, a faster S protein-specific antibody response was found in patients who did not survive (14.7 days), as compared with the patients who recovered from the disease (20 days). Further, the antibody titer was significantly higher in the deceased patients with faster production than in the recovered patients. To mechanistically understand why antibody response has a more detrimental effect than protective, Liu et al. (2019) studied viral antibody response in animal models (Chinese rhesus monkeys). When animals infected with the SARS-CoV and adoptively transferred with anti-S protein IgG could not prevent the infection but instead displayed severe disease symptoms. Presence of the S protein antibody abrogated wound healing, induced macrophage/monocyte infiltration into the lungs and caused the release of proinflammatory cytokine followed by acute lung injury. This study thus demonstrated that the presence of S protein-specific antibody might have a deleterious effect in inducing lung injury, irrespective of the viral load. However, since mechanistic details are difficult to discern in clinical samples, more studies in animal models need to be explored. Further, owing to the dynamics of antibody response in clinical samples concerning underlying disease condition, age, and genetic factors; animal models will provide a cleaner system to delineate the antibody dynamics with respect to disease severity (Guan et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Contrary to B cell activation, some studies have shown lower antibody durability in both mild and severe cases . In a longitudinal study on a 26-year-old woman with a moderate disease condition, antibody response disappeared within three months . In a sizable cohort of samples, asymptomatic patients (n = 37 with median age 41 years) had relatively lower durability of the IgG and IgM antibodies in comparison to the symptomatic patients (n = 37). Further, the viral shedding in the asymptomatic group was higher than the symptomatic group (Long et al., 2020b) . Similarly, Ibarrondo et al. has shown the same antibody durability in 34 COVID-19 patients with a mean age of 43 years when studied longitudinally for a period of upto 4 months (Ibarrondo et al., 2020) . The authors found a significant decline in IgG antibodies in the sera of convalescent patients with mostly mild symptoms. A declining trend was seen for multiple SARS-CoV-2 antibodies like IgG N, IgM, IgG S1, and IgA S1 in the longitudinal analysis (n = 487) (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) . In another longitudinal study, the disappearance of S and N protein-specific antibodies was observed within 3 months of recovery . Based on these reports, we can infer that the antibody response in some COVID-19 patients may not be long-lasting, which poses a challenge for antibody-based therapy and vaccine researchfurther, these data caution towards chances of reinfection, as shown to be the case with other seasonal coronaviruses (Edridge et al., 2020) . However, larger cohort size and longer time frame longitudinal studies are needed to find the durability of antibody response in COVID-19.",

It appears that in patients with severe disease symptoms, TNF-\u03b1 may influence the GC and hence B cell number (Kaneko et al., 2020) , whether the same holds for asymptomatic patients with compromised antibody durability remains elusive. This dynamic antibody response is critical while considering convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) for severe or critically ill patients. If a patient already has sufficient antibodies, CPT may not be a viable treatment option (Anderson et al., 2020; Duan et al., 2020) . While many studies have reported success with CPT, some studies have shown no added beneficial effects with this approach . Thus, pre-caution should be taken while using this approach, i.e., if a patient already has adequate virus-specific antibodies or presence of cross-reactive and auto-antibodies, plasma therapy may do more harm than good, which may be the reason with non-responsiveness of CPT in some patients (Nagoba et al., 2020) .",

A recent study explored the cross-reactive and neutralization property of these antibodies simultaneously . This study used plasma from 15 SARS-CoV-2 and 7 SARS-CoV patients and found a high degree of cross-reactivity between the antibody response from these samples, but a very low antibody neutralizing property. These results were further confirmed in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. While S309 antibody showed better neutralization property against SARS-CoV-2, the neutralization properties for CR3022 are not yet known (Pinto et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) . Thus, although a high degree of crossreactivity of the antibody response from SARS-CoV-2 can be found with other related CoVs, the neutralizing property of these antibodies may be epitope specific. The weak neutralizing property of such cross-reactive antibodies should thoroughly be tested before usage as a therapeutic intervention, to prevent the complications which may arise due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). These factors also become essential while considering convalescent plasma therapy.",

BD-368-2 was further explored for its efficacy in animal models and showed therapeutic potential in SARS-CoV-2 transgenic animals. Further, the study suggested the use of two different monoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes as a more viable therapeutic intervention than a single antibody, which is impressive considering the emerging mutations in SARS-CoV-2.

Virus uptake by the phagocytic cells induces robust propagation and hence may further aggravate the disease condition, while antibody immune complex formation may generate a high pro-inflammatory response. Experience from previous viral infections has shown that ADE may lead to worse disease outcome in some patients with the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies, reviewed by Lee W.S. et al. (2020) . In vitro studies on monocytes and macrophages have shown ADE in SARS-CoV (Flipse et al., 2016) . However, no definitive clinical data is available that indicates the occurrence of ADE during SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These results thus suggest a close correlation of the NKT cell activity in COVID-19 and the presence of these cells may be required for the clearance of virus during the initial phase of infection. Concomitantly, increased infiltration and activity of these cells may lead to a more severe outcome associated with eosinophilic pneumonia, as shown in one study. However, no direct correlation of these cells types with disease severity was found, probably due to meagre sample size (n = 3).

Similarly, a study by Jouan et al. (2020) found a decrease in NKT and MAIT cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (n = 30, with varied disease severity) as compared to healthy controls (n = 20). This decline in circulating MAIT cells was concomitantly associated with an increase in these cells in the endotracheal aspirates (ETA) obtained from critically ill patients who needed mechanical ventilation (n = 12), while no changes in NKT cell number in ETA were detected. The presence of circulating IL-18 reflected the activation of these cells, and the expression of PD-1 suggested subsequent exhaustion throughout the infection. This study thus indicates that the presence of the activated status of these unconventional T cells may serve as a predictive assessment of disease severity. More research about the activation, proliferation and differentiation status of these cells to the disease severity and local vs systemic effect is needed to fully understand their contribution in COVID-19 (Chen and John Wherry, 2020).",

Although the molecular mechanisms associated with lymphocytopenia during SARS-CoV-2 are not known, emerging evidence suggests the role of multiple factors based on the correlations drawn from previous viral infections. The decline in lymphocyte numbers in circulation can be attributed to altered chemokine and cytokine signaling responsible for the recruitment and activation/inhibition of these cells, increased infiltration to the site of infection, and cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015; Walling and Kim, 2018) .",

Interestingly, a recent study suggests that severely ill COVID-19 patients had lower levels of activated (CD11a+) and terminally differentiated (CD57+) peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (which are also S-protein reactive). The decline in the number of these cells can attribute to their concomitant migration to the infected regions under inflammatory response.",

Homing of these activated T cells to the site of infection may thus be associated with the worsening of the disease by amplifying the proinflammatory state. A single patient analysis revealed increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the BALF (Voiriot et al., 2020) . ScRNA-seq in BALF followed by cluster analysis revealed the presence of CD8+ T cells with proliferative phenotype in severe cases, whereas moderate cases exhibited clonal expansion phenotype . From these accounts, it is indicative that increased migration of activated T cells to the site of infection may be one of the reasons for lymphocytopenia (in the blood) and the remaining T cells in the blood may eventually become dysfunctional (exhausted) as discussed below.",

The heightened viral load and presence of specific inhibitory signals bring about changes in the transcriptional and effector profile of T cells in a coordinated manner. Initially, they lose their property to secrete effector cytokines and gradually proceed to reduced expression of essential maintenance and activation surface receptors (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015) . A subsequent increase in the expression of inhibitory receptors and associated morphological changes result in the elimination of these cells from the circulation (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015) . CD4+ T cell exhaustion determines their insufficient secretion of effector molecules like IL-2, IL-10, IL-21, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 with a concomitant increase in inhibitory molecular signaling by PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, CD244 (2B4), and TIM-3 (Blank et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019) . Similarly, CD8+ T cell exhaustion is determined by reduced expression of IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and cytolytic granules. Besides, decreased expression of T cell maintenance receptors CD122 and CD127, and increase in inhibitory receptor signaling via PD-1, CTLA-4, NKG2A, TIGIT, LAG-3, CD244 (2B4), and CD160 also mark their exhaustion (Wherry and Kurachi, 2015; Blank et al., 2019) . B cell exhaustion is also demonstrated similar to T cell exhaustion with an expression of inhibitory receptors PD-1, CD22, and LAIR-1 but the exhaustion profile of these cells is relatively unexplored (Moir and Fauci, 2014) .",

In some instances, exhaustion markers are concomitantly expressed along with activation and proliferation markers, as discussed above Mathew et al., 2020; Mazzoni et al., 2020) . Moreover, increased expression of exhaustion-related genes like BATF, IRF4, and CD274 also correlated with disease severity (Hadjadj et al., 2020) . Interestingly, increased apoptosis of T cells became evident in severe cases as compared to mild/moderate conditions. Thus, one way to explain lymphocytopenia in COVID-19 patients is that after the onset of symptoms, T cells are primed to overcome the infection. However, in cases where viral infection persists, these cells attain robust activation, which may do more harm than good, as seen in severe and critically ill patients reviewed by Chen and John Wherry (2020) . Thus, the exhaustion of these cells precedes robust activation response, and eventually, they get eliminated from the circulation, as has been seen with previous viral infections (Wherry, 2011; Blank et al., 2019) . For example, during acute infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), CD8+ T cells were shown to exhibit functional activation status and develop into memory T cells.",

Following exhaustion, these cells are eliminated from the circulation, which is responsible for the decline in their number with long-term infection (Petrovas et al., 2009 ).

Though respiratory viruses are not known to induce T cell apoptosis directly, virus-activated secondary factors may be responsible (Kim et al., 2008) . For example, T cell apoptosis was seen by the enhanced expression of death receptors during the infection of influenza virus (H5N1) (Boonnak et al., 2014) . MERS infection was also associated with T cell apoptosis by the virus-mediated activation of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of cell death, resulting in their depletion from circulation (Chu et al., 2014) . The MERS infection was abortive in these cells, suggesting indirect activation of cell death pathways. A few in vitro studies have shown low replication of SARS-CoV in T cells and the absence of any significant cell death (Chan and Chen, 2008; . Whether SARS-CoV-2 infects, T cells are currently unknown, but it appears that T cell decline during COVID-19 cannot be attributed to direct cell death by the virus but to the exhaustion mechanism.",

Thus, based on these early findings, lymphocyte exhaustion may be driven by multiple factors that actively engage in rendering these cells ineffective, followed by their subsequent elimination (lymphocytopenia). Overall, a clear picture is emerging, which strongly indicates lymphocytopenia as a predictive marker for COVID-19 disease severity. Along with increased neutrophil number, the blood lymphocyte count serves as a better prognostic marker and reflects the immunopathological state of the patients (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b) . Further, based on these emerging studies, it is becoming evident that T cell response is heterogeneous during COVID-19 infection. While peripheral blood may exhibit lymphocytopenia, and mostly exhausted status of these cells, the site of infection is associated with an activated profile of the cells and hence determines the severity of the disease. Thus, caution should be exercised while designing therapeutic interventions for COVID-19. The underlying immunological state should be borne in mind while considering the treatment. Patients with lymphocytopenia and elevated functional and activation status of T cells may benefit from immunomodulatory approaches like mesenchymal stem cells, which are currently under clinical trials (NCT04377334). Patients with imperfect T cell and B cell responses may benefit from convalescent plasma therapy, whereas patients with impaired interferon response may respond better to interferon therapies (NCT04350671; NCT04388709). Thus, before a vaccine is available, a rational way to recommend therapy for severe cases of COVID-19 should be based on the patient's underlying immunological state. However, the treatment options become challenging when the patients exhibit cytokine storm and associated ARDS.",

Though the term CS is generally used with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) during CAR-T cell immunotherapy, it can reflect different pathological conditions. While IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL1-\u03b2 predominantly represent CRS, CS is a much more complex response mounted by a range of inflammatory cells. Further, differences are also apparent in the kinetics, and the concentration of the cytokines released, as discussed in a recent review (Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020) .

Based on the clinical cytokine profile across the studies in critical/deceased patients, serum IL-6 level is well established as a reliable predictive marker for COVID-19 severity and a potential marker of ARDS along with increased neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Thus, considering a robust increase in IL-6 levels in the majority of the severe COVID-19 patients, currently, treatments are underway to lower the levels of this pleiotropic cytokine. For example, antibodies directed against IL-6R (such as tocilizumab) have shown promising clinical outcomes (Capra et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; .

By this time, the injury incurred by the hyperactivated innate immune system far bypasses the damage by the virus, eventually leading to respiratory collapse and multi-organ failure. Taking cues from animal models and postmortem samples of deceased SARS-CoV infected patients, a comprehensive picture of the clinical and molecular pattern of lung damage has emerged (Leung et al., 2005) as shown in Figure 5 . These events proceed in a sequential and wellcoordinated manner. Excessive alveolar epithelial cell death, loss of extracellular matrix, deposition of cellular debris, and formation of hyaline membrane starts early along with bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cell denudation, referred to as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). These events are proceeded by desquamation of the alveolar and bronchial epithelial lining, altered permeability of the alveolar-vascular barrier, interstitial pulmonary edema, thrombosis, coagulation, and fibrin deposition (Gralinski et al., 2013) . Finally, the SARS-CoV disease progresses to a more severe fibrotic stage with increased fibroblast cell proliferation, interstitial fibrosis, collagen deposition, and complete collapse of the airways. The contents are released to the secondary tissues along with the proinflammatory cytokines, which may result in multi-organ failure. These changes are orchestrated by a coordinated action of molecular events that are ever-expanding (Chong et al., 2004; Jih, 2005; Yen et al., 2006) .",

While, most of the patients exhibited interstitial and intra-alveolar edema, ATII cell hyperplasia, thrombosis, fibrin deposition, infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes, hyaline membrane formation and other fibrotic changes (Carsana et al., 2020; Polak et al., 2020) .

(A) Immunological response in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients are overtly conferred by the adaptive immune cells with assistance from the innate immune system. Infected ATII cells and activated AMs produce a repertoire of cytokines and chemokines to recruit innate and adaptive immune cells and limit the viral propagation. The functional immune system thus acts in a well-coordinated manner to eliminate the virus specific ATII cells. Due to the relatively stem cell-like property of ATII cells, the eliminated cells are subsequently regenerated, thus ensuring recovery of the damaged lung tissue. (B) However, in severe/critically ill patients, an exaggerated inflammatory response is mounted by hyperactivated innate immune cells, and to a lower degree by adaptive immune cells. A hyperinflammatory state is created in the lungs which is characterized by the robust accumulation of inflammatory cells like monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. This leads to the excessive release of cytokines and chemokines by these cells, thus inducing a vicious hyperinflammatory cycle. Damage to the lung parenchyma is inflicted by this hyperinflammatory state, along with other cytotoxic molecules like MMPs, NETs, ROS and NO. The latter two combine to form more cytotoxic peroxynitrite ions. The combined action of these events results in epithelial denudation, vascular leak, platelet and RBC infiltration, vascular edema, and hyaline membrane formation, resulting in ARDS.",

Differences in S protein, ORF3b, ORF6 and ORF8 between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are functionally relevant (Shi et al., 2019; Chan et al., 2020; Mantlo et al., 2020) . Similarly, the differential immune responses generated by the two viruses needs to be delineated well to develop targeted therapies to modulate these specific molecular networks (Moreno-Eutimio et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Further, the increased activation status of these cells at the site of infection (lungs) in severe cases adds more complexity to the T cell immune response in COVID-19 patients and hence may pose difficulty in devising a universal therapeutic intervention. Similarly, the presence of reactive T cells in healthy individuals is another area that needs a comprehensive understanding, mainly while designing a vaccine. Keeping these challenges in mind and till the time an effective vaccine becomes available, existing immunomodulatory approaches like mesenchymal stem cell-based therapies (currently under clinical trials), anti-IL6 and anti-GMCSF drugs to counter cytokine storm, as well as antiviral drugs remain the standard therapeutic interventions. While the antiviral drug remdesivir has shown promise in some patients, severe side effects were also reported in others . Considering the number of factors that affect the complexity of immune response during COVID-19, it is crucial to understand that a single type of intervention may not work for all patients. Thus, it appears that exploring a combination therapy may be more compelling at present. However, determination of the optimal combination, dose, and time of treatment needs thorough investigation. These targeted therapies become critical, considering the chance of reinfection. A recent study on ten healthy individuals throughout 35years revealed short-lasting immunity against four common seasonal coronaviruses, with chances of reinfection in a year after infection (Edridge et al., 2020) . It is plausible that SARS-CoV-2 may exhibit the same tendency of reinfection, which may be a growing concern for vaccine research. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the immunopathological changes and sustainability of protective immunity is needed. In this review, we highlight some of these immunological responses, which are central to the progression and outcome of COVID-19 patients. Ongoing research in this direction should lead to effective therapies sooner rather than later, alongside with the vaccines.",
