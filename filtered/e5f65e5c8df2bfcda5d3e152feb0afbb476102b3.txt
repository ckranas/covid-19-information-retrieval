The sponge is one of the oldest multicellular invertebrates in the world. Marine sponges represent one of the extant metazoans of 700-800 million years. They are classified in four major classes: Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. Among them, three genera, namely, Haliclona, Petrosia, and Discodemia have been identified to be the richest source of biologically active compounds. So far, 15,000 species have been described, and among them, more than 6000 species are found in marine and freshwater systems throughout tropical, temperate, and polar regions. More than 5000 different compounds have been 330 isolated and structurally characterized to date, contributing to about 30% of all marine natural products. The chemical diversity of sponge products is high with compounds classified as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, polyketides, steroids, and macrolides, which integrate a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial. There is an open debate whether all natural products isolated from sponges are produced by sponges or are in fact derived from microorganisms that are inhaled though filterfeeding or that live within the sponges. Apart from their origin and chemoecological functions, sponge-derived metabolites are also of considerable interest in drug development. Therefore, development of recombinant microorganisms engineered for efficient production of sponge-derived products is a promising strategy that deserves further attention in future investigations in order to address the limitations regarding sustainable supply of marine drugs. Considering that oceans comprise over 70% of the earth's surface and harbor a tremendous variety of flora and fauna, marine habitat represents an unexplored source of new bioactive molecules. Although still quite young by many standards, since the 1950s, this field of marine natural products has undergone exponential growth and proven to be a productive source for structurally diverse secondary metabolites. Due to long evolutionary processes favoring the accumulation of strongly bioactive compounds, sponges (Porifera) and their associated microorganisms have become the largest contributors of marine natural products. Seemingly primitive and morphologically defenseless organisms like sponges developed ingenious survival strategies which rely heavily on the accumulation of defensive products protecting them from a multitude of stress factors that involve overgrowth by fouling organisms, attacking by predators, and invasion by pathogenic microorganisms. Sponges are classified in four major classes: Calcarea, Demospongiae, Hexactinellida, and Homoscleromorpha. Among them, three genera, namely, Haliclona, Petrosia, and Discodemia have been identified to be the richest source of biologically active compounds. The chemical diversity of sponge products is high with compounds classified as alkaloids, terpenoids, peptides, polyketides, steroids, and macrolides, which integrate a wide range of biological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, antifungal, anti-HIV, anti-inflammatory, and antimalarial. Biologically significant alkaloids, as a special and important class of bioactive natural products, are widely distributed over terrestrial and marine organisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that marine invertebrates and microorganisms are abundant sources of these secondary metabolites. Among these natural products, imidazole-, oxazole-, and thiazole-containing alkaloids are often found to show diverse significant biological activities, including antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, antimalarial, immunosuppressive activities, etc. The following review summarizes the latest progress on the isolation, structure identification of a diverse 209 alkaloids from 66 marine sponges with potent biological activities within the literature coverage from 1986 to 2016.

Nazumamide A (210) was isolated from the marine sponge Theonella sp. in 1991 and displayed inhibition of thrombin with an IC 50 In 2005, some highly cytotoxic polypeptides with 48 amino acid residues, such as polytheonamides A (229), B (230), and C (231) were isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei collected from Hachijo-jima Island. They were tested against P388 murine leukemia cells with IC 50 values of 15.5 × 10 −6 , 13.51 × 10 −6 , and 13.48 × 10 −6 μM, respectively [87, 88] , and polytheonamide B (230) exhibited cytotoxicity against HeLa human uterine cervix carcinoma cells with an IC 50 value of 0.58 nM [89] , L1210 murine lymphocytic leukemia cells with an IC 50 < 0.8 nM [90] , and Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells with an IC 50 < 0.2 nM [91] . In 2005, the chemical investigation of marine sponge Theonella sp. collected off Shimo-koshiki-jima Island, Kagoshima, led to isolation of the koshikamide A 2 (232) , which exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against P388 cells with an IC 50 value of 4.6 μM [92] . A chlorinated peptide, sintokamide A (233), was isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp. collected in Indonesia in 2008, which was found to be an inhibitor of N-terminus transactivation of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells with an IC 50  In 1996, aciculitins A-C (236-238) were isolated from the lithistid sponge Aciculites orientalis (Negros, Siquijor, Philippines). Aciculitins A-C were cytotoxic to the human colon tumor cell line HCT-116 with an IC 50 of 0.5 μg/mL and inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at a loading of 2.5 μg/disk in the standard disk assay [95] . Through bioassay-guided separation, arenastatin A (239) was isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea arenaria (Okinawan, Japan) in 1995, which exhibited extremely potent cytotoxicity with IC 50 of 5 pg/ml against KB cells [96] . In 1998, a chlorate cyclic depsipeptide, cyclolithistide A (240), was isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. It is important to note that cyclolithistide A exhibited significant antifungal activity against Candida albicans (ATCC 24433) in the agar disk diffusion assay. At a dose of 20 μg/disk, the inhibition activity was comparable to 90% of the standard, nystatin at a dose of 100 μg/disk [97] . (244) were isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei (Tanegashima Island, Tokyo, in July 1993) as a series of potent serine protease inhibitors. In the inhibitory assays against thrombin and trypsin, cyclotheonamide A, E, E2, and E3 exhibited significant inhibition activities with IC 50 values of 23 and 16 nM, 2.9 and 30 nM, 13 and 55 nM, and 9.5 and 52 nM, respectively [98] . 99] . Nine cyclodepsipeptides, homophymines B-E (246-249) and A1-E1 (250) (251) (252) (253) (254) , were also isolated from the polar extracts of the sponge Homophymia sp. (New Caledonian, in 1992). Homophymines displayed very potent antiproliferative activity (IC 50 (255) and jaspamides B-P (256-269) were isolated from the marine sponge Jaspis splendens. All tested jaspamide derivatives exhibited antiproliferative activities with IC 50 values ranging from 0.01 to 33 μM against human breast adenocarinoma (MCF-7) and colon carcinoma (HT29) cell lines [101] . Jaspamides B and C exhibited cytotoxicity against the human NSCLC-N6 cancer cell line with IC 50 values of 3.3 and 1.1 μg/mL, respectively [102] . Jaspamides Q and R together with jaspamide exhibited potent activities against mouse lymphoma (L5178Y) cell lines with IC 50 values in the ng/mL range (<0.1 μg/mL, <0.16 μM) [103] . . Keramamide E exhibited cytotoxicity against L1210 murine leukemia cells and human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells with IC 50 values of 1.60 and 1.55 μg/mL, respectively, while keramamides G, H, and J showed weak cytotoxicity (IC 50 ~10 μg/mL) [105] . Keramamide F showed cytotoxicity against human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells and murine lymphoma L1210 cells with IC 50 values of 1.4 and 2.0 μg/mL, respectively [106] . Motuporin (282), a cyclic pentapeptide, was isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei (Papua, New Guinea, 1992). Motuporin inhibited protein phosphatase-1 in a standard phosphorylase phosphatase assay at a concentration of < l nM, making it one of the most potent PPl inhibitors known, and it also displayed considerable in vitro cytotoxicity against murine leukemia (P388: IC 50 6 μg/mL), human lung (A549: IC 50 2.4 μg/mL), ovarian (HEY: IC 50 2.8 μg/mL), colon (LoVo: IC 50 2.3 μg/mL), breast (MCF-7: IC 50 12.4 μg/mL), and brain (U373MG: IC 50 2.4 μg/mL) cancer cell lines [108] . The chemical investigation of marine sponge Theonella swinhoei (Malaita Island, Solomon Islands, in July 2004) resulted in the isolation of nine cyclopeptides, perthamides C-K . Perthamides were proved to inhibit TNF-α and IL-8 release in primary human keratinocytes cells and therefore could represent potentially leads for the treatment of psoriasis [111, 112] . A proline-rich cyclic octapeptide, hymenistatin 1 (295) , was isolated from the sponge Hymeniacidon sp. (Palau, Western Pacific Ocean, 1985), which was found to be active against the P388 leukemia cell line (ED 50 3.5 μg/mL) [113] . Axinastatin 1 (296), a proline-rich cyclic peptide, was isolated from the marine sponge Axinella sp. (Palau, Western Pacific, in 1985), with P388 lymphocytic leukemia inhibitory activity (ED 50 0.21 μg/mL) [114] . In 1993, axinastatin 4 (297), another proline-rich cycloheptapeptide, was isolated from marine sponge Axinella cf. (collected in western Indian Ocean, The Republic of The Comoros), which showed comparable cell growth inhibitory activity against a series of human cancer cell lines (P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line, ED 50 = 0.057 μg/mL) [115] . In 1993, a cyclic heptapeptide, hymenamide B (298), with a prolylproline segment was isolated from the marine sponge Hymeniacidon sp. (Okinawan, Japan). Hymenamide B showed cytotoxicity against murine lymphoma L1210 cells and human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells with IC 50 value of 3.2 and 6.0 μg/mL in vitro, respectively [116] . , which appeared moderate antitumor activity (P388 murine leukemia ED 50 7.5 μg/ml) [117] . In 1995, cyclic heptapeptide phakellistatin 2 (300) was isolated from the marine sponge Phakellia carteri, showed cell growth inhibitory activity of ED 50 0.34 μg/ mL against the P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line [118, 119] . Phakellistatin 4 (301) isolated from Phakellia costata, showed GI 50 values of about 0.6 μM in different human cancer cell lines [119] . Phakellistatin 5 (302), a metabolite of marine sponge Phakellia costada collected from the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk), exhibited significant cell growth inhibitory activity to the P388 murine lymphocytic leukemia and the human cancer cell lines representing ovarian (OVCAR-3), CNS (SF295), lung (NCI-H460), prostate (DU-145), colon (KM20L2), and melanoma (SK-MEL-5) cancers, with GI 50 values ranging from 0.14 to 0.74 μg/ mL [120] . In 2003, cyclodecapeptide designated phakellistatin 12 (303) was isolated as a trace (1.7 × 10 −6 % yield) constituent of the Western Pacific Ocean (Federated States of Micronesia-Chuuk) sponge Phakellia sp. with activity against P388 lymphocytic leukemia ED 50 2.8 μg/mL [121] . A cyclic heptapeptide phakellistatin 13 (304) isolated from the sponge Phakellia fusca Thiele, collected off Yongxing Island of China, in 1998, exhibited potent cytotoxicity against the human hepatoma BEL-7404 cell line with an ED 50 < 2 μg/mL [122] . [123] . The synthetic cyclic peptides of phakellistatins were chemically but not biologically identical with the natural products [116] [117] [118] [119] . 50 values of 4.9 and 9.7 μM, respectively, but with no activity against leukemia HL-60 and hepatoma HepG2 (IC 50 > 20.0 μM) and cervical HeLa (IC 50 17.3 μM) cells [124] . (316) showed potent anti-TB (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) activity with MIC 90 values of 2 and 5 μM, respectively. Callyaerin A showed strong anti-TB activity, but not cytotoxic to THP-1 (the human monocytic cell line) or MRC-5 (the human fetal lung fibroblast cell line) cells (IC 50 > 10 μM), which indicated the potential of these compounds as promising anti-TB agents. Callyaerins E (317) and H (318) exhibited strong activity against the L5178Y cell line with ED 50 values of 0.39 and 0.48 μM, respectively. On the other hand, callyaerin A also showed strong antifungal activity toward C. albicans. Callyaerin G (319) was found to be cytotoxic toward the mouse lymphoma cell line (L5178Y) and HeLa cells with ED 50 (s) of 0.53 and 5.4 μg/mL, respectively [98] .  Marine aliphatic polyketides are a class of compounds that present diverse and interesting biological properties. Due to the versatility of their biosynthetic production mechanism, these compounds exhibit remarkable diversity, both in terms of structural complexity and biological activity. Polyketides are constructed as highly oxygenated stereo chemically enriched scaffolds, sometimes with the characteristic presence of macrocyclic lactones, cyclic five-or six-membered ethers, or polyethers that act as a conformational constraint. This review summarizes the isolation, structure identification of a diverse 104 polyketides from 23 genera of marine sponges with a variety of potent biological activities within the literature coverage from 1968 to 2016. Phormidolide A, first isolated from the cyanobacterium Phormidium sp., which is toxic to brine shrimp (LC 50 = 1.5 μM) [125] , together with two new cytotoxic macrolides named phormidolides B (320) and C (321), were identified from a sponge of the Petrosiidae family, collected off the coast of Pemba (Tanzania), in 2014 [126] . Cytotoxic activities tested using three human tumor cell lines, lung (A549), colon (HT29), and breast (MDA-MB-231), manifested that phormidolides B and C have significant cytotoxic activities against these three cell lines with IC 50 around 0.5-1.4 μM [126] . The fact of original discovery from a cyanobacteria species suggested that phormidolide A (322) is actually metabolite synthesized by symbiotic cyanobacterium of the sponge, supporting the relevance of symbiotic bacteria as sources of bioactive polyketides and peptides in sponges. Plakilactones and gracilioethers are oxygenated polyketides of the plakortin family isolated from the marine sponge Agelas gracilis, collected in southern Japan, in 2009 [127] and Plakinastrella mamillaris, collected at the Fiji Islands, in 2012-2013 [128] [129] [130] . In bioassay-guided fractionation of the lipophilic sponge Agelas gracilis extract, Fusetani et al. obtained three new antimalarial compounds against Plasmodium falciparum, gracilioethers A-C (323-325), with IC 50 values of 0.5-10 μg/mL, whereas gracilioether B also showed antileishmanial activity [127] . A few years later, the Zampella group isolated several plakilactone-and gracilioetherpolyketides, together with the previously known gracilioethers A-C compounds from another sponge Plakinastrella mamillaris. Among them, gracilioether B, gracilioether C, and plakilactone C (326) demonstrated activation of PPARγ in a dosedependent manner with relative EC 50 values of ≈ 5, 10, and 2 μM, respectively, and further mechanism study demonstrated that gracilioether B and plakilactone C covalently bind to the PPARγ substrate domain through a Michael addition reaction involving a cysteine residue and the α,β-unsaturated ketone group in their side chains, whereas gracilioether C is a noncovalent agonist for PPARγ [128] . In additon, gracilioether H (327) inhibited chloroquine-resistant CR FC29 strain in vitro with the antiplasmodial activity of IC 50 (342) from Candidaspongia sp., collected in Papua New Guinea, in 2011(isolated as an inseparable mixture of two isomers in equilibrium) [137] , exhibited highly cytotoxic in the subnanomolar to nanomolar range against various cancer cell lines. Cell-flow cytofluorometry analysis revealed that tedanolide caused accumulation of cells in the S phase at concentration as low as 0.01 μg/mL [134] . 13-Deoxytedanolide (343) showed remarkable cytotoxicity against P388 murine leukemia cells with IC 50 's of 94 pg/mL. 13-Deoxytedanolide also performed highly in vivo antitumor activity against P388: T/C = 189% at a dose of 0.125 mg/kg [135] . Tedanolide C exhibited potent cytotoxicity against HCT-116 cells in vitro with IC 50 value of 9.53 × 10 −8 M and caused a strong S-phase arrest [136] . Precandidaspongiolides A and B showed excellent selectivity against melanoma cell lines in the NCI 60-cell line screen, and the LC 50 values for precandidaspongiolides A/B against melanoma cell lines were significantly lower than other tumor cell lines (seven of the nine melanoma cell lines in the panel had nanomolar LC 50 values around 19-174 nM); further, precandidaspongiolides A/B were evidenced as P-gp substrates [137] . Studies of SARs of 13-deoxytedanolide [135] , precandidaspongiolides A and B, and candidaspongiolides A and B [137] reported that the southern hemisphere of 13-deoxytedanolide comprised the pharmacophore and the epoxide-bearing side chain of 13-deoxytedanolide was essential for the activity [138] ; the hemiketal of precandidaspongiolide B and candidaspongiolide B was not essential for the activity, while potency was affected when the primary alcohol of precandidaspongiolides A and candidaspongiolide A was substituted, and the C-7 acetylation of candidaspongiolides A and B increased potency [137] . The similarities between the myriaporones [139] and the candidaspongiolides [137] afforded further evidence in support of microbial symbionts as producers of candidaspongiolides, 13-Deoxytedanolide [140] and candidaspongiolide A [141] . However, the underlying reasons for the candidaspongiolides' melanoma selectivity have yet to be determined. Lehualides are polyketide derivatives isolated from sponge of the genus Plakortis, which have a long alkyl chain with varying degrees of saturation and incorporate α-or γ-pyrone moieties, coupled with thioacetate or thiol functionalities [142, 143] . [148] , in Kerama Islands, Okinawa [149] and in Okinawan [150] ) and Adocia (collected from the Eten Island area of Truk Lagoon in January 1984 and November 1985 at 5-10 m depths [151] and Manado, Indonesia, on May 15, 1993 [152] ), which showed a number of biological activities [146, 147, 151, 152, [148] [149] [150] . In vitro assays and preliminary SAR studies (in 2010) showed that among the compounds 1-8, halenaquinone appeared as the most PLA 2 inhibitor of the series with an IC 50 of 3.7 μM. Incorporating a dioxothiazine unit in compounds 2 and 3 led to a 30-to 40-fold decrease in potency when compared with the most active pentacyclic polyketide 1, and among pentacyclic polyketide compounds, the presence of a secondary alcohol at C-3 rather than a ketone abolished PLA 2 inhibition (4 and 5). These results highlighted that the C-3 oxidation state and the presence of quinone ring E were important for the anti-PLA 2 activity [27, 146] . Similar conclusions were reported regarding the SAR of protein tyrosine kinase inhibition exhibited by halenaquinone (1) [147] . Farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitory experiments showed that the presence of dioxothiazine substitution (IC 50 1 1.57 μM vs. 2 1.48 μM and 3 3.75 μM) led to little variation in human (FH) FTase inhibitory activity. Interestingly tetrahydrohalenaquinones A (4) and B (5) did not show such activity. Furthermore, quinol sulfates 6 (IC 50 16.11 μM) and 7 (IC 50 6.71 μM) exhibited modest activity suggesting that the presence of a quinone moiety was essential for FTases inhibitory activity. Sub-micromolar inhibition of farnesyltransferase enzyme of orhalquinone 8 (IC 50 0.40 μM), highlighting this scaffold as a significant modification for enhancing activity [146] . Antiplasmodial activities against FcB1 and 3D7 Plasmodium falciparum strains revealed that compound 2, 3, and 8 were the most active of the series with values of IC 50 [152] and P. simplex (collected at the Caribbean Sea) in 1999 [153] . All compounds exhibited a strong in vitro antimalarial activity against D10 (chloroquine-sensitive) and W2 (chloroquine-resistant) strains of Plasmodium falciparum, with a more potent activity on the W2 strain (IC 50 ~ 180 ng/mL), lacking of cytotoxicity [154] . Plakortide I is purified from an unidentified sponge of the genus Plakortis and collected at Discovery Bay, Jamaica, in 2002 and represented the first report of an endoperoxide with an α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety in the "western" alkyl side chain and exhibited significant antimalarial activity against the W2 strain with an IC 50 value of 570 ng/mL and a selectivity index of >8.4 [155] . Plakortides M (363) and N (364) were isolated from the sponge P. halichondroides, collected in Puerto Rico, in 2003, which exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against a number of cancer cell lines in the NCI human cancer screening program but with less selectivity [156] . Peroxyketal polyketides peroxyplakoric A 3 (365) and B 3 (366) esters isolated from Plakortis sp., collected at Zamami Island, Okinawa Prefecture, in 1993, showed IC 50 = 50 ng/mL against P. falciparum with a selective toxicity index (about 200) [157] . SAR studies played crucial roles in both "western" alkyl side chain and the conformational behavior of the dioxane ring of these compounds according to the interaction with the Fe(II)-heme [158, 159] . [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] [169] [170] [171] . It is remarkable to note that the first compound of this class of toxic polyketides, pederin, was isolated in 1953 from the beetle Paederus fuscipes [161] . The presence of pederin class of polyketides in such taxonomically distinct organisms indicated the possible microbial origin of these compounds. Pederins exhibited multiple interesting pharmacological activities. Pederin (368), the chemical defense agent of the blister beetle, and mycalamides A (369) and B (370) were reported to disrupt protein synthesis [161, 162, 164] . Furthermore, mycalamides A and B together with mycalamides C (371) and D (372) showed potent activity against the P388 murine leukemia cell line, giving IC 50 values of 3.0, 0.7, 95.0, and 35.0 ng/mL, respectively [164, 168] . Theopederins A-L (373-384) were markedly cytotoxic against P388 murine leukemia cells with the activity of nM level [165, 167, 171] . 13-Des-Omethyl-onnamide A (385), dihydroonnamide A (386), onnamide B (387), l7-oxoonnamide B (388), onnamide C (389), onnamide D (390), and onnamide A (391) were highly cytotoxic against the P388 cell line with IC 50 values of 0.15, 0.04, 0.13, 0.10.0.07, 0.02, and 0.01 μg/mL, respectively [166] . Onnamide F (392) was active against fungi Saccharomyces cerevisae with a value of LD 99 1.4 μg/mL. No activity was observed against Bacillus subtilis or Eschericha coli, indicating a selective toxicity for eukaryotes [170] . Icadamides A (393) and B (394) were reported to show in vitro cytotoxicity against HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cell line with IC 50 value of 63 nM and 0.17 nM, respectively. Among pederin type of compounds, only icadamide B (395) was studied for in vivo antitumor activity and exhibited activity against intraperitoneally and subcutaneously implanted tumors such as P388 mouse leukemia, M109 mouse lung tumors, and asbestos-induced pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. Icadamide C displayed potent cytotoxic activity against a small panel of five human solid tumor cell lines (A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, XF-498, and HCT-15) with ED 50 values of less than 0.1 μg/mL [160] . [172, 173, 78, [174] [175] [176] , unique polyketides bearing nitrogen and phosphorus functions. These macrolides exhibited a variety of biological activities including antitumor and smooth muscle contractile, which are attributed to inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (all these compounds exhibited nM scale of inhibition activity). SAR studies showed that the 17-phosphate, 13-hydroxyl, and the hydrophobic tetraene moieties were all necessary for binding to the phosphatase 1 and 2A [176] . The sponge-derived polyketide macrolides fijianolides are an important subset of 20-membered ring containing compounds isolated from marine sponge Cacospongia mycofijiensis, Hyatella sp., and Fasciospongia rimosa [177] [178] [179] [180] . Fijianolide B extremely potent (KB a IC 50 = 29 nM, MDA-MB-435 IC 50 = 5.7 nM), while fijianolide A (414) (HT29 IC 50 = 21 μM, KB IC 50 > 39 μM, MDA-MB-435 IC 50 = 2 μM) was also very active but at a reduced potency [181, 182] . Neolaulimalide (415) showed cytotoxicity against P388, A549, HT29, and MEL28 cell lines at 0.01-0.05 μg/mL [180] . Fijianolide B (416) together with fijianolides E (417) and G (418) were also shown to disrupt interphase and mitotic division, and fijianolide B was more potent than fijianolides E and G [177] . An in vivo evaluation of fijianolide B using tumor-bearing severe combined immuno-deficiency mice demonstrated significant inhibition of growth of HCT-116 tumor cells over 28 days [177] . Spiculoic acids and zyggomphic acids are indane-type polyketides, which have integrated phenylacetic acid, butyrate, and propionate units, isolated from marine sponge Plakortis zyggompha and P. angulospiculatus [183] [184] [185] . The vast majority of polyketides made in nature are assembled from acetate and propionate building blocks, whereas these spiculoic acids and zyggomphic acids incorporated the intact of butyrate units. Furthermore, the location of the olefin functionality formed by reduction of the β ketone and dehydration after condensation of the phenylacetic acid starter unit with the first butyrate is unusual. Normally, the dehydration step in polyketide biosynthesis would yield an α,β-unsaturated ester. In the biosyntheses of these polyketides, dehydration occurs in the opposite direction, leading to conjugation between the olefin and the phenyl ring [184] . Spiculoic acid A (419) showed in vitro cytotoxicities against the breast MCF-7, breast MDA-MB-231, lung carcinoma A549, and colon carcinoma HT29 cell lines with IC 50 values of 8.0, 2.4, 4.6, and 8.1 μg/mL, respectively [183, 184] . Zyggomphic acid (420) exhibited in vitro antitumor activities against the breast MDA-MB-231, lung carcinoma A549, and colon carcinoma HT29 cell lines with IC 50 values of 1.2, 3.3, and 3.6 μg/mL, respectively [183] . Dihalenaquinolides A (421) and B (422), novel pentacyclic polyketide dimers, were isolated from marine sponge Petrosia elastica collected in Nan-wan, Taiwan, during June 1998 [186] . Dihalenaquinolide A inhibited the growth of PC-3 tumor cells at 10 μg/mL, while compound dihalenaquinolide B was inactive [186] . Callystatin A (423) is a novel polyketide with a terminal α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone, isolated from the marine sponge Callyspongia truncata, collected at Goto Islands, Nagasaki Prefecture, in 1997 and exhibited potent cytotoxicity against KB cells at IC 50 0.01 ng/ml. Through analogue, syntheses and the assessment of their biological potencies against KB cells manifested the ketonic carbonyl, the 19-hydroxyl, and the three asymmetric methyl groups located in the β-hydroxyketone part of callystatin A contributing to the cytotoxic potency, respectively. Moreover, the α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone portion served as a conclusive functional group for the cytotoxic activity [187] .  Natural products possessing a macrocyclic lactone moiety are considered to be "macrolides," and most of them are likely to belong to polyketides from a biogenetic viewpoint. Because so many macrolides have been reported in recent years, the selection of compounds derived from 36 marine sponges may seem arbitrary and depends on the potency of their biological activities reported from year 1984 to year 2014. In 1984, tedanolide (424) was isolated from Tedania ignis (Caribbean), which exhibited highly cytotoxic with ED 50 2.5 × 10 −4 μg/mL in KB (human carcinoma of the nasopharynx) and 1.6 × 10 −5 μg/mL in PS (lymphocytic leukemia) [134] . Eight antitumor compounds including norhalichondrins A-C (425-427), homohalichondrins A-C (428-430), and halichondrins B (431) and C (432) were found from Halichondria okadai Kadota (Miura Peninsula, Tokyo) in 1986, among which halichondrin B exhibited remarkable in vivo antitumor activity [188] . In 1987, halichondramide (433), dihydrohalichondramide (434), and isohalichondramide (435) were isolated from the Pacific sponge Halichondria sp. (Kwajelein Island), among which halichondramide showed significant activity against Candida albicuns at 0.01 μg/disk in the standard disk assay [189] , and dihydrohalichondramide and isohalichondramide had antifungal activity and inhibited cell division in the fertilized sea urchin egg assay [190] . In 1989, mycalolides A-C (436-438) were isolated from a sponge Mycale sp. (Kii Peninsula, Japan) and demonstrated antifungal activities against many pathogenic fungi and cytotoxic against B-16 melanoma cells with IC 50 s of 0.5-1.0 ng/mL [191] . The chemical investigation of Okinawan marine sponge Jaspis sp. in 1993 yielded jaspisamides A-C (439-441) which exhibited cytotoxicities against L1210 murine leukemia cells in vitro, with IC 50 values of <0.001, <0.001, and < 0.001 μg/mL, and against human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells in vitro with IC 50 values of 0.015, 0.006, and 0.013 μg/mL, respectively [192] . In 1988, an Indonesian sponge Hyattella sp. was collected offshore from Manado (northern Sulawesi, Indonesia) yielded laulimalide (442) and isolaulimalide (443), and laulimalide displayed potent cytotoxicity, IC 50 = 15 ng/mL, against the KB cell line [179] . Swinholide A (444) was first isolated from a Red Sea sponge Theonella swinhoei (Gulf of Eilat, Israel, in 1985), demonstrating in vitro antifungal activity [193] .

Marine organisms produce a wide array of fascinating terpenoid structures distinguished by characteristic structural features. Since sponges are one of the prime resources of sesquiterpenes,diterpenes,sesterterpenes,and triterpenes, we here will survey 170 terpenoids from 32 sponges with various biological activities such as antitumor, anti-inflammation, antifouling, fungicide, as well as pesticide. In 1996, chemical investigation of sponge Acanthella eavernosa (Hachijo-jima Island, Tokyo), yielded Isocyanate and isothiocyanate derivatives 516 and 517, both of which were highly active in antifouling assay with EC 50 value of 0.05 μg/mL [233] .

(Iriomote Island, Okinawa, Japan) revealed the discovery of Euryspongins A-C (536-538). The compounds 536-538 were not active against protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) while compound 539 (the dehydrated product of 536) tended to inhibite PTP1B with IC 50 value of 3.6 μM, highlighting the importance of the absence of an OH group at C-4 for activity [238] .  In 1998, four new norditerpenes (540-543) were isolated from the marine sponge Diacarnus cf. spinopoculum (Solomon Islands). Compounds 540 and 541 showed moderate activity against the NCI's 60 cell line [239] .

The two compounds showed temperate cytotoxic activity against A549 and K562 cell lines with mean IC 50 values in the range 3.9-5.4 μM. The cytotoxicity of 1 may be related to the presence of a free phenolic −OH group, as the corresponding O-methoxy derivative is inactive [263] . O  The basic role of sterols is the maintenance of optimal fluidity of cell membranes, although these compounds also serve as precursors for the production of diverse steroid classes such as the polyhydroxylated marine sterols. In recent years, research in the marine sterol field has progressed at an impressive pace.

In 1993, an Okinawan marine sponge of the genus Xestospongia was the source of aragusterol A-D (746-749) [295] [296] [297] , all of which except aragusterol C strongly inhibited the proliferation of KB cells at IC 50 values of 0.042, 3.3, and 0.041 μg/mL, respectively. In the same year, antibacterial compound gelliusterol E (751) was obtained from the Red Sea sponge Callyspongia aff. implexa [299] . Gelliusterol E inhibited the formation and growth of gram-negative bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 2.3 μM. In 2012, Okinawan sponge Dysidea sp. was the source of dysideasterols F-H (752-754), all of which inhibited human epidermoid carcinoma cells strongly with a similar cytotoxic effect with IC 50 values of 0.15-0.3 μM [300] . In 2010, an undescribed species of Topsentia was the source of three isopropyl steroids, topsentinols K (755), L (756) and K trisulfate (757); the latter was an inhibitor of BACE1 dose-dependently with an IC 50 In 2009, five norselic acids A-E (758-762) were obtained from the sponge Crella sp. collected in Antarctica, all of which inhibited the growth of the Leishmania parasite at low micromolar levels [302] . Also in 2009, Australian marine sponge Psammoclema sp. contained a series of trihydroxysterols (763-766), of which 4 were cytotoxic against a panel of cancer cell lines [303] . In 2008, Ircinia aruensis collected in Naozhou Island yielded six epoxysterols. Compound 767 exhibited cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines (7402, H-460, LOVO, and MCF) with IC 50 values of 4.3, 2.8, 5.1, and 3.5 μg/mL, respectively [304] . In 2005, Homaxinella sp. (Korea) contained a series of highly degraded sterols demethylincisterols A 1 -A 4 (768-771) and butoxyderivatised sterols homaxisterols A 1 -A 4 (772-775), all of which but homaxisterols A 4 inhibited a panel of five human solid tumor cell lines, and especially 770 displayed significant cytotoxicity [305] . In 2004, Italian sponge Cliona nigricans provided two polychlorinated steroids clionastatins A (776) and B (777), which exhibited potential antitumor activity in three cell lines with IC 50 values ranging from 0.8 to 2.0 μg/mL [306] . In 2004, four sterols (778-781) were isolated from the marine sponge Axinella cf. bidderi (Yemen, Indian Ocean), which possess, respectively, the cholestene and the cholestane skeleton with a cyclic enol ether linkage between C-18 and C-22. These sterols showed cytotoxic activity against prostate, ovary, pancreas, colon, and lung cell lines with GI 50 values ranging from 0.6 to 8.3 μg/mL [307] . In 2002, three new sterols (782-784), isolated from the marine sponge Polymastia tenax, were found to have potent antiproliferative activity toward A549, HT29, H-116, MS-1, and PC-3 tumor cells in the range 0.5-10 μg/mL [308] . In 2001, an undescribed species of Gellius collected in the Caribbean coast of Panama was the source of four acetylenic sterols, gelliusterols A-D (785-788); 785, 786, and 787 were found to be cytotoxic to a panel of cancer cell lines [309] . In 2000, northern Australia Dysidea sp. yielded three polyoxygenated sterols (789-791) that inhibited the binding of IL-8 to the human recombinant IL-8 receptor-type A with the IC 50 values of 20, 5.5, and 4.5 μM, respectively [310] . A deepwater marine sponge Scleritoderma sp. cf. paccardi which collected from Turneffe Islands (Belize) in 1985 yielded a sterol ether (792) named 24(R)-methyl-5α-cholest-7-enyl 3β-methoxymethyl ether. IC 50 of the compound inhibited the murine P388 tumor cell line was 2.3 μg/mL [311] .  For the past decades, marine sponges have been considered as a very fertile field for the discovery of bioactive natural chemical substances with respect to the diversity of their primary and secondary chemical components and metabolites [312] . It was proved that marine sponges produce an enormous array of antitumor, antiviral, antiinflammatory, antibiotic, and other bioactive molecules that have the potential for therapeutic use. Studies showed that different components affect the targeted disease by different mechanisms. Natural chemical products that can act as inhibitors of transcription factors may be effective against both malignant neoplasms and viral diseases. Most bioactive metabolites from sponges proved to be inhibitors of certain enzymes, which often mediate or produce mediators of intracellular or intercellular messengers involved in the pathogenesis of a disease [313] . Here, we introduce several kinds of recently confirmed bioactive lead compounds isolated from marine sponge which pharmacological mechanisms were studied. Cytarabine (Fig. 15.1) is derived from the related marine natural products spongothymidine and spongouridine, nucleosides with a modified sugar moiety. These nucleosides were isolated from the Caribbean sponge Crypotethia crypta by Bergmann and Feeney in 1951 [314] . Cytarabine is mainly used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), where it is the backbone of induction chemotherapy [315] . Cytosine arabinoside interferes with the synthesis of DNA. Its mode of action is due to its rapid conversion into cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, which damages DNA when the cell cycle holds in the S phase (synthesis of DNA). The cells requiring DNA replication for mitosis are therefore most affected [315] . Cytosine arabinoside was also considered as inhibitor of both DNA and RNA polymerases and nucleotide reductases needed for DNA synthesis. As an antiviral agent, cytarabine was often used to inhibit deoxycytidine utilization. Due to the rapid deamination in the body into the inactive uracil derivative, cytarabine therefore is often given by continuous intravenous infusion [316] . Renieramycin G (Fig. 15. 2) was isolated from marine sponges Xestospongia and Cribrochalina [317] . A recent study demonstrated that Renieramycin G induced apoptosis via the p53-dependent pathway and inhibited the progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer [318] . The minimal antiproliferative activity for members of the tetrahydroisoquinoline family possessing an amide carbonyl group at the C-21 position seems consistent compared to their C-21 cyano-or carbinolamine-containing relatives. The brominated alkaloid Isofistularin-3 (Iso-3), a new DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)1 inhibitor, was from the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba [319] ( Fig. 15.3) . Docking analysis confirmed DNMT inhibition data in vitro and revealed binding of Iso-3 within the DNA binding site of DNMT1 [320] . Subsequent increased expression of tumor suppressor gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) could be correlated to decreased methylation of CpG sites within the essential Sp1 regulatory region of its promoter. Iso-3 induced growth arrest of cancer cells in G0/ G1 with increasing p21 and p27 expression and reducing cyclin E1, PCNA and c-myc levels. Fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy revealed that the reduced proliferation was accompanied by morphological changes as autophagy. Furthermore, Iso-3 strongly synergized with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) in RAJI [combination index (CI) = 0.22] and U937 cells (CI = 0.21) and increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis via a mechanism involving reduction of survivin expression but not of Bcl-2 family proteins nor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) [321] . Treatment of Iso-3 decreased FLIPL expression and triggered activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with increased GRP78 expression, which eventually induced TRAIL receptor death receptor (DR)5 surface expression. Importantly, as a potential candidate for further anticancer drug development, Iso-3 reduced the viability, colony, and in vivo tumor forming potential without affecting the viability of PBMCs from healthy donors or zebrafish development [321] . Ageladine A (Fig. 15.4) was derived from the sponge Agelas nakamurai [322] , exhibiting in vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic activity associated with its MMP inhibition. However, subsequent study confirmed that it is resulted from the selective inhibition of kinases such as yeast Sps1/Ste20-related kinase 4, dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A, and tyrosine kinase 2 [323] . Ageladine A and its synthetic analogues feature highly selective angiogenesis inhibition, at concentrations of which no cytotoxicity are shown in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. Moreover, ageladine A is a fluorescent dye that is pH-sensitive and is of interest for imaging [324] . Naamidine A (Fig. 15 .5) was found in marine sponge Leucetta chagosensis. Bioactivity study showed that this compound inhibits the EGF signaling pathway and is more specific for the EGF-mediated mitogenic activity than for the insulinmediated mitogenic activity [325] . In 2009, LaBarbera et al. illustrated that naamidine A triggers biomarkers of apoptosis like externalization of phosphatidylserine, cleavage and activation of caspases-3, −8, and − 9, and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential indicating that the cell death caused by naamidine A in epidermoid carcinoma cells (A-431) is a consequence of apoptosis instead of cytotoxicity. It is also reported that naamidine A inhibits the growth of tumor xenograft by activating caspase-3 manifesting apoptosis activity in vivo. Besides, naamidine A-caused apoptosis does not depend on functional p53 and is independent of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 [326] . Araguspongine C (Fig. 15.6 ) is a group of macrocyclic oxaquinolizidine alkaloids derived from the marine sponge Xestospongia species [327] . Araguspongine C prevented the proliferation of varied breast cancer cell lines in vitro dosedependently. Characterized by vacuole formation and upregulation of autophagy markers such as Atg3, Atg7, Atg16L, and LC3A/B suppressing c-Met and HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase activation [328] , araguspongine C induces autophagic cell death in HER2-overexpressing BT-474 breast cancer cells. What's more, docking research and cell-free Z-LYTE assays revealed that araguspongine C owing the direct interaction potentially with the receptor tyrosine kinases c-Met and HER2 at their kinase domains. Especially, araguspongine C treatment causes the suppression of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade in breast cancer cells by autophagy [328] . Psammaplysene A (Fig. 15.7) is derived from the marine sponge Psammaplysilla sp. Schroeder et al. demonstrated that psammaplysene A was an active inhibitor of a transcription factor FOXO1 nuclear export, whereas psammaplysene B shows less potential [329] . Extensive study illustrated that human endometrial cancer cells treated for 24 h with 1 μM psammaplysene A causes cell death leading to morphology changes with apoptosis and PARP cleavage, revealing that the cell death aroused from psammaplysene A is a result of apoptosis instead of cytotoxicity. Psammaplysene A bringing about the doubling of cells in the G2/M phase and FOXO1 silencing in ECC-1 cells reduces psammaplysene A-induced apoptosis [330] . Agelasines from a marine sponge Agelas clathrodes have structurally unique compounds which possess mono or bi-cyclic diterpenoids with a 9-methyladeninium chromophore. The cytotoxicity of agelasine B (Fig. 15.8 ) and its mechanism have been extensively studied which are of great interest that its higher toxicity in cancer cells (IC50 = 3.22, 2.99, and 6.86 μM MCF-7, SKBr3, and PC-3 cells, respectively) than in normal cells (fibroblasts, IC50 = 32.91 μM) where agelasine B upregulated the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ and caused fast Ca 2+ release via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This research indicated that sarcoplasmic-ER Ca 2+ -ATPase activity is inhibited by agelasine B. What's more, intracellular Ca 2+ accumulation in the mitochondria is tied to apoptosis. In addition, this marine sponge toxin induces DNA fragmentation and severely enhances caspase-8 activity in MCF-7 cells [331] . Therefore, agelasine B is potential for treating breast cancer for less toxicity in normal breast cells. PM060184 (Fig. 15.9 ) belongs to a new family of tubulin-binding agents originally isolated from the marine sponge Lithoplocamia lithistoides [332] . It was published that PM060184 presents the highest known affinities among tubulin-binding agents and that it targets tubulin dimers at a new binding site. PM060184 has a potent antitumor activity in a panel of different tumor xenograft models. Moreover, PM060184 is able to overcome P-gp-mediated resistance in vivo, an effect that could be related to its high binding affinity for tubulin. PM060184 is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization that reduces microtubule dynamicity in cells by 59% [333] . PM060184 suppresses microtubule shortening and growing at a similar extent. This action affects cells in interphase and mitosis. In the first case, the compound induced a disorganization and fragmentation of the microtubule network and the inhibition of cell migration. In the second case, it induced the appearance of multipolar mitosis and lagging chromosomes at the metaphase plate. These effects correlated with a nonclassical apoptosis pathway, which caused prometaphase arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis or appearance of cells in a multinucleated interphaselike state. Taken together, PM060184 represents a new tubulin-binding agent with promising potential as an anticancer agent [334] . Eribulin mesylate (E7389) (Fig. 15.10) is a microtubule dynamics inhibitor with antitumor activity, which is effective against not only a broad range of human cancer cell lines but also human tumor xenograft models derived from melanoma, colon, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer [336] . This non-taxane molecule is a structurally simplified synthetic analogue of halichondrin B derived from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai [335] . Different from other tubulin-targeted agents like taxanes, epothilones, and vinca alkaloid, which affect both growth and shortening of microtubules, eribulin only affects growth by binding to the microtubules and suppressing microtubule polymerization without affecting shortening, thereby sequestering tubulin into nonfunctional aggregates [336, 337] . The prohibited formation of mitotic spindles leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis as a result of prolonged mitotic blockage. Eribulin remains to be active in taxane-resistant cell lines with β-tubulin mutations and those which overexpress P-gp according to in vitro studies. It's reported to be manageably safe in a 21-day-cycle administration, neutropenia being the main dose limit among all toxicities, with an MTD of 1.4 mg/m 2 in phase I studies, but seems to be both effective and safe in several phase II studies. Therefore, it has been applied to patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with at least two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease [335] [336] [337] . 10-Acetylirciformonin B (Fig. 15 .11) classified as furanoterpenoid which is isolated from marine sponge Ircinia sp. can restrain the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells, with an IC50 value of 1.7 μg/mL obtained at 48 h of treatment due to its unique structure of the linear C22-sesterterpenoid. What's more, its anticancer activity was activated by inducting of DNA damage and apoptosis. To be detailed, DNA damage was mediated by the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, p-CHK2 (checkpoint kinase), sensitive markers of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and apoptosis which was triggered by caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, resulting to PARP cleavage, the downregulation of Bcl-xL and the upregulation of Bax [338] . Hyrtioreticulins A and B (Fig. 15 .12) belong to indole alkaloids derived from the marine sponge Hyrtios reticulatus. These alkaloids have inhibition of E1-ubiquitin intermediate formation from 0.75 to 11 μg/mL in IC50 values [339] . Moreover, the structures are approximately the same except for their stereochemistry at C-1, in which hyrtioreticulin A is trans-configured and hyrtioreticulin B is cis, respectively, demonstrating that the trans configuration reinforces inhibitory activity against E1, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme required for ubiquitination in the ubiquitinproteasome pathway involving in a large variety of cellular events such as cell cycle control, transcription, and development [340] . Deregulation of this pathway, therefore, can cause numerous diseases like cancer. Consequently, the ubiquitin pathway plays a significant role in anticancer drugs. In that context, hyrtioreticulins A and B catch more attention on the bioactivity on new anticancer therapeutics. Peloruside A (Fig. 15.13) is a microtubule-stabilizing agent isolated from a New Zealand marine sponge [341] . Peloruside prevents growth of a panel of cancer cell lines at low nanomolar concentrations, including cell lines that are resistant to paclitaxel. Three xenograft studies in athymic nu/nu mice were performed to assess the efficacy of peloruside compared with standard anticancer agents such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, and doxorubicin. In the first study, peloruside A, 5 and 10 mg/kg (QD × 5) caused growth inhibition (%TGI of 84% and 95%, respectively), on the growth of H460 non-small cell lung cancer xenografts, whereas standard treatments with paclitaxel (8 mg/kg, QD × 5) and docetaxel (6.3 mg/kg, Q2D × 3) were much less effective (%TGI of 50% and 18%, respectively). In a second xenograft study using A549 lung cancer cells and varied schedules of dosing, activity of peloruside was again superior compared with the taxanes with inhibitions ranging from 51% to 74%, compared with 44% and 50% for the two taxanes [342] . A third xenograft study in a P-glycoprotein-overexpressing NCI/ADR-RES breast tumor model showed that peloruside was better tolerated than either doxorubicin or paclitaxel. Peloruside is highly effective in preventing the growth of lung and P-glycoproteinoverexpressing breast tumors in vivo and that further therapeutic development is necessary [343] . E7974 (Fig.15 .14) is a synthetic analogue of the marine sponge natural product hemiasterlin. Hemiasterlin, a potent cytotoxic tripeptide, was originally isolated from marine sponges [344] . E7974 acts via a tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism. E7974 inhibits polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro with IC 50 values similar to those of vinblastine. In cultured human cancer cells, E7974 induces G 2 /M arrest and marked disruption of mitotic spindle formation. Consistent with this observation, E7974 induces caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, typical biochemical markers of apoptosis. Only a short cellular exposure to E7974 is sufficient to induce maximum mitotic arrest, suggesting that E7974's antitumor effects in vivo may persist even after blood levels of the drug decrease after drug administration. Investigation of interactions of E7974 with purified tubulin using two synthetic tritiated photoaffinity analogues of E7974 indicated that E7974 seems to share a unique, predominantly α-tubulin-targeted mechanism with other hemiasterlin-based compounds, suggesting the hemiasterlins evolved to mainly target α-tubulin, not β-tubulin subunits unlike many tubulin-targeted natural products [345] . Phorbaketal A (Fig. 15.15 ) is a metabolite of the marine sponge Phorbas sp. [346] . This tricyclic sesterterpenoid has significant inhibitory effect on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 which is induced by inhibited the transcription of a crucial signaling molecule named nuclear factor-kap-paB (NF-κB) in inflammation, whereas the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) proved to be upregulated in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells [347] . Solomonsterol A (Fig. 15.16) , a selective pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist found in the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei, shows anti-inflammatory activity and immune dysfunction and attenuates systemic inflammation in the rheumatoid arthritis mouse model. It is reported that solomonsterol A had an effect on protecting from the development of arthritis according to arthritis score, CRP, and plasma cytokines. In addition, anti-collagen antibodies (CAIA) could reduce the expression of inflammatory markers including TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-17 and chemokines MIP1α and RANTES in draining lymph nodes in the rheumatoid arthritis mouse model which are induced by injecting transgenic mice harboring a humanized PXR [348] . Epimuqubilin A (Fig. 15.17) , a norsesterterpene peroxide isolated from marine sponge Latrunculia sp., inhibits nitric oxide production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (IC(50) = 7.6 μM). At both the mRNA and protein levels, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are suppressed in a dosedependent manner. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), one major upstream signaling pathway involved in the transcription of both COX-2 and iNOS, were not affected by treatment of epimuqubilin A. However, the compound blocked the phosphorylation of inhibitor κB (IκB) kinase (IKKβ), resulting in the stabilization of IκBα and inhibition of NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and DNA binding. Levels of phosphorylated IKKα were not affected. This is an unique mechanistic relationship that suggests epimuqubilin A warrants further exploration as a potential therapeutic agent [349] . Ascididemin (ASC) is a marine alkaloid and belongs to the group of pyridoacridine alkaloids, mostly being isolated from sponges and tunicates (Fig. 15.18 [350, 351] . Similar to other planar pyridoacridine derivatives, ascididemin interacts with DNA and recognizes triplex and quadruplex structures especially G-quadruplexes. Different mechanisms of action for this alkaloid have been proposed including topoisomerase I and II toxins. However, experiments with cell lines resistant to these toxins indicated that topo I and II are not potential targets for ascididemin (ASC) in the cell but may be by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to cleave DNA. Own work contributes to its action on the apoptotic signaling in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, ACS induces a mitochondrial pathway that requires the activation of caspase-2 upstream of mitochondria. Caspase-2 activation was not blocked by the overexpression of Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-xL and was responsible for caspase-9 activation. As a possible link between caspase-2 and mitochondrial activation, Bid was found to be cleaved by ASC as a specific caspase-2 inhibitor inhibits the ASC-induced cleavage of Bid [351] . In addition, JNK was activated by ASC upstream of mitochondria via reactive oxygen species. Caspase-2 activation provides a possible link between the DNA damaging activity and the induction of apoptosis. To this end, ASC might be a valuable chemical tool to induce DNA damage and apoptotic signaling events. Variolin B (VAR-B) (Fig. 15.19 ) is a natural product isolated from the sponge Kirkpatrickia variolosa, found in Antarctica. VAR-B has been shown potent proapoptotic activity. In different human cancer cell lines, both compounds inhibited colony formation, caused cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 μM. Although variolins induced an increase in the levels of p53 with an increase in p21, their cytotoxicities did not appear to be dependent on p53 status as their potency was comparable in cells with wild-type p53 or in sublines with inactivated p53. Both VAR-B and dVAR-B prevent the cells from enter- ing S phase, blocking cells in G1 and cause an accumulation of cells in G2. The apoptosis induced by VAR-B and dVAR-B occurred very rapidly in some cell lines (e.g., Jurkat leukemia cells) and was already evident 4 h after the beginning of treatment. Although intercalation of dVAR-B in DNA has been demonstrated, neither VAR-B nor dVAR-B produces detectable breaks in DNA, which are consistent with the in vitro biochemical assays that also demonstrated that dVAR-B is not topoisomerase I or II poison. Instead, each of these variolins appears to inhibit cyclindependent kinases (CDKs) in the lM range. CDK1-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A, and CDK2/cyclin E complexes were inhibited in a range of concentrations lower than those required to inhibit the activity of CDK4/cyclin D or CDK7/cyclin H complexes. Variolins are a new class of CDK inhibitors that activate apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion, and thus they may be effective against tumors with p53 mutations or deletions [352] . Spongistatin is a macrocyclic lactone that has been isolated from the marine sponges Spirastrella spinispirulifera and Hyrtios sp. by the group of Pettit. Spongistatin 1 (Fig. 15.20) showed interesting apoptotic features in various tumor cells. In leukemic cell lines, it triggered caspase-dependent apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo, and Omi/HtrA2 from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Spongistatin 1 caused degradation of the anti-apoptotic XIAP, which suggested it might be a promising drug for the treatment of chemoresistance due to overexpression of XIAP. Moreover spongistatin 1 induces apoptosis more efficiently in human primary leukemic cells of children suffering from acute leukemia at low nanomolar concentrations than clinically applied conventional drugs used in micromolar concentrations. In addition normal healthy peripheral blood cells were significantly less affected by spongistatin 1 [353] . Besides leukemic cells, spongistatin 1 showed promising apoptotic potential in mammary cancer cells including the treatment-resistant cell line MCF-7 lacking caspase-3. Regarding the apoptotic signaling pathways of spongistatin 1, two interesting features can be reported. First, spongistatin 1-induced cell death involves the pro-apoptotic proteins AIF and endonuclease G. Both proteins translocate from mitochondria to the nucleus and contribute to spongistatin 1-mediated apoptosis as shown via gene silencing. Second, spongistatin 1 acts as a tubulin-depolymerizing agent and is able to free the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim from its sequestration both by the microtubular complex and by the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Silencing of Bim by siRNA leads to a diminished translocation of AIF and endonuclease G to the nucleus and subsequently reduces rate of apoptosis. By using spongistatin 1 as a chemical tool, Bim has been suggested to be an important factor upstream of mitochondria by executing a central role in the caspase-independent apoptotic signaling pathway induced by spongistatin 1. These different apoptotic features indicate that the apoptosis signaling is cell line-specific. Finally, spongistatin 1 affects highly invasive pancreatic tumor cells by not only inhibiting their invasion and migration but also by inducing anoikis in these cells. Bcl-2 seems to be a major target for spongistatin 1 in these processes. Besides tumor cells, spongistatin inhibits angiogenic activity of endothelial cells via inhibition of PKC-a [354] .
