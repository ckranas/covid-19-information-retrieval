It is believed that the name America was first used on a map of the New World created by German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller in 1507, reputedly in recognition of the Italian explorer, Amerigo Vespucci, who had made a series of voyages to the region in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The earliest inhabitants of the north American continent can be traced back to Palaeolithic times. The Pueblo culture in modern-day Colorado and New Mexico flourished from the 11th to the 14th century AD. In the 12th century permanent settlements appeared in the east where cultivation and fishing supported major fortified towns. The first Europeans to make their presence felt were the Spanish, who based themselves in Florida before venturing north and west. Santa Fe in New Mexico was founded in 1610. But by the mid-17th century there was competition centred on Quebec from the French who colonized the banks of the St Lawrence River. Elizabethan adventurers were eager to exploit the New World but it was not until 1607 that an English colony was established. This was at Jamestown in what is now southern Virginia. After a perilous start when disease and malnutrition carried off most of the settlers, Virginia's population grew rapidly to meet the European demand for tobacco. Maryland, originally a refuge for persecuted Catholics, also thrived on the tobacco trade. To make up for the shortage of labour, slaves were imported from Africa. In 1620 a hundred pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock to found a Puritan enclave, which became the colony of Massachusetts. Other settlements soon followed, accommodating a broad range of Christian radicals fleeing persecution. Not all were tolerant of beliefs that differed from their own. Pennsylvania, the colony named after the Quaker William Penn, was exceptional in offering freedom of worship to 'all persons who confess and acknowledge the one almighty and eternal God'. In 1664 the British took control of neighbouring Dutch colonies. New Amsterdam became New York. Almost all of the eastern seaboard was now claimed by British settlers who were also venturing inland. Their main European rivals were the French who claimed a vast area around and to the southwest of the Great Lakes. With American Indian tribes allied to both sides, there was heavy fighting in 1744 and 1748. But within a decade British forces had captured most of the French strongholds. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Britain commanded the whole of North America east of the Mississippi while Spain, having surrendered Florida, gained Louisiana from France. For a brief period colonization was restricted to the area east of the Appalachians, the rest of the territory being reserved for American Indian tribes. This soon became a point of issue between the settlers who were intent on expansion and the government in London, which wanted a settled, selfsupporting community benefiting British trade. Having disposed of the French threat, the colonists felt confident enough to defy orders that ignored their interests. In particular, they objected to the Navigation Acts which required goods to be carried in British vessels and to various taxes imposed without consultation. 'No taxation without representation' became a rallying cry for disaffected colonists. The centre of opposition was Boston, scene of the infamous 'tea party' when, in 1773, militants destroyed a cargo of East India tea. In 1775 the arrest of rebel ringleaders served only to provoke the 13 colonies to co-operate in further acts of rebellion, including the setting up of a de facto government which appointed George Washington commander of American forces. The War of Independence (Revolutionary War) was by no means a clear-cut affair. British forces, never more than 50,000 strong, were supported by a powerful body of colonists who remained loyal to the Crown. The war lasted for seven years from 1776 with both sides often getting close to a conclusive victory. The decisive moment came at last with the surrender of Gen. Burgoyne and his 8,000 troops in upper New York state in Oct. 1777, a defeat that persuaded a cautious France to enter the war. Under the peace terms secured in 1783 Britain kept Canada, leaving the new United States with territory stretching from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. A constitution based on democratic principles buttressed by inalienable rights including the ownership of property came into force in 1789. It allowed for a federal government headed by a president and executive, a legislature with a House of Representatives and a Senate, and a judiciary with ultimate authority on constitutional matters exercised by a Supreme Court. The first president was George Washington, who was elected in 1789. In 1800 Washington, D.C. was declared the national capital. Hostilities with Britain resumed in 1812 amidst accusations that Britain was using the excuse of the Napoleonic wars to harass American shipping and to encourage American Indian resistance to expansion into the Midwest. Most of the fighting took place on the Canadian border where an attempted invasion was decisively repulsed. But Louisiana, having reverted to French rule and subsequently sold to the USA, was secured for the Union. With the exception of Louisiana, other American territories that had once been part of the Spanish empire fell to Mexico. But not for long. In 1836 Texas broke away from Mexico, surviving as an independent republic until 1845 when it was annexed by the USA. This provoked war with Mexico which ended in 1848 with the USA taking over what are now the states of California, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and New Mexico. Any temptation there might have been for European involvement in the struggle was removed by the Monroe Doctrine, a declaration by President Monroe that interference from the Old World in matters concerning the western hemisphere would not be tolerated. It was a measure of the growing military and economic selfconfidence of the USA that such a warning, delivered in 1823, was taken seriously. The westward expansion began soon after independence but accelerated with the destruction of American Indian power and the removal of the native population to designated reservations. In 1846 a long-running dispute with Britain confirming US title to Oregon acted as a spur to migration as did the Californian gold rush of 1848. By the 1850s the railway network was bringing people and economic prosperity to the mid-west. The population quadrupled between 1815 to 1860, from 8m. to almost 31m. In 1862 the Homestead Act allocated 160 acres to anyone who was ready to farm it. By 1890 the expansion into the west was largely complete. The transition from a rural society to an industrial power of world importance created tensions, not least between the slave-owning southern states and the rest of the Union which favoured the abolition of slavery. Economic as well as humanitarian factors were in play since the North resented the advantage cheap labour gave to the South. The opposing view held that the South, by now the world's largest cotton producer, depended on slavery for its commercial survival. Mutual antagonism came to a head with the secession of the southern states from the Union in 1860-61 and their formation as a Confederacy. Despite sporadic outbreaks of violence, civil war was not in prospect until Confederate troops fired on the US flag at Fort Sumter. President Abraham Lincoln ordered a blockade of the South. The recruitment of rival armies followed within weeks. The war turned out to be much bloodier than anyone had expected. More American lives were lost in the Civil War than in the two world wars combined. The military balance was maintained until 1863 when the North secured a crushing victory at the Battle of Gettysburg. However, the war continued until April 1865 when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. A few days later Lincoln was assassinated, a loss that the southern states had subsequent cause to regret. Contrary to Lincoln's hopes, a generous settlement was now out of the question. Instead of a gradual transition to a new society, the South was rushed into a social revolution. This in turn led to terrorist violence and acts of vengeance against freed slaves. From this carnage emerged the notorious Ku Klux Klan as the standard bearer of lynch law. While the 13th amendment (1865) prohibited slavery, political freedom was denied to the Black community by state-imposed literacy tests and discriminatory property taxes. That America had interests beyond its own borders was made evident by the Spanish war of 1898 which resulted in the USA becoming the dominant power in the Caribbean. However, the effort to take over in the Philippines came up against Filipino resistance and led to a heavy death toll. By 1900 the USA rivalled Britain and Germany as the world's dominant power. With vast natural resources and a manufacturing capacity that secured 11% of world trade, it was clear that Europe was soon to lose its grip on world affairs. Ironically, though, it was Europe as the chief supplier of labour that gave the USA the impetus it needed to fulfil its promise. Between 1881 and 1920, 23m. immigrants entered the USA, the largest population movement ever recorded. Given the heterogeneous background of the American population in the early 20th century it is scarcely surprising that popular opinion was against involvement in the First World War. But events, including German U-boat harassment of American shipping, soon proved that isolationism was not an option. It was not until 1917 that America joined the hostilities but the resurgence of energy created by the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force was critical to the Allied breakthrough. Post-war America, relatively unscathed by the European conflict, was unquestionably the most powerful nation and as such was able to dictate terms at the Versailles peace conference. But President Wilson's 'fourteen points' which set out a plan for collective security policed by a League of Nations failed to win support in the one country that was critical to its success. The Treaty was rejected by the Senate in 1920 and America retreated once again into isolationism. A resumption of economic growth was accompanied by a struggle to impose a common set of values, chiefly white and Protestant, on a diverse population. To outsiders the most extraordinary experiment in social engineering was Prohibition, a federally-imposed attempt to outlaw all alcoholic drinks. Whatever gain there was to the health of the nation, the chief beneficiaries were the bosses of organized crime. Dreams of everlasting prosperity were shattered by the 1929 Stock Market Crash. A succession of bank failures was followed by widespread bankruptcies and mass unemployment which sent the economy into a further downward spin. The beginning of the end to the agony came with the election to the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pushed through Congress a series of radical measures known collectively as the New Deal, aimed at revitalizing the nation. The abandonment of the gold standard, cheap loans to restart factories and farms and huge investment in public works proved to be the key to recovery. Nonetheless, unemployment remained high until production was boosted by the demands of another world war. In 1935 Roosevelt's social security act provided the bare bones of an American welfare state. Roosevelt was well aware of the dangers to the USA if the fascist dictators were allowed to triumph, but as in 1914, there was formidable popular opposition to direct involvement. Roosevelt compromised by supplying Britain with much needed armaments on favourable terms. But it was events in Asia rather than in Europe that eventually persuaded America of the need for direct action. Opposition to Japanese expansion into China and southeast Asia, including an oil embargo and a freezing of Japanese assets in the USA, brought a savage retaliation at Pearl Harbor in 1941, when much of the US fleet was destroyed. America declared war on Japan while Germany declared war on America. The US military effort focused initially on the Pacific but after 1942 American forces were also committed to the campaign in north Africa and Europe. With the D-Day landings in June 1944, US troops led the attack on Germany and in May 1945, within a month of Roosevelt's death, Germany surrendered. By then Vice-President Harry Truman had been confirmed as Roosevelt's successor and forced a Japanese surrender by sacrificing Hiroshima and Nagasaki to the atomic bomb. This time, in the aftermath of war, the USA needed no encouragement to assume the leadership of the free world. The threat of a Soviet takeover in Europe was countered by the formation of NATO in 1949 and the provision of dollar aid under the 1947 Marshall Plan to kick-start European economic recovery. In addition, the Truman doctrine provided a $400m. aid package for the Turkish and Greek governments. The risk of a return to isolationism receded still further when China fell to communism in 1949. In 1950 American troops went to the aid of South Korea when it was invaded by the communist North. Though technically under the aegis of the UN, the campaign was an almost entirely American affair led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. When Chinese forces became involved, MacArthur spoke openly of extending the war to the Chinese mainland, a threat countered strongly by President Truman who forced MacArthur's resignation to establish undisputed political control over the military. A ceasefire was negotiated after Dwight Eisenhower was elected president in 1953. The USA took the lead in setting up the South East Asia Treaty Organization on the same lines as NATO. Eisenhower had a decisive influence on the Suez crisis in 1956 when he refused to support the invasion of Egypt by British, French and Israeli forces. Domestically he made little headway against a powerful Democratic opposition in both Houses of Congress. His attempts to thaw the Cold War also met with frustration. He handed over the Republican presidential candidacy to his vice-president Richard Nixon, who lost the 1960 election by a slim margin to John F. Kennedy. In the early 1960s civil rights were high on the political agenda. The thuggish tactics of Senator Joe McCarthy and the House Committee on Un-American Activities during the previous decade brought into focus basic democratic freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution while growing protests against racial discrimination led to legislation to enforce equality of opportunity in education and employment. The civil rights movement peaked in the early 1960s when the imposition of federal law in the South led to acts of violence against liberal protesters. Foremost among the campaigners for racial equality was Martin Luther King, Jr, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and who was assassinated four years later. Social tensions were exacerbated by the Cold War confrontation. In his first year of office Kennedy was embarrassed by the failed Bay of Pigs invasion when anti-Castro Cubans, trained and supported by the CIA, attempted to overthrow the country's communist regime. The building of the Berlin Wall in Aug. 1961 symbolized a hardening of the Cold War. In 1962 Kennedy had to confront the prospect of the Soviets placing missiles in Cuba. The prospect of world war was only too real until an agreement between the two nations allowed for a withdrawal of the missiles on the condition of a US promise not to invade Cuba. The incident prompted a thawing in East-West relations and in 1963 the USA, UK and USSR signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty which, for the first time, put a brake on the spread of nuclear weapons. Less hopeful was the acceleration of the conflict in Vietnam. Kennedy increased the American military presence in South Vietnam from 700 at the beginning of his term in office to 15,000 to counter the threat of communist domination by the North. Domestically, Kennedy's government pledged $1√Å2bn. for social and housing programmes. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in Nov. 1963 and his vice-president, Lyndon Johnson, was inaugurated as his successor. Johnson oversaw the implementation of civil rights legislation initiated by the Kennedy administration, epitomized by the Voting Rights Act, and also introduced Medicare (health insurance for the elderly). By 1966 over 350,000 American troops were in Vietnam and by the following year almost 80,000 Americans had been killed or wounded. The public turned against involvement in southeast Asia, not least because increased military expenditure led to a delay in domestic reforms. Johnson decided not to contest the 1968 presidential election. His likely successor for the Democrat nomination was John Kennedy's brother, Bobby, but he was assassinated in June of that year. The Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, won the presidency. With falling support for US involvement in Vietnam, he reduced the number of troops stationed there from 550,000 in 1969 to 30,000 three years later but authorized military operations in North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in the hope of forcing North Vietnam to the negotiating table. Elsewhere, he signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) with Moscow in 1972 and relaxed trade restrictions against China. Nixon was re-elected as president in 1973 and shortly afterwards agreed a ceasefire with North Vietnam. However, his second term of office was cut short by the Watergate scandal. The charges against him centred on White House-released taped transcripts of discussions in which Nixon authorized a cover-up of a break-in at the Democratic party headquarters in the Watergate complex, Washington, D.C. in 1972. Threatened with Congressional impeachment, Nixon announced his resignation in Aug. 1974. Gerald Ford, who replaced Nixon, granted his predecessor a controversial 'full, free and absolute pardon'. Ford lost the 1976 presidential election to Democrat Jimmy Carter. Perceived as a Washington outsider, Carter's often strained relations with Congress and the Senate obstructed his domestic agenda. The economy suffered and by 1980 inflation and unemployment were both running high. Internationally, he secured the neutrality of the Panama Canal and brokered the influential Camp David talks between Egypt and Israel. He also re-established diplomatic ties with China. Henry Kissinger, who was secretary of state for part of Nixon's and all of Carter's years in office, oversaw America's withdrawal from southeast Asia, winning the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with his North Vietnamese counterpart Le Duc Tho in 1974 . Attempts at further improving US-Soviet relations were scuppered when the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II) was postponed because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The incursion also led to a US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Radical Iranian students stormed the US embassy in Tehran in late 1979 and seized over 50 US hostages. After a year of negotiations, a secret US military rescue mission failed and contributed to Republican Ronald Reagan's landslide victory at the 1980 presidential polls. Reagan's economic policies, known as 'Reaganomics', redefined American society in the 1980s. In his first year of office he introduced a 25% tax cut for individuals and corporations. He slashed welfare but increased military expenditure. In terms of governmental structure, he was intent on delegating many federal programmes to state and local levels. A recession in 1982 prompted tax increases and set the pattern of boom and bust that characterized his tenure. In 1986 he reduced the number of tax rates, abolishing tax altogether for many low-income earners. In Oct. 1987 the stock market collapsed, losing a third of its value over two months, and by the end of his presidency, Reagan had seen the national debt more than triple to $2√Å5trn. Relations between the USA and USSR deteriorated in the early 1980s. The shooting down of a South Korean airliner carrying American citizens in 1983 led to a further deployment of US missiles in Western Europe while US proposals for the Strategic Defense Initiative (known as 'Star Wars') added to tensions. In 1983 the USA invaded Grenada, scene of a coup, in a bid to curb Soviet-Cuban influence in the Caribbean. However, relations between the two superpowers improved in the mid-eighties after successful negotiations on nuclear arms limitations. Reagan met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 and in 1987 the two leaders signed a treaty in Washington, D.C. agreeing to destroy a range of intermediate-range nuclear weapons. Reagan's foreign policy elsewhere was unstinting in its protection of US interests. In 1986 he bombed Tripoli after Libya was accused of involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in West Berlin which killed two American servicemen. The following year he became embroiled in the Iran-Contra affair. The CIA was found to have sold arms to Iran to fund anti-communist guerrillas in Nicaragua. Reagan and his deputy, George Bush, were cleared of direct involvement but Reagan was censured for allowing the affair to develop. Bush took over the presidency in 1989 and continued an active foreign policy. At the end of 1989 he authorized the invasion of Panama to remove Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power. The collapse of the Soviet empire in 1990 extended US economic aid to Eastern Europe and Bush signed a non-aggression pact with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev which effectively ended the Cold War. In 1990-91 Bush led a coalition of European and Arab states to counter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Around 500,000 US troops were stationed in the Persian Gulf and when trade embargoes and diplomacy failed to persuade Iraq to withdraw, Bush authorized a military offensive in Jan. 1991 . By the end of Feb. Kuwaiti independence had been restored. Domestically, Bush was badly damaged when he was forced to raise taxes despite his election promise of 'no new taxes'. The Democrats regained control of the White House with the election of Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton combined economic recovery at home with an active foreign policy which underlined America's role as the only superpower. He secured the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which created a free-trade zone between the United States, Canada and Mexico, cut the United States budget deficit by 50% in his first term and in his second term authorized America's first tax cut since 1981. Unemployment reached its lowest levels since the late-1960s and in 1998 there was a federal budget surplus for the first time in almost 30 years. His social legislation included anti-crime provisions, the Family and Medical Leave Act, a welfare reform bill and an increase in the minimum wage. He also appointed Madeleine Albright as the first-ever female secretary of state. On the international scene Clinton brokered talks between the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin which resulted in limited Palestinian self-rule. He sent peacekeeping troops both to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Haiti. In 1995 he was instrumental in securing the Dayton accords that offered peace between Yugoslavia, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Relations with Vietnam were normalized and diplomatic and trade links with China much improved. He was also an important figure in the formulation of the 1998 Good Friday agreement which sought to reach a peace settlement in Northern Ireland. Clinton retained a hard-line stance against Iraq, sending forces against Saddam Hussein in 1994 Hussein in , 1996 Hussein in and 1998 . Sudan and Afghanistan were attacked in 1998 having been linked with the al-Qaeda terrorist network held responsible for the bombing of US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. In 1999 there was a Clinton-led NATO campaign of air strikes against Yugoslavia when the country's leaders refused to end a campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá was forced to withdraw his troops and allow an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. However, Clinton's second term of office was dominated by scandal. He reached an out-of-court agreement with Paula Jones, a state government employee who had accused him of sexual harassment. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, were also accused of criminal wrongdoing over a land deal in Arkansas, known as Whitewater, though they were both eventually cleared of the charges. Most damagingly, Clinton had an affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. Having denied the sexual nature of the affair under oath, Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice although the Senate trial ended when neither motion gained a simple majority. In 2000 Clinton's vice-president, Al Gore, lost the presidential election to George W. Bush, son of the earlier President George Bush. Gore was defeated despite winning the popular vote. In 2001 Bush's first budget included a $1√Å25trn. tax cut. He attracted international criticism in his early months in office for refusing to ratify the Kyoto Agreement on global warming and climate change and for his bid to replace the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with a new accord allowing for a missile defence system in the United States. Following talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June 2001 the two leaders signed an anti-nuclear deal to reduce their respective strategic nuclear warheads by two-thirds over the next ten years. 'War on Terror' On 11 Sept. 2001 the heart of New York City was devastated after hijackers flew two jet airliners into the World Trade Center. A plane also crashed into the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C., and a fourth hijacked plane crashed near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The death toll, initially put at 6,700, was eventually lowered to 2,753, with 67 countries reporting dead or missing citizens. Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident leader of the al-Qaeda terrorist network and believed to be living in Afghanistan at the invitation of the ruling Taliban, immediately became the chief suspect and military action against Afghanistan followed, with air strikes beginning on 7 Oct. 2001. Despite the UN establishing a fragile multi-party government in Afghanistan, the USA continues to carry out special missions against Taliban and al-Qaeda targets. In early 2002 Bush declared North Korea, Iran and Iraq 'an axis of evil' and by Sept. 2002 was pressing the UN to act against Iraq. Bush's foreign policy was played out against a background of domestic recession. On 20 March 2003 US forces, supported by the UK, launched attacks on Iraq, and initiated a war aimed at 'liberating Iraq'. On 9 April 2003 American forces took control of central Baghdad, effectively bringing an end to Saddam Hussein's rule. In Nov. 2004 Bush won a second term as president, which was dominated by continuing military engagement in Iraq and Afghanistan and by the collapse in 2007 of the US sub-prime mortgage sector. He was succeeded by the Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election of 2008 to become the country's first African American president. Obama took office with the global financial system in turmoil. In March 2010 he oversaw the passage of landmark legislation reforming health care insurance. In May 2011 he ordered the military strike that led to the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He won a second term with victory in the 2012 presidential election. From June 2013 his administration was undermined by revelations of controversial widespread surveillance of US citizens and foreign allies by the National Security Agency. In Oct. 2013 the government shut down for 16 days following Congress's refusal to sign off the budget. From 2014 US air strikes targeted Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria. Also that year social unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a national debate on relations between the police and the Black community. Tensions continued in 2015 and 2016 amid a number of high-profile incidents in which unarmed Black men were shot and killed by police. A protest in Dallas in July 2016 culminated in the deaths of five police officers. In July 2015 the USA sanctioned a multinational deal with Iran, curbing nuclear weapons development by Tehran. In the same month, the USA and Cuba normalized their diplomatic relations. 2016 was dominated by the presidential election in Nov., when Republican candidate Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump campaigned on a divisive populist agenda of protectionist economic policies and tighter border controls. After taking office in Jan. 2017, his early tenure was dominated by legal challenges to executive orders he had signed imposing a travel ban on several Muslim-majority nations. He also introduced new regulations governing visa applications and trade between US citizens and Cuban firms, confirming a renewed cooling in relations with its island neighbour. The United States is bounded in the north by Canada, east by the North Atlantic, south by the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico, and west by the North Pacific Ocean. The area of the 50 states of the USA plus the District of Columbia is 3,796,742 sq. miles (9,833,517 sq. km) , of which 3,531,905 sq. miles (9,147,593 sq. km) 258 7,488,676 357,780 62,947,714 1900 66,868,508 8,834,395 509,265 76,212,168 1910 81,812,405 9,828,667 587,459 92,228,531 1920 94,903,540 10,463,607 654,421 106,021,568 1930 110,395,753 11,891,842 915,065 123,202,660 1940 118,357,831 12,865,914 941,384 132,165,129 1950 135,149,629 15,044,937 1,131,232 151,325,798 1960 158,831,732 18,871,831 1,619,612 179,323,175 1970 177,748,975 22,580,289 2,882,662 203,211,926 1980 188,371,622 26,495,025 11,679,158 226,545,805 1990 199,686,070 29,986,060 19,037,743 248,709,873 2000 1 211,460,626 34,658,190 35,303,090 281,421,906 2010 1 223,553,265 38,929,319 46,262,954 308,745 ,538 1 'White' refers to the White-alone population, 'Black' to the Black-alone population and 'Other races' to the population in all the remaining race groups, including those reporting two or more races. The mid-year population estimate for 2019 was 328,239,523. The 2010 census population of 308,745,538 represented an increase of 9√Å7% since 2000 (the smallest percentage increase between ten-yearly US censuses since the Second World War). Minorities accounted for 92% of the growth. There were 156,964,212 females at the 2010 census, or 50√Å8% of the total population. The UN gives an estimated population for 2020 of 331√Å00m. 2010 density, 33√Å8 per sq. km (87√Å4 per sq. mile). Urban population (persons living in places with at least 2,500 inhabitants) at the 2010 census was 249,253,271 (80√Å7%); rural, 59,492,267. In 2000 it was 79√Å0%; in 1990, 75√Å2%; in 1980, 73√Å7%; in 1970, 73√Å6%. Sex distribution by race of the population in 2013: Alongside these racial groups, and applicable to all of them, a category of 'Hispanic origin ' comprised 50,477,594 persons in 2010 ' comprised 50,477,594 persons in (including 31,798,258 of Mexican ancestry), up 15,171,776 from 35,305,818 in 2000 Hispanics are now the largest ethnic minority in the USA. The rapid growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations led the US Census Bureau to suggest in 2014 that by around 2044 Whites will constitute less than half the total population. Among ten-year age groups the 45-54 age group contained the most people according to the 2010 census, with a total of 45,006,716 (14√Å6% of the population). At the 2000 census the 35-44 age group had the most people. At the 2010 census there were 116,716,292 households, up from 105,480,101 in 2000. There were 31√Å7m. single-person households in 2010 representing 27% of all households, up from 9% in 1950. There were 53,364 people aged 100 or over according to the 2010 census, compared to 50,454 in 2000. Females accounted for 82√Å8% of the centenarians in 2010, up from 80√Å1% in 2000. The USA does not have an official language, although English has been provided with official status in 30 states. A survey covering the period 2009-13 showed that 60√Å4m. persons five years and over spoke a language other than English in the home, including Spanish or Spanish Creole by 37√Å5m.; Chinese by 2√Å9m.; French or French Creole by 2√Å0m.; Tagalog (a Filipino language) by 1√Å6m.; Vietnamese by 1√Å4m.; Korean by 1√Å1m.; and German by 1√Å1m. 79√Å3% of the population has English as its mother tongue. The following table includes population statistics, the year in which each of the original 13 states (Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia) ratified the constitution, and the year when each of the other states was admitted into the Union. Two-letter abbreviated postal codes for use in addresses are shown in brackets. The USA is divided into four geographic regions comprised of nine divisions. These are, with their 2010 census populations: Northeast (comprised of the New England and Middle Atlantic divisions), 53, 317, 240; Midwest (East North Central, West North Central), 66, 927, 001; South (South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central), 114, 555, 744; West (Mountain, Pacific) , 71,945,553. 3 3 0 3 0 1 Overall figure for area does not equal sum of totals for individual states and divisions because of rounding. 2 District of Columbia selected as site of national government in 1791. 3 No permanent residents. There may be occasional visits from military and scientific personnel. In 2016 there were 43,070,000 foreign-born persons, representing 13√Å5% of the population; of these 22√Å45m. were from Latin America (including 11√Å70m. from Mexico), 12√Å83m. from Asia and 4√Å52m. from Europe. The percentage of the population that is foreign-born has more than doubled since 1980. In fiscal year 2015 a total of 1,051,031 persons obtained legal permanent resident status (1, 266, 129 in fiscal year 2006 and a record 1,826,595 in 1991) . Population of cities with over 100,000 inhabitants at the censuses of 2000 and 2010: Census 2000 -100,377 1 Designated by the United States Census Bureau as a CDP (census designated place) and not incorporated as a city. 2 Incorporated since the 2000 census. 3 Officially designated as a Municipality. 4 Officially designated as a Town. The Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, provides for the numerical limitation of most immigration. The Immigration Act of 1990 established major revisions in the numerical limits and preference system regulating legal immigration. The numerical limits are imposed on visas issued and not admissions. The maximum number of visas allowed to be issued under the preference categories in fiscal year 2012 was 370,951: 226,000 for family-sponsored immigrants and 144,951 for employment-based immigrants. Within the overall limitations the per-country limit for independent countries is set to 7% of the total family and employment limits, while dependent areas are limited to 2% of the total. Immigrants not subject to any numerical limitation are spouses, children, and parents of US citizens who are 21 years of age or older; certain former US citizens; ministers of religion; certain long-term US government employees; refugees and asylumseekers adjusting to immigrant status; and certain other groups of immigrants. Immigrants obtaining lawful permanent residence, by country or region of birth, for fiscal years: Country or region of birth The total number of immigrants admitted from 1820 to 2017 was 83,861,792, with most coming from Mexico, Germany and Italy. One of the consequences of the economic downturn of the late 2000s is that immigration from Mexico declined considerably and the net migration flow also slowed. In 2013 for the first time Mexico was overtaken as the leading sending country for immigrants to the USA, with more coming from both China and India. Illegal immigration remains a concern. In the 2013 fiscal year the USA deported some 370,000 undocumented immigrants. In the 2014 fiscal year 67,339 unaccompanied children were detained crossing the US-Mexico border (of which more came from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador than Mexico itself), up from 38,045 in the previous fiscal year and 24,120 in the 2012 fiscal year. The number of immigrants admitted for legal permanent residence in the United States in fiscal year 2017 was 1,127,627. Included in this total were 578,081 new arrivals who entered the country with legal permanent resident status. The remaining 549,546 were status adjusters, who had arrived earlier as non-immigrants (including students and temporary workers). The USA has by far the largest annual net gain in migrants of any country. It also receives the most asylum seekers on an annual basis. A total of 707,265 persons were naturalized in fiscal year 2017 (including 118,559 persons born in Mexico). The refugee admissions ceiling for fiscal year 2017 was fixed by then President Obama at 110,000 (the highest total since 1995). For the fiscal year 2018, President Trump-who campaigned for the presidency on a platform of immigration control-requested a cap of 45,000. The birth rate in 2017 was the lowest ever recorded. Although divorce figures are not available since 1997 as not all states maintain complete statistics, it is estimated that the rate fell from 4√Å3 per 1,000 population in 1997 to 3√Å1 per 1,000 in 2015 (the lowest rate since 1968). Rate of natural increase per 1,000 population: 5√Å9 in 2000; 5√Å0 in 2010; 3√Å2 in 2017 3√Å2 in . Population growth rate, 2003 Even though the marriage rate shows a gradual decline, it remains much higher than in most other industrial countries. In 2017 the median age at first marriage was 29√Å5 for males and 27√Å4 for females. In 2014, 7% of Black men were married to a White woman and 4% of Black women were married to a White man. Following a Supreme Court ruling, same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in June 2015. The number of births to unmarried women in 2014 was 1,604,870 (40√Å2% of all births), compared to 665,747 in 1980 and a peak of 1,726,566 in 2008 . The rate of births to teenagers was 22√Å3 per 1,000 women in 2015 (the lowest on record); it has halved since 2001. The number of babies born to women aged 15-19 was 249,078 in 2014, down from 409,802 in 2009 and the fewest reported since the end of the Second World War. Between 1970 and 2009 the proportion of all births outside of marriage rose from 11% to 41% with increases in all age groups (although it has fallen slightly in the meantime-the percentage of all births to unmarried women was 40√Å3% in 2015). The birth rate for unmarried women fell for the seventh consecutive year to 43√Å4 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2015. In 2016, 31√Å3% of children under 18 years lived in households with only one parent or neither parent. Infant mortality rates, per 1,000 live births: 29√Å2 in 1950; 12√Å9 in 1980; 5√Å9 in 2016 5√Å9 in . Fertility rate, 2016 births per woman (the lowest since the mid-1980s). There were a reported 926,190 abortions in 2014, down from a peak in 1990 of an estimated 1,608,600. The number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2014 was 14√Å6, the lowest since 1972. Expectation of life, 1970: males, 67√Å1 years; females, 74√Å7 years. 2016: males, 76√Å1 years; females, 81√Å1 years. The overall figure for 2016 of 78√Å6 years represented the second consecutive fall (from 78√Å7 years in 2015 and 78√Å9 years in 2014) . Numbers of deaths by principal causes, 2014 (and as a percentage of all deaths): heart disease, 614,348 (23√Å4%); cancer, 591,699 (22√Å5%); chronic lower respiratory disease, 147,101 (5√Å6%); accidents, 136,053 (5√Å2%); stroke, 133,103 (5√Å1%); Alzheimer's disease, 93,541 (3√Å6%); diabetes, 76,488 (2√Å9%); pneumonia and influenza, 55,227 (2√Å1%); kidney diseases, 48,146 (1√Å8%); suicide, 42,773 (1√Å6%). The age-adjusted suicide rate in 2014, at 13√Å0 per 100,000 population (20√Å7 per 100,000 among males and 5√Å5 per 100,000 among females), was the highest since the mid-1980s. The number of Americans living in poverty in 2015 was 43√Å1m. or 13√Å5% of the total population, down from 46√Å7m. and 14√Å8% in 2014 but up from 11√Å3% in 2000.

Ten amendments (called collectively 'the Bill of Rights') to the constitution were added 15 Dec. 1791; two in 1795 and 1804; a 13th amendment, 6 Dec. 1865, abolishing slavery; a 14th in 1868, including the important 'due process' clause; a 15th, 3 Feb. 1870, establishing equal voting rights for White and Black; a 16th, 3 Feb. 1913 , authorizing the income tax; a 17th, 8 April 1913, providing for popular election of Senators; an 18th, 16 Jan. 1919, prohibiting alcoholic liquors; a 19th, 18 Aug. 1920 , establishing women's suffrage; a 20th, 23 Jan. 1933 , advancing the date of the President's and Vice-President's inauguration and abolishing the 'lameduck' sessions of Congress; a 21st, 5 Dec. 1933 , repealing the 18th amendment; a 22nd, 27 Feb. 1951, limiting a President's tenure of office to two terms, or two full terms in the case of a Vice-President who has succeeded to the office of President and has served two years or less of another President's term, or one full term in the case of a Vice-President who has succeeded to the office of President and has served more than two years of another President's term; a 23rd, 30 March 1961, granting citizens of the District of Columbia the right to vote in national elections; a 24th, 4 Feb. 1964 , banning the use of the poll-tax in federal elections; a 25th, 10 Feb. 1967, dealing with Presidential disability and succession; a 26th, 22 June 1970, establishing the right of citizens who are 18 years of age and older to vote; a 27th, 7 May 1992, providing that no law varying the compensation of Senators or Representatives shall take effect until an election has taken place. National Motto 'In God we trust'; formally adopted by Congress 30 July 1956. The executive power is vested in a president, who holds office for four years, and is elected, together with a vice-president chosen for the same term, by electors from each state, equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress. The President must be a natural-born citizen, resident in the country for 14 years, and at least 35 years old. The presidential election is held every fourth (leap) year on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Nov. Technically, this is an election of presidential electors, not of a president directly; the electors thus chosen meet and give their votes (for the candidate to whom they are pledged, in some states by law, but in most states by custom and prudent politics) at their respective state capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in Dec. next following their election; and the votes of the electors of all the states are opened and counted in the presence of both Houses of Congress on the sixth day of Jan. The total electorate vote is one for each Senator and Representative. Electors may not be a member of Congress or hold federal office. If no candidate secures the minimum 270 college votes needed for outright victory, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution applies, and the House of Representatives chooses a president from among the first three finishers in the electoral college. (This last happened in 1824). If the successful candidate for President dies before taking office the Vice-President-elect becomes President; if no candidate has a majority or if the successful candidate fails to qualify, then, by the 20th amendment, the Vice-President acts as President until a president qualifies. The duties of the Presidency, in absence of the President and Vice-President by reason of death, resignation, removal, inability or failure to qualify, devolve upon the Speaker of the House under legislation enacted on 18 July 1947. In case of absence of a Speaker for like reason, the presidential duties devolve upon the President pro tempore of the Senate and successively upon those members of the cabinet in order of precedence, who have the constitutional qualifications for President. The presidential term, by the 20th amendment to the constitution, begins at noon on 20 Jan. of the inaugural year. This amendment also installs the newly elected Congress in office on 3 Jan. instead of-as formerly-in the following Dec. The President's salary is $400,000 per year (taxable), with an additional $50,000 to assist in defraying expenses resulting from official duties. Also he may spend up to $100,000 non-taxable for travel and $19,000 for official entertainment. In 1999 the presidential salary was increased for the president taking office in Jan. 2001 , having remained at $200,000 a year since 1969. The office of Vice-President carries a salary of $230,700 and $20,000 allowance for expenses, all taxable. The Vice-President is ex officio President of the Senate, and in the case of 'the removal of the President, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of his office', he becomes the President for the remainder of the term. The administrative business of the nation has been traditionally vested in several executive departments, the heads of which, unofficially and ex officio, formed the President's cabinet. Beginning with the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, however, an increasing amount of executive business has been entrusted to some 30 so-called independent agencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Reserve System, etc. All heads of departments and of the administrative agencies are appointed by the President, but must be confirmed by the Senate. The legislative power is vested by the Constitution in a Congress, consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives. By amendments of the constitution, disqualification of voters on the ground of race, colour or sex is forbidden. The electorate consists of all citizens over 18 years of age. Literacy tests have been banned since 1970. In 1972 durational residency requirements were held to violate the constitution. In 1973 US citizens abroad were enfranchised. With limitations imposed by the constitution, it is the states which determine voter eligibility. In general states exclude from voting: persons who have not established residency in the jurisdiction in which they wish to vote; persons who have been convicted of felonies whose civil rights have not been restored; persons declared mentally incompetent by a court. Illiterate voters are entitled to receive assistance in marking their ballots. Minority-language voters in jurisdictions with statutorily prescribed minority concentrations are entitled to have elections conducted in the minority language as well as English. Disabled voters are entitled to accessible polling places. Voters absent on election days or unable to go to the polls are generally entitled under state law to vote by absentee ballot. The Constitution guarantees citizens that their votes will be of equal value under the 'one person, one vote' rule. The Senate consists of two members from each state (but not from the District of Columbia), chosen by popular vote for six years, approximately one-third retiring or seeking re-election every two years. Senators must be no less than 30 years of age; must have been citizens of the USA for nine years, and be residents in the states for which they are chosen. The Senate has complete freedom to initiate legislation, except revenue bills (which must originate in the House of Representatives); it may, however, amend or reject any legislation originating in the lower house. The Senate is also entrusted with the power of giving or withholding its 'advice and consent' to the ratification of all treaties initiated by the President with foreign powers, a two-thirds majority of Senators present being required for approval. (However, it has no control over 'international executive agreements' made by the President with foreign governments; such 'agreements' cover a wide range and are more numerous than formal treaties.) The Senate has 16 Standing Committees to which all bills are referred for study, revision or rejection. The House of Representatives has 20 such committees. In both Houses each Standing Committee has a chairman and a majority representing the majority party of the whole House; each has numerous sub-committees. The jurisdictions of these Committees correspond largely to those of the appropriate executive departments and agencies. Both Houses also have a few select or special Committees with limited duration. The House of Representatives consists of 435 members elected every second year. The number of each state's Representatives is determined by the decennial census, in the absence of specific Congressional legislation affecting the basis. The number of Representatives for each state in the 116th congress, which began in Jan. 2019 (based on the 2010 census), is given below: The constitution requires congressional districts within each state to be substantially equal in population. Final decisions on congressional district boundaries are taken by the state legislatures and governors. By custom the Representative lives in the district from which he is elected. Representatives must be not less than 25 years of age, citizens of the USA for seven years and residents in the state from which they are chosen. In addition, five delegates (one each from the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico) are also members of Congress. They have a voice but no vote, except in committees. The delegate from Puerto Rico is the resident commissioner. Puerto Ricans vote at primaries, but not at national elections. Each of the two Houses of Congress is sole 'judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members'; and each of the Houses may, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member. The period usually termed 'a Congress' in legislative language continues for two years, terminating at noon on 3 Jan. The salary of a Senator is $174,000 per annum, with tax-free expense allowance and allowances for travelling expenses and for clerical hire. The salary of the Speaker of the House of Representatives is $223,500 per annum, with a taxable allowance. The salary of a Member of the House is $174,000. The salary for the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives is $193,400. No Senator or Representative can, during the time for which he is elected, be appointed to any civil office under authority of the USA which shall have been created or the emoluments of which shall have been increased during such time; and no person holding any office under the USA can be a member of either House during his continuance in office. No religious text may be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the USA or in any state. By an Act passed on 2 June 1924 full citizenship was granted to all American Indians born in the USA, though those remaining in tribal units were still under special federal jurisdiction. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 gave the tribal Indians, at their own option, substantial opportunities of self-government and the establishment of self-controlled corporate enterprises empowered to borrow money and buy land, machinery and equipment; these corporations are controlled by democratically elected tribal councils. Recently a trend towards releasing American Indians from federal supervision has resulted in legislation terminating supervision over specific tribes. In 1988 the federal government recognized that it had a special relationship with, and a trust responsibility for, federally recognized American Indian entities in continental USA and tribal entities in Alaska. In 2015 the Bureau of Indian Affairs listed 566 'Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services'. Total American Indian and Alaska Native population at the 2010 census was 2,932,248, of which California (362,801), Oklahoma (321,687), Arizona (296,529) and New Mexico (193, 222) accounted for more than 40%. The District of Columbia, ceded by the State of Maryland for the purposes of government in 1791, is the seat of the US government. It includes the city of Washington, and embraces a land area of 61 sq. miles. The Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 instituted a Mayor Council form of government with appointed officers. In 1973 an elected Mayor and elected councillors were introduced; in 1974 they received power to legislate in local matters. Congress retains power to enact legislation and to veto or supersede the Council's acts. Since 1961 citizens have had the right to vote in national elections. In 1978 the Senate approved a constitutional amendment giving the District full voting representation in Congress but it was not ratified by the requisite three-quarters of the states within seven years and so expired in 1985. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands of the United States each have a local legislature, whose acts may be modified or annulled by Congress, though in practice this has seldom been done. Puerto Rico, since its attainment of commonwealth status on 25 July 1952, enjoys practically complete self-government, including the election of its governor and other officials. The conduct of foreign relations, however, is still a federal function and federal bureaux and agencies still operate in the island. General supervision of territorial administration is exercised by the Office of Territories in the Department of Interior. The Union comprises 13 original states, seven states which were admitted without having been previously organized as territories, and 30 states which had been territories-50 states in all. Each state has its own constitution (which the USA guarantees shall be republican in form), deriving its authority, not from Congress, but from the people of the state. Admission of states into the Union has been granted by special Acts of Congress, either (1) in the form of 'enabling Acts' providing for the drafting and ratification of a state constitution by the people, in which case the territory becomes a state as soon as the conditions are fulfilled, or (2) accepting a constitution already framed, and at once granting admission. Each state is provided with a legislature of two Houses (except Nebraska, which since 1937 has had a single-chamber legislature), a governor and other executive officials, and a judicial system. Both Houses of the legislature are elective, but the senators (having larger electoral districts usually covering two or three counties compared with the single county or, in some states, the town, which sends one representative to the Lower House) are less numerous than the representatives, while in 38 states their terms are four years; in 12 states the term is two years. Of the four-year Senates, Illinois, Montana and New Jersey provide for two four-year terms and one two-year term in each decade. Terms of the lower houses are usually shorter; in 45 states, two years. The trend is towards annual sessions of state legislatures; most meet annually now whereas in 1939 only four did. The Governor is elected by direct vote of the people over the whole state for a term of office ranging in the various states from two to four years and with a salary ranging from $70,000 (Maine) to $201, 680 (California) . The Governor's duty is to see to the faithful administration of the law, and he has command of the military forces of the state. He may recommend measures but does not present bills to the legislature. In some states he presents estimates. In all but one of the states (North Carolina) the Governor has a veto upon legislation, which may, however, be overridden by the two Houses, in some states by a simple majority, in others by a three-fifths or two-thirds majority. In some states the Governor, on his death or resignation, is succeeded by a Lieut.-Governor who was elected at the same time and has been presiding over the state Senate. In several states the Speaker of the Lower House succeeds the Governor. From the 1980s Trump sporadically expressed an interest in entering politics, variously mentioning ambitions to stand for the US presidency or the mayoralty of New York. He was a vocal critic of Barack Obama's two-term Democratic tenure from 2009, even suggesting that Obama had not been eligible to stand for the presidency on the spurious grounds that he was born abroad (an allegation the White House refuted by releasing Obama's birth certificate). On 16 June 2015 Trump formally announced his decision to stand in the presidential primaries, promising to 'Make America Great Again'. He became the presumptive nominee following a landslide victory in the Indiana primary on 3 May 2016, after which all his remaining Republican rivals withdrew. On 15 July he announced Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate and both were nominated at the Republican National Convention four days later. Trump attracted much media focus on his business history, celebrity reputation, social attitudes and abrasive campaigning style. His contentious policy standpoints included strict controls on immigration and the exclusion of foreign Muslims, and the building of a wall along the border with neighbouring Mexico. He also stated his intention to repeal Obama's affordable medical care legislation, to negotiate new bilateral trade deals abroad and to withhold defensive support to NATO partners that he considered made an insufficient contribution to defence costs. In addition, he praised the autocratic presidential tenure of Vladimir Putin in Russia. Trump variously described the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, as 'crooked' and physically unfit for office. His victory at the polls on 8 Nov. was regarded as one of the greatest upsets in US presidential election history. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president in Jan. 2017. Apparent discord in the White House and allegations of impropriety have since prompted a frequent turnover of senior government figures and presidential aides. Trump has also favoured the use of social media over traditional channels of information dissemination and state diplomacy, which on several occasions has generated criticism and resentment overseas. Meanwhile, he has sought to reverse much of his predecessor's legacy on trade, the environment and health care, and to strengthen US defences, immigration controls and deportation guidelines. In June 2017 he announced that he would withdraw the USA from the 2015 landmark United Nations agreement reached in Paris on climate change. However, his efforts to suspend the entry of citizens from several Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and Africa were blocked by the courts until June 2018 when the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced. Also, his demands for federal funding for the construction of a border wall with Mexico to block illegal immigration were resisted by the resurgent Democrats in the House of Representatives following their majority victory in the mid-term congressional elections in Nov. 2018. The consequent political stand-off led to the longest shutdown of the federal government in history, from late Dec. 2018 until its temporary suspension for three weeks from late Jan. 2019 and the negotiation of a limited compromise agreement in mid-Feb. Trump subsequently declared a national emergency as a means of securing extra funding to build the wall, although the legality of his action was challenged. In international affairs, Trump has made plain his hostility towards Iran. He not only withdrew the USA in May 2018 from the multilateral agreement of 2015 containing Iran's nuclear development and imposed more punitive sanctions, but has also more directly confronted Iran's regional influence in the Middle East, including by authorizing the assassination in Iraq in Jan. 2020 of Qassem Suleimani, Iran's most senior military general. At the same time he has demonstrated unwavering support for Israel. In 2017 he announced that the USA would officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and in 2019 he recognized Israel's disputed sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights and declared Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank to be consistent with international law. Then in Jan. 2020 he unveiled a long-awaited peace plan for the Middle East that was heavily weighted in Israel's territorial favour despite envisaging a separate, but disjointed, Palestinian state. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, promptly dismissed the plan. In response to alleged chemical weapon attacks in 2017 and 2018 in Syria's civil war attributed to President Assad's Russian-and Iranianbacked regime, Trump had ordered missile strikes on Syrian military targets. However, he later controversially announced in Oct. 2019 that he was withdrawing US troops from northern Syria, seemingly abandoning his Kurdish allies against the jihadist Islamic State presence in that country, which then prompted a military offensive by neighbouring Turkey against the Kurds. Speculation about Trump's perceived ambivalence towards Russia's President Putin and claims about alleged Russian cyber backing for his 2016 election campaign continued to undermine his fractious relationship with the US federal security agencies and the media. Nevertheless, a two-year investigation into the election concluded in March 2019 that there was no evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign team and Russian agencies or of attempts by the president to obstruct justice, and in Aug. Trump formally withdrew the USA from the 1987 arms limitation agreement with Russia on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe, having accused the Russians of breaking its terms. Trump has adopted a harder line than his predecessor towards neighbouring communist Cuba, banning US citizens from conducting business with any entity with links to the Cuban military, intelligence or security agencies and tightening visa restrictions. He has also sought to undermine the regime of the leftist president of Venezuela, Nicol√°s Maduro. In Jan. 2019, amid increasing civil unrest, he recognized Juan Guaid√≥, the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the country's interim leader and in Aug. froze all assets of the Maduro government and threatened sanctions against companies doing business with it. Having initially pursued an aggressive policy towards communist North Korea's military threat to neighbouring states, warning of overwhelming retaliatory action, Trump then staged an historic meeting with his counterpart, Kim Jong-un, in June 2018, at which they agreed to work towards denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Despite little apparent diplomatic progress by the year's end, a second summit took place in Feb. 2019, and a third in June, but they ended without any significant advance being made. And although he had earlier endorsed the 'one China' principle defining US relations with Beijing, Trump signed Congress-approved legislation in Nov. 2019 supporting the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, prompting condemnation by the Chinese government. Regarding economic policy, Trump instigated major changes in taxation and budgetary spending, further stimulating an already growing economy. In Dec. 2017 he signed into law a radical US$1√Å5trn. tax reform plan, cutting corporate tax rates in particular, while in Feb. 2018, in a significant departure from traditional Republican fiscal orthodoxy, he proposed a $4√Å4trn. budget outlining steep changes to domestic programmes, large increases in military expenditure and a significant rise in the federal deficit. Meanwhile, his disdain for the international trade order prompted his withdrawal of the USA from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (the trade agreement concluded by the Obama administration with 11 other Pacific region countries) and the renegotiation of the 24-year-old trilateral North American Free Trade Agreement between the USA, Canada and Mexico. He also ignited a damaging trade war in 2018 between the USA and China, progressively imposing trade tariffs on Chinese products to stop what he claimed had been the systematic theft of US intellectual property. China similarly retaliated before both sides reached an initial 'phase one' deal on tariffs, imports and intellectual property in Dec. 2019 to resolve the dispute, which was formally signed in Jan. 2020. In Dec. 2019 Trump became only the third US president after Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton to face impeachment proceedings as the Democratcontrolled House of Representatives pursued allegations that he pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate and discredit a potential Democrat rival in the forthcoming 2020 presidential election. However, in the subsequent trial proceedings on charges of abuse of power that began in the Senate in Jan. 2020, the Republican majority in the chamber voted against calling new witnesses, undermining the prosecution case, and then in early Feb. voted not to convict the president, prompting considerable political and media criticism. The President is C.-in-C. of the Army, Navy and Air Force. The National Security Act of 1947 provides for the unification of the Army, Navy and Air Forces under a single Secretary of Defense with cabinet rank. The President is also advised by a National Security Council and the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization. Defence expenditure in 2013 totalled $600,400m. ($1,896 per capita). Defence spending in 2013 represented 3√Å7% of GDP (down from 37√Å8% in 1944 , 14√Å2% in 1953 , 9√Å4% in 1968 and 6√Å2% of GDP in 1986 although up from the post-war low of 3√Å0% in 1999). The USA spent more on defence in 2013 than the next 12 biggest spenders combined. US expenditure was 33√Å5% of the world total, although its population is less than 5% of the world total. In 1997 the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) was implemented-a plan to transform US defence strategy and military forces. Conscription was first introduced during the American Civil War in 1862 and operated during all subsequent major periods of conflict including World Wars I and II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. A limited draft was also employed in peacetime in the Cold War and early 1960s. The final draft ended in 1973 when the USA converted to an all-volunteer military. Although conscription is not currently in force the Military Selective Service Act requires all males between the ages of 18 and 26 to register for compulsory military service should the need arise. Active duty military personnel in Feb. 2017 numbered 1,291,817, of which 204,376 were women. In Dec. 2016 US armed forces abroad numbered 239,830, including 11,281 in and around Afghanistan and 25,168 in and around Iraq. In Dec. 2011 the last US troops left Iraq although 4,000 remained in neighbouring Kuwait. However, US troops have been redeployed in Iraq since June 2014 to oppose Islamic State forces active in the country. In Dec. 2016 some 6,800 US troops were on active duty in Iraq. There were 31 active duty military deaths in the US armed forces participating in Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation New Dawn (Iraq) in 2018 (37 in 2017). In June 2011 then President Obama announced that 10,000 troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2011 and a further 23,000 by the end of Sept. 2012. There were 29,000 US troops serving with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in Sept. 2014, although the mission's mandate expired at the end of the year. As of Feb. 2019 the USA contributed some 8,500 troops to more than 17,000 personnel charged with training, advising and assisting the Afghan National Security Forces under the aegis of Operation Resolute Support. After President Trump agreed in Aug. 2017 to send some 3,500 additional troops, there were more than 14,000 US forces in Afghanistan overall in Nov. The USA is the world's largest exporter of arms, with 33% of the global major weapons total over the period 2012-16. The USA's last nuclear test was in 1993. The deployed nuclear warhead count stood at 1,750 in Jan. 2018 according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. There are about a further 4,700 stored and other warheads, giving a total stockpile of around 6,450 warheads. At the height of the Cold War each side possessed over 10,000 nuclear warheads. The START I arms-control treaty, signed in 1991, limited to approximately 6,000 the number of nuclear warheads that the USA and Russia may each deploy on long-range, or 'strategic', land-based missiles, submarine-launched missiles and bombers. The 1993 START II treaty would have obliged both sides to reduce their stocks of strategic weapons to 3,500 nuclear warheads. However, instruments of ratification were never exchanged and the treaty lapsed. Russia retracted acceptance in June 2002 after the USA withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. START I expired on 5 Dec. 2009 Estimates of the number of firearms in the country are around 310m., equivalent to 99 firearms for every 100 people, making the USA the world's most heavily armed country. With a total of 3√Å2m. employees in 2015, the Department of Defense is the world's largest employer. Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy. The Secretary of the Army is the head of the Department of the Army. Subject to the authority of the President as C.-in-C. and of the Secretary of Defense, he is responsible for all affairs of the Department. The Army consists of the Active Army, the Army National Guard of the US, the Army Reserve and civilian workforce; and all persons appointed to or enlisted into the Army without component; and all persons serving under call or conscription, including members of the National Guard of the States, etc., when in the service of the US. The active duty strength of the Army was 565,463 (79,694 women) in Sept. 2011. The Army budget for fiscal year 2019 was $178,886m., with a request for fiscal year 2020 of $191,397m. Starting in 2006 the Army undertook its widest-ranging reorganization since the end of the Second World War in order to allow it to deploy continuously in different parts of the world. Subsequent cuts to the defence budget saw the Pentagon announce in Feb. 2014 plans to reduce active troop numbers from 520,000 to between 440,000 and 450,000, its lowest level since 1940 (before the USA entered the Second World War Approximately 32% of the Active Army is deployed outside the continental USA. Several divisions, which are located in the USA, keep equipment in Germany and can be flown there in 48-72 hours. Headquarters of US Seventh and Eighth Armies are in Europe and Korea respectively. Combat vehicles of the US Army are the tank, armoured personnel carrier, infantry fighting vehicle, and the armoured command vehicle. The Army's main battle tank is the M1A2 Abrams; its standard infantry fighting vehicle is the M2A3 Bradley. The Army has nearly 4,900 aircraft, all but about 300 of them helicopters, including AH-1 Cobra and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. Over 95% of recruits enlisting in the Army have a high school education and over 50% of the Army is married. Women serve in both combat support and combat service support units. The National Guard is a reserve military component with both a state and a federal role. Enlistment is voluntary. The members are recruited by each state, but are equipped and paid by the federal government (except when performing state missions). As the organized militia of the several states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Territories of the Virgin Islands and Guam, the Guard may be called into service for local emergencies by the chief executives in those jurisdictions; and may be called into federal service by the President to thwart invasion or rebellion or to enforce federal law. In its role as a reserve component of the Army, the Guard is subject to the order of the President in the event of national emergency. In 2011 it numbered 465,071 (Army, 358, 391; Air Force, 106, 680) . The Army Reserve is designed to supply qualified and experienced units and individuals in an emergency. Members of units are assigned to the Ready Reserve, which is subject to call by the President in case of national emergency without declaration of war by Congress. The Standby Reserve and the Retired Reserve may be called only after declaration of war or national emergency by Congress. In 2011 the Army Reserve numbered 198,000. Secretary of the Navy Richard V. Spencer. The Navy's Operating Forces include the Atlantic Fleet, divided between the 2nd fleet (home waters) and 6th fleet (Mediterranean) and the Pacific Fleet, similarly divided between the 3rd fleet (home waters), the 7th fleet (West Pacific) and the 5th fleet (Indian Ocean), which was formally activated in 1995 and maintained by units from both Pacific and Atlantic. The Navy budget for fiscal year 2019 was $195,627m., with a request for fiscal year 2020 of $205,572m. The active duty strength of the Navy was 325,123 (53,385 women) in Sept. 2011. The active ship force levels of the Navy in the year indicated:  A principal part of the US naval task is to deploy the seaborne strategic deterrent from nuclear-powered ballistic missile-carrying submarines (SSBN), of which there were 14 in 2012, all of the Ohio class. The listed total of 57 tactical submarines in 2012 comprised four Ohio class guidedmissile submarines, plus 41 attack submarines of the Los Angeles class, three of the Seawolf class and nine of the Virginia class. The surface combatant forces are comprised of modern cruisers, destroyers and frigates. These ships provide multi-mission capabilities to achieve maritime dominance in the crowded and complex littoral warfare environment. As of 2012 the cruiser force consisted of 22 Ticonderoga class ships. There were 62 active guided-missile Arleigh Burke Aegis class destroyers and 22 active Oliver Hazard Perry class guided-missile frigates. There were ten nuclear-powered Nimitz class carriers in 2012, the first of which, USS Nimitz, was commissioned on 3 May 1975 and the tenth and last of which, USS George H. W. Bush, was commissioned on 10 Jan. 2009. USS Enterprise, completed in 1961, was the prototype nuclear-powered carrier and was in service until Dec. 2012 when it was retired, temporarily reducing the number of aircraft carriers to ten. The Navy's newest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, was commissioned in July 2017. The USS Ronald Reagan is the only aircraft carrier whose home port is not in the USA-since Oct. 2015 its home port has been Yokosuka, in Japan. Each of the Nimitz class carriers can carry between 85 and 90 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Strike fighter planes are primarily F/A-18 Hornets and Super Hornets. The principal function of the naval aviation organization (strength in 2013 of 98,600) is to train and provide combat ready aviation forces. The main carrier-borne combat aircraft in the 2013 inventory were 820 F/A-18 Hornet dual-purpose fighter/attack aircraft out of a total of 1,089 combat-capable aircraft. While administratively part of the Department of the Navy, the Corps ranks as a separate armed service, with the Commandant serving in his own right as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and responsible directly to the Secretary of the Navy. Its strength (including active reservists) was 199,350 in 2013. The role of the Marine Corps is to provide specially trained and equipped amphibious expeditionary forces. The Corps includes an autonomous aviation element numbering 34,700 in 2013. The Coast Guard operates under the Department of Homeland Security in time of peace and as part of the Navy in time of war or when directed by the President. The act of establishment stated the Coast Guard 'shall be a military service and branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times'. The Coast Guard is the country's oldest continuous sea-going service and its missions include maintenance of aids to navigation, icebreaking, environmental response (oil spills), maritime law enforcement, marine licensing, port security, search and rescue and waterways management. The workforce in 2013 was made up of 41,200 military personnel augmented by 7,600 civilians. On an average Coast Guard day the service conducts 45 search and rescue cases, saves ten lives and over $1√Å2m. in property, seizes 874 lb of cocaine and 214 lb of marijuana, interdicts 17 illegal migrants, conducts 24 security boardings in and around US ports, investigates 35 pollution incidents, and facilitates movement of $8√Å7bn. worth of goods and commodities through the maritime transportation system. Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett. The Department of the Air Force was activated within the Department of Defense on 18 Sept. 1947, under the terms of the National Security Act of 1947. The USAF has the mission to defend the USA through control and exploitation of air, space and cyberspace. For operational purposes the service is divided into nine major commands, 35 field operating agencies and four direct-reporting units. In addition there are two reserve components: the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard. Major commands accomplish designated phases of USAF worldwide activities. They also organize, administer, equip and train their subordinate elements. In descending order, elements of major commands include numbered air forces, wings, groups, squadrons and flights. The basic unit for generating and employing combat capability is the wing, considered to be the Air Force's prime war-fighting instrument. The bulk of the combat forces are grouped under the Air Combat Command, which controls strategic bombing, tactical strike, air defence and reconnaissance assets in the USA. Air Force bombers include the B-1B Lancer, the B-2A Spirit and the B-52H Stratofortress, which has been the primary manned strategic bomber for 50 years. In the fighter category are the F-22A Raptor, F-15 Eagle and Strike Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Air Force budget for fiscal year 2019 was $192,920m., with a request for fiscal year 2020 of $204,757m. The active duty strength of the Air Force was 333,370 (63,552 women) in Sept. 2011-19√Å1% of personnel were women, compared to 16√Å4% in the Navy and 13√Å6% in the Army. Since 1991 women have been authorized to fly combat aircraft, but not until 1993 were they allowed to fly fighters. Services accounted for 78√Å0% of GDP in 2014, industry 20√Å7% and agriculture 1√Å3%. Per capita personal income in 2015 was $47,669, more than double the 1994 total of $22,538. In 2017 the USA gave $34√Å7bn. in international aid, the highest figure of any country. In terms of a percentage of GNI, however, the USA was one of the least generous major industrialized countries, giving just 0√Å18% (compared to more than 0√Å6% in the early 1960s). The USA remains an economic powerhouse, producing around 20% of total global output. However, based on GDP measured by Purchasing Power Parity, China's economy became the world's largest in 2014-a position previously held by the USA for over a century. The USA's volume of trade is the largest in the world, although the value of the external sector as a percentage of GDP is relatively low. It is self-sufficient in most raw materials, with the notable exception of oil (although it is predicted that domestic shale oil production will lead to self-sufficiency by the 2030s). Core industries include motor vehicles, steel, aerospace, chemicals, telecommunications, electronics, computers and military equipment. Since 1992 the economy has grown at higher average rates than in the other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and G7 countries in most years, and per capita GDP is higher than in other G7 states. The economy, however, is constrained by imbalances, including a low savings rate, a heavy reliance on consumer spending and a sizeable current account deficit. The global economy remains fragile following the 2008 financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the US sub-prime housing market. The ripple effects of the crisis continue to impact the USA as it struggles to maintain its leading status within the changing world economy. By 1995 labour productivity in advanced Western European countries had reached US levels, but since then US labour and total factor productivity growth has outpaced that of other advanced economies. The principal sectors in which the USA outperforms its rivals are retail, wholesale and finance. It has also been able to extract greater efficiency gains from information technology-related investments. US firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western Europe and Asia in laying off workers and in introducing labour-saving technology. However, income inequality is higher than in other advanced economies and the gap between skilled and unskilled labour incomes has been growing over the last three decades. The USA also has a significant gender pay gap and it showed the widest disparity of all the 38 developed countries surveyed in the International Labour Organization's Global Wage Report 2014/15. In 2013 over 45m. Americans lived below the poverty line (with a disproportionate percentage of these being African-Americans), although by 2018 the figure had declined to 38√Å1m. people. The attacks of 11 Sept. 2001 posed serious challenges to the dollar payment system and stock market. Business investment relative to GDP plummeted in 2001-02, having reached record highs in the previous fiscal year. The collapse of the giant energy company Enron in Dec. 2002 was followed by other accounting scandals. However, in the third quarter of 2003 the economy recorded an annualized growth rate of 6√Å9%, fuelled by tax cuts, low interest rates and increased consumer and business spending. Interest rates began rising from then historic lows of 1√Å0% in 2003 with the federal funds rate reaching 5√Å25% by the end of 2006. Growth remained strong through 2006 despite the impact of Hurricane Katrina and high oil prices. The sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007 seriously damaged the wider economy. A sharp rise in defaults and foreclosures as a result of the rapid decline in house prices, which had begun in 2006, spread panic through the banking sector. A government stimulus package enacted in early 2008, together with interest rate cuts amounting to 5% by Dec. 2008, were aimed at raising confidence in the financial markets. However, market nervousness increased, prompting tougher lending criteria and declining asset prices. In Sept. 2008 Lehman Brothers became the first major bank to collapse since the start of the crisis. The government announced financial rescue packages for mortgage-lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-between them responsible for half of the outstanding mortgages in the economy-along with American International Group, the country's biggest insurance company. In Oct. 2008 the House of Representatives approved a $700bn. plan aimed at purchasing bad debts of failing institutions. Continued market turmoil then resulted in a further $250bn. investment that gave the government stakes in a range of banks. Interest rates reached their lowest recorded level at between 0-0√Å25% in Dec. 2008 . In Feb. 2009 Congress approved the then President Obama's $787bn. economic stimulus plan, comprising tax breaks and money for social programmes, a move that substantially increased the fiscal deficit. The cost of military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, meanwhile, put further strain on the economy. Growth of 1√Å5% in the third quarter of 2009 brought an end to the recession. The fragile recovery was underpinned by the government stimulus measures, a rebound in world trade (with increasing demand from large emerging-market economies) and housing market stabilization. The economy nonetheless contracted by 2√Å5% in 2009 as a whole, while real annual GDP growth in the first ten years of the century, at an average of 1√Å7%, was the lowest in a full decade since the 1930s. Further recovery was hampered by a combination of external events, such as rising oil prices, a debt crisis in the eurozone, and weak domestic drivers including low consumer spending and the sluggish housing market. However, GDP grew by 2√Å6% in 2010, and by early 2012 positive employment and retail sales figures saw the stock market jump to its highest level since May 2008. Fiscal pressures have emerged with the retirement of the post-Second World War baby-boom generation and the rise in life expectancy, increasing the strain on welfare entitlement programmes. In March 2010 the then President Obama signed into law a health care reform measure-the Affordable Care Act (ACA)-to extend health insurance to an additional 32m. Americans, impose new taxes on the wealthy and outlaw restrictive insurance practices. According to the Congressional Budget Office, efficiencies contained in the reform were expected to cut the federal deficit by $138bn. over ten years. The US Department of Health and Human Services reported in March 2016 that approximately 20m. Americans had gained health coverage under the Act since 2010. However, after several unsuccessful attempts in 2017 to repeal and replace the ACA (with a programme based around refundable tax credits to support insurance purchases), the new populist president, Donald Trump, signed an executive order in Oct. scaling back some of the Act's provisions. In Feb. 2011 Obama had unveiled his 2012 budget, which aimed to cut $1√Å1trn. from the US deficit over the following decade. However, political wrangling over raising the debt ceiling caused disruption on the financial markets as fears mounted that the economy would default. In Aug. 2011 Congress approved a bipartisan compromise deal that raised the debt ceiling by $2√Å4trn. from $14√Å3trn. and paved the way for savings of at least $2√Å1trn. over ten years. The international credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded the USA's AAA credit-rating to AA+ days after the deal had been reached, causing further volatility in the markets. This rating was reaffirmed in Oct. 2016. Against a background of congressional disagreements, a combination of scheduled tax increases and automatic spending cuts-known as the 'fiscal cliff'-threatened to push the economy into recession again at the start of 2013. Failure to reach an accord on the budget by 31 Dec. 2012 would have triggered automatic tax increases of over $500bn. and spending cuts of over $100bn. from domestic and military programmes, amounting to a 4-5% cut in output. However, a deal was reached on the eve of the deadline, based on a package of measures including limited tax rises for wealthier families and individuals and a short-term extension of unemployment benefits. On 1 Oct. 2013 following a repeated failure by Congress to agree a budget for the next fiscal year, the government entered a partial shutdown of operations for the first time in 17 years. A short-term fiscal deal was struck on 17 Oct., funding the government until 15 Jan. 2014 and raising the debt ceiling until 7 Feb. Congress then agreed to raise the borrowing limit for another year in Feb. 2014. According to Standard & Poor's, the Oct. shutdown shaved $24bn. off the economy and cut growth significantly in the fourth quarter of 2013. To prevent a repeat shutdown, an omnibus spending bill was passed in Jan. 2014 to provide the government with funding of $1√Å1trn. for the 2014 fiscal year. In Oct. 2015 Congress passed a budget agreement that allowed for the debt ceiling to be raised until March 2017. In April 2014 Janet Yellen, the then chair of the Federal Reserve Board, cut back the Board's quantitative easing programme. She then closed monthly bond purchases with a final $15bn. buying round in Oct. that year. The programme, which began in 2009, was the largest emergency economic stimulus in history and added over $3√Å5trn. to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet deficit-an amount roughly equal to the size of the German economy. Economic recovery gained momentum from the second quarter of 2013 and throughout 2014 and 2015. Annual GDP growth averaged 2√Å4% in the period 2013-15, rendering the economy 10% larger than its 2007 pre-crisis level. In the third quarter of 2017, GDP increased at an annual rate of 2√Å8% despite the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma in Aug. and Sept. respectively. Stock and asset prices had also improved following the recession, while unemployment fell by around 0√Å8% each year between 2010 and 2016. The more optimistic economic outlook resulted from a combination of the hydraulic fracturing energy boom, a rebound in the housing market, robust real consumer spending (which reached an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2016) and an improved fiscal situation. By March 2019 the jobless rate had dropped to 3√Å8%, although the Labor Department indicated that it might not be as favourable as it appeared, pointing to an increase in the number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits over the previous ten months. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate, which had been raised by a quarter percentage point in Dec. 2015 (for the first time since 2006 and from a record low level), was increased by the same amount again in Dec. 2016, three times in 2017 and four times in 2018. In its March 2019 meeting the Federal Reserve agreed to keep interest rates unchanged, pointing toward low inflation, among other factors. Uncertainty remained as to whether interest rates would be increased later in the year, ultimately depending on inflation. In mid-2018 the government passed a bill aimed at loosening the banking rules implemented after the financial crisis and assisting small-to medium-sized banks. Nonetheless, the economic rebound has been more fragile than any following previous recessions, since damage to the financial sector has not been fully repaired. Furthermore, government spending has created a fiscal drag and the long-expected retirement of baby-boomers has depressed the labour supply. The economy continues to face a number of risks, including slow growth in emerging world markets and international political volatility. The election of President Trump in Nov. 2016 and the potential changes to monetary and fiscal policy added further uncertainty, although he promised to increase annual GDP growth to 4√Å0% by cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and removing regulation. The US government ended fiscal year 2017 in Sept. with a deficit more than $82bn. higher than that in the previous year. After the fiscal year 2018 budget narrowly passed Congress the following month, a proposal for significant tax reform was then approved by the Senate in Dec. 2017. It was the largest tax overhaul in over 30 years, effectively reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Although Trump's tax reform gave the economy an expected short-term boost, the ultimate economic impacts of its changes continue to be debated. Meanwhile, friction with China over trading and commercial practices escalated markedly from mid-2018, with national and global economic consequences, as both countries imposed punitive and damaging tariffs until they agreed an initial 'phase one' deal at the end of 2019 to start resolving their differences. A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research suggested that the trade dispute had cost the US economy $7‚Ä¢8bn. over the course of 2018. Also, the US trade deficit reached an all-time high in early 2019. GDP growth in 2018 was 2‚Ä¢9%, falling just short of the Trump administration's 3% goal. This exceeded most economists' expectations given the negative impacts of the trade conflict with China and the unexpected drop in consumer spending that occurred in the final quarter of 2018. Furthermore, in the autumn of 2018 the US stock market experienced the largest drops since the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P stock market index dropped 6‚Ä¢2% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average index dropped 5‚Ä¢6%, although there was a recovery from the end of the year. Despite what then became the longest federal government shutdown in the country's history, lasting a total of 35 days between Dec. 2018 and Jan. 2019, the Federal Reserve reported in Feb. 2019 that consumer and business confidence remained favourable, but acknowledged that some economic indicators had 'softened' since the autumn. In early 2020 the emergence of the Covid-19 global pandemic presented a major challenge to sustained economic prosperity. In March the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates as stock markets plummeted and the government authorized a $2trn. stimulus package to provide relief to businesses and workers in a bid to keep the economy moving. In the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, the USA was ranked sixth in the world for the ease of doing business. Foreign exchange reserves in Dec. 2014 were $41,944m. and gold reserves were 261√Å50m. troy oz. The USA has the most gold reserves of any country, and more than the combined reserves of the next two (Germany and Italy). Broad money supply totalled $15,624√Å8bn. in Dec. 2014. The budget covers virtually all the programmes of federal government, including those financed through trust funds, such as for social security, Medicare and highway construction. Receipts of the government include all income from its sovereign or compulsory powers; income from business-type or market-orientated activities of the government is offset against outlays. The fiscal year ends on 30 Sept. (before 1977 on 30 June). Budget receipts and outlays, including off-budget receipts and outlays (in $1m.): In 1996 the chain-weighted method of estimating GDP replaced that of constant base-year prices. In chain-weighting the weights used to value different sectors of the economy are continually updated to reflect changes in relative prices. The Federal Reserve System, established under The Federal Reserve Act of 1913, comprises the Board of seven Governors, the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks with their 24 branches, and the Federal Open Market Committee. The seven members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate. Each Governor is appointed to a full term of 14 years or an unexpired portion of a term, one term expiring every two years. The Board exercises broad supervisory authority over the operations of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, including approval of their budgets and of the appointments of their presidents and first vice presidents; it designates three of the nine directors of each Reserve Bank including the Chair and Deputy Chair. The Chair of the Federal Reserve Board is appointed by the President for four-year terms. The Chair is Jerome H. Powell. The Board has supervisory and regulatory responsibilities over banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System, bank holding companies, bank mergers, Edge Act and agreement corporations, foreign activities of member banks, international banking facilities in the USA, and activities of the US branches and agencies of foreign banks. Legislation of 1991 requires foreign banks to prove that they are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision by a regulator at home, and have the Board's approval to establish branches, agencies and representative offices. The Board also assures the smooth functioning and continued development of the nation's vast payments system. Another area of the Board's responsibilities involves the implementation by regulation of major federal laws governing consumer credit. From 1968 the Congress passed a number of consumer financial protection acts, the first of which was the Truth in Lending Act, for which it has directed the Board to write implementing regulations and assume partial enforcement responsibility. Others include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Consumer Leasing Act, Fair Credit Billing Act, Truth in Savings Act and Electronic Fund Transfer Act. To manage these responsibilities the Board has established a Division of Consumer and Community Affairs. To assist it, the Board consults with a Consumer Advisory Council, established by the Congress in 1976 as a statutory part of the Federal Reserve System. Another statutory body, the Federal Advisory Council, consists of 12 members (one from each district); it meets in Washington, D.C. four times a year to advise the Board of Governors on economic and banking developments. Following the passage of the Monetary Control Act of 1980, the Board of Governors established the Thrift Institutions Advisory Council to provide information and views on the special needs and problems of thrift institutions. The group is comprised of representatives of mutual savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. All depository institutions (commercial and savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, US agencies and branches of foreign banks, and Edge Act and agreement corporations) must meet reserve requirements set by the Federal Reserve and hold the reserves in the form of vault cash or deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. Banks which participate in the federal deposit insurance fund have their deposits insured against loss up to $100,000 for each account. The fund is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation established in 1933; it obtains resources through annual assessments on participating banks. All members of the Federal Reserve System are required to insure their deposits through the Corporation, and non-member banks may apply and qualify for insurance. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1992 originated with bank reform initiatives. It imposed new capital rules on banks, new reporting requirements and a code of 'safety and soundness' standards. The main aim of the Act is to reduce risk through rigorous enforcement of capital requirements. Regulators are required to take action where banks fail to observe these standards. In April 2017 the largest banks in the USA in terms of market value were: J. P. Morgan Chase ($305√Å9bn.); Wells Fargo ($273√Å9bn.); and Bank of America ($231√Å2bn.). The key stock exchanges are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Euronext) and the Nasdaq Stock Exchange (NASDAQ). They are the two largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization, with the New York Stock Exchange having a market capitalization larger than the next three biggest combined. There are several other stock exchanges, in Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco (Pacific Stock Exchange) and Chicago, although trading is very limited in them. Gross external debt totalled $19,019,303m. in Dec. 2017 (compared to $18,025,120m. in Dec. 2016 . The USA received $275√Å4bn. worth of foreign direct investment in 2017, down from $457√Å1bn. in 2016 and a record $465√Å8bn. in 2015. By the end of 2017 the total stock of foreign direct investment was $7,807√Å0bn. By Aug. 2013, 61% of internet users in the USA were using online banking. In 2015 fossil fuels accounted for 81% of primary energy consumption (of which petroleum 37%, natural gas 29% and coal 16%), renewables (including biomass, hydro-power, wind, geothermal and solar) 10% and nuclear power 9%. Consumption of renewables surpassed nuclear power in 2011, since when its share in consumption has gradually increased. The USA's carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of energy in 2014 accounted for 14√Å5% of the world total (the second highest after China) and were equivalent to 16√Å5 tonnes per capita (down from 19√Å6 tonnes per capita in 2001). The population of the USA is only 4√Å6% of the world total. An Environmental Performance Index compiled in 2016 ranked the USA 26th of 180 countries, with 84√Å7%. The index examined various factors in nine areas-agriculture, air quality, biodiversity and habitat, climate and energy, fisheries, forests, health impacts, water and sanitation, and water resources. In March 2001 then President Bush rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to combat the rise in the earth's temperature through the reduction of industrialized nations' carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring of fossil fuels by an average 5√Å2% below 1990 levels by 2012. In Feb. 2002 he unveiled an alternative climate change plan to the Kyoto Protocol, calling for voluntary measures to reduce the rate of increase of US carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption and flaring of fossil fuels. In 2009 then President Obama endorsed an American Clean Energy and Security bill that laid out plans for an emissions trading scheme echoing the EU model. It was passed by the House of Representatives in 2009 but did not become law owing to inaction in the Senate. Obama had previously called for a reduction in US greenhouse gas emissions of 80% on 1990 levels by 2050. In 2017 President Trump's budget proposals included a 31% funding cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, although Congress eventually approved a cut of only 1%. In June 2017 Trump announced the USA's withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He has pledged his support for the USA's domestic fossil fuel industries. The USA recycled 34√Å5% of its municipal solid waste in 2012. Net installed capacity in 2014 was 1,073√Å4m. kW. In 2016 natural gas surpassed coal for the first time as the leading source of electricity production, with 34% of the total compared to 30% for coal. Nuclear contributed 20% of the total in 2016 and renewables (notably hydro and wind) 15%. The USA has more nuclear reactors in use than any other country in the world. In 2016 the USA had a nuclear generating capacity of 99,535 MW, with 99 nuclear reactors. Two reactors are under construction in Georgia that are expected to become operational in 2021 and 2022. Electricity generation in 2014 was 4,339,210m. kWh, the second highest in the world behind China. Consumption per capita in 2013 was 12,988 kWh. Crude oil production (2018), 4,001m. bbls, the highest ever annual total. Up until 2008 production had been gradually declining since the mid-1980s, when annual production was 3,275m. bbls. In 2008 production was at its lowest level since 1946, at 1,830m. bbls. However, it has since risen sharply, largely thanks to the development of hydraulic fracturing (or 'fracking') and horizontal drilling. By 2017 the USA had become the world's largest oil producer. Proven crude oil reserves were 39√Å2bn. bbls in 2017. Offshore oil accounts for about 16% of total production. Crude oil imports began to exceed production in 1993 and in 2015 totalled 2,683m. bbls, with Canada supplying over 40% of US oil imports. In Oct. 2002 the USA took its first delivery of Russian oil for its Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a consequence of an energy dialogue declared by then President George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin at their summit in May 2002. The USA is by far the largest single consumer of oil (19√Å4m. bbls per day in 2015). In 2011 the USA exported more petroleum products than it imported on an annual basis for the first time since 1949. The USA is by some distance the greatest single consumer of natural gas and also the largest producer (having overtaken Russia in 2010). Dry natural gas production, 2018, was a record 30√Å44trn. cu. ft. Shale gas production was 15√Å2trn. cu. ft in 2015 (46% of total US natural gas production), up from 0√Å4trn. cu. ft in 2000. Proven natural gas reserves in 2017 totalled 464√Å3trn. cu. ft. In 2017 natural gas exports exceeded imports for the first time in 60 years. The USA is the largest producer of wind power, with 190√Å9bn. kWh in 2015 (up from 94√Å7bn. kWh in 26√Å6bn. kWh in 2006) . In 2014 total installed capacity amounted to 65,877 MW, second only behind China. The USA is the largest producer of ethanol (from maize). Production totalled 13,300m. gallons in 2012 (13,929m. gallons in 2011 and 13,298m. gallons in 2010) . The total area within the 50 states of the USA plus the District of Columbia covered by water is 264,837 sq. miles. Total average annual water usage is nearly 67,000 cu. ft per person-more than twice the average for an industrialized nation. The USA is wholly dependent upon imports for columbium, bauxite, mica sheet, manganese, strontium and graphite, and imports over 80% of its requirements of industrial diamonds, fluorspar, platinum, tantalum, tungsten, chromium and tin. Total value of non-fuel minerals produced in 2017 was an estimated $75√Å2bn. ($39√Å5bn. in 1997) . Details of some of the main minerals produced are given in the following tables. Production of metals (2012)  Agriculture in the USA is characterized by its ability to adapt to widely varying conditions, and still produce an abundance and variety of agricultural products. From colonial times to about 1920 the major increases in farm production were brought about by adding to the number of farms and the amount of land under cultivation. During this period nearly 320m. acres of virgin forest were converted to crop land or pasture, and extensive areas of grasslands were ploughed. Improvident use of soil and water resources was evident in many areas. During the next 20 years the number of farms reached a plateau of about 6√Å5m., and the acreage planted to crops held relatively stable around 330m. acres. The major source of increase in farm output arose from the substitution of power-driven machines for horses and mules. Greater emphasis was placed on development and improvement of land, and the need for conservation of basic agricultural resources was recognized. A successful conservation programme, highly co-ordinated and on a national scale-to prevent further erosion, to restore the native fertility of damaged land and to adjust land uses to production capabilities and needs-has been in operation since early in the 1930s. Since the Second World War the uptrend in farm output has been greatly accelerated by increased production per acre and per farm animal. These increases are associated with a higher degree of mechanization; greater use of lime and fertilizer; improved varieties, including hybrid maize and grain sorghums; more effective control of insects and disease; improved strains of livestock and poultry; and wider use of good husbandry practices, such as nutritionally balanced feeds, use of superior sites and better housing. During this period land included in farms decreased slowly, crop land harvested declined somewhat more rapidly, but the number of farms declined sharply. All land in farms totalled less than 500m. acres in 1870, rose to a peak of over 1,200m . acres in the 1950s and had declined to 912m. acres by 2015, even with the addition of the new States of Alaska and Hawaii in 1960. The number of farms declined from 6√Å35m. in 1940 to 2√Å11m. in 2012, as the average size of farms doubled. The average size of farms in 2012 was 434 acres, but ranged from a few acres to many thousand acres. In 2012 the total value of land and buildings was $2,268,537m. The average value of land and buildings per acre in 2012 was $2,481. In 2012 The farm value of the above crops in 2015 was: apples, $3,394m.; grapes, $5,562m.; lemons, $734m.; oranges, $1,711m.; strawberries, $2,239m.; tangerines and mandarins, $637m. The USA is the world's second largest producer of apples. In 2016 there were 2,714,498 acres of organic crops. Certified organic farms numbered 14,217 in 2016. Organic food sales for the USA in 2015 totalled $39√Å7bn. In 2015 production of milk was 208,633m. lb; cheese, 11,838m. lb; butter, 1,858m. lb; ice cream, 898m. gallons; non-fat dry milk, 1,822m. lb; yoghurt, 4,742m. lb. The USA is the world's largest producer of both cheese and milk. In 2013  Forests covered a total area of 766√Å26m. acres (310√Å10m. ha.) in 2015, or 34% of the land area. Of the total area under forests 68% was timber land. The 154 national forests had an area of 188,323,491 acres in 2017. Timber production was 14,091m. cu. ft in 2015. The USA is the world's largest producer of roundwood (10√Å8% of the world total in 2015). In 2014 there were 758 designated wilderness areas throughout the USA, covering a total of 109√Å5m. acres (44√Å3m. ha.). More than half of the total area covered is in Alaska (52%), followed by California (14%), Idaho, Arizona and Washington. In 2013 the domestic catch was 9,880m. lb, valued at $5,490m. (including 1,257m. lb of shellfish valued at $2,858m.). Main species landed in terms of value ($1m.): salmon, 757; crabs, 714; shrimp, 565; lobsters, 518. Disposition of the domestic catch in 2013 (1m. lb): fresh or frozen, 8,019; canned, 365; cured, 45; reduced to meal or oil, 1,451. The USA's imports of fishery commodities in 2011 ($17√Å47bn.) were the largest of any country; exports of fishery commodities totalled $5√Å79bn. (the fifth highest in the world). Established by Act of Congress, 1933, the TVA is a multiple-purpose federal agency which carries out its duties in an area embracing some 41,000 sq. miles in the seven Tennessee River Valley states: Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia. In addition, 76 counties outside the Valley are served by TVA power distributors. It is the largest public power company in the USA. Its three directors are appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate; headquarters are in Knoxville (TN). The largest companies in the USA by market capitalization on 26 March 2019 were: Microsoft ($904√Å6bn.), a technology company; Apple Inc. ($880√Å8bn.), a computer company; and Amazon ($876√Å2bn.), a technology company. They were also the three largest companies by market value in the world in March 2019. According to a survey published by the New York-based Interbrand in Oct. 2018, Apple is the world's most valuable brand, worth $214√Å48bn. The following table presents industry statistics of manufactures as reported at various censuses from 1909 to 1980 and from the Annual Survey of Manufactures for years in which no census was taken. The Annual Surveys of Manufactures carry forward the key measures of manufacturing activity which are covered in detail by the Census of Manufactures. The total number of employees in the manufacturing industry in 2015 was 11,166,953; there were 297,191 manufacturing establishments in 2012 (350,828 in 2002) . In 2015 manufacturing contributed 12√Å1% of GDP, down from 15√Å1% of GDP in 2000. The leading industries in 2015 in terms of value added by manufacture (in $1bn.) were: chemicals, 377√Å3; computer and electronic products, 278√Å2; food and beverage and tobacco products, 257√Å5; motor vehicles and parts, 163√Å1; petroleum and coal products, 161√Å8; machinery, 153√Å1. In 2015 a total of 12,105,000 motor vehicles were made in the USA (the highest total since 2002), continuing an upward trend since the height of the recession in 2009 when only 5,710,000 were produced. In 2015 principal commodities produced (by value of shipments, in $1m.) were: transportation equipment, 948,208; food, 775,591; chemicals, 751,623; petroleum and coal products, 507,907; machinery, 384,579. Net profits (2015) for manufacturing corporations were $505bn. after tax. Hourly earnings of production workers in Aug. 2017 were $20√Å93 in manufacturing and $26√Å80 in construction. The USA is the second largest beer producer after China, with 5,940m. gallons in 2013. Output of the iron and steel industries (in 1m. net tons of 2,000 lb) in recent years was: The sum of these two items should equal the total in the preceding column; any difference is due to rounding. In May 2016 iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing employed 83,890 persons. The median hourly wage was $22√Å88. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics there were 157√Å1m. people in the civilian labour force in 2015 (83√Å6m. men and 73√Å5m. women). There were 26√Å3m. foreign-born persons in the labour force in 2015, representing 16√Å7% of the total. Undocumented immigrants constitute 5% of the labour force. The unemployment rate was 3√Å6% in Jan. 2020, down from 4√Å0% in Jan. 2019 , 9√Å8% in Jan. 2010 and 10√Å0% in Oct. 2009 (which was the highest rate since 1983). When it was 3√Å5% in Sept., Nov. and Dec. 2019, unemployment was at its lowest level since 1969. Payroll employment increased by 216,000 in Jan. 2017 reflecting job gains in retail trade, construction and financial activities (having fallen by 793,000 in Jan. 2009 in the largest monthly fall since 1945). In 2009 as a whole 5√Å1m. jobs were lost-the highest number since records began in 1939. Long-term unemployment rose from 6√Å1% of the labour force between 16 and 64 having been out of work for more than a year in 2001 to 10√Å0% in 2006 and 31√Å3% in 2011 . In Jan. 2010 A total of 12 strikes and lockouts of 1,000 workers or more occurred in 2015, involving 47,000 workers and 740,000 idle days. On 24 July 2007 the federal hourly minimum wage was raised from $5√Å15 to $5√Å85 an hour. It had been $5√Å15 for nearly ten years, having previously been increased from $4√Å75 an hour on 1 Sept. 1997. It was raised again on 24 July 2008, to $6√Å55 an hour, and on 24 July 2009, to $7√Å25 (still valid as of March 2019). Americans worked an average 1,789 hours per person in 2014. Median weekly earnings in 2016 were $915 among men and $749 among women). Labour relations are legally regulated by the National Labor Relations Act, amended by the Labor-Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act 1947 as amended by the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 1959 , again amended in 1974 , and the Railway Labor Act of 1926 , as amended in 1934 and 1936 The USA had 60,000 people living in slavery according to the Walk Free Foundation's 2013 Global Slavery Index. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the USA, Canada and Mexico was signed on 7 Oct. 1992 and came into effect on 1 Jan. 1994  Freight service is provided by nine major independent railroad companies and several hundred smaller operators. The largest companies are the Union Pacific Railroad and the BNSF Railway (formerly the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway). Long-distance passenger trains are run by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), which is federally assisted. Amtrak was set up in 1971 to maintain a basic network of longdistance passenger trains, and is responsible for almost all non-commuter services. In 2013 the operational Amtrak rail system measured 21,356 miles. Outside the major conurbations, there are almost no regular passenger services other than those of Amtrak, which carried 30√Å8m. passengers in fiscal year 2015. The busiest US airport in 2016 was Atlanta (Hartsfield-Jackson), which handled 104,171,935 passengers. The second busiest was Los Angeles International with 80,921, 527 passengers, followed by Chicago (O'Hare) with 77,960,588. As well as being the three busiest airports in the USA for passenger traffic, they also rank among the busiest in the world. The busiest port is South Louisiana, which handled 261√Å9m. tons of cargo in 2016. Other major ports are Houston (248√Å0m. tons in 2016), New York-New Jersey (133√Å4m. tons in 2016), New Orleans, Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Long Beach and Baton Rouge. South Louisiana handles the most domestic cargo ahead of Houston, but Houston the most foreign trade cargo ahead of South Louisiana. Regional private companies formed from the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. after its dissolution in 1995 ('Baby Bells') operate the telephone and electronic transmission services system at the national and local levels. Telegram services are still available through iTelegram. In 2012 there were 138√Å6m. main telephone lines in operation (436√Å5 per 1,000 inhabitants), down from 182√Å9m. in 2003. There were 304√Å8m. cellphone subscriptions in 2012 (960√Å1 per 1,000 persons), up from 160√Å6m. in 2003. In addition the proportion of households that only have cellphones has rapidly increased, to such an extent that by Dec. 2008 the number of cellphone-only households had surpassed landline-only households, with 20% of households being cellphone-only. The leading cellphone operators are Verizon Wireless (with more than 115m. subscribers), AT&T Mobility, Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile. In 2013 an estimated 84√Å2% of the population were internet users. 75√Å6% of households had a computer in 2011, with 71√Å7% of households having internet access at home. In 2014 e-commerce amounted to $304√Å9bn. In 2012 there were 89√Å8 wireless broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants and only 28√Å4 fixed broadband subscriptions per 100. In Dec. 2011 there were 157√Å4m. Facebook users (about three times as many as any other country and 50% the total population of the USA). Out of 178 countries analysed in the 2017 Fragile States Index-a list published jointly by the Fund for Peace and Foreign Policy magazine-the USA was ranked the 21st least vulnerable to conflict or collapse. The index is based on 12 indicators of state vulnerability across social, political and economic categories. Legal controversies may be decided in two systems of courts: the federal courts, with jurisdiction confined to certain matters enumerated in Article III of the Constitution, and the state courts, with jurisdiction in all other proceedings. The federal courts have jurisdiction exclusive of the state courts in criminal prosecutions for the violation of federal statutes, in civil cases involving the government, in bankruptcy cases and in admiralty proceedings, and have jurisdiction concurrent with the state courts over suits between parties from different states, and certain suits involving questions of federal law. The highest court is the Supreme Court of the US, which reviews cases from the lower federal courts and certain cases originating in state courts involving questions of federal law. It is the final arbiter of all questions involving federal statutes and the Constitution; and it has the power to invalidate any federal or state law or executive action which it finds repugnant to the Constitution. This court, consisting of nine justices appointed by the President who receive salaries of $255,300 a year (the Chief Justice, $267,000), meets from Oct. until June every year. For the term beginning Oct. 2012 it disposed of 7,602 cases, deciding 76 on their merits. In the remainder of cases it either summarily affirms lower court decisions or declines to review. A few suits, usually brought by state governments, originate in the Supreme Court, but issues of fact are mostly referred to a master. The US courts of appeals number 13 (in 11 circuits composed of three or more states and one circuit for the District of Columbia and one Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit); the 179 circuit judges receive salaries of $220,600 a year. Any party to a suit in a lower federal court usually has a right of appeal to one of these courts. In addition, there are direct appeals to these courts from many federal administrative agencies. In the year ending 30 Sept. 2013, 56,475 appeals were filed in the courts of appeals, in addition to 1,259 in the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The trial courts in the federal system are the US district courts, of which there are 94 in the 50 states, one in the District of Columbia and one each in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Territories of the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Marianas. Each state has at least one US district court, and three states have four apiece. Each district court has from one to 28 judgeships. There are 677 US district judges ($208,000 a year), who received 284,604 civil cases in 2012-13. In addition to these courts of general jurisdiction, there are special federal courts of limited jurisdiction. The US Court of Federal Claims (16 judges at $205,100 a year) decides claims for money damages against the federal government in a wide variety of matters; the Court of International Trade (13 judges at $208,000) determines controversies concerning the classification and valuation of imported merchandise. The judges of all these courts are appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate; to assure their independence, they hold office 'during good behaviour' (meaning that they cannot be discharged but may be impeached for misconduct) and cannot have their salaries reduced. This does not apply to judges in the Territories, who hold their offices for a term of ten years or to judges of the US Court of Federal Claims. The judges may retire with full pay at the age of 70 years if they have served a period of ten years, or at 65 if they have 15 years of service, but they are subject to call for such judicial duties as they are willing to undertake. In 2000 the number of lawyers in the USA passed the 1m. mark, the equivalent to 363 per 100,000 people, reaching 1√Å3m. by 2015. There were 75,861 criminal cases filed for the year ending March 2017 of which 24,104 involved drugs, 20,602 immigration and 10,171 property offences. Persons convicted of federal crimes may be fined, released on probation under the supervision of the probation officers of the federal courts, confined in prison, or confined in prison with a period of supervised release to follow, also under the supervision of probation officers of the federal courts. Federal prisoners are confined in 87 institutions incorporating various security levels that are operated by the Bureau of Prisons. On 31 Dec. 2012 the total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of federal or state adult correctional authorities was 1,570,397, down slightly from 1,598,248 in Dec. 2007 . A total of 2,228,000 inmates were held in state or federal prisons or local jails in 2012 (down from a peak of 2,308,000 in 2008), giving a rate of 710 per 100,000 population (the second highest in the world). Although the USA has less than 5% of the world's population it has around 24% of the world's prisoners. Blacks make up 37% of the prison population, although they only account for 14% of the general population. The USA was ranked 23rd of 102 countries for criminal justice and 21st for civil justice in the 2015 World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, which provides data on how the rule of law is experienced by the general public across eight categories. The state courts have jurisdiction over all civil and criminal cases arising under state laws, but decisions of the state courts of last resort as to the validity of treaties or of laws of the USA, or on other questions arising under the Constitution, are subject to review by the Supreme Court of the US. The state court systems are generally similar to the federal system, to the extent that they generally have a number of trial courts and intermediate appellate courts, and a single court of last resort. The highest court in each state is usually called the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals with a Chief Justice and Associate Justices, usually elected but sometimes appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the State Senate or other advisory body; they usually hold office for a term of years, but in some instances for life or during good behaviour. The lowest tribunals are usually those of Justices of the Peace; many towns and cities have municipal and police courts, with power to commit for trial in criminal matters and to determine misdemeanours for violation of the municipal ordinances. There were no executions from 1968 to 1976. The US Supreme Court had held the death penalty, as applied in general criminal statutes, to contravene the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the US constitution, as a cruel and unusual punishment when used so irregularly and rarely as to destroy its deterrent value. The death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976, but has not been authorized in Alaska, the District of Columbia There were 17,413 murders in 2016, the highest total since 1997 and up from 14,164 in 2014 (which had been the lowest annual total since 1968). The murder rate in 2016 was 5√Å3 per 100,000 persons, up from 4√Å4 per 100,000 in 2014 although down from 10√Å2 per 100,000 in 1980. 73% of all murders in 2016 were carried out with firearms. The adult literacy rate is at least 99%. Based on the results from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), in 2012 some 18% of US adults ages 16 to 65 scored at or below level 1 proficiency on the literacy scale compared to the average of 15% for the countries participating in PIAAC. (The scale ranged from below level 1 to level 5, with level 1 literacy proficiency requiring 'knowledge and skill in recognizing basic vocabulary, evaluating the meaning of sentences, and reading of paragraph text. ') Elementary and secondary education is mainly a state responsibility. Each state and the District of Columbia has a system of free public schools, established by law, with courses covering 12 years plus kindergarten. There are three structural patterns in common use; the K8-4 plan, meaning kindergarten plus eight elementary grades followed by four high school grades; the K6-3-3 plan, or kindergarten plus six elementary grades followed by a threeyear junior high school and a three-year senior high school; and the K5-3-4 plan, kindergarten plus five elementary grades followed by a three-year middle school and a four-year high school. All plans lead to high-school graduation, usually at age 17 or 18. Vocational education is an optional part of secondary education. Each state has delegated some degree of control of the educational programme to local school districts (numbering 13,567 in school year 2011-12), each with a board of education (usually three to nine members) selected locally and serving mostly without pay. The policies of the local school districts must be in accord with the laws and the regulations of their state departments of education. While regulations differ from one jurisdiction to another, in general it may be said that school attendance is compulsory from age seven to 16. All states operate both two-year and fouryear public colleges, with the two-year colleges typically offering programmes at lower cost. Private schools and college operate independently throughout the USA and are funded primarily by tuition. 'Charter schools' are public schools that operate outside the school boards' administration. They retain the basics of public school education, but may offer unconventional curricula and hours of attendance. Founders may be parents, teachers, public bodies or commercial firms. Organization and conditions depend upon individual states' legislation. The first charter schools were set up in Minnesota in 1991. By 2012, 6,079 charter schools were operating in 40 states and Washington, D.C. In 2012 some 18% of US adults age 16 to 65 scored at or below level 1 proficiency on the PIAAC literacy scale (see above). By race/ethnicity, 10% of Whites, 35% of Blacks and 43% of Hispanics scored at or below level 1 proficiency. In March 2013, 88√Å2% of all persons 25 years old and over had completed four years of high school or more, and 31√Å7% had completed a bachelor's or higher degree. In the age group 25 to 29, 89√Å9% had completed four years of high school or more, and 33√Å6% had completed a bachelor's or higher degree. However, according to a study conducted in 2013 about a third of American fourth graders (aged 9-10) are unable to read at a basic level. In the fall of 2012, 20√Å6m. students (12√Å7m. full-time and 11√Å7m. women) were enrolled in 4,726 colleges and universities; 3√Å0m. were first-time students. It is projected that in 2023 the student population will number 23√Å8m. In 2015-16 total expenditure on education came to $1,254bn. (7√Å0% of GDP); spending on elementary and secondary education totalled $707bn. (3√Å9% of GDP) and that on tertiary education was $548bn. (3√Å0% of GDP). Current expenditure per pupil in public elementary and secondary schools in 2013-14 was $11,226. At the post-secondary level, the USA spent $29,700 per full-time equivalent student in 2014, compared to the OECD average of $16,400. Estimated expenditures in 2015-16 for private elementary and secondary schools and private post-secondary institutions were $52bn. and $204bn. respectively. In 2011-12 the federal government contributed about 18% of total revenue for public institutions; state governments, 24%; student tuition and fees, 21%; and local sources, 6%. Federal support for vocational education in fiscal year 2012 amounted to about $1√Å7bn. Summary of statistics of regular schools (public and private), teachers and pupils for 2011-12 (compiled by the US National Center for Education Statistics): In the fall of 2012 there were 16√Å0 pupils per teacher in public schools in the USA and 12√Å5 pupils per teacher in private schools. The majority of the private elementary and secondary schools are affiliated with religious denominations. In 2011-12 there were 6,870 Catholic schools with 2,088,000 pupils and 138,000 teachers, and 14,210 schools of other religious affiliations with 1,992,000 pupils and 163,000 teachers.

Admission to the practice of medicine (for both doctors of medicine and doctors of osteopathic medicine) is controlled in each state by examining boards directly representing the profession and acting with authority conferred by state law. Although there are a number of variations, the usual time now required to complete training is eight years beyond the secondary school with up to three or more years of additional graduate training. Certification as a specialist may require between three and five more years of graduate training plus experience in practice. In 2013 the total number of physicians in the USA, Puerto Rico and outlying US areas was 1,045,910 (813,770 in 2000 and 393,742 in 1975) ; active doctors numbered 854,698.

Patient admissions to community hospitals in 2014 totalled 33,067,000; average length of stay was 5√Å5 days. There were 693√Å1m. outpatient visits. Personal health expenditure in 2015 totalled $2,717√Å2bn., including: hospital care, $1,036√Å1bn.; professional services, $840√Å2bn.; prescription drugs, $324√Å6bn.; nursing-home care, $156√Å8bn.; home health care, $88√Å8bn.; medical durables, $48√Å5bn. Total national health spending in 2015 amounted to $3,205√Å6bn. In 2014 the USA spent 16√Å5% of its GDP on health-nearly 5% more than any other leading industrialized nation. Public spending on health amounted to 48√Å2% of total health spending in 2013 (the lowest percentage of any major industrialized nation). In March 2010 then President Obama secured the passage of a controversial health care reform package that was expected to increase insurance coverage to a further 32m. citizens. Implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (popularly known as 'Obamacare') began in Oct. 2013. By May 2014 it was estimated that 20m. Americans had gained health insurance coverage under the Act. The proportion of uninsured people dropped from 18√Å0% to 11√Å4% between the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2015. The US Census Bureau had estimated in 2008 that 46√Å3m. people in America were uninsured. However, Obama's presidential successor, Donald Trump, has vowed to repeal large parts of the Obamacare legislation.

The State of the World's Water 2016, WaterAid reported that 0√Å8% of the population does not have access to safe water. Social welfare legislation was chiefly the province of the various states until the adoption of the Social Security Act of 14 Aug. 1935. This as amended provides for a federal system of old-age, survivors and disability insurance; health insurance for the aged and disabled; supplemental security income for the aged, blind and disabled; federal state unemployment insurance; and federal grants to states for public assistance (medical assistance for the aged and aid to families with dependent children generally and for maternal and child health and child welfare services). Legislation of Aug. 1996 began the transfer of aid administration back to the states, restricted the provision of aid to a maximum period of five years, and abolished benefits to immigrants (both legal and illegal) for the first five years of their residence in the USA. The Social Security Administration (formerly part of the Department of Health and Human Services but an independent agency since March 1995) has responsibility for a number of programmes covering retirement, disability, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income and survivors. The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for federal programmes which promote the economic and social wellbeing of families, children, individuals and communities. ACF has federal responsibility for the following programmes: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; low income energy assistance; Head Start; child care; child protective services; and a community services block grant. The ACF also has federal responsibility for social service programmes for children, youth, native Americans and persons with developmental disabilities. The Administration on Aging (AoA), an agency in the US Department of Health and Human Services, is one of the nation's largest providers of homeand community-based care for older persons and their caregivers. Created in 1965 with the passage of the Older Americans Act (OAA), AoA is part of a federal, state, tribal and local partnership called the Aging Network. It serves about 10m. older persons and their caregivers, and includes 56 state and territorial units on aging, 622 Area Agencies on Aging, 260 Title VI Native American aging programmes and tens of thousands of service providers. These organizations provide assistance and services to older individuals and their families in urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the USA. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), an agency of the Health and Human Services Department, has federal responsibility for health insurance for the aged and disabled. Unemployment insurance is the responsibility of the Department of Labor. In 2015-16 an average of 1,206,820 families were receiving payments under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; total payments amounted to $30,868m. (including 23√Å9% for basic assistance, 16√Å6% for child care, and 9√Å2% for work, education and training activities). The role of the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is to ensure that children are supported by their parents. Money collected is for children who live with only one parent because of divorce, separation or birth outside marriage. In 2015-16, $32,700m. was collected for child support; total OCSE expenditures were $5√Å7bn. ($3√Å4bn. in federal funds and $2√Å3bn. in state funds). The Social Security Act provides for protection against the cost of medical care through Medicare, a two-part programme of health insurance for people age 65 and over, people of any age with permanent kidney failure and for certain disabled people under age 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits. In 2014 payments totalling $269,300m. were made under the hospital portion of Medicare. Medicare enrolment in 2014 totalled 54√Å1m. Full retirement benefits are payable from age 66 for Americans born between 1943 and 1954. For those born in 1955 the full retirement age (normal retirement age) will be 66 years and 2 months. The full retirement age will continue to rise in two-month increments each year until it reaches 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later. Pensions may also be deferred up to age 70. In June 2018 there were 43√Å1m. retired workers receiving an average monthly benefit of $1,413 ($1,198 for disabled workers); retired workers and their dependants accounted for 72% of total benefits paid, with disabled workers and dependants accounting for 13%. The minimum social security benefit was eliminated in Jan. 1982 for all workers becoming eligible for retirement or disability insurance benefits after Dec. 1981. A means-tested supplemental income benefit is available to over-65s and disabled and blind individuals with limited income and limited resources. Medicaid is a jointly-funded, federal-state health insurance programme for certain low-income and vulnerable people. It covered 73√Å7m. individuals in 2013 including children under 21 (40√Å4%), adults aged 65 and over (5√Å6%) and blind and/or disabled (13√Å0%). In Dec. 2016, 8√Å25m. persons were receiving Supplementary Security Income payments. 1,164,589 aged persons received $501√Å5m. in benefits; 68,344 blind people received $39√Å4m.; and 7,018,228 disabled people received $4,199√Å4m. Payments, including supplemental amounts from various states, totalled $4,740√Å3m. in 2016. In 2015-16 the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the Food Stamp Program) helped 44,219,000 persons at a cost of $70,915m.; and an average of 30√Å4m. persons received help from the national school lunch programme (73√Å3% for free or at a reduced price).

During the 17th and 18th centuries the British, Spanish and French all fought for control of the territory; it passed to Britain in 1763 and thence to the USA in 1783, except for a Spanish enclave on Mobile Bay, which lasted until 1813. Alabama was organized as a Territory in 1817 and was admitted to the Union as a state on 14 Dec. 1819. The economy was then based on cotton, grown in white-owned plantations by black slave labour imported since 1719. Alabama seceded from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War (1861) and joined the Confederate States of America; its capital Montgomery became the Confederate capital. After the defeat of the Confederacy the state was readmitted to the Union in 1878. Attempts made during the reconstruction period to find a role for the newly freed black slaves-who made up about 50% of the populationlargely failed, and when whites regained political control in the 1870s a strict policy of segregation came into force. At the same time Birmingham began to develop as an important centre of iron-and steel-making. Most of the state was still rural. In 1915 a boll-weevil epidemic attacked the cotton and forced diversification into other farm produce. More industries developed from the power schemes of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s. The black population remained mainly rural, poor and without political power, until the 1960s when confrontations on the issue of civil rights produced reforms. Alabama is bounded in the north by Tennessee, east by Georgia, south by Florida and the Gulf of Mexico and west by Mississippi.

Key Historical Events Discovered in 1741 by Vitus Bering, Alaska's first settlement, on Kodiak Island, was in 1784. The area known as Russian America with its capital (1806) at Sitka was ruled by a Russo-American fur company and vaguely claimed as a Russian colony. Alaska was purchased by the United States from Russia under the treaty of 30 March 1867 for $7√Å2m. Settlement was boosted by gold workers in the 1880s. In 1884 Alaska became a 'district' governed by the code of the state of Oregon. By Act of Congress approved 24 Aug. 1912 Alaska became an incorporated Territory; its first legislature in 1913 granted votes to women, seven years in advance of the Constitutional Amendment. During the Second World War the Federal government acquired large areas for defence purposes and for the construction of the strategic Alaska Highway. In the 1950s oil was found. Alaska became the 49th state of the Union on 3 Jan. 1959 . In the 1970s new oilfields were discovered and the Trans-Alaska pipeline was opened in 1977. The state obtained most of its income from petroleum by 1985. Questions of land-use predominate; there are large areas with valuable mineral resources, other large areas held for the native peoples and some still held by the Federal government. The population increased by over 400% between 1940 and 1980. Alaska is bounded north by the Beaufort Sea, west and south by the Pacific and east by Canada.

The state has the right to select 103√Å55m. acres of vacant and unappropriated public lands in order to establish 'a tax basis'; it can open these lands to prospectors for minerals, and the state is to derive the principal advantage in all gains resulting from the discovery of minerals. In addition, certain federally administered lands reserved for conservation of fisheries and wild life have been transferred to the state. Special provision is made for federal control of land for defence in areas of high strategic importance. The constitution of Alaska was adopted by public vote, 24 April 1956. The state legislature consists of a Senate of 20 members (elected for four years) and a House of Representatives of 40 members (elected for two years). For the 116th Congress, which convened in Jan. 2019, Alaska sends one member to the House of Representatives. It is represented in the Senate by Lisa Murkowski (R. 2002-23) and Daniel Sullivan (R. 2015-21). The franchise may be exercised by all citizens over 18. The capital is Juneau. In the 2016 presidential election Donald Trump took Alaska with 52√Å9% of the vote (Mitt Romney won it in 2012).  In 2011 total state revenue was $14,921m. Total expenditure was $11,320m. (education, $2,475m.; public welfare, $1,918m.; highways, $1,412m.; government administration, $586m.; natural resources, $391m.). Outstanding debt in 2011, $6,418m.

Oil and Gas Alaska ranks fourth among the leading oil producers in the USA (behind Texas, North Dakota and California), although production is steadily declining and is now less than a quarter of what it was in 1988. Commercial production of crude petroleum began in 1959 and by 1961 had become the most important mineral by value. Production in 2014 totalled 181m. bbls. Oil comes mainly from Prudhoe Bay, the Kuparuk River field and several Cook Inlet fields. Oil from the Prudhoe Bay Arctic field is now carried by the Trans-Alaska pipeline to Prince William Sound on the south coast, where there is a tanker terminal at Valdez. Natural gas marketed production, 2014, 345bn. cu. ft. The total area covered by water is 94,743 sq. miles (the most of any state), of which 19,304 sq. miles are inland.

Total estimated 2012 value, $3,436√Å1m. Value of non-fuel mineral production in 2009 was $2,620m. In some parts of the state the climate during the brief spring and summer (about 100 days in major areas and 152 days in the southeastern coastal area) is suitable for agricultural operations, thanks to the long hours of sunlight, but Alaska is a food-importing area. In 2007 there were 686 farms covering a total of 882,000 acres. The average farm had 1,285 acres in 2007 and was valued at $391 per acre. Farm income, 2009: crops, $26m.; livestock and products, $6m. The net farm income in 2009 was $8m. Principal sources: greenhouse and nursery products, hay and potatoes. In 2007 there were 14,823 cattle and calves, 522 sheep and lambs, 757 hogs and pigs, and 3,600 laying hens. Of the 126√Å87m. forested acres of Alaska (the highest acreage of any state), 10√Å87m. acres are national forest land. The interior forest covers 115m. acres; more than 13m. acres are considered commercial forest, of which 3√Å4m. acres are in designated parks or wilderness and unavailable for harvest. The coastal rain forests provide the bulk of commercial timber volume; of their 13√Å6m. acres, 7√Å6m. acres support commercial stands, of which 1√Å9m. acres are in parks or wilderness and unavailable for harvest. In 2014 there were 758 designated wilderness areas throughout the USA, covering a total of 109√Å5m. acres (44√Å3m. ha.). More than 52% of the system is in Alaska (57√Å4m. acres or 23√Å2m. ha.). In 2017 commercial fishing landed 6,005m. lb of fish and shellfish at a value of $1√Å8bn. Alaska is by the far the most important state for fishery landings, accounting for 60√Å5% of the total by weight in 2017. In 2012 the state's 1,446 manufacturing establishments had 42,000 employees, earning $1,699m. Total value added by manufacturing in 2013 was $1,726m.

The Alaska Highway extends 1,523 miles from Dawson Creek, British Columbia, to Fairbanks, Alaska. It was built by the US Army in 1942, at a cost of $138m. The greater portion of it, because it lies in Canada, is maintained by Canada. There is a railroad from Skagway to the town of Whitehorse, the White Pass and Yukon route, in the Canadian Yukon region (this service operates seasonally, although only the section between Skagway and Carcross is in service). The government-owned Alaska Railroad runs from Seward to Fairbanks. This is a freight service with only occasional passenger use. In 2012 there was one freight railroad operating with 506 miles of freight railroad (excluding trackage rights). Rail traffic originating in Alaska in 2012 totalled 5√Å6m. tons and rail traffic terminating in the state also came to 5√Å6m. tons. Alaska's largest international airports are Anchorage and Fairbanks. There were 29 primary airports in 2012 (commercial service airports with more than 10,000 passenger boardings annually), more than in any other state. General aviation aircraft in the state per 1,000 population is about ten times the US average. Anchorage handled 2,543,105 tonnes of freight in 2011 (including transit freight), ranking it second in the USA behind Memphis for cargo handled (and fourth in the world). Alaska Airlines carried 27√Å4m. passengers in 2013 (25√Å9m. in 2012). There were 4,537,477 passenger enplanements statewide in 2012. Regular shipping services to and from the USA are furnished by two steamship and several barge lines operating out of Seattle and other Pacific coast ports. A Canadian company also furnishes a regular service from Vancouver, BC. Anchorage is the main port. A 1,435 nautical-mile ferry system for motor cars and passengers (the 'Alaska Marine Highway') operates from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert (British Columbia) to Juneau, Haines (for access to the Alaska Highway) and Skagway. A second system extends throughout the southcentral region of Alaska linking the Cook Inlet area with Kodiak Island and Prince William Sound. The death penalty was abolished in Alaska in 1957. In Dec. 2014 the jail and prison population totalled 5,216. In 2013-14 there were 507 public schools in Alaska serving over 130,000 students. There were also 8, 195 full-and part-time teachers who earned an average salary of $65,891. Total audited K-12 operating and selected special revenue funds for public schools in the 2012-13 school year were $2√Å32bn., a figure that includes State of Alaska retirement payments. There are seven degree-granting institutions (five public and two private). The University of Alaska (founded in 1922) had 28,760 students at fall 2014 at its three campuses (Anchorage, Fairbanks and Southeast); there are six teaching units at the main campus in Anchorage. Alaska had 2√Å1 community hospital beds for every 1,000 population in 2013. In the same year there were 25√Å0 active physicians per 10,000 civilian population and 7√Å8 dentists per 10,000. Medicare enrolment in July 2012 totalled 73,833. In fiscal year 2012 a total of 137,055 people in Alaska received Medicaid. In Dec. 2014 there were 89,047 Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) beneficiaries. A total of 9,872 people were receiving payments under Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in Dec. 2012.

Spaniards looking for sources of gold or silver entered Arizona in the 16th century finding there American natives, including Tohono O'odham, Navajo, Hopi and Apache. The first Spanish Catholic mission was founded in the early 1690s by Father Eusebio Kino. Settlements were made in 1752 and a Spanish army headquarters was set up at Tucson in 1776. The area was governed by Mexico after the collapse of Spanish colonial power. Mexico ceded it to the USA in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the Mexican-American war (1848). Arizona was then part of New Mexico; the Gadsen Purchase (of land south of the Gila River) was added to it in 1853. The whole was organized as the Arizona Territory on 24 Feb. 1863. Miners and ranchers began settling in the 1850s. Conflicts between American Indian and immigrant populations intensified when troops were withdrawn to serve in the Civil War. The Navajo surrendered in 1865, but the Apache continued to fight, under Geronimo and other leaders, until 1886. Arizona was admitted to the Union as the 48th state in 1912. Large areas of the state have been retained as Indian reservations and as parks to protect the exceptional desert and mountain landscape. In recent years this landscape and the American Indian traditions have been used to attract tourists.

Most of the state's silver and gold are recovered from copper ore. Other minerals include sand and gravel, molybdenum, coal and gemstones. Value of non-fuel mineral production in 2009 was $5,180m. Arizona, despite its dry climate, is well suited for agriculture along the watercourses and where irrigation is practised on a large scale from great reservoirs constructed by the USA as well as by the state government and private interests. Irrigated area in 2007 was 876,158 acres. The wide pasture lands are favourable for the rearing of cattle and sheep, but numbers are either stationary or declining compared with 1920. In 2007 Arizona contained 15,637 farms and ranches and the total farm and pastoral area was 26√Å1m. acres; in 2007 there were 1,205,425 acres of crop land. In 2007 the average farm was 1,670 acres (the fifth largest average size in the USA) and was valued at $748 per acre. Farming is highly commercialized and mechanized and concentrated largely on cotton picked by machines. Area under cotton in 2009: upland cotton, 145,000 acres (440,000 bales harvested); American Pima cotton, 1,700 acres (4,000 bales harvested).

In the 16th and 17th centuries French and Spanish explorers encountered tribes of Chaddo, Osage and Quapaw. The first European settlement was French, at Arkansas Post in 1686, and the area became part of French Louisiana. The USA bought Arkansas from France as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; it was organized as a Territory in 1819 and entered the Union on 15 June 1836 as the 25th state. The eastern plains by the Mississippi were settled by white plantationowners who grew cotton with black slave labour. The rest of the state attracted a scattered population of small farmers. The plantations were the centre of political power. Arkansas seceded from the Union in 1861 and joined the Confederate States of America. At that time the slave population was about 25% of the total. In 1868 the state was readmitted to the Union. Attempts to integrate the black population into state life achieved little, and a policy of segregation was rigidly adhered to until the 1950s. In 1957 federal authorities ordered that high school segregation must end. The state governor called on the state militia to prevent desegregation; there was rioting, and federal troops entered Little Rock, the capital, to restore order. It was another ten years before school segregation finally ended. The main industrial development followed the discovery of large reserves of bauxite.

There were many small American Indian tribes, but no central power, when the area was discovered in 1542 by the Spanish navigator Juan Cabrillo. The Spaniards did not begin to establish missions until the 18th century, when the Franciscan friar Junipero Serra settled at San Diego in 1769. The missions became farming and ranching villages with large American Indian populations. When the Spanish empire collapsed in 1821, the area was governed from newly independent Mexico. The first wagon-train of American settlers arrived from Missouri in 1841. In 1846, during the war between Mexico and the USA, Americans in California proclaimed it to be part of the USA. The territory was ceded by Mexico on 2 Feb. 1848 and became the 31st state of the Union on 9 Sept. 1850. Gold was discovered in 1848-49 and there was an immediate influx of population. The state remained isolated, however, until the development of railways in the 1860s. From then on the population doubled on average every 20 years. The sunny climate attracted fruit-growers, market-gardeners and wine producers. In the early 20th century the bright lights and cheap labour attracted film-makers to Hollywood, Los Angeles. Southern California remained mainly agricultural with an American Indian or Spanish-speaking labour force until after the Second World War. Now more than 90% of the population is urban, with the manufacturing emphasis on hi-technology equipment, much of it for the aerospace, computer and office equipment industries. Land area, 155,779 sq. miles (403,466 sq. km); water area, 7,916 sq. miles (20,501 sq. km). California is the third largest US state behind Alaska and Texas.

The growth rate reflects continued high though somewhat reduced natural increase (excess of births over deaths) as well as substantial net immigration. California's population is 12√Å1% of the total US population. July 2018 estimate, 39,557,045. Population in five census years was: Of the total population in 2010, 18,736,126 were female and 27,958,916 were 18 years old or older.

California experienced a severe economic recession that began at the end of 2007, although the state has now fully recovered from this. The principal cause of the recession was a financial crisis instigated by risky financial activity that led to the bursting of the housing bubble. If California were a country in its own right it would be the world's fifth largest economy. 2017 Gross Domestic Product by state was $2,746,873m., the highest in the United States and representing 14√Å3% of the USA's total GDP.

Justice A 'three strikes law', making 25-years-to-life sentences mandatory for third felony offences, was adopted in 1994 after an initiative (i.e. referendum) was 72% in favour. However, the state's Supreme Court ruled in June 1996 that judges may disregard previous convictions in awarding sentences. In Nov. 2012 voters approved Proposition 36, which modifies the three strikes law, to impose a life sentence only when the third felony conviction is 'serious or violent' and authorizes resentencing for offenders currently serving life sentences if their third strike conviction was not serious or violent.

Eastern Colorado, the hot, dry plains, passed to France in 1802 and then to the USA as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. The rest remained Spanish, becoming Mexican when Spanish power in the Americas ended. In 1848, after war between Mexico and the USA, Mexican Colorado was ceded to the USA. A gold rush in 1859 brought a great influx of population, and in 1861 Colorado was organized as a Territory. The Territory officially supported the Union in the Civil War of 1861-65, but its settlers were divided and served on both sides. Colorado became a state in 1876. Mining and ranching were the mainstays of the economy. In the 1920s the first large projects were undertaken to exploit the Colorado River. The Colorado River Compact was agreed in 1922, and the Boulder Dam (now Hoover Dam) was authorized in 1928. Since then irrigated agriculture has overtaken mining as an industry and is as important as ranching. In 1945 the Colorado-Big Thompson project diverted water by tunnel beneath the Rocky Mountains to irrigate 700,000 acres (284,000 ha.) of northern Colorado. Now more than 80% of the population is urban, with the majority engaged in telecommunications, aerospace and computer technology.

After the War of Independence, Connecticut was one of the original 13 states of the Union. Its state constitution came into force in 1818 and lasted with amendments until 1965 when a new one was adopted. In the early 1800s a textile industry thrived on water power. By 1850 the state had more employment in industry than in agriculture, and immigration from Europe (and especially from southern and Eastern Europe) grew rapidly throughout the 19th century. Some immigrants worked in whaling and iron-mining, but most sought industrial employment. Settlement was spread over a large number of small towns, with no single dominant culture. Yale University was founded at New Haven in 1701. The US Coastguard Academy was founded in 1876 at New London, a former whaling port.

Delaware was the territory of Algonquian-speaking Indians who were displaced by European settlement in the 17th century. The first settlers were Swedes who came in 1638 to build Fort Christina (now Wilmington), and colonize what they called New Sweden. In 1655 their colony was taken by the Dutch, who were based in New Amsterdam. In 1664 the British took the whole New Amsterdam colony, including Delaware, and called it New York. In 1682 Delaware was granted to William Penn, who wanted access to the coast for his Pennsylvania colony. Union of the two colonies was unpopular, and Delaware gained its own government in 1704, although it continued to share a royal governor with Pennsylvania until the War of Independence. Delaware then became one of the 13 original states of the Union and the first to ratify the federal constitution (on 7 Dec. 1787). The population was of Swedish, Finnish, British and Irish extraction. The land was low-lying and fertile, and the use of slave labour was legal. There was a significant number of black slaves, but Delaware was a border state during the Civil War (1861-65) and did not leave the Union. 19th-century immigrants were mostly European Jews, Poles, Germans and Italians. The north became industrial and densely populated, more so after the Second World War with the rise of the petrochemical industry. Industry in general profited from the opening of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in 1829; it was converted to a toll-free deep channel for oceangoing ships in 1919. Delaware is bounded in the north by Pennsylvania, northeast by New Jersey, east by Delaware Bay, south and west by Maryland.

The other commissioner was detailed by the President from the Engineer Corps of the Army. The Commission form of government was abolished in 1967 and a new Mayor Council instituted with officers appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. On 24 Dec. 1973 the appointed officers were replaced by an elected Mayor and councillors, with full legislative powers in local matters as from 1974.

These 'Seminoles' or runaways attracted other refugees including slaves, the recapture of whom was the motive for the first Seminole War of 1817-18. A second war followed in 1835-42, when the Seminoles retreated to the Everglades swamps. After a third war in 1855-58 most Seminoles were forced or persuaded to move to reserves in Oklahoma. Florida became a state in 1845. About half of the population were black slaves. At the outbreak of Civil War in 1861 the state seceded from the Union. During the 20th century Florida continued to grow fruit and vegetables, but real estate development (often for retirement) and the growth of tourism and the aerospace industry set it apart from other ex-plantation states.

Originally the territory of Creek and Cherokee tribes, Georgia was first settled by Europeans in the 18th century. James Oglethorpe founded Savannah in 1733, intending it as a colony offering a new start to debtors, convicts and the poor. Settlement was slow until 1783, when growth began in the cotton-growing areas west of Augusta. The American Indian population was cleared off the rich cotton land and moved beyond the Mississippi.

The islands of Hawaii were settled by Polynesian immigrants, probably from the Marquesas Islands, about AD 400. A second major immigration, from Tahiti, occurred around 800-900. In the late 18th century all the islands were united into one kingdom by Kamehameha I. Western exploration began in 1778, and Christian missions were established after 1820. Europeans called Hawaii the Sandwich Islands. The USA, Britain and France all claimed an interest. Kamehameha III placed Hawaii under US protection in 1851. US sugar-growing companies became dominant and in 1887 the USA obtained a naval base at Pearl Harbor. A struggle developed between forces for and against annexation by the USA. In 1893 the monarchy was overthrown. The republican government agreed to be annexed to the USA in 1898, and Hawaii became a US Territory in 1900. The islands and the naval base were of great strategic importance during the Second World War, when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the USA into the war. Hawaii became the 50th state of the Union in 1959. The 19th-century plantation economy encouraged the immigration of workers, especially from China and Japan. Hawaiian laws, religions and culture were gradually adapted to the needs of the immigrant community.

Home to Algonquian-speaking tribes, Illinois was explored first by the French in 1673. France claimed the area until 1763 when, after the French and Indian War, it was ceded to Britain along with all the French land east of the Mississippi. In 1783 Britain recognized US claims to Illinois, which became part of the North West Territory of the USA in 1787, and of Indiana Territory in 1800. Illinois became a Territory in its own right in 1809, and a state in 1818. Immigration increased greatly with the opening in 1825 of the Erie Canal from New York, along which farmer settlers could move west and their produce back east for sale. Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 and quickly became the transport, trading and distribution centre of the mid-west. Industrial growth brought a further wave of immigration in the 1840s, mainly of European refugees. This movement continued with varying force until the 1920s, when it was largely replaced by immigration of black work-seekers from the southern states. In the 20th century the population was urbanized and heavy industry was established along a network of rail and waterway routes. Chicago recovered from a destructive fire in 1871 to become the hub of this network and at one time the second largest American city.

They established fortified trading posts but there was little settlement. In 1763 the area passed to Britain, with other French-claimed territory east of the Mississippi. In 1783 Indiana became part of the North West Territory of the USA; it became a separate territory in 1800 and a state in 1816. Until 1811 there was continuing conflict with the American Indian inhabitants, who were then defeated at Tippecanoe. Early farming settlement was by families of British and German descent, including Amish and Mennonite communities. Later industrial development offered an incentive for more immigration from Europe, and, subsequently, from the southern states. In 1906 the town of Gary was laid out by the United States Steel Corporation and named after its chairman, Elbert H. Gary. The industry benefited from navigable water to supplies of iron ore and of coal. Indiana Port on Lake Michigan was a thriving trade centre, especially after the opening of the St Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The Ohio River also carried freight. Indianapolis was built after 1821 and became the state capital in 1825. Natural gas was discovered in the neighbourhood in the late 19th century.

In 1854 the Kansas Territory was created and opened for white settlement. The early settlers were farmers from Europe or New England, but the Territory's position also brought it into contact with southern culture. Slavery was prohibited by the Missouri Compromise of 1820 but the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act affirmed the principle of 'popular sovereignty' to settle the issue, which was then fought out by opposing factions throughout 'Bleeding Kansas'. Kansas entered the Union (as a non-slave state) in 1861, minus the territory that is now in Colorado. The economy was based on cattle-ranching and railways. Herds were driven to the railheads and shipped from vast stockyards, or slaughtered and processed in railhead meat-packing plants.

The state became divided on the issue of slavery, although plantation interests (mainly producing tobacco) dominated state government. In fact the state did not secede in 1861, and the majority of citizens supported the Union. Public opinion was more favourable to the south in the hard times of the reconstruction period. The eastern mountains became an important coal mining area, tobaccogrowing continued and the Bluegrass plains produced livestock, including especially fine thoroughbred horses.

Originally the territory of Choctaw and Caddo tribes, the area was claimed for France in 1682. In 1718 the French founded New Orleans which became the centre of a crown colony in 1731. France ceded the area west of the Mississippi (most of the present state) to Spain in 1762 and the eastern area, north of New Orleans, to Britain in 1763. The British section passed to the USA in 1783 but France bought back the rest from Spain in 1800, including New Orleans and the mouth of the Mississippi. The USA, fearing exclusion from a strategically important and commercially promising shipping area, persuaded France to sell Louisiana in 1803. The present states of Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Oklahoma were included in the purchase. The area became the Territory of New Orleans in 1804 and was admitted to the Union as a state in 1812. The economy initially depended on cotton and sugarcane plantations. The population was of French, Spanish and black descent, with a growing number of American settlers. Plantation interests succeeded in achieving secession in 1861 but New Orleans was occupied by the Union in 1862.

The state has become mainly urban industrial, with the Mississippi ports growing rapidly. There is petroleum and natural gas, and a strong tourist industry based on the French culture and Caribbean atmosphere of New Orleans.

After 1652 Maine was governed as part of Massachusetts, and French claims finally failed in 1763. Most of the early settlers were English and Protestant Irish, with many Quebec French. The Massachusetts settlers gained control when the first colonist, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, supported the losing royalist side in the English civil war. During the English-American war of 1812, Maine residents claimed that the Massachusetts government did not protect them against British raids. Maine was separated from Massachusetts and entered the Union as a state in 1820. Maine is a mountainous state and even the coastline is rugged, but the coastal belt is where most settlement has developed. In the 19th century there were manufacturing towns making use of cheap water-power and the rocky shore supported a shell-fish industry. The latter still flourishes, together with intensive horticulture, producing potatoes and fruit. The other main economic activity is forestry for timber, pulp and paper. The capital is Augusta, a river trading post which was fortified against American Indian attacks in 1754, incorporated as a town in 1797 and chosen as capital in 1832. Maine is bounded west, north and east by Canada, southeast by the Atlantic, south and southwest by New Hampshire.

The first white settlement was made by the Calvert family, British Roman Catholics, in 1634. The settlers received some legislative rights in 1638. In 1649 their assembly passed the Act of Toleration, granting freedom of worship to all Christians. A peace treaty was signed with the Iroquois in 1652, after which it was possible for farming settlements to expand north and west. The capital (formerly at St Mary's City) was moved to Annapolis in 1694. Baltimore, which became the state's main city, was founded in 1729. The first industry was tobacco-growing, which was based on slaveworked plantations. There were also many immigrant British small farmers, tradesmen and indentured servants. At the close of the War of Independence, the treaty of Paris was ratified in Annapolis. Maryland became a state of the Union in 1788. In 1791 the state ceded land for the new federal capital, Washington, and its economy has depended on the capital's proximity ever since.

The first European settlement was at Plymouth, where the Mayflower landed its English religious separatists in 1620. In 1626-30 more colonists arrived, the main body being English Puritans who founded a Puritan commonwealth. This commonwealth, of about 1,000 colonists led by John Winthrop, became the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was founded under a company charter. Following disagreement between the English government and the colony, the charter was withdrawn in 1684, but in 1691 a new charter united a number of settlements under the name of Massachusetts Bay. The colony's government was rigidly theocratic. Shipbuilding, iron-working and manufacturing were more important than farming, the land being poor. The colony was Protestant and of English descent until the War of Independence. The former colony adopted its present constitution in 1780. In the struggle which ended in the separation of the American colonies from the mother country, Massachusetts took the foremost part, and on 6 Feb. 1788 became the 6th state to ratify the US constitution. The state acquired its present boundaries (having previously included Maine) in 1820.

In 1763 Michigan passed to Britain, along with other French territory east of the Mississippi, and from Britain it passed to the USA in 1783. Britain, however, kept a force at Detroit until 1796, and recaptured Detroit in 1812. Regular American settlement did not begin until later. The Territory of Michigan (1805) had its boundaries extended after 1818 and 1834. It was admitted to the Union as a state (with its present boundaries) in 1837.

Lake Michigan ports shipped bulk cargo of iron ore and grain. Detroit was the capital until 1847, when that function passed to Lansing. Detroit remained, however, an important centre of flour-milling and shipping and, after the First World War, of the motor industry. Michigan is divided into two by Lake Michigan.

Mississippi was one of the territories claimed by France and ceded to Britain in 1763. The indigenous people were Choctaw and Natchez. French settlers at first traded amicably, but in the course of three wars (1716, 1723 and 1729) the French allied with the Choctaw to drive the Natchez out.

Originally the territory of many American Indian hunters including the Sioux, Cheyenne and Chippewa, Montana was not settled by American colonists until the 19th century. The area passed to the USA with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, but the area west of the Rockies was disputed with Britain until 1846. Trappers and fur-traders were the first immigrants, and the fortified trading post at Fort Benton (1846) became the first permanent settlement. Colonization increased when gold was found in 1862. Montana was created a separate Territory (out of Idaho and Dakota Territories) in 1864. In 1866 large-scale grazing of sheep and cattle provoked violent confrontation with the indigenous people whose hunting lands were invaded. American Indian wars led to the defeat of federal forces at Little Bighorn in 1876 and at Big Hole Basin in 1877, but by 1880 the American Indians had been moved to reservations. Montana became a state in 1889. Helena, the capital, was founded as a mining town in the 1860s. In the early 20th century there were many European immigrants who settled as farmers or as copper-miners, especially at Butte.

It was ceded by France to Spain in 1763, returned to France in 1801, and sold by Napoleon to the USA as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. During the 1840s the Platte River valley was the trail for thousands of pioneers' wagons heading for Oregon and California. The need to serve and protect the trail led to the creation of Nebraska as a Territory in 1854. In 1862 the Homestead Act opened the area for settlement, but colonization was slow until the Union Pacific Railroad was completed in 1869. Omaha, developed as the starting point of the Union Pacific, became one of the largest railway towns in the country. Nebraska became a state in 1867, with approximately its present boundaries except that it later received small areas from the Dakotas.

They developed manufacturing industries, especially shoe-making, textiles and clothing, to which large numbers of French Canadians were attracted after the Civil War. Portsmouth, originally a fishing settlement, was the colonial capital and is the only seaport. In 1808 the state capital was moved to Concord (having had no permanent home since 1775); Concord produced the Concord Coach which was widely used on the stagecoach routes of the West until 1900. New Hampshire is bounded in the north by Canada, east by Maine and the Atlantic, south by Massachusetts and west by Vermont. Total area is 9,349 sq. miles (24,214 sq. km) of which 8,953 sq. miles (23,187 sq. km) Nashua, 86,494; Dover, 29,987; Rochester, 29,752; Keene, 23,409; Derry, 22,015; Portsmouth, 20,779; Laconia, 15,951.

Originally the territory of Delaware Indians, the area was settled by immigrant colonists in the early 17th century, when Dutch and Swedish traders established fortified posts on the Hudson and Delaware Rivers. The Dutch gave way to the English in 1664. In 1676 the English divided the area; the eastern portion was assigned to Sir George Carteret and the western granted to Quaker settlers. This lasted until 1702 when New Jersey was united as a colony of the Crown and placed under the jurisdiction of the governor of New York. It became a separate colony in 1738. During the War of Independence crucial battles were fought at Trenton, Princeton and Monmouth. New Jersey became the 3rd state of the Union in 1787. Trenton, the state capital since 1790, began as a Quaker settlement and became an iron-working town. Industrial development grew rapidly, there and elsewhere in the state, after the opening of canals and railways in the 1830s. Princeton, also a Quaker settlement, became an important post on the New York road; the college of New Jersey (Princeton University) was transferred there from Newark in 1756. The need for supplies in the Civil War stimulated industry and New Jersey became a manufacturing state. The growth of New York and Philadelphia, however, encouraged commuting to employment in both centres. By 1980 about 60% of the state's population lived within 30 miles of New York. New Jersey is bounded north by New York, east by the Atlantic with Long Island and New York City to the northeast, south by Delaware Bay and west by Pennsylvania.

Key Historical Events The first European settlement was established in 1598. Until 1771 New Mexico was the Spanish 'Kingdom of New Mexico'. In 1771 it was annexed to the northern province of New Spain. When New Spain won its independence in 1821, it took the name of Republic of Mexico and established New Mexico as its northernmost department. Ceded to the USA in 1848 after war between the USA and Mexico, the area was recognized as a Territory in 1850, by which time its population was Spanish and American Indian. There were frequent conflicts between new settlers and raiding parties of Navajo and Apaches. The American Indian war lasted from 1861-66, and from 1864-68 about 8,000 Navajo were imprisoned at Bosque Redondo. The boundaries were altered several times when land was taken into Texas, Utah, Colorado and lastly (1863) Arizona. New Mexico became a state in 1912. Settlement proceeded by means of irrigated crop-growing and Mexicanstyle ranching. During the Second World War the desert areas were used as testing zones for atomic weapons. Mineral related industries developed after the discovery of uranium and petroleum. New Mexico is bounded north by Colorado, northeast by Oklahoma, east by Texas, south by Texas and Mexico and west by Arizona. Total area is 121,590 sq. miles (314,917 sq. km) of which 121,298 sq. miles (314,161 sq. km) are land. In 2010 American Indian lands covered 12,085 sq. miles (reservations plus off-reservation trust land). Census population, 1 April 2010, was 2,059,179, an increase of 13√Å2% since 2000. July 2018 estimate, 2,095,428. Of the total population in 2010, 1,041,758 were female and 1,540,507 were 18 years old or older. The population in five census years was: Before 1930 New Mexico was largely a Spanish-speaking state, but after 1945 an influx of population from other states considerably reduced the percentage of persons of Spanish origin or descent. However, in recent years the percentage of the Hispanic population has begun to rise again. In  Santa Fe, Jan. 26√Å4 F (-3√Å1 C), July 68√Å4 F (20 C). Annual rainfall 15√Å2 00 (386 mm).

The first European immigrants came in the 17th century, when there were two powerful American Indian groups in rivalry: the Iroquois confederacy (Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Seneca) and the Algonquianspeaking Mohegan and Munsee. The Dutch made settlements at Fort Orange (now Albany) in 1624 and at New Amsterdam in 1625, trading with the American Indians for furs. In the 1660s there was conflict between the Dutch and the British in the Caribbean; as part of the concluding treaty the British, in 1664, received Dutch possessions in the Americas, including New Amsterdam, which they renamed New York. In 1763 the Treaty of Paris ended war between the British and the French in North America (in which the Iroquois had allied themselves with the British). Settlers of British descent in New England then felt confident enough to expand westward. The climate of northern New York being severe, most settled in the Hudson river valley. After the War of Independence New York became the 11th state of the Union (1778), having first declared itself independent of Britain in 1777. The economy depended on manufacturing, shipping and other means of distribution and trade. During the 19th century New York became the most important city in the USA. Its industries, especially clothing, attracted thousands of European immigrants. Industrial development spread along the Hudson-Mohawk valley, which was made the route of the Erie Canal (1825) linking New York with Buffalo on Lake Erie and thus with the developing farmlands of the middle west. On 11 Sept. 2001 two hijacked commercial airliners were flown into the World Trade Center in central New York. The complex was destroyed in the attack and 2,753 people died. New York is bounded west and north by Canada with Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the St Lawrence River forming the boundary; east by Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut, southeast by the Atlantic, south by New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

European settlement was attempted in 1585-87, following an exploratory visit by Sir Walter Raleigh, but this failed. Settlers from Virginia came to the shores of Albemarle Sound after 1650 and in 1663 Charles II chartered a private colony of Carolina. In 1691 the north was put under a deputy governor who ruled from Charleston in the south. The colony was formally separated into North and South Carolina in 1712. In 1729 control was taken from the private proprietors and vested in the Crown, whereupon settlement grew, and the boundary between north and south was finally fixed (1735). After the War of Independence, North Carolina became one of the original 13 states of the Union. The city of Raleigh was laid out as the new capital. Having been a plantation colony North Carolina continued to develop as a plantation state, growing tobacco with black slave labour. It was also an important source of gold before the western gold-rushes of 1848. In 1861 at the outset of the Civil War, North Carolina seceded from the Union, but General Sherman occupied the capital unopposed. A military governor was admitted in 1862, and civilian government restored with readmission to the Union in 1868. North Carolina is bounded north by Virginia, east by the Atlantic, south by South Carolina, southwest by Georgia and west by Tennessee.

In 1889 North and South Dakota were admitted to the Union as separate states with Bismarck as the Northern capital. The largest city, Fargo, was also a railway town, named after William George Fargo, the expresscompany founder. The population grew rapidly until 1890 and steadily until 1930 by which time it was about one-third European in origin. Between 1930 and 1970 there was a steady population drain, increasing whenever farming was affected by the extremes of the continental climate. The discovery of oil in the state in 2006 has since prompted an economic boom that has generated a population rise more than three times the rate in the USA overall since 2010.

The land was inhabited by Delaware, Miami, Shawnee and Wyandot Indians. It was explored by French and British traders in the 18th century and confirmed as part of British North America in 1763. After the War of Independence it became part of the Northwest Territory of the new United States. Former independence fighters came in from New England in 1788 to make the first permanent white settlement at Marietta, at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers. In 1803 Ohio was separated from the rest of the Territory and admitted to the Union as the 17th state. In the early 19th century there was steady immigration from Europe, mainly of Germans, Swiss, Irish and Welsh. Industrial growth began with the processing of farm, forest and mining products; it increased rapidly with the need to supply the Union armies in the Civil War of 1861-65. As the industrial cities grew, so immigration began again, with many whites from Eastern Europe and the Balkans and blacks from the southern states looking for work in Ohio. Cleveland, which developed rapidly as a Lake Erie port after the opening of commercial waterways to the interior and the Atlantic coast (1825, 1830 and 1855) , became an iron-and-steel town during the Civil War.

In 1714 Juchereau de Saint Denis made the first French contact. During the 18th century French fur-traders were active. A French and Spanish struggle for control was resolved by the French withdrawal in 1763. France returned briefly in 1800-03, and the territory then passed to the USA as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1828 the Federal government set aside the area of the present state as Indian Territory (a reservation and sanctuary for American Indian tribes who had been driven off their lands elsewhere by white settlement). About 70 tribes came, among whom were Creeks, Choctaws and Cherokees from the southeastern states, and Plains Indians. In 1889 the government took back about 2√Å5m. acres of the Territory and opened it to white settlement. About 10,000 homesteaders gathered at the site of Oklahoma City on the Santa Fe Railway in the rush to stake their land claims. The settlers' area, and others subsequently opened to settlement, were organized as the Oklahoma Territory in 1890. In 1907 the Oklahoma and Indian Territories were combined and admitted to the Union as a state. Indian reservations were established within the state. The economy first depended on ranching and farming, with packing stations on the railways. A mining industry grew in the 1870s attracting foreign immigration, mainly from Europe.

The early work of the conservation districts, beginning in 1937, was limited to flood and erosion control: since 1970, they also include urban areas. Irrigated production has increased in the Oklahoma 'panhandle'. The Ogalala aquifer is the primary source of irrigation water there and in western Oklahoma, a finite source because of its isolation from major sources of recharge. Declining groundwater levels necessitate the most effective irrigation practices. There were 12,363,000 acres of forested land in 2013, with 306,000 acres of national forest. The forest products industry is concentrated in the 118 eastern counties.

The Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) estimates logging totalled 3√Å6bn. bd ft in 2011. According to the Oregon Employment Department's covered employment statistics, the forestry and logging subsector's 766 worksites employed 9,385 people statewide and added about $474m. in payroll to Oregon's economy in 2011. Trees vary from the coastal forest of hemlock and spruce to the state's primary species, Douglas fir, throughout much of western Oregon. In eastern Oregon, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine and true firs are found. Here, along the Cascade summit and in the mountains of northeast Oregon, alpine species are found.

In Dec. 2014 Pennsylvania Key Historical Events Pennsylvania was occupied by four powerful tribes in the 17th century: Delaware, Susquehannock, Shawnee and Iroquois. The first white settlers were Swedish, arriving in 1643. The British became dominant in 1664 and in 1681 William Penn, an English Quaker, was given a charter to colonize the area as a sanctuary for his fellow Quakers. Penn's ideal was peaceful co-operation with the American Indians and religious toleration within the colony. Several religious groups were attracted to Pennsylvania, including Protestant sects from Germany and France. In the 18th century, co-operation with the American Indians failed as the settlers extended their territory. The Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia while Pennsylvania became one of the original 13 states of the Union. In 1812 the state capital was moved to its current location in Harrisburg, originally a trading post and ferry point on the Susquehanna River in the south-central part of the state. The Mason-Dixon line, the state's southern boundary, was the dividing line between free and slave states in the build-up to the Civil War. Gettysburg and other crucial battles were fought in the state. Industrial growth was rapid after the war. Pittsburgh, founded as a British fort in 1761 during war with the French, had become an iron-making town by 1800 and grew rapidly when canal and railway links opened in the 1830s. The American Federation of Labor was founded in Pittsburgh in 1881, by which time the city was of national importance producing coal, iron, steel and glass. At the beginning of the 20th century, industry attracted immigration from Italy and Eastern Europe. In farming areas the early sect communities survive, notably Amish and Mennonites. (The Pennsylvania 'Dutch' are of German extraction.) Pennsylvania is bounded north by New York, east by New Jersey, south by Delaware and Maryland, southwest by West Virginia, west by Ohio and northwest by Lake Erie.

In 2011 overseas visitors to Pennsylvania-excluding those from Canada and Mexico-numbered 920,000, down from 923,000 in 2010 but up from 672,000 in 2006. The earliest white settlement was founded by Roger Williams, an English Puritan who was expelled from Massachusetts because of his dissident religious views and his insistence on the land-rights of the American Indians. At Providence he bought land from the Narragansetts and founded a colony there in 1636. A charter was granted in 1663. Religious toleration attracted Jewish and nonconformist settlers; later there was French Canadian settlement. Shipping and fishing developed strongly, especially at Newport and Providence. These two cities were twin capitals until 1900, when the capital was fixed at Providence. Significant actions took place in Rhode Island during the War of Independence. In 1790 the state accepted the federal constitution and was admitted to the Union. Early farming development was most successful in dairying and poultry. Early industrialization from the 1790s was mainly in textiles. Thriving on abundant water power, the industry began to decline after the First World War. British, Irish, Polish, Italian and Portuguese workers settled in the state, working in the mills or in the shipbuilding, shipping, fishing and naval ports. The growth of the cities led to the abolition of the property qualification for the franchise in 1888. Rhode Island is bounded north and east by Massachusetts, south by the Atlantic and west by Connecticut. Land area, 1,034 sq. miles (2,678 sq. km); water area, 511 sq. miles (1,324 sq. km  Births, 2014, 10,823 (10√Å3 per 1,000 population); deaths, 2014, 9,770 (9√Å3) .

Originally the territory of Yamasee Indians, the area attracted French and Spanish explorers in the 16th century. There were attempts at settlement on the coast, none of which lasted. Charles I of England made a land grant in 1629 but the first permanent white settlement began at Charles Town in 1670, moving to Charleston in 1680. This was a proprietorial colony including North Carolina until 1712; both passed to the Crown in 1729. The coastlands developed as plantations worked by slave labour. In the hills there were small farming settlements and many trading posts, dealing with American Indian suppliers. After active campaigns during the War of Independence, South Carolina became one of the original states of the Union in 1788. In 1793 the cotton gin was invented, enabling the speedy mechanical separation of seed and fibre. This made it possible to grow huge areas of cotton and meet the rapidly-growing needs of new textile industries. Plantation farming spread widely and South Carolina became hostile to the antislavery campaign which was strong in northern states. The state first attempted to secede from the Union in 1847, but was not supported by other southern states until 1860, when secession led to civil war. At that time the population was about 703,000, of whom 413,000 were black. During the reconstruction periods there was some political power for black citizens but control was back in white hands by 1876. The constitution was amended in 1895 to disenfranchise most black voters and they remained with hardly any voice in government until the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. Columbia became the capital in 1786. South Carolina is bounded in the north by North Carolina, east and southeast by the Atlantic, southwest and west by Georgia. Land area, 30,061 sq. miles (77,857 sq. km); water area, 1,960 sq. miles (5,076 sq. km  The present constitution dates from 1895, when it went into force without ratification by the electorate.

In the 2016 presidential election Donald Trump took South Carolina with 54√Å9% of the vote (Mitt Romney won it in 2012).  In 2015 production was 96√Å5bn. kWh, of which 53√Å2bn. kWh was from nuclear energy. The total area covered by water is 1,960 sq. miles. Gold is found, though non-metallic minerals are of chief importance: value of non-fuel mineral output in 2009 was more than $440m., chiefly from cement (Portland), stone and gold. Production of kaolin, vermiculite and scrap mica is also important. In 2007  The forest industry is important; total forest land (2013), 13√Å04m. acres. National forests amounted to 602,000 acres.

The death penalty is authorized. There have been no executions since 2011, when one was carried out. In 2012 Fur-traders were active but there was no settlement until Fort Randall was founded on the Missouri river in 1856. In 1861 North and South Dakota were united as the Dakota Territory. The Homestead Act of 1862 stimulated settlement, mainly in the southeast until there was a gold-rush in the Black Hills of the west in 1875-76. Colonization was by farming communities in the east with miners and ranchers in the west. Livestock farming predominated, attracting European settlers from Scandinavia, Germany and Russia. In 1889 the North and South were separated and admitted to the Union as states. Pierre, founded as a railhead in 1880, was confirmed as the capital in 1904. It faces Fort Pierre, the former centre of the fur trade, across the Missouri river. During the 20th century there have been schemes to exploit the Missouri for power and irrigation.

Higher ( Tennessee Key Historical Events Bordered on the west by the Mississippi, Tennessee was part of an area inhabited by Cherokee. French, Spanish and British explorers navigated the Mississippi to trade with the Cherokee in the late 16th and 17th centuries. French claims were abandoned in 1763. Colonists from the British colonies of Virginia and Carolina then began to cross the Appalachians westwards, but there was no organized Territory until after the War of Independence. In 1784 there was a short-lived, independent state called Franklin. In 1790 the South West Territory (including Tennessee) was formed and Tennessee entered the Union as a state in 1796. The state was active in the war against Britain in 1812. After the American victory, colonization increased and pressure for land mounted. The Cherokee were forcibly removed during the 1830s and taken to Oklahoma, a journey on which many died.

In 2012 Texas Key Historical Events A number of American Indian tribes occupied the area before French and Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century. In 1685 La Salle established a colony at Fort St Louis, but Texas was confirmed as Spanish in 1713. Spanish missions increased during the 18th century with San Antonio (1718) as their headquarters. In 1820 a Virginian colonist, Moses Austin, obtained permission to begin a settlement in Texas. In 1821 the Spanish empire in the Americas came to an end and Texas, together with Coahuila, formed a state of the newly independent Mexico. The Mexicans agreed to the Austin venture and settlers of British and American descent came in. Discontented with Mexican government, the settlers declared independence in 1836. Warfare, including the siege of the Alamo fort, ended with the foundation of the independent Republic of Texas which lasted until 1845. During this period the Texas Rangers were organized as a police force and border patrol. Texas was annexed to the Union in Dec. 1845, as the Federal government feared its vulnerability to Mexican occupation. This led to war between Mexico and the USA from 1845 to 1848. In 1861 Texas left the Union and joined the southern states in the Civil War, being readmitted in 1869.

The strongest American Indian tribes in the 18th century were Chinook, Nez Perc√©, Salish and Yakima. The area was designated by European colonizers as part of the Oregon Country. Between 1775 and 1800 it was claimed by Spain, Britain and the USA; the dispute between the two latter nations was not settled until 1846. The first small white settlements were American Indian missions and fur-trading posts. In the 1840s American settlers began to push westwards along the Oregon Trail, making a settlement with Britain a matter of urgency. When this was achieved the whole area was organized as the Oregon Territory in 1848. Washington was made a separate Territory in 1853. Apart from trapping and fishing, the chief industry was supplying timber for the new settlements of California. After 1870 the westward extension of railways encouraged settlement. Statehood was granted in 1889. Settlers were mostly Americans from neighbouring states to the east and Canadians. Scandinavian immigrants followed. Seattle, laid out in 1853 as a saw-milling town, was named after the American Indian chief who had ceded the land and befriended the settlers. It grew as a port during the Alaskan and Yukon goldrushes of the 1890s. The economy thrived on exploiting the Columbia River for hydro-electric power.

The 40 western counties, mostly hilly country and settled by miners and small farmers who were not slave-owners, were declared a new state. On 20 June 1863 West Virginia became the 35th state of the Union. The capital, Charleston, was an 18th-century fortified post on the early westward migration routes across the Appalachians. In 1795 local brine wells were tapped and the city grew as a salt town. Coal, oil, natural gas and a variety of salt brines were all found in due course. Huntington, the next largest town, served the same industrial area as a railway terminus and port on the Ohio river. Wheeling, the original state capital, located on the major transportation routes of the Ohio River, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the National Road, was a well-established, cosmopolitan city when it hosted the statehood meetings in 1861. Three-quarters of the state is forest. Settlement has been concentrated in the mineral-bearing Kanawha valley, along the Ohio river and in the industrial Monongahela valley of the north. More than half of the population is still classified as rural. However, the majority commute to industrial employment. West Virginia is bounded in the north by Pennsylvania and Maryland, east and south by Virginia, southwest by the Big Sandy River (forming the boundary with Kentucky) and west by the Ohio River (forming the boundary with Ohio  In 2012 there were 2,226 miles of freight railroad (excluding trackage rights).

The territory was inhabited by Plains Indians (Arapahoes, Sioux and Cheyenne) in the early 19th century. There was some trading with white Americans, but very little white settlement. In the 1840s the great western migration routes, the Oregon and the Overland Trails, ran through the territory with Wyoming offering mountain passes accessible to wagons. Once migration became a steady flow forts were built to protect the route from American Indian attack. In 1867 coal was discovered. In 1868 Wyoming was organized as a separate Territory and in 1869 the Sioux and Arapaho were confined to reservations. At the same time the route of the Union Pacific Railway brought railway towns to southern Wyoming. Settlement of the north was delayed until after the final defeat of hostile American Indians in 1876. The economy was based on ranching. Cheyenne, made Territorial capital in 1869, also functioned as a railway town moving cattle. Casper, on the site of a fort on the Pony Express route, was also a railway town on the Chicago and North Western. Laramie started as a Union Pacific construction workers' shanty town in 1868. In 1890 oil was discovered at Casper, and Wyoming became a state the same year. Subsequently, mineral extraction became the leading industry, as natural gas, uranium, bentonite and trona were exploited as well as oil and coal.

The outlying territories of the USA comprise the two Commonwealths of the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico, the incorporated territory of Palmyra Atoll, a number of unincorporated territories (including American Samoa, Guam and the US Virgin Islands) in the Pacific Ocean and one unincorporated territory in the Caribbean Sea. In 1889 Spain ceded Guam (largest and southernmost of the Marianas Islands) to the USA and sold the rest to Germany. Occupied by Japan in 1914, the islands were administered by Japan under a League of Nations mandate until occupied by US forces in Aug. 1944. In 1947 they became part of the US-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. On 17 June 1975 the electorate voted for a Commonwealth in association with the USA; this was approved by the US government in April 1976 and came into force on 1 Jan. 1978 . In Nov. 1986 the islanders were granted US citizenship. The UN terminated the Trusteeship status on 22 Dec. 1990 .

A Spanish dependency since the 16th century, Puerto Rico was ceded to the USA in 1898 after the Spanish defeat in the Spanish-American war. In 1917 US citizenship was conferred and in 1932 there was a name change from Porto Rico to Puerto Rico. In 1952 the territory was proclaimed a commonwealth with a representative government and a directly elected governor. Puerto Rico is the easternmost of the Greater Antilles and lies between the Dominican Republic and the US Virgin Islands. Total area: 13,791 sq. km (5, 325 sq. miles), of which 8,868 sq. km (3, 424 sq. miles) are dry land. Climate is warm and sunny in winter and hot in summer; the north coast experiences more rainfall than the south coast. Population (2010 census): 3,725,789 (1,940,618 female); density: 1,088 per sq. mile. Main towns (2010 census): San Juan (the capital), 395, 326; Bayam√≥n, 208, 116; Carolina, 176, 762; Ponce, 166, 327; Caguas, 142, 893 . The Puerto Rican island of Vieques, 10 miles to the east, has an area of 51√Å7 sq. miles and 9,301 (2010) inhabitants. The island of Culebra, between Puerto Rico and St Thomas, has an area of 10 sq. miles and 1,818 (2010) inhabitants. Spanish and English are joint official languages. Puerto Rico is a self-governing commonwealth (Estado Libre Asociado) in association with the USA. The chief of state is the US President. The head of government is an elected Governor. There are two legislative chambers: the 51-member House of Representatives and the 27-member Senate. Executive power is exercised by the Governor, elected every four years, who leads a cabinet of 15 ministers. A new constitution was approved in 1952. Puerto Rico broadly has authority over its internal affairs, but the USA controls areas generally regulated by the federal government. Puerto Ricans are US citizens and possess most of the rights and obligations of citizens from the 50 states. Differences include Puerto Rico's local taxation system and partial exemption from the Internal Revenue Code, its lack of voting representation in either house of the US Congress (they have one non-voting representative) and the ineligibility of Puerto Ricans to vote in presidential elections. Puerto Rican men are subject to conscription (not enforced) in the US Armed Forces. Puerto Rico's authority over internal affairs is subject to the agreement of the US Congress and may, in theory, be rescinded at any time. At a plebiscite on 14 Nov. 1993 on Puerto Rico's future status, 48√Å6% of votes cast were for Commonwealth (status quo), 46√Å3% for Statehood (51st State of the USA) and 4√Å4% for full independence. In a further plebiscite in Dec. 1998, some 52√Å2% of voters backed no change, while 46√Å5% supported statehood. Independence was supported by 2√Å5%, while free association received 0√Å3%. A non-binding referendum of Puerto Rico's status was then held on 6 Nov. 2012. Voters were asked firstly whether they wished to continue with the current territorial status, and secondly which status they favoured of statehood, independence or sovereign nation in free association with the USA. Turnout approached 80%, with 54√Å0% voting no to the first question. Of those, 73√Å0% cast a vote on the second question, with 61√Å1% opting for statehood, 33√Å3% for sovereign free association and 5√Å5% for independence. In a further non-binding referendum in June 2017, with only a 23% turnout, 97% were in favour of statehood. Nonetheless, before Puerto Rico can become the 51st state of the USA, legislation has to be approved by the US Congress and signed off by the President.

By the Tripartite Treaty of 7 Nov. 1899, ratified 19 Feb. 1900, Great Britain and Germany renounced, in favour of the USA, all rights over the islands of the Samoan group east of 171 long. west of Greenwich. The islands to the west of that meridian, now the independent state of Samoa, were assigned to Germany. (1, 143) . There is also Swain's Island, with an area of 1√Å9 sq. miles and only a few inhabitants, which lies 210 miles to the northwest. Rose Island (uninhabited) is 0√Å4 sq. mile in area.

Polynesian customs (not inconsistent with US laws) are respected. Fagatogo is the seat of the government. The islands are organized in 15 counties grouped in three districts; these counties and districts correspond to the traditional political units.

The lower house, or House of Representatives, is composed of 20 members elected by universal adult suffrage and one non-voting member for Swain's Island. The upper house, or Senate, is comprised of 18 members elected, in the traditional Samoan manner, in meetings of the chiefs. The Governor and Lieut.-Governor have been popularly elected since 1978.
