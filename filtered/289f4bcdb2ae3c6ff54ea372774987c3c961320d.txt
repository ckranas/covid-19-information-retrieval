# These authors contributed equally to this work Graphical abstract J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Highlights  This paper summarized 159 natural compounds against ALI.  The paper summed up the protective effects of all products on ALI in vivo and vitro.  This paper clarified the underlying mechanism of natural compounds against ALI. Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as common life-threatening lung diseases with high mortality rates are mostly associated with acute and severe inflammation in lungs. With increasing in-depth studies of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ALI/ARDS, significant breakthroughs have been made, however, there are still no effective pharmacological therapies for treatment of ALI/ARDS. Especially, the novel coronavirus pneumonia is ravaging the globe, and causes severe respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, developing new drugs for therapy of ALI/ARDS is in great demand, which might also be helpful for treatment of COVID-19. Natural compounds have always inspired drug development, and numerous natural products have shown potential therapeutic effects on ALI/ARDS. Therefore, this review focuses on the potential therapeutic effects of natural compounds on ALI and the underlying mechanisms. Overall, the review discusses 159 compounds and summarizes more than 400 references to present the protective effects of natural compounds against ALI and the underlying mechanism.

Numerous studies have found that the incidence and mortality of ALI/ARDS is influenced by factors including season, advanced age, gender, smoking and alcohol use. The incidence of ALI increases with age from 16 per 100,000 people for those aged 15-19 years to 306 per 100,000 people for those aged 75-84 years, and mortality increased from 24% for those aged 15-19 years to 60% for those aged 85 years or older [7] . A registry-based study conducted in Taiwan, China, for 1997-2011 found that in-hospital mortality rate increased from 33.5% for patients aged 18-29 years to 68.2% for patients aged 80 years or older [8] . Therefore, treatments for ALI/ARDS are needed. Currently, existing therapies for ALI/ARDS can be divided into supportive therapy and pharmacological intervention. The lung protective strategy of mechanical ventilation is recognized as the only supportive therapy that effectively improves survival while other ventilatory strategies including high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, prone positioning and a conservative fluid strategy cannot effectively reduce mortality [9] . According J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 to the various physiological and pathological disorders caused by ALI/ARDS, pharmacological therapy can be classified as anti-inflammatory and physiological therapy [10] . Physiologybased pharmacological therapies are performed using drugs affecting ventilation, diffusion or perfusion. It is well known that ALI/ARDS is an inflammatory pulmonary condition, therefore, anti-inflammatory therapies including pharmaconutrients, anti-oxidants, protease inhibitors, complement inhibitors, matrix metalloprotease modification, antiproteases, ketoconazole, ibuprofen and corticosteroids are widely researched [11] . Currently, cell-based therapy including stem cells, growth factors and colony-stimulating factor also attract researchers' attention for ALI/ARDS treatment [12] . Despite numerous studied interventions, there are no effective pharmacological therapies for treating ALI/ARDS to substantially reduce mortality and improve the patients' quality of life [13, 14] . In addition, given the high morbidity and mortality, there is tremendous pressure to find new effective drugs for management of ALI/ARDS. In recent years, natural products have been investigated to treat ALI/ARDS in regard to various activities. A variety of natural products that possess multiple antiinflammatory activity and lung protective effect, such as flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids have been proposed for treatment of ALI based on in vivo and in vitro research results. Additionally, no studies have comprehensively summarized the natural products able to treat ALI. Therefore, this paper critically reviewed the relevant data in PubMed databases, CNKI databases and Web of Science from 1994 to 2020 (up to May). The search terms included ALI and compound. Taken together, this paper reviewed the natural compounds in the available literature regarding their protective effects against ALI and the underling mechanisms. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 Acute lung injury is a kind of lung disease characterized by pulmonary edema induced by dysregulated inflammation and alveolar/capillary barrier destruction [15]. The American European Consensus Conference (AECC) in 1994 proposed that arterial hypoxemia with PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 and <200 mmHg could be defined as ALI and ARDS, respectively [16]. In the 2012 Berlin Conference, ARDS was divided into three categories according to PaO2/FiO2: mild (200-300 mmHg), moderate (100-200 mmHg) and severe (<100 mmHg) [15]. Currently, it is thought that the Berlin definition of ALI/ARDS provides greater predictive validity for mortality than that of AECC [13]. According to previous studies, the risk factors of ALI/ARDS can be divided into direct and indirect factors. Direct factors are mainly sever pulmonary infection, near drowning, lung contusion and pulmonary embolism, which cause serious alveolar lesions. The indirect factors mainly include sepsis, massive transfusion, trauma, pancreatitis, fat embolism and drug overdose, which firstly trigger an uncontrolled systemic inflammation and then eventually cause vascular endothelial injury and multiple inflammatory cell infiltration with lighter alveolar lesions [17, 18]. These risk factors can induce dysregulated inflammatory response, excessive accumulation and activation of leukocytes and platelets as well as increased permeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers [19, 20], which still remain pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying ALI/ARDS. Inflammatory response is the physiological response of the body to various pathological damages and stimuli. It is widely believed that uncontrolled inflammation of the lungs or the whole body is the main pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS [21]. During the process, cells including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), macrophages, vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and alveolar epithelial cells are involved. The PMN, VEC, macrophages and platelets can be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the induction of inflammatory cytokines, COX-2, iNOS and VCAM-1, resulting in up-regulated inflammatory response. Numerous studies have revealed that blocking MAPK activity may be a treatment for ALI/ARDS [33, 34]. Oxidative stress also plays an important role in the development of ALI/ARDS. When the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 body is stimulated by the risk factors of ALI/ARDS, excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) including free radicals such as superoxide anion radicals (O2· − ), hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and non-free radical species such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen ( 1 O2) are produced [35, 36]. Normally, cells express various proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), NAD(P)H, quinone-1 (NQO1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) that scavenge ROS [37, 38]. Excess ROS beyond the scavenging capacity of anti-oxidants causes the unsaturation of fatty acids in the cell membranes, reduces membrane fluidity and increases membrane permeability, leading to lung edema and lung dilatation. The ROS also damage the alveolar and pulmonary VEC, injure microvascular barriers and aggravate lung edema [39, 40]. A key transcription factor, Nrf2, regulates the products of the anti-oxidant proteins scavenging ROS [41]. Primarily, Nrf2 is bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) in cytoplasm and remains inactive, when activated, Nrf2 is phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus and binds to ARE, resulting in the increased expression of anti-oxidant genes for SOD, GCLC, NQO1, CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1 [42, 43]. Additionally, Nrf2 can also regulate NLRP3 inflammasome, MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways to prevent inflammation and oxidative stress [44]. Therefore, Nrf2 is an important target for the treatment of ALI/ARDS [43]. It is widely believed that cell apoptosis and autophagy are also involved in the occurrence and development of ALI/ARDS induced by diverse stimuli. The role of apoptosis and autophagy in ALI/ARDS can be protective or harmful, according to the conditions. In LPSstimulated lung neutrophilic cells, autophagy activation significantly inhibits inflammation through the CaMKIα-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-ATG7 signaling pathway [45]. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f involved. Among these channels or transporters, ENaCs, Na + /K + -ATPase and K + channels are essential for the transepithelial Na + transport system while CFTR might be the chloride channel in this process [52] . Aquaporins which are found to have four different family members (AQP1, AQP3, AQP4 and AQP5) are expressed in lung tissue. AQP1 is the predominant form for microvascular endothelial water permeability, while AQP5 is the main transcellular pathway across the alveolar epithelium due to its' location in the apical surface of alveolar type I cells, the site where most of the alveolar edema fluid is cleared [53, 54] . Alveolar permeability is critical for AFC, and the ROS and pro-inflammatory factors can disrupt the alveolar-capillary barrier and subsequently reduce AFC. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and TGF-β1, can also down-regulate AFC through decreasing the expression of alveolar ion channels, which are key regulators of AFC [55] . Thus, increased AFC may protect against ALI/ARDS. Nowadays, various drugs with anti-ALI effects, such as dexamethasone (DEX), prednisolone, prednisone and ulinastatin, are widely used to clinically treat ALI. However, these drugs can induce various undesirable side reactions, including coagulation dysfunction, gastric ulcers and osteoporosis, which greatly limit their application [56] . Therefore, it is in great demand to discover new agents for ALI with fewer toxicity and adverse effects. In this review, the natural compounds proven to possess potential benefits in ALI treatment are summarized and categorized according to their chemical structures. Their action against ALI and the underlying mechanisms are further presented and discussed. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 Flavonoids are widely distributed in nature and are ubiquitous in vegetables, fruits and many plants. Chemically, flavonoids possess the basic structure of a chromone (1,4benzopyrone) moiety connected to a phenyl ring at position 2. Numerous flavonoids have been found to attenuate inflammatory responses through down-regulating the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the MAPK signaling pathway [57-61], as well as prevent oxidative stress through activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [62, 63]. Due to these activities, flavonoids can prevent ALI, ulcerative colitis, osteoporosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Alzheimer's disease and other diseases [64]. However, flavonoids have low bioavailability after oral administration, which limits their application and efficacy in the body. Therefore, new preparations of flavonoids have been investigated to improve their bioavailability in clinical application. Recently, the anti-lung injury effects of some kinds of flavonoids have been reported. Luteolin 1, a natural flavonoid compound existed in Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, has been proven to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tumor activities. Luteolin can prevent lung fibrosis and airway mucus overproduction [65, 66]. According to Chen, 10 mg/kg luteolin was generally more effective in suppressing lung inflammation and fibrosis than 5 mg/kg prednisolone in bleomycin-instilled mice [65]. Further study revealed that luteolin might be a potential agent for ALI treatment [67, 68]. Interestingly, luteolin obviously attenuated lung edema and lung histopathologic changes in ALI murine model induced by LPS or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Of note, luteolin significantly down-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2), suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA) expression as well as promoted the anti-oxidases SOD, CAT and glutathione (GSH) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 [68]. Additionally, luteolin also decreased ICAM-1 and high mobility group protein (HMGB1) expression, which can trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In terms of mechanism, luteolin could prevent lung injury involving induction of HO-1 and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 to alleviate oxidative stress [69, 70] . What's more, luteolin also inhibited the PI3K/Aktmediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathway to alleviate inflammatory responses [67, 71, 72]. MiR-132 which can subsequently activate the NF-κB signaling pathway was also involved in the protective effects of luteolin on ALI/ARDS. Interestingly, luteolin obviously decreased the expression of MiR-132 to inhibit the activation of NF-κB [73]. Baicalein 2 is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory effects extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. Baicalein as a direct and selective MD2 inhibitor can ameliorate lung injury induced by LPS or I/R via modulating oxidative stress and inflammation [74, 75]. It was confirmed that baicalein could alleviate lung edema, histopathologic changes and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity after 10 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection. Additionally, baicalein could reduce inflammatory responses via suppressing expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, ICAM-1, IL-12 and MCP-1. The underlying mechanisms may include inhibition of the TLR4-MD2-mediated MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways [75], upregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway [76], and suppression of Bax/Bcl-2-mediated apoptosis [74]. Baicalin 3, also one of the principal constituents extracted from Chinese medicinal plant Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, can alleviate lung impairment as shown by attenuated MPO activity, lung edema and lung histopathologic changes in ALI models induced by various stimuli such as LPS, burn, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Influenza A virus (IAV), SiO2, air J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Quercetin 8, a natural flavonol in many plants, also protected against ALI induced by LPS, cigarette smoke, I/R, radiation, manganese, acid aspiration, paraquat, bleomycin, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or CLP [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] , as shown by improved animal survival, lung edema and lung histological changes. The protective effects of quercetin on lungs in various ALI animal models suggest that quercetin is a potential candidate for ALI treatment. Of note, the effects of quercetin were associated with its inhibitory effects on inflammatory condition and oxidative stress. In terms of mechanism, the effects of quercetin were associated with down-regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway [114] as well as up-regulating the cAMP-Epac [115] and HO-1 pathways [116, 117] . Interestingly, quercetin also suppressed hypoxia-induced A549 survival and proliferation, which was mediated by ferrous accumulation through the AMPK/HO-1 axis, indicating that quercetin may be useful for tumor treatment [107] . In addition, quercetin also inhibited the activity of pneumolysin, suggesting that this compound might be a novel drug candidate for the treatment of pneumococcal infections [118] . Rutin 9 is a flavonoid compound widely distributed in nature. Rutin was found to inhibit histopathological change, neutrophil infiltration and MPO activity in LPS-induced ALI mice. These effects of rutin were associated with its anti-inflammatory effects via suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2, MMP9 and MIP2) and anti-oxidant activity via up-regulating anti-oxidative enzymes SOD, CAT and GSH-Px. Moreover, rutin also prevented VCAM-1 and MDA expression. In terms of mechanism, rutin might exert lung protective effects through inhibiting Akt phosphorylation and the MAPK-NF-κB signaling pathway [119] [120] [121] [122] . Kaempferol 10, a natural flavonoid extracted from the leaf of Ilex cornuta Lindl. ex Paxt., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f IL-6) were slightly weaker than those of 1 mg/kg DEX; the 1 mg/kg DEX also had stronger inhibitory effects on phosphorylation of ERK and NF-κBp65 [131] . Isorhamnetin prevented the Staphylococcus aureus-induced cell injury associated with down-regulating transcription of the Hla-encoding gene hla and RNAIII [132] . Mangiferin 13 is a natural glucosyl xanthone isolated from Belamcanda chinensis (Linn.) Redouté. Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, mangiferin attenuated animal mortality, lung lethality and pathological injury in several ALI murine models induced by CLP, LPS, arsenic or bleomycin. In addition, mangiferin obviously prevented lung inflammation via inhibiting proinflammatory mediators and enzyme production (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, COX-2, iNOS, PGE2 and NO), inhibited oxidative stress via promoting antioxidant enzyme levels (SOD, GSH and CAT) and attenuated apoptosis via regulating Bax/Bcl-2, Caspase 9 and Caspase 8. Concerning the underlying mechanism, this compound obviously suppressed MAPK and NF-κB signaling and up-regulated the Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway [133] [134] [135] [136] . Additionally, these protective effects of mangiferin were also associated with Hspa5 and Ywhae, which could subsequently down-regulate the MAPK signaling pathway. Interestingly, 30 mg/kg mangiferin gave slightly stronger lung protection than 1 mg/kg DEX in LPS-induced ALI mice [133] . Isovitexin 14, a glycosylflavonoid isolated from hulls of rice (Oryza sativa), possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. This compound at 25 μg/mL significantly prevented LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 in RAW264.7 cells. In LPS-induced ALI mice, 100 mg/kg isovitexin significantly prevented lung histological change and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, isovitexin significantly J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f MAPK signaling pathways [163, 164] . Compared with 2 mg/kg DEX, the inhibitory effect of 30 mg/kg hesperitin on SOD expression was comparable but the inhibitory effects on lung edema, lung inflammatory condition and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, and NO) were weaker [165] . Nobiletin 27, an important polymethoxyflavone widely found in citrus fruits, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activities. Nobiletin dramatically attenuated lung histopathological changes, lung edema, MPO activity and inflammatory cells infiltration in mice with LPS-induced ALI. In addition, nobiletin dose-dependently inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and NO) in BALF of ALI mice and in LPSstimulated A549 cells, and these effects of nobiletin were correlated with blockade of the NF-κB pathway. However, the anti-inflammatory and lung protective effects of 10 mg/kg nobiletin were weaker than those of 5 mg/kg DEX, and protective effects of 20 mg/kg nobiletin were comparable with 5 mg/kg DEX [166] . Dihydromyricetin (DHM) 28 is a flavonoid extracted from the spines of Gleditsia sinensis Lam. It was reported that DHM ameliorated lung pathological changes and lung edema in ALI mice challenged by LPS or CLP, which was associated with its inhibition of secretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and IL-18. The responsible mechanism involved DHM activating PPAR-expression as well as blocking the MAPK signaling pathway [167] and NLRP3 inflammasome [168] . Moreover, DHM had similar effects to 5 mg/kg DEX. However, DEX inhibited Smad4 expression but DHM had no effect [167] . Fisetin 29 is a natural flavonoid commonly found in plants and various types of fruits, such as apples, grapes and strawberries. Fisetin effectively reduced inflammatory cytokine J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 25 release (TNF-α and IL-6), neutrophils and macrophage infiltration as well as MPO activity in lung tissues of mice with LPS-induced ALI. The underlying mechanism was associated with suppression of TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathways [169] . Eriodictyol 30, a natural flavonoid widely distributed in various fruits and vegetables, could improve survival rate, attenuate lung histopathologic changes, increase SOD levels and decrease inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2 and MIP-2) expression, MDA expression and MPO activity in LPS-induced ALI mice. These protective effects were related to activation of the Nrf2 pathway and inhibition of the COX-2/NLRP3/NF-κB signaling pathway [170, 171] . Sakuranetin 31, a flavanone found in the leaves of Baccharis retusa DC., was reported to inhibit the reduction of lung compliance and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL1-β, iNOS, ARG1, MMP9 and TIMP-1) in mice with LPS-induced ALI. The NF-κB pathway was involved in the process [172] . 2′O-galloylhyperin 32 is a natural flavonol glycoside isolated from Pyrola calliantha H. Andr. This compound dose-dependently prevents LPS-induced lung damage with blunting inflammation and oxidative stress, which was induced by suppressing inflammatory mediator expressions (TNF-α, IL-6, KC and MIP-2), MDA activity and activities of anti-oxidant enzymes SOD and GSH. However, 50 mg/kg 2′O-galloylhyperin had weaker anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities than 5 mg/kg DEX. Also, the protective effects of 2′O-galloylhyperin and DEX were associated with up-regulating the AMPK and Nrf2 signaling pathways as well as suppressing the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways [173] . Troxerutin 33, a natural flavonoid derivative of rutin, occurs widely in grains, fruits and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more serious form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as respiratory diseases with high mortality rates, are manifested by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, increased alveolar permeability and severe alveolar edema with normal cardiac filling pressures [1] . Despite advances in treatment methods, the morbidity and mortality of ALI and ARDS remains high. In the United States, for ALI and ARDS, the incidence for patients >15 years is 78.9 and 58.7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f overall mortality rate is still a significant 38.5% and 41.1%, respectively [2] . A study in intensive care units (ICUs) in Shanghai reported that the incidence of ARDS for patients >15 years is 2%, with a mortality rate of 70% [3] . A retrospective cohort study performed by researchers at the University of Washington reported that morbidity and mortality among 146 ,058 patients <18 years in ICUs during 2007-2016 were 1.8% and 20%, respectively [4] . A study in Thailand found that mortality and morbidity of the 1,738 patients <15 years in pediatric ICUs (PICUs) for 2013-2016 were as high as 7.4% and 51.2%, respectively [5] . Additionally, an international observational study performed in total 145 PICUs from 27 countries for 2016-activated to produce pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-9 and IL-8, inflammatory mediators such as elastin, cathepsins, collagenases and gelatinases, cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory transmitters, which conversely cause damage to the cells above and to alveolar epithelial cells. Then, the alveolar endothelial cells are damaged, resulting in the increased permeability of microvascular barriers, which is associated with the extravascular accumulation of protein-rich edema fluid as well as the transfer of leukocytes, erythrocytes and inflammasome-regulated cytokines into the alveolar space [22] [23] [24] . During the inflammatory process of ALI/ARDS, several signal transduction pathways such as nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), toll like receptors (TLRs), adrenergic receptors and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are involved [25] [26] [27] . Inhibition of NF-κB expression can inhibit the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, significantly reduce the inflammatory response in the lungs and improve the survival rate of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice [28] . In addition, the ablation of proteins such as NAMPT, Rip2 and Pfkfb3, which could activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, were found to prevent lung injury and inflammatory response in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R), LPS or cigarette smoke-induced ALI mice [29] [30] [31] [32] . The MAPK (JNK, ERK and p38) is an important signaling pathway regulating inflammatory responses. The activation of MAPK can promote In LPS-challenged alveolar epithelial cells, autophagy activation or AMPK stimulation remarkably ameliorate LPS-induced airway inflammation [46] . In addition, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine treatment significantly improves the permeability of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) stimulated by LPS as well as attenuating LPS-lung injury in mice [47] . Therefore, the effects of autophagy in ALI/ARDS depends on cell type. Similarly, the effects of apoptosis in ALI/ARDS also depend on condition. In ALI/ARDS patients, the apoptosis and autophagy of PMNs are decreased, which can be confirmed by fewer apoptotic PMNs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). This phenomenon is partly induced by anti-apoptotic factors, like granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor, which can promote PMN survival through decreasing apoptosis of PMN, resulting in accumulation at the inflammation site [48, 49] . However, in ALI/ARDS patients, the apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages and VEC is enhanced, leading to disturbed microvascular integrity, increased microvascular permeability and release of proinflammatory cytokines [50] . Therefore, apoptosis and autophagy also play important roles in ALI/ARDS development. Hypoxemia and pulmonary bilateral infiltrate are the clinical characteristic of ALI/ARDS, therefore, it is important to effectively clear the edema fluid in the alveoli to guarantee effective gas exchange for patients with ALI/ARDS to survive. Therefore, alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) is an important factor for the treatment of ALI/ARDS, and those patients with maximal AFC have lower mortality [51] . During the AFC process, the alveolar epithelium plays a primary role with epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs), Na + /K + -ATPase, aquaporin (AQP), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), K + channels and other channels also actively J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f embolism, paraquat, cigarette smoke or pancreatitis [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . Baicalin could alleviate pulmonary inflammation through down-regulating expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-23 and MMP9 [77] . Additionally, baicalin suppressed lung oxidative injury through decreasing MDA as well as retaining SOD and CAT [81] . In terms of mechanism, the NLRP3 inflammasome and TLRs/NF-κB signaling pathways were down-regulated by baicalin but the Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway was up-regulated [77, 81] . Interestingly, baicalin was proven to be a promising anti-mycobacterial and anti-inflammatory agent through inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signal pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as upregulating LC3II expression in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis [86] . Studies showed that baicalin was more effective than DEX. Baicalin at 50 mg/kg significantly improved pulmonary function, inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine expression (TNF-a, IL-6 and MMP9), whereas 1 mg/kg DEX failed to significantly improve any of these [85, 87] . Tanshinone IIA 4 is the major active compound isolated from Salvia miltiorrhizae Bunge. Tanshinone IIA has various activities including cardioprotective, anti-atherosclerotic, anticancer, anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities. Moreover, tanshinone IIA increased the survival rate as well as attenuated lung histopathologic changes and lung edema in animals with ALI induced by LPS, paraquat, seawater, bleomycin, pancreatitis or aspiration [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] . Interestingly, tanshinone IIA exerted inhibitory effects on lung inflammatory condition via inhibition of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6. In addition, oxidative stress was attenuated by tanshinone IIA via its suppression of ROS, MDA5 and IRE-a. In regard to mechanism, tanshinone IIA prevented ALI through suppressing TRPM7 expression [93] , ACE2 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and Ang-(1-7) expression [92] , PLA2 activity [90] , the HIF-1α pathway [94] and the Sirt1/NF-κB signaling pathway [95] . Additionally, tanshinone IIA could prevent oxidative stress through up-regulating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [88] . Apoptosis, an important role in ALI, was also suppressed by tanshinone IIA through up-regulating Bcl-2 and down-regulating Bax and Caspase-3, which were partly mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway [91] . At the same time, tanshinone IIA also inhibited lung edema and lung damage via inhibition of AQP1 and AQP5 over-expression [96] . Salvia miltiorrhizae Bunge, has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, visceral protective and other properties [97] . At the same time, the increased MPO activity, pulmonary fibrosis, lung edema and lung histopathologic changes in animals with ALI induced by LPS, radiation or I/R were prominently suppressed by cryptotanshinone, which demonstrated the protective role of cryptotanshinone in ALI model [98] [99] [100] . In addition, cryptotanshinone exerted anti-inflammatory activity via down-regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and COX-2), which might be due to its ability to inhibit the TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway [98] . Interestingly, expressions of the pro-fibrotic signals TGF-1 and NOX-4 were down-regulated but the anti-fibrotic enzyme MMP-1 was promoted by cryptotanshinone, indicating that cryptotanshinone could prevent pulmonary fibrosis [99] . Tang also found that 40 mg/kg cryptotanshinone had protective effects on LPSinduced lung inflammation and lung histopathological changes, comparable to the effects of 1 mg/kg DEX (1 mg/kg) [98] . Tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium 6, a water-soluble derivative of tanshinone IIA, was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f found to inhibit seawater aspiration-induced ALI through up-regulating Na + /K + -ATPase activity in mice and alveolar type II cells, which was partly mediated by the ERK1/2 signaling pathway [101] . Additionally, tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium exerted protective effects against LPS or cigarette smoke-induced lung injury evidenced by attenuated lung edema, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, improved lung function and ameliorated expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These effects of tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium were mediated by suppressing ERK1/2 and NF-κB activation [102, 103] . Moreover, these protective effects of 10 mg/kg tanshinone IIA sulfonate sodium were comparable to those of 1 mg/kg DEX [102] . Hyperoside 7 is a natural flavonoid found in Leonurus artemisia (Lour.) S. Y. Hu. The flavonoids of Polygonum hydropiper L. mainly contain rutin, quercetin, hyperoside and quercitrin, which have been found to inhibit LPS-induced ALI through suppressing MAPK signaling pathway [104] . Flavonoids from Houttuynia cordata containing 8.8% rutin, 26 .7% hyperoside and 31.7% quercitrin have been found to alleviate H1N1-induced ALI in mice, which was related to anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects through suppressing influenzal NA activity and TLR signaling [105] . Of note, hyperoside improved animal survival as well as reduced histological changes and lung edema in ALI murine model induced by LPS or hypoxia. What's more, inflammatory cell infiltration, MPO activity and expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were inhibited by hyperoside, and these effects were mediated by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway [106] . Interestingly, hyperoside also inhibited hypoxia-induced survival and proliferation of A549 cells, which were induced by regulation of the AMPK/HO-1 axis [107] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f showed inhibitory effects on inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. At 100 mg/kg, kaempferol exhibited inhibitory effects on lung pathological changes and lung edema in mice with LPS-induced ALI, which was likely induced by regulating the polyubiquitination of TRAF6 as well as inhibiting the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways [123, 124] . Another study found that kaempferol also inhibited H9N2 virus-induced ALI through inhibiting TLR4/MyD88-mediated NF-κB and MAPKs pathways [125] . What's more, in an ALI murine model induced by CLP, kaempferol exhibited inhibitory effects via suppression of ICAM-1 pathways [126] . Astragalin 11, a flavonoid widely found in many traditional herbs and medicinal plants, can prevent LPS-induced ALI in mice via its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Astragalin significantly improved lung pathological changes, lung edema and animal survival. During the process, astragalin significantly reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and MMP9. Astragalin obviously down-regulated the NF-κB signaling pathway [127] and activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway [128] . Isorhamnetin 12 is an abundant flavonol aglycone extracted from Hippophae rhamnoides L. This compound has shown anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in previous studies. Due to these activities, isorhamnetin significantly attenuated lung pathological damage, lung edema and MPO activity in mice. Additionally, isorhamnetin obviously inhibited inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2) and MDA level as well as increased SOD level in vivo and in vitro. In terms of underlying mechanism, isorhamnetin significantly blocked the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways [129] [130] [131] . The lung protective effects of 60 mg/kg isorhamnetin on lung injury and inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1β and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhibited inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 and MDA and ROS levels, as well as up-regulated SOD and GSH activities. Moreover, isovitexin suppressed ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. Regarding mechanism, these protective effects of isovitexin were associated with inhibition of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways and activation of the HO-1/Nrf2 pathway [137] . Wogonin 15, a natural flavonoid extracted from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, prevented lung injury in ALI murine model by suppressing production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6, iNOS, COX-2 and MIP-2. In terms of mechanism, wogonin blocked Akt and RhoA activation, reduced p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation, as well as suppressed the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-involved NF-κB signaling pathway [138] [139] [140] . Of note, 10 mg/kg wogonin exhibited inhibitory effects on lung edema as well as expression of iNOS and COX-2 comparable to that of 1 mg/kg DEX in an LPS-induced ALI murine model [139] . Georgi. This compound at 20 mg/kg significantly prevented LPS-or I/R-induced lung injury. The inhibitory effects were induced by its suppression of MPO, MDA, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2 as well as up-regulation of GSH and SOD. Scutellarin exerted these protective effects by blocking the NF-κB [141] and Bax/Bcl-2 signaling pathways [142] . Tectorigenin 17 is a natural isofavone isolated from Belamcanda chinensis (L.) Redouté (Iridaceae). At 10 mg/kg, this compound significantly attenuated lung edema, improved lung pathological inflammation and prevented release of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, which might be associated with NF-κB p65 activity. However, compared with 2 mg/kg J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f DEX, tectorigenin had a slightly weaker effect on ameliorating inflammatory responses [143] . Glycitin 18 is an active constituent extracted from Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., which is a traditional medicine for moistening lungs and suppressing coughs. It is reported that glycitin significantly alleviated histopathological changes, MPO activity and expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in mice with LPS-induced ALI. Additionally, glycitin inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in RAW264.7 cells stimulated by LPS. Moreover, the lung protective and anti-inflammatory effects of 20 mg/kg glycitin were slightly weaker than of 5 mg/kg DEX. The inhibition by glycitin and DEX might be associated with suppressing the TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways [144] . Rhamnazin 19 as a natural flavonoid known for the ability of antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities was reported to inhibit lung histopathology change, MPO activity, lung edema and LDH activity in LPS-induced ALI rats. In addition, rhamnazin also lowers inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and MDA and H2O2 levels. Rhamnazin exerted these protective effects through activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway [145] . Isoliquiritigenin 20 alleviated LPS-induced ALI in mice via its inhibition of oxidative damage and inflammatory injury. During the process, isoliquiritigenin suppressed MDA levels and production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2 and iNOS. Isoliquiritigenin also up-regulated SOD and GSH activities. The underlying mechanism might involve the activation of AMPK/Nrf2/ARE and PPARγ signaling as well as inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome [146, 147] . activity and the expression of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18 as well as improved SOD activity in LPS-induced ALI mice, which were due to the blunting of the lung NLRP3 inflammasome. However, protective effects of 40 mg/kg morin were weaker than of 2 mg/kg DEX [148] . Formononetin 22 is a major constituent of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge. This compound at 20 mg/kg significantly exerted protective effects against ALI by markedly attenuating lung histopathologic changes, lung edema, MPO activity and inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α and IL-6) as well as increasing SOD activity. This may be associated with up-regulating PPAR-γ gene expression but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Compared with 2 mg/kg DEX, 20 mg/kg formononetin had weaker lung protective effects [149] . Naringenin 23 is a naturally occurring plant bioflavonoid mainly found in the fruits of citrus paradise, oranges and other citrus species. Naringenin significantly increased the survival rate, alleviated lung injury, suppressed inflammatory mediator expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and MIP-2) and down-regulated ROS and MDA levels in ALI mice induced by LPS through blocking the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [150, 151] . Naringin 24, a well-known flavanone glycoside found in grapefruit and other citrus fruits, is an effective anti-inflammatory compound. Naringin exerted protective effects in ALI models induced by LPS or paraquat and improved survival rates and reduced lung injury and lung fibrosis [152, 153] . Naringin at 100 μM obviously prevented production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-1α [154] . The effects of naringin on ALI were due to its inhibition of inflammatory responses via suppressing inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f α, TGF-β1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1) and oxidative stress via promoting SOD, GSH-Px and HO-1 expression, which was induced by blocking the NF-κB pathway [152] . Also, naringin exhibited mucoactive effects with reduction of goblet cell hyperplasia, inhibition of mucus hypersecretion and promotion of sputum excretion [155] . Moreover, 36.8 mg/kg naringin had stronger effects than 2.4 mg/kg prednisone in inhibiting lung inflammatory condition in cigarette smokeinduced ALI mice [156] . The protective effects of 60 mg/kg naringin and 5 mg/kg DEX were comparable [152] . Hesperidin 25, a flavanone glycoside found in sweet oranges and lemons, has antiinflammatory properties. This compound could prevent lung injury and lung inflammatory condition induced by LPS, H1N1, CLP or I/R [157] [158] [159] [160] . Hesperidin obviously inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, Inos, HMGB1, IL-12 and MCP-1) in ALI mice, A549 cells and THP-1 cells stimulated by LPS through downregulating the NF-κB and MAPKs signaling pathways [158, 161] . What's more, hesperidin suppressed the Hsp70/TLR4/MyD88 signaling pathway in CLP-induced lung injury mice [157] . Hesperitin 26, a major bioflavonoid occurring in sweet oranges and lemons, has been reported to have anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities. Hesperitin could attenuate lung edema and lung inflammatory condition in ventilator, acrolein or LPS-induced ALI murine model. During the process, hesperitin obviously suppressed chemokines expression (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS and MIP-2) and MDA activity, on the other hand, but also up-regulated SOD and GSH activities [162, 163] . In terms of the underlying mechanism, hesperitin markedly activated PPAR-γ, blocking MD2/TLR4 complex formation and suppressed the NF-κB and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f vegetables. Troxerutin (150 mg/kg) effectively improved alveolar wall thickening, lung edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in a mouse model with LPS-induced ALI. Troxerutin also increased the expression of IL-10. These effects of troxerutin were comparable with those of 5 mg/kg DEX. Network pharmacology analysis and in vivo experiments showed that troxerutin markedly prevented the MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathway [174] . Engeletin 34 is a flavanonol glycoside isolated from the radix of Smilax china L. Engeletin effectively attenuated lung histopathological changes, lung edema and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, engeletin suppressed inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) via inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway, possibly due to its ability to activate PPAR-γ. Moreover, the protective effects of 100 mg/kg engeletin treatment 1 h before LPS were better than when applied 1 h after LPS [175] . anti-inflammatory mechanism of silibinin was associated with its inhibition of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome [176, 177] .  Alkaloids are an important class of alkaline nitrogenous organic compounds, and have been reported to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-bacterial activities [185] [186] [187] . Most alkaloids are water-insoluble or hardly water-soluble. However, some alkaloids have toxic effects on heart, liver, spleen and other organs [188] [189] [190] . Therefore, we should also pay attention not only to the protective effects but also the toxicity of alkaloids. The alkaloids reported to have anti-lung injury activity are summarized below. Berberine 40 is a natural alkaloid isolated from Corydalis yanhusuo W. T. Wang plants, which have various activities including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-bacterial effects. Berberine is a well-known anti-bacterial agent; however, it also effectively alleviated lung injury by reducing lung edema, lung inflammatory condition and neutrophil infiltration in mice with ALI stimulated by LPS or cigarette smoke. During the process, expression of proinflammatory cytokines or mediators (TNF-α, IL-6, IL8, KC, MIP-2, cPLA-2 and MCP-1) was down-regulated. Of note, the PERK-mediated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis was up-regulated [191, 192] and the NF-κB signaling pathway was down-regulated [193] . However, compared with effects of 5 mg/kg DEX, the protective effects of berberine against lung injury, lung edema, MPO activity, inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediator expression (IL-6 and KC) were significantly weaker, possibly induced by the stronger activation of DEX on the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway [192] . Also, 30 mg/kg cavidine and 5 mg/kg DEX had comparable protective effects [195] . Corynoline 43, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Corydalis bungeana Turcz, markedly improved histopathological changes, lung edema, MPO activity and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Protective effects of 60 mg/kg corynoline were comparable with 5 mg/kg DEX. The mechanism of the effects of corynoline was related to up-regulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which subsequently inhibited NF-κB activation [196] . Ukrain 44 is an active alkaloid extracted from Chelidonium majus L. This compound was reported to markedly inhibit lung damage and histopathological changes in mice with ALI induced by I/R, which were associated with increasing total anti-oxidant status, as well as decreasing total oxidant status and oxidative stress index levels [197] . L. At 20 mg/kg, tetrahydhydrocoptisine dramatically ameliorated lung pathological changes, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decreased the mortality rate and lung edema, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration and MPO activity, as well as reduced TNF-α and IL-6 production in mouse ALI model induced by LPS. However, these protective effects of 20 mg/kg tetrahydhydrocoptisine were slightly weaker than of 5 mg/kg DEX. Additionally, the effects of tetrahydhydrocoptisine were due to its inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway [198] . Of note, the protective effects of protostemonine were related to inactivation of the MAPK and Akt signaling pathways [199, 200] . in vitro showed that bergenin could significantly ameliorate histological changes and pulmonary edema as well as reduce MPO activity, inflammatory cell infiltration and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) in mice with LPS-induced ALI. These protective effects of bergenin were comparable to those of 5 mg/kg DEX. Bergenin exerted these protective effects both in vitro and in vivo through suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway [201] . Betanin 48, a natural compound isolated from Portulaca oleracea L. dose-dependently J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f attenuated lung injury via its inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNFα and IL-1β) and NF-κB activity in ALI rats induced by paraquat. In addition, betanin also protected the barrier function of the alveolar epithelium, demonstrated by increased expression of ZO-1 and claudin-4 [202] . Cordycepin 49, a natural compound derived from Cordyceps militaris (L.ex Fr.) Link., was found to decrease the lung edema, MPO activity, MDA content, and inflammatory cytokines production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS and NO) in ALI mice induced by LPS. In terms of the underlying mechanism, cordycepin dramatically up-regulated the Nrf2 signaling pathway and down-regulated the NF-κB signaling pathways [203, 204] .  Terpenoids, a class of compounds commonly found in plants, possess various activities. Most terpenoids can prevent inflammation, and the process involves the NF-κB and MAPK J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f signaling pathways [207] [208] [209] . In addition to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, terpenoids also possess anti-tumor activity through promoting apoptosis via regulating the NF-κB, Akt, Bax/bcl-2 and P53 signaling pathways. What's more, terpenoids also have antidiabetic, liver protective, neuroprotective and anti-lung injury activities [210, 211] . Pogostone 52 is a natural sesquiterpene isolated from Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth. It remarkably improved survival rate, attenuated lung histological alterations, decreased lung edema, reduced MPO and MDA levels as well as down-regulated the levels of proinflammatory mediators (TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6) in mice with ALI induced by LPS via the regulation of KEAP1-Nrf2/NF-κB signaling pathways [212] . Furthermore, pogostone can also attenuate cell injury in A549 cells induced by TNF-a through regulating the balance between the Nrf2 and NF-κB p65 signaling pathways. In addition, the protective effects of 20 mg/kg pogostone were comparable with those of 5 mg/kg DEX [213] Patchouli alcohol 53, also a natural sesquiterpene isolated from Pogostemon cablin (Blanco) Benth., inhibited ALI induced by LPS in mice via its inhibitory effects on inflammatory responses and oxidative stress. Patchouli alcohol significantly inhibited proinflammatory mediators (TNF-a, IL-1β and IL-6), suppressed MDA activity as well as increased activities of anti-oxidant enzymes SOD and GSH-Px. These protective effects of 40 mg/kg patchouli alcohol were comparable to those of 5 mg/kg DEX. In terms of the mechanism, the NF-κB signaling pathway was involved [214, 215] . Eucalyptol 54 is a natural compound isolated from Zingiber officinale Rosc., which can be used as medicine and food. Previous studies demonstrated that 30 mg/kg eucalyptol significantly prevented lung histological and pulmonary inflammation induced by LPS in the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f ALI murine model, associated with inhibition of the NF-κB pathway [216, 217] . Additionally, eucalyptol obviously mitigated lung damage caused by cigarette smoke through inhibiting ICAM-1 expression [218] . In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of 100 mg/kg eucalyptol and 0.5 mg/kg prednisone were comparable [216] . Moreover, the inhibitory effects of eucalyptol on TLR4 expression were significantly stronger than those of prednisone. Also, 400 mg/kg eucalyptol had a stronger inhibitory effect on inflammatory cell infiltration than 1 mg/kg DEX [217] . Zerumbone 55, a sesquiterpene found in Zingiber zerumbet Smith, has various activities. Due to inhibitory effects on inflammation and oxidative stress, zerumbone significantly inhibited lung edema, MPO activity and pro-inflammatory cytokines production (TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, MIP-2, iNOS and COX-2) as well as reversed the anti-oxidative enzymes activities (SOD, CAT and GSH) in LPS-induced ALI murine model. The protective effects of zerumbone were associated with down-regulating the MAPK [219] and Akt-NF-κB pathways [220] as well as up-regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway [221] . Limonene 56 is a natural monoterpene derivative widely found in fruits, such as lemon, orange and grape. This compound significantly inhibited lung edema, MPO activity and proinflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β) in mice with LPS-induced ALI. In regard to the underlying mechanism, these effects of limonene were associated with suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. During the process, 75 mg/kg limonene had a stronger inhibitory effect on activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway than 0.5 mg/kg DEX [222] . Thymol 57, a natural monoterpene from Thymus vulgaris L., inhibited lung J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f histopathologic lung alteration, lung edema and MPO activity in LPS-induced ALI murine model. These protective effects were associated with suppressing inflammatory responses via ameliorating pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β) as well as attenuating oxidative stress via increasing SOD activity and inhibiting MDA levels. These effects of thymol were associated with its inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway and activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway [223, 224] . P-Cymene 58 is a biological constituent of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. This compound significantly prevented lung pathological changes, lung edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, MPO activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β) in mice with LPS-induced ALI. However, the protective effects of 10 mg/kg p-cymene were weaker than of 5 mg/kg DEX, possibly due to the stronger inhibitory effects of DEX on the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [225, 226] Linalool 59, a natural component of essential oils in aromatic plants, is widely used to make shampoos, detergents and soaps. Linalool effectively prevented lung pathological changes and inflammatory cell infiltration in LPS-induced ALI mice. Additionally, this compound also dramatically suppressed inflammatory cytokine production (TNFα and IL-6) in LPS-stimulated mice and RAW264.7 cells. However, these effects of 25 mg/kg linalool were much weaker than those of 5 mg/kg DEX. In addition, during the process, linalool dramatically blocked the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [227] . 3-Dehydroandrographolide 61, a natural andrographolide product, was demonstrated to decrease LPS-induced ALI in mice, associated with inactivation of the NF-κB/Akt signaling pathway. However, these protective effects were attenuated by α7nAchR siRNA or methyllycaconitine, demonstrating that 3-dehydroandrographolide protected against ALI through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway [230] . Decne. Costunolide significantly suppressed lung edema, MPO activity and inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS and KC) in mice induced by lipoteichoic acid or heatkilled Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA) [231] . Additionally, costunolide dose-dependently reduced inflammatory cytokine expression in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages stimulated by lipoteichoic acid or HKSA. These effects of costunolide were related to inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway [232] . Dehydrocostus lactone 63, also a sesquiterpene extracted from the radix of Aucklandia lappa Decne., exerted protective effects against ALI via anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that dehydrocostus lactone effectively attenuated LPS-induced pathological injury and reduced pro-inflammatory mediator expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, iNOS, NO and IL-12) in lung and macrophages through suppressing the p38 MAPK/MK2 and Akt-mediated NF-κB signaling pathways [233] . Ginsenoside Rg3 could attenuate histopathological alterations, lung edema and inflammatory cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) as well as promote the polarization of M2 macrophages in mice with LPS-induced ALI, which were associated with activating the MerTK-dependent PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [234] . Ginsenoside Rg3 was also found to inhibit LPS-induced ALI in mice through down-regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway [235] . However, anti-lung injury and anti-inflammatory effects of ginsenoside Rg3 were significantly weaker than of DEX, possibly because of the stronger effects of DEX on activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway [234] . Ginsenoside Rg5 65, also a natural compound isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, could prevent ALI in vivo and in vitro via its anti-inflammatory activity. Ginsenoside Rg5 significantly attenuated lung injury and lung inflammatory condition in LPS-induced ALI mice. Additionally, this compound dramatically suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and COX-2) in mice and alveolar macrophages, which were associated with preventing the binding of LPS to TLR4 and subsequently down-regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway. These protective effects of 10 mg/kg ginsenoside Rg5 were comparable to those of 5 mg/kg DEX [236] . Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11) 66, another natural compound isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, can protect against ALI via its anti-inflammatory effects. PF11 significantly prevented lung injury, lung edema and inflammatory cytokines production (TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6). Additionally, PF11 inhibited neutrophil infiltration by reducing MIP-2 and ICAM-1 expression as well as promoted neutrophil clearance through enhancing neutrophil J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f apoptosis and phagocytosis. Both 30 mg/kg PF11 and 1 mg/kg DEX could prevent lung inflammation and neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages; however, only PF11 inhibited neutrophil apoptosis, and 1 mg/kg DEX had no such effect [237] . Betulin 67 is a naturally occurring triterpene extracted from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. Betulin at 8 mg/kg could remarkably alleviate lung injury in mice induced by LPS, Escherichia coli or CLP. In addition, betulin dramatically suppressed inflammatory cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) and promoted IL-10 expression in RAW264.7 cells and ALI mice stimulated by LPS or E. coli. Betulin was also able to enhance the clearance of E. coli. All the protective effects of betulin may be associated with suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway [238, 239] . Betulinic acid 68, also a triterpene isolated from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., could inhibit ALI induced by LPS or CLP. The effects of betulinic acid were induced by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, MCP-1 and MMP9) and promoting activities of anti-oxidant enzymes SOD and GSH. In terms of the underlying mechanism, NF-κB activity was involved [240, 241] . Bigelovii A 69 is a nor-oleanane type triterpene saponin extracted from Salicornia bigelovii Torr. Bigelovii A obviously inhibited lung edema, neutrophil infiltration and lung permeability in LPS-induced ALI murine model. Additionally, this compound significantly down-regulated inflammatory mediator expressions (IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-2) in mice and MH-S cells. These effects of bigelovii A were associated with down-regulating the NF-κB and p38 MAPK/ERK1/2-C/EBPδ signaling pathways [242] . Senegenin might exert these effects through suppressing the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. These protective effects of 8 mg/kg senegenin were comparable to those of 5 mg/kg DEX [243, 244] . Echinocystic acid 71 is an important constituent of Albizia julibrissin Durazz. This compound could prevent lung injury and lung inflammation in LPS-induced ALI mice, and the protective effects of 5 mg/kg echinocystic acid and 5 mg/kg DEX were comparable. In addition, 5 μM echinocystic acid markedly prevented pro-inflammatory cytokine and mediator expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, COX2, NO and PGE2) in alveolar macrophages stimulated by LPS. All the effects of this compound were related to its inhibition of the binding of LPS to TLR4 and the subsequent NF-κB and MAPK activation [245] . Esculentoside A 72 is a natural compound in Phytolacca acinosa Roxb. This compound could prevent lung injury, lung edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and MPO activity in LPSinduced ALI mice, and its protective effects were related to inhibition of the NF-kB and MAPKs signaling pathways [246] . Additionally, esculentoside A was able to attenuate airway inflammation induced by ovalbumin , which was related to its up-regulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway [247] . Taraxasterol 73 is a pentacyclic-triterpene isolated from Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg. The treatment of taraxasterol 1 h before LPS administration or 7 h after LPS administration could attenuate lung edema, MPO activity, inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, PGE-2 and COX-2) in ALI mice. These protective effects of 10 mg/kg taraxasterol were comparable with 0.5 mg/kg DEX. The effects of taraxasterol might be related to its inhibition of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [248] . Sclareol 74 as a natural labdane-type diterpene found in Salvia Sclare L. can ameliorate lung histological alterations, lung edema, MPO activity, inflammatory cell infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2) in ALI mice. Additionally, sclareol inhibited oxidative stress through increasing SOD and GSH-Px levels. These effects of sclareol might be related to its inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK activation and up-regulation of HO-1. Of note, the anti-lung injury and anti-inflammatory effects of 10 mg/kg sclareol were comparable to those of 10 mg/kg DEX but scareol had a weaker anti-oxidant effect than DEX [249] .

Schisantherin A 154, a natural dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan extracted from the fruit of Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd. et Wils., has been reported to reduce lung histopathologic changes, lung edema, MPO activity, inflammatory cell infiltration as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in mice stimulated by LPS, which were associated with blocking the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. However, 40 mg/kg schisantherin A had slightly weaker anti-inflammatory effects than 5 mg/kg DEX [412] . and A549 cells with IC50 of 6.1 and 2.2 µM, respectively [416] . Dehydromatricarin A 158, an active compound from Artemisia argyi Lévl. et Van., markedly inhibited lung injury, inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression (TNF-α, IL-6 and iNOS) in LPS-induced ALI mice. These effects might be associated with suppressing NF-κB phosphorylation [400, 417] .  Currently, there is no effective drug in modern medicine that can effectively prevent ALI. Dexamethasone, ulinastatin, prednisone and prednisolone are used for clinical treatment of acute inflammation or allergy. Because of their favorable anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, they are commonly used for treatment of ALI. However, the use of these drugs may result in patients with more severe gastrointestinal irritation, allergic reactions and other side effects; therefore, efficacy of these drugs is still unsatisfactory [56, 419] . Many natural compounds are reported to prevent ALI in vivo and in vitro, and so might be potential drugs for ALI. Nowadays, traditional Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) that contain various natural compounds have been used to treat COVID-19 to prevent virus, inflammation and lung J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f injury. These CPMs such as Tanreqing injection (TRQI), Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQWC) and Xuebijing injection (XBJI) have good therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 treatment [420] . Baicalin, baicalein, rutin, wogonin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol and chlorogenic acid are the main ingredients of TRQI, which is approved by the National Drug Regulatory Authority of China (China SFDA, number: Z20030045) [421] . In previous studies, Xi-juan Qiao et al. found that combined use of TRQI and ribavirin granules was significantly more effective than iibavirin granules alone in treatment of viral pneumonia in children. Additionally, the combination of TRQI and ribavirin granules significantly shortened body temperature recovery time and hospitalization time as well as reduced adverse reactions compared with ribavirin granules alone [422] . Pharmacological research showed that TRQI significantly prevented airway inflammation and lung injury caused by LPS through inhibiting the MAPK/NF-κB pathway [423] . Due to these effects, TRQI is recommended in therapeutic regimens of COVID-19 in China. Rutin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, chlorogenic acid, hyperoside and emodin are the main ingredients of LHQWC, which is approved by China SFDA (Number: Z20040063) [424] . During COVID-19, LHQWC was widely and effectively used for the treatment of COVID-19, and the effect of a combination of other drugs (umifenovir, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir) plus LHQWC was superior to single or dual agents [425, 426] . Chun-juan Ye found that the combination of LHQWC and other drugs like ribavirin and cefuroxime resulted in higher total efficiency than other drugs alone (90.63% and 68.75%, respectively) [427] . Pharmacological research revealed that LHQWC could prevent LPS-induced ALI through inhibiting inflammatory responses as well as attenuate PM2.5-induced lung injury through suppressing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pulmonary oxidative lesions via up-regulating Nrf2 signaling pathway [428, 429] . Hydroxysafflor yellow A, tanshinone IIA, rutin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, chlorogenic acid, hyperoside and protocatechuic acid are important ingredients of XBJI [330] . In Qin's study, the use of XBJI could improve lung injury in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 [331] . In addition, in 2019, a randomized controlled trial was performed with 710 patients to investigate the efficacy of XBJI on severe community acquired pneumonia in China. The combination of XBJI and the routine anti-infective treatment could reduce the 28-day mortality of patients with severe pneumonia complicated with sepsis by 8.8%, shorten mechanical ventilation time by 5.5 days as well as shorten the ICU length of stay by 4 days [432] . In addition, a meta-analysis revealed that the combined treatment of XBJI and western medicine showed better efficiency than western medicine treatment alone with significantly decreasing 28-day mortality and shorting ICU stay time [433] . Pharmacological research revealed that XBJI could prevent CLP-, dichlorvos-, paraquat-or I/R-induced ALI through decreasing inflammatory responses and oxidative stress; during the process, p38 MAPK and TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathways were involved [434] [435] [436] [437] . In this review, pure compounds against ALI/ARDS from 1995-2020 were categorized by the chemical structures, and the pharmacological effects and the underlying mechanism of all the compounds were clarified. The anti-ALI effects of natural compounds were mainly attributed to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activities. Different kinds of compounds may have similar protective effects and similar targets. Interestingly, during the process, the NF-κB, MAPK and Nrf2 signaling pathways were the pathways most frequently involved. COVID-19 has resulted in demand for therapeutic agents to ameliorate and stop this epidemic. Therefore, this article may provide potential agents to treat the lung injury caused by COVID-19. With the development of science and technology, the pathological pathways of ALI/ARDS have been discovered and specific research is needed to better explain the traditional use of herbal medicines, identify active constituents and explore the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, more studies are needed to substantiate anti-ALI activities of natural compounds. These studies will significantly facilitate research to discover novel drugs from natural products to treat ALI/ARDS induced by various factors, by summarizing the pharmacological effects and presenting their underlying mechanistic functions.
