Objective There has been an unprecedented rise in infant mortality, and reduction in life expectancy associated with deprivation in recent years. A healthy pregnancy can have significant impacts on the life chances of children. The objective of this review was to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of socio-economic status and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources Nine databases were searched for articles published between 1999 -August 2019. Grey literature searches, including national statistical records were also assessed for relevance. Study selection criteria Studies reporting associations between individual-level or household socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes in the United Kingdom or Republic of Ireland. Results Among the 82,353 search results, 53,821 unique titles were identified and 35 met the eligibility criteria. Outcomes reported were mortality, birth weight, preterm birth, and mode of delivery. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. There was significantly increased odds of women from lower levels of occupation/social classes compared with the highest level having stillbirth (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.23-1.59), neonatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.22-1.57), perinatal mortality (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.57), preterm birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33-1.50), and low birth weight (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.61). Meta-analysis limitations relate to reliance on available data, unmeasured confounders, and the small number of studies for some outcomes. Conclusions This systematic review identified consistent and strong evidence that lower occupational status, especially manual occupations and unemployment, were significantly associated with increased risk of multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should incorporate approaches which address wider determinants of health to provide women and their families with the best chances of having a healthy pregnancy and baby, and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population. Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42019140893.  Search strategy broad and wide-ranging resulting in the inclusion of 7,446,139 mothers and babies in the analysis from 35 publications.  No restriction by pregnancy outcome, results therefore provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of SES.  Results limited to UK and ROI only.  Between countries and over time, the occupational classifications used have changed. cohort, decisions on which study to include were based on sample size, time period, and categories used to define determinants and outcomes. Decisions on inclusion and exclusion of studies were recorded using a PRISMA flowchart. Data extractions were carried out using a standardised protocol independently by two reviewers for each included study (KT, OA, MM), and discrepancies were validated by a third reviewer (AO, NH). Data were extracted on the study period, registry, country of study, aims, study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size, socio-economic determinants and outcomes (supplementary appendix S4). Authors of primary studies were contacted if needed to request additional data or clarify reported results (supplementary appendix S5). The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess information bias, selection bias, and confounding in case-control and cohort studies (supplementary appendix S6). 17 Stars were awarded for high quality aspects of study design. A maximum of eight stars was attainable for cohort studies (0-2 stars deemed as low quality, 3-5 moderate quality, and 6-8 high quality) and nine stars for case-control studies (0-3 stars for low quality, 4-6 for moderate quality and 7-9 for high quality). Any discrepancies on screening, extraction and quality appraisal were resolved through discussion between the reviewers (KT, OA, MM, AO) and the project lead (NH). A meta-analysis was used to calculate a pooled odds-ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) where there were at least two studies reporting the same outcome and comparable individual-or household-level SES exposures. Meta-analysis was only possible for occupation-derived social class. Sub-groups for this variable were included in the meta-analysis where possible to stratify analysis comparing highest versus intermediate-or lowest-level of occupation/social class. Heterogeneity was explored through meta-regression for factors including duration of data collected, country, region, date and sample size, location, publication date, and quality. I 2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% were used to indicate low, moderate and high levels of heterogeneity. 18 Publication bias was investigated using Egger's test and funnel plots. Sensitivity analysis was performed for each metaanalysis by excluding one dataset at a time to identify the effect of any individual dataset on the pooled effect size and between-study heterogeneity. All analysis was conducted in Stata v16. 19 Narrative synthesis methods were used to analyse outcomes with insufficient data to include in a meta-analysis. The associations between SES determinants and pregnancy outcomes reported by the studies, or calculated using data reported in the studies, were tabulated according to classifications of pregnancy outcomes (e.g. birth weight outcomes) and sub-grouped by the level of determinant (e.g. occupation). Authors were contacted when insufficient data were reported in the published studies to calculate ORs. Patterns in the data, including statistical significance and direction of effect, are summarised narratively. Patients or the public were not involved in any aspect of the study design, conduct or in the development of the research question or outcome measures. The database searches identified 53,821 records after duplicates had been removed. A further 9,414 references and citations and 529 grey literature data sources were screened ( The studies were I, the Submitting Author has the right to grant and does grant on behalf of all authors of the Work (as defined in the below author licence), an exclusive licence and/or a non-exclusive licence for contributions from authors who are: i) UK Crown employees; ii) where BMJ has agreed a CC-BY licence shall apply, and/or iii) in accordance with the terms applicable for US Federal Government officers or employees acting as part of their official duties; on a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free basis to BMJ Publishing Group Ltd ("BMJ") its licensees and where the relevant Journal is co-owned by BMJ to the co-owners of the Journal, to publish the Work in this journal and any other BMJ products and to exploit all rights, as set out in our licence.

The recent Marmot review 1 identified that 30% of children in England are living in poverty, and those in the most deprived 10% are almost twice as likely to die, and more likely to have illness or long-term disability. Having a healthy pregnancy is vital to improve the life chances of future generations and to give every child the best start in life. However, studies in high income countries (HICs) show worse pregnancy outcomes among women living in deprived communities. 3 4 Socio-economic inequalities disproportionately affect women, which impacts on their own health and the life chances of their children. Female life expectancy has declined in England's most deprived areas over the past 10 years which has been attributed to austerity, whereas it has slightly increased for men. 1 Women, particularly lone mothers, have the highest gap between income and adequate living standards and are the most likely to be living in food insecure households, 5 which is another measure of poverty. The evidence relating to the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most disadvantaged, and potential for future inequalities in health consequences due to political and economic pathways, 6 will only serve to increase these inequalities. Compared to other HICs, the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI) perform poorly in terms of both neonatal and maternal mortality. 2 7 8 For example, differences in infant mortality are linked to the level of deprivation, and there is evidence for widening inequalities in the poorest households since 2013. 2 Slowdown in life expectancy has been worse in the UK than almost all other HICs across Europe, whereas wealth inequality has increased faster. 1 Health costs associated with inequalities in England are estimated to be more than £12 billion; 1 therefore, there are potential economic benefits as well as moral and ethical reasons to invest in reducing health inequalities. Despite this, local governments responsible for delivering public health agendas in England have had a 77% budget reduction over 10 years. These cuts have been inequitable, regressive, and applied to the most deprived areas of England with the greatest health needs, contributing to widening health inequalities. 1 Central to understanding the relatively low performance of the UK and ROI compared to other HICs is documenting the scale of inequalities related to adverse pregnancy outcomes across the social gradient. Important individual factors to explore the "causes of the causes" 1 are employment, education, income and housing. Whilst there have been a number of systematic reviews which F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y examine the impact of deprivation, 3 9 10 these are out of date and focus on area-based measures (such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation) as an inadequate proxy for individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES), which can be more difficult to collate. Using individual-level socioeconomic indicators provides a richer way of understanding the relative importance of particular SES factors and their direct and indirect impact on a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and a first step to understand and then mitigate their effect on the most vulnerable groups in our communities. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of SES and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the UK and ROI. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019140893) and conducted in line with MOOSE guidelines 11 (supplementary appendix S1). Nine electronic databases were searched between 1 st January 1999 and 7 th August 2019 (supplementary appendix S2). The start date of 1999 was included as it coincided with the start of the English Health Inequalities Strategy. 12 The databases were searched using key words and MeSH headings developed by an information specialist at Newcastle University (CR). Searching for epidemiological studies using databases alone systematically misses a proportion of relevant studies, therefore in line with MOOSE guidelines, supplementary searches were carried out on the reference lists of all included studies, relevant systematic reviews, grey literature searches comprising key data sources for the UK and ROI (supplementary appendix S3), and contacting experts in key organisations in each of the countries. 13 The inclusion criteria for the review were determined a priori in terms of Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcome and Study design (PECOS) 14 :  Population: the unborn fetus, neonate (child under 28 days of age) or mother in the UK or ROI.  Exposure: Individual-level or household socio-economic factors including income, education, employment status, poverty/low wage, social isolation, car ownership and housing status. Aggregate area-level measures of socio-economic status (such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation) were excluded.  Comparison: Studies with individual-or household-level exposures which compare high to low SES.  Outcomes: Pregnancy outcomes related to fetus, neonate or mother  Study design: Observational studies with cohort, case-control, longitudinal or cross-sectional designs. The results from the database searches were imported into Endnote 15 and duplicates were removed. Screening the titles and abstracts was managed in Covidence. 16 Title, abstract and full text screening were completed independently in duplicate. Where multiple studies reported data from the same published between the years 1999 to 2019 (with data reported from 1990 onwards), 10 were case control and 25 were cohort studies. The majority of studies reported national-level data and these datasets are assumed to be nationally representative. All studies scored between three and eight on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (supplementary appendix S9). The studies were rated as either high quality (n=4 case-control, 18 cohort) or moderate quality (n=6 case-control, 7 cohort), with no lowquality studies. Most studies (n=23) reported outcomes associated with occupation-derived social class using different classifications (supplementary appendix S10) which we grouped into: (i) highestlevel (managerial/professional) occupations; (ii) intermediate-level occupations; and (iii) lowest-level (routine/manual/partly skilled) occupations. 20 Seventeen studies investigated associations with education, seven for employment and income/finances, four for housing, and one for car ownership. Pregnancy outcomes reported were mortality (stillbirth, neonatal, perinatal, maternal) , low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), mode of delivery, maternal morbidity and congenital anomalies ( Table 1) . [Insert Figure 1 here] ), of which 1,139 were screened at full text level (reasons for exclusion are detailed in supplementary appendix S7). Forty studies met the inclusion criteria, five of these reported duplicate data (supplementary appendix S8). Thirty-five studies were included reporting unique data for 7,446,139 mothers and babies, 27 were conducted in the UK and eight in the ROI ( Table 1 ). The studies were published between the years 1999 to 2019 (with data reported from 1990 onwards), 10 were case control and 25 were cohort studies. The majority of studies reported national-level data and these datasets are assumed to be nationally representative. All studies scored between three and eight on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (supplementary appendix S9). The studies were rated as either high quality (n=4 case-control, 18 cohort) or moderate quality (n=6 case-control, 7 cohort), with no low-quality studies. Most studies (n=23) reported outcomes associated with occupationderived social class using different classifications (supplementary appendix S10) which we grouped into: (i) highest-level (managerial/professional) occupations; (ii) intermediate-level occupations; and (iii) lowest-level (routine/manual/partly skilled) occupations. 20 Seventeen studies investigated associations with education, seven for employment and income/finances, four for housing, and one for car ownership. Pregnancy outcomes reported were mortality (stillbirth, neonatal, perinatal, maternal) , low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), mode of delivery, maternal morbidity and congenital anomalies (Table 1) .

Individual and household inequality measures reported were paternal, maternal and primary household occupation/social class. Stillbirth was reported by five studies 31 39 40 43 51 for 12,642,203 births (supplementary appendix S11, table a), and four 39 40 43 51 could be pooled into the meta-analysis. Perinatal mortality was reported by three studies 39 43 51 for 11,189 ,810 births (supplementary appendix S11, table b) and neonatal mortality was reported by three studies 43 40 51 for 11,580 ,610 births (supplementary appendix S11, table c) and all could be pooled in meta-analysis. There were significantly increased odds for the pooled lowest/intermediate occupation compared with highest for all three outcomes (stillbirth OR 1.40 95% CI 1. 23-1.59 ; perinatal mortality OR 1.39 95% CI 1. . All sub-group meta-analyses showed highest odds among the lowest-level of occupation/social class compared with the highest-level (stillbirth OR 1.61 95% CI 1. 37-1.88; perinatal mortality OR 1.57 95% CI 1. 41-1.74 ; neonatal mortality OR 1.58, 95% CI 1. . Heterogeneity was high for all meta-analyses ( Figure 2a ) and was not explained by any of the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Aiii, Biii, Ciii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of any individual studies for all stillbirth analyses (supplementary appendix S12Aiv) and for perinatal and neonatal mortality overall pooled meta-analyses and lowest versus highest occupation sub-groups (supplementary appendix S12Biv, Civ); however, the significance changed with the removal of the ONS 2002-2017 dataset in the intermediate sub-group for both outcomes. There was evidence of publication bias for all outcomes (supplementary appendix S12Aii, Bii, Cii). One study 31 not able to be pooled in the stillbirth metaanalysis reported increased odds of stillbirth among unemployed mothers (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.54) and fathers (OR 2.26, .02) compared with those who were employed (supplementary appendix S11, table a). Maternal mortality was reported by one study 38 which showed a significantly increased odds among unemployed women compared to those in employment (adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.04, supplementary appendix S11 table d). [Insert Figure 2 here]  Thirteen studies 39 43 56-77 106-133 reported associations between low and high birth weight outcomes and paternal and maternal occupation/social class, education, housing, income/household finances and car ownership. A meta-analysis was possible for occupation and very low birth weight (VLBW), low birth weight (LBW) and macrosomia. Two studies 39 43 reported associations between occupation/social class and VLBW (<1,500g, n=10,284,045 births) and macrosomia (>4,000g, n=3,430,632 births) (supplementary appendix S11, tables e and g) and both were included in the meta-analysis. Six studies reported LBW (<2,500g, n=3,430,632 births) with four 39 43 27 35 that could be included in meta-analysis (supplementary appendix S11, table f). The meta-analysis for the pooled lowest/intermediate occupation compared with highest identified no significant association with VLBW (OR 1.18 95% CI 0. 89-1.57) , a significantly increased odds of LBW (OR 1.40 95% CI 1. 19-1.61) , and decreased odds of macrosomia (OR 0.89 95% CI 0. 79-0.99) (Figures 3a-c) . The subgroup meta-analysis identified that the highest odds for LBW were in the lowest-level occupation category (OR 1.55 95% CI 1. Figure 3a) whereas for macrosomia only the intermediate-level versus highest-level occupation remained significant (Figure 3c ). There was significant heterogeneity in all meta-analyses for birth weight outcomes which were not explained by any of the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Diii, Eiii, Fiii), and evidence of publication bias (supplementary appendix S12Dii, Eii, Fii) . Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results for birth weight meta-analysis were not robust. For LBW, results were robust for the overall pooled analysis and for the lowest-level sub-group. However, the exclusion of datasets in the LBW intermediate-level sub-group and all macrosomia groupings resulted in odds no longer being significant, whereas the exclusion of one dataset in the VLBW analysis resulted in the odds becoming significant for the pooled meta-analysis and both sub-groups (supplementary appendix S12Div, Eiv, Fiv). [Insert Figure 3 here] Additional data were reported for occupation and mid-low birth weight (MLBW) <3000g 39 43 and small for gestational age (SGA) <5 th or <10 th percentile 27 41 54 (supplementary appendix S11, tables h and i). Predominantly, the data showed a significantly increased odds of SGA and MLBW when mothers had lowest-level occupations compared to highest, 27 54 39 43 whereas the evidence was conflicting for intermediate/non-manual occupations. 41 27 39 43 No association was found between SGA and whether the mother had a contract post, worked shifts or long hours, or had an active, or stressful job. 41 Further SES exposures reported for birth weight outcomes were education, 33 36 41 55 34 50 54 , income/finance 25 33 55 34 50 and overcrowding, housing tenure and car ownership 24 . There was significantly increased odds of LBW, 33 SGA 54 and IUGR 34 for lower levels of education when studies used degree-level education as the comparison group (supplementary appendix S11 -table j); however, studies using other comparison groups reported no significant associations with high or LBWs. 50 41 55 36 There was significantly increased odds of LBW in lower income groups 25 33 but not for VLBW 55 or IUGR, 34 or between other finance measures and SGA 50 (supplementary appendix S11, table k). One study 24 reported a significantly increased odds of LBW when babies were born to mothers living in overcrowded households and in council/housing association properties, but no significant associations with the number of rooms or renting (supplementary appendix S11, table l). One study 24 reported a significantly increased association between LBW and households with no cars, and a significantly decreased association for households with >1 car (supplementary appendix S11, table m). Eight studies 27 23 34 42 45 49 50 52 reported associations between PTB and occupation/social class, employment status, education, housing and income (supplementary appendix S11, tables n-q). Metaanalysis was possible for the association between occupation/social class and preterm birth which was reported by two studies 27 23 for 515,752 births (supplementary appendix S11, table n). The pooled meta-analysis for lowest/intermediate occupation compared with highest identified a significantly increased odds (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50; Figure 4 ). The subgroup meta-analysis identified that the highest odds for PTB were in the lowest-level occupation category (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.60). Heterogeneity was moderate for the lowest-level occupation subgroup analysis but substantial for the overall meta-analysis and the intermediate occupation sub-group ( Figure 4 ) and these were not explained by the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Giii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of any individual studies (supplementary appendix S12Giv), and there was no evidence of publication bias (supplementary appendix S12Gii). 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Additional data reported for PTB included employment, education, housing and income or other finance measures. Two studies 49 52 reported significantly increased odds of PTB (overall, spontaneous and elective) among unemployed women compared with employed (supplementary appendix S11, table n). Five studies 23 42 34 45 49 reported an overall lack of association between education and PTB (supplementary appendix S11, table o). A significantly increased risk of PTB was reported for babies born to women living in crowded homes compared with non-crowded homes, 42 and there was conflicting evidence 42 49 for rented housing (supplementary appendix S11, table p). Two studies 34 49 reported the association between income and PTB, and another 50 reported the association between financial difficulties and PTB (supplementary appendix S11, table q). For income, there was a significantly increased odds among women in the lowest income group 34 in one study but not in another. 49 There were also significantly increased odds among women "not managing financially" but not for "being behind with bills". 50 Five studies reported the associations between occupation/social class and caesarean delivery (emergency, elective or any), 21 26 28 44 instrumental delivery, 26 and induction. 48 Meta-analysis was possible for caesarean delivery. Any caesarean section (elective or emergency combined) was reported by three studies 21 26 44 for 50,345 births, whereas emergency and elective caesarean were reported separately by four studies 21 26 28 44 for >47,496 births (sample size not reported for one study, 28 supplementary appendix S11, table r) and all were included in the meta-analysis. The metaanalysis identified a significantly reduced odds of emergency caesarean (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94; Figure 5a ), elective caesarean (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91; Figure 5b ) and any caesarean (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86; Figure 5c ) for the pooled lowest/intermediate occupation/social class compared with the highest level. The sub-group meta-analysis identified that the lowest occupation/social class had the lowest odds of all caesarean categories (Figures 5a-c). There was moderate heterogeneity for any caesarean delivery, and this was significantly reduced in the subgroup analysis ( Figure 5c ). Heterogeneity was moderate for elective caesarean which was reduced by subgrouping ( Figure 5b ) and further partly explained by the date of data collection (supplementary appendix S12Iiii). There was high heterogeneity for emergency caesarean pooled data which was partly explained by subgrouping ( Figure 5a ) and further explained to a very small degree by sample size, but not by the other factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix 12Hii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of individual studies (supplementary appendix S12Hiv, Iiv, Jiv) and there was no evidence of publication bias for any category of caesarean section (supplementary appendix S12Hii, Iii, Jii). [Insert Figure 5 here] Additional data for caesarean delivery identified a significantly decreased odds among women in the lowest income quintile 34 (supplementary appendix S11, table s), living in council housing, housing association or privately rented accommodation (supplementary appendix S11, table t), and among women who bent or stood a lot and physically exerted themselves at work 44 , but an increased odds among women who mostly sat, undertook demanding tasks, worked during pregnancy and worked more than 50 hours (supplementary appendix S11, table v). 44 There was an overall lack of association with maternal education 34 26 (supplementary appendix S11, 26 and induction 48 (supplementary appendix S11, tables w-x) with some conflicting results depending on parity and previous mode of delivery. Six studies reported no significant associations between occupation and placental problems 29 , maternal morbidity 53 37 , myocardial infarction 22 , antenatal stroke 46 or amniotic fluid embolism 30 (supplementary appendix S11, table y). One study reported associations between education level and congenital anomalies 47 with significantly increased odds of congenital anomalies for educational attainment levels below a diploma, degree or higher degree qualification (supplementary appendix S11, table z). Meta-analysis from this systematic review of 7,446,139 births in the UK and ROI identified that lower-level occupation/social class is associated with a significantly increased risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and LBW by approximately 40%. Additional data narratively summarised suggest there is also an increased risk of stillbirth, maternal mortality and preterm birth amongst unemployed parents. Further individual level SES factors with some, albeit limited, evidence of increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes include lowest-level of education (compared with women who have a degree), housing and income. Overall, the data on individual and household measures of inequality suggest women (and families) experiencing lower SES face generally worse pregnancy outcomes compared with women who have a higher social status. Education, housing, income, taxation and social protection policies have undermined social mobility, leading to widening and persistent inequalities. 1 Austerity has been associated with widening inequalities in a variety of health outcomes, including infant mortality rate. 2 134 In response to economic hardship, women are less likely to adopt positive health-related behaviours due to the need to focus on coping in the short term rather than planning for the future. 1 135 As such, poverty experienced by those in lower SES might also be a pathway leading low SES to worse pregnancy outcomes alongside poorer nutrition, housing insecurity, financial stress 2 and the wider social determinants of health. These associations may be mediated by health behaviours and other risk factors, whereby mothers facing economic hardship are, for example, more likely to smoke during pregnancy. Our analysis has demonstrated a relationship between low SES and PTB (which increases the risk of subsequent infant mortality), and this is also related to low maternal weight and smoking. 54 Furthermore, deprivation is related to poor diet, 136 low levels of physical activity, 137 increased obesity, 138 late access to (and low engagement with) antenatal care, 139 increased drug 140 and alcohol use 141 and exposure to domestic violence. 142 Tackling the fundamental drivers of poor pregnancy outcomes is imperative as they are associated with lower educational attainment and disadvantage throughout life, 143 144 therefore contributing to the intergenerational cycle of inequality. This has implications considering the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, and the need for governments to not follow austerity again and instead focus on policies which won't further exacerbate inequalities, particularly for women and children. This review has many strengths. Our search strategy was broad and wide-ranging, which included multiple databases supplemented by searching citations and reference lists and contacting experts in each of the four UK regions and the ROI. The grey literature sources resulted in several large datasets being included from national records in all nations of the UK and the ROI.

We did not restrict by language, and all screening, data extraction, and quality assessments were carried out in duplicate to minimise human error. We also did not restrict by pregnancy outcome; consequently, we have wide ranging outcomes highlighting the effects of SES on the health of the mother and baby during pregnancy and up to 28 days postnatal. Using a validated quality appraisal tool, all included studies were rated moderate to high quality. However, the review is also subject to some limitations. Our findings refer to UK and ROI only and therefore further research should be undertaken to enable an understanding of how pregnancy outcomes relate to socioeconomic determinants across other HICs. Furthermore, rich data sources from the ONS and NRS were used extensively in this review to document the association between occupation-derived social class and birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal and perinatal mortality. Over the 28 years for which we had data, the occupational classifications evolved in line with changing labour market conditions as did the reporting of birth registrations, therefore the categories with which we analysed data are not directly comparable. Broad groupings of lowest, intermediate and higher-level occupations were required to be able to pool data which may not reflect any differences within these groups (e.g. any differences between unemployed versus manual employment which would have been grouped as lowest-level). This review is subject to the usual limitations of observational research whereby we cannot claim that there is a causal relationship between individual and household measures of socioeconomic disadvantage and pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, we have only found a limited number of studies for some outcome/SES combinations, and therefore it is possible that there is publication bias (that negative results are less likely to be published) and selective reporting within studies which may impact the assessment of risk of bias. Whilst there was substantial evidence for some SES measures, there was very limited data available for housing, income and car ownership, and a lack of data for other measures of individual or household inequality which may be important including other measures of poverty and social isolation. Further, there was a lack of consistency in definitions used between studies, particularly for education, which made direct comparisons difficult and it was not possible to pool this data in a meta-analysis. Further studies should explore these other axes of inequalities in addition to gain a broader insight into the relative importance and interplay of socioeconomic variables and pregnancy outcomes. Similarly, although we did identify a range of pregnancy outcomes, there was an absence of evidence available for other outcomes which require further exploration, such as miscarriage, postpartum haemorrhage, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, measures of newborn health (e.g. Apgar score), attachment, and the need for high-risk healthcare services (e.g. neonatal intensive care). This systematic review did not include pregnancy outcomes beyond 28 days postnatal, such as breastfeeding, postnatal depression and infant mortality. These additional inequality measures and health outcomes warrant further research to supplement the existing evidence-base and inform public health and maternity policy and practice, particularly in light of rising inequalities in infant mortality in the UK. 2 The early-life health outcomes and exposure to SES inequalities identified in this review have lifelong consequences, for example the prevalence of severe mental health problems is around three times higher among children in the bottom quintile of family income compared to those in the top quintile. 145 Over the last 10 years, austerity measures have impacted those poorest in our society the most. As a result of tax and welfare policies, between 2010/11 and 2015/16, the number of people in work and living in poverty has increased to 3.7 million. 146 Furthermore, funding for supporting community services such as Sure Start Children's Centres have been widely cut, despite having been shown to reduce hospitalisations and improve inequalities, including reducing SES inequalities in infant mortality. 147 Indeed, research found that SES inequalities in infant mortality decreased during a period of social policy investment in England (the English health Inequalities strategy [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] . 134 Consequently, more children are born into poverty with associated inequalities in health outcomes such as those identified in this review, as well as infant mortality which disproportionally impacts deprived communities. 2 Identifying inequalities during pregnancy is a step towards informing where services could adapt provision to effectively support populations that are socioeconomically disadvantaged. However, targeting interventions solely at the most disadvantaged groups will not reduce the steepness of the social gradient, for example we identified that women in the intermediate-level occupations were also at increased risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Proportionate universalism instead advocates a universal approach with a scale and intensity that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage. 148 This requires engagement between health professionals and people from lower socioeconomic groups in shared decision-making, which is too often characterised by less information giving, less directions and less socio-emotional and partnership building. 149 Our review demonstrated that lower SES women are less likely to have a Caesarean section which could be protective against the increased harm associated with an operative birth; however, this could highlight that women from deprived communities are less likely to request a Caesarean, or more worryingly, be involved in discussions around birthing options. A greater consciousness of structural constraints, and a willingness by health professionals to systematically break them down, may empower marginalised, lower socioeconomic patients to be more involved in decisions around their care and help reduce inequalities in the long-term. At a policy level, this review highlights that employment and workplace policies need to consider their role in supporting better pregnancy outcomes. The period of employment covers the years when people are starting and raising families and as such is instrumental in reducing the transmission of inequities to the next generation. 1 Yet austerity has driven fundamental shifts in the labour market and a push towards employment, whatever its quality or stability, leading to more precarious and part-time opportunities. Since the financial crisis, these changes have given rise to a reduction in real earnings, which for families is exacerbated further by a large reduction in benefits available for working age people and children. 150 Indeed, USA research suggests that pushing low income mothers into work has little health benefit. 151 Through shaping policies related to healthcare, public health and social policy, governments can influence the social determinants of health. 152 Social protection policies as well as active labour market policies and family policies may help reduce inequalities, although the evidence currently available is inconclusive. 153 This review has highlighted that systematic collection of routine data in pregnancy allows for associations between upstream socioeconomic factors and pregnancy outcomes to be established as evidenced in the included large national datasets for occupation-derived social class and various pregnancy outcomes. Thus, improvements to the quality and completeness of routinely collected national datasets in the antenatal and perinatal period could have a powerful impact on policy development. Overall, the findings from this review highlight that pregnancy outcomes are also associated with factors which lie upstream of the health behaviours of women and the care they receive in pregnancy and labour. These findings support the need for 'whole system' approaches to explore and address socioeconomic inequalities and pregnancy outcomes. Key areas for action may include: improved surveillance; analysis of the policy landscape impacting pregnant women and their families, with consideration of the role of different sectors and settings, including the NHS; and timely and rigorous research and evaluation efforts to further develop understanding of population needs for pregnant women and their families, and the ways to address these needs. The findings from this review provide evidence that there is a worsening of health for both babies and pregnant women who experience higher levels of individual and household socioeconomic deprivation. The strongest current evidence-base is for increased risk of mortality, LBW and PTB among lower-level occupation-derived social class. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should consider this evidence-base and incorporate approaches which address the wider determinants of health to provide women and their families with the best chance of having a healthy pregnancy and baby, and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population.  The UK and ROI perform poorly in terms of neonatal and maternal mortality compared to other high-income countries.  Growing evidence-base demonstrates the rise of children and families living in poverty following 10 years of austerity, and the association with increasing mortality rates and the reduction in life expectancy over this period.  To date, few systematic reviews have sought to understand the role of deprivation on pregnancy outcomes -those that do focus predominantly on area-based measures which do not allow the relative importance of individual socio-economic indicators to be investigated.  Our study identified consistent and strong evidence that lower occupational status was significantly associated with 40% increased risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and low birth weight.  Improving pregnancy outcomes and reducing early life inequalities requires policy approaches that proportionately target and benefit families in the lower SES groups. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 interaction ) ) OR neglect* OR overcro wd* OR ( poor W/1 ( environment OR housing ) ) OR {public housing} OR crowding ) ) OR ( ( TITLE-ABS ( ( regenerat* OR redevelop* OR develop* OR renewal OR depriv* OR disadvantag* OR af fluent OR poor ) W/5 ( area OR neighbourhood OR neighborhood OR communit* ) ) ) OR ( TITL E-ABS ( ( ( local OR urban OR {new deal} ) W/5 communit* ) OR {single regeneration budget} OR {area based initiative} ) ) ) ) ) AND ( PUBYEAR > 1998 ) ) AND ( TITLE-ABS ( epidemiolog* OR ( case W/3 ( control OR series OR report OR stud* OR comparison ) ) OR {control group} OR cohort* OR longitudinal OR ( followup W/1 ( study OR studies ) ) OR prospective OR retrospective OR ( associat* W/3 ( with OR b F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y 6 etween ) ) OR prevalence OR transversal OR incidence OR ( observational W/1 ( study OR stud ies ) ) OR {cross sectional} OR {logistic model} ) ) AND NOT INDEX ( medline ) BNI 1.

There has been a sustained increase in infant mortality in England, disproportionately affecting the most deprived areas, 1 2 and a reduction in life expectancy for the first time in 120 years, with similar trends in the rest of the United Kingdom (UK). 1 The evidence-base which demonstrates the increase in children and families living in poverty, and the association with increasing mortality rates and reduction in life expectancy, is compelling. The recent Marmot review 1 identified that 30% of children in England are living in poverty, and those in the most deprived 10% are almost twice as likely to die, and more likely to have illness or long-term disability. Having a healthy pregnancy is vital to improve the life chances of future generations, to prevent perinatal and infant mortality and to give every child the best start in life. For example, babies born small for gestational age (SGA) or preterm are more likely to die during infancy and childhood. [3] [4] [5] However, studies in high income countries (HICs) show worse pregnancy outcomes among women living in deprived communities. 6 7 Socio-economic inequalities disproportionately affect women, which impacts on their own health and the life chances of their children. Female life expectancy has declined in England's most deprived areas over the past 10 years which has been attributed to austerity, whereas it has slightly increased for men. 1 Women, particularly lone mothers, have the highest gap between income and adequate living standards and are the most likely to be living in food insecure households, 8 which is another measure of poverty. The evidence relating to the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the most disadvantaged, and the potential for future inequalities in health consequences due to political and economic pathways, 9 will only serve to increase these inequalities. Compared to other HICs, the UK and Republic of Ireland (ROI) perform poorly in terms of both neonatal and maternal mortality. 2 10 11 For example, differences in infant mortality are linked to the level of deprivation, and there is evidence for widening inequalities in the poorest households since 2013. 2 Slowdown in life expectancy has been worse in the UK than almost all other HICs across Europe, whereas wealth inequality has increased faster. 1 Health costs associated with inequalities in England are estimated to be more than £12 billion; 1 therefore, there are potential economic benefits as well as moral and ethical reasons to invest in reducing health inequalities. Despite this, local governments responsible for delivering public health agendas in England have had a 77% budget reduction over 10 years. These cuts have been inequitable, regressive, and applied to the most deprived areas of England with the greatest health needs, contributing to widening health inequalities. 1 Central to understanding the relatively low performance of the UK and ROI compared to other HICs is documenting the scale of inequalities related to adverse pregnancy outcomes across the social gradient. Important individual factors to explore the "causes of the causes" 1 include employment, education, income and housing. Whilst there have been a number of systematic reviews which examine the impact of deprivation, 6 12 13 these are out of date and focus on area-based measures (such as the Index of Multiple Deprivation) as an inadequate proxy for individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES), which can be more difficult to collate. There is some evidence from a meta-analysis published in 2012 14 that individual-level social class is significantly associated with an increase in low birth weight and infant mortality, and the authors concluded that future research should focus on the more proximal individual-level determinants of health. Using individual-level socioeconomic indicators provides a richer way of understanding the relative importance of particular SES factors and their direct and indirect impact on a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This is an essential first step to understand and then mitigate their effect on the most vulnerable groups in our communities. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to understand the association between individual-level and household-level measures of SES and adverse pregnancy outcomes in the UK and ROI. We hypothesised that there would be an increased association between low SES measures and increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019140893) and conducted in line with MOOSE guidelines 15 (supplementary appendix S1). Nine electronic databases were searched between 1 st January 1999 and 7 th August 2019 (supplementary appendix S2). The start date of 1999 was included as it coincided with the start of the English Health Inequalities Strategy. 16 The databases were searched using key words and MeSH headings developed by an information specialist at Newcastle University (CR). Searching for epidemiological studies using databases alone systematically misses a proportion of relevant studies, therefore in line with MOOSE guidelines, supplementary searches were carried out on the reference lists of all included studies, relevant systematic reviews, grey literature searches comprising key data sources for the UK and ROI (supplementary appendix S3), and contacting experts in key organisations in each of the countries. 17 The inclusion criteria for the review were determined a priori in terms of Population, Exposure, Comparison, Outcome and Study design (PECOS) 18 The results from the database searches were imported into Endnote 19 and duplicates were removed. Screening the titles and abstracts was managed in Covidence. 20 Title, abstract and full text screening were completed independently in duplicate. Where multiple studies reported data from the same cohort, decisions on which study to include were based on sample size, time period, and categories used to define determinants and outcomes. We included any studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported an association between the exposure and outcomes of interest, regardless of whether this was the primary aim of the study. Decisions on inclusion and exclusion of studies were recorded using a PRISMA flowchart. Data extractions were carried out using a standardised protocol independently by two reviewers for each included study (KT, OA, MM), and discrepancies were validated by a third reviewer (AO, NH). Data were extracted on the characteristics of the included studies and the results reported on associations between inequality exposure variables and pregnancy outcomes (supplementary appendix S4). Authors of primary studies were contacted if needed to request additional data or clarify reported results (supplementary appendix S5). The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess information bias, selection bias, and confounding in case-control and cohort studies (supplementary appendix S6). 21 Stars were awarded for high quality aspects of study design. A maximum of eight stars was attainable for cohort studies (0-2 stars deemed as low quality, 3-5 moderate quality, and 6-8 high quality) and nine stars for case-control studies (0-3 stars for low quality, 4-6 for moderate quality and 7-9 for high quality). Any discrepancies on screening, extraction and quality appraisal were resolved through discussion between the reviewers (KT, OA, MM, AO) and the project lead (NH). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to address the quality of the evidence. 22 Only those outcomes considered most important were evaluated using GRADE, and due to the available evidence, only inequalities in occupation/social class were considered. Quality of evidence for each pregnancy outcome was assessed based on study design (the baseline rating for observational studies is low), risk of bias, imprecision of estimates, inconsistency of results from different studies, indirectness of study results (i.e. lack of applicability) and publication bias. 23 A meta-analysis was used to calculate a pooled odds-ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) where there were at least two studies reporting the same outcome and comparable individual-or household-level SES exposures. Meta-analysis was only possible for occupation-derived social class. Sub-groups for this variable were included in the meta-analysis where possible to stratify analysis comparing intermediate-or lowest-level of occupation/social class to highest-level. Heterogeneity was explored through meta-regression for factors including duration of data collected, country, 24 Publication bias was investigated using Egger's test and funnel plots. Sensitivity analysis was performed for each metaanalysis by excluding one dataset at a time to identify the effect of any individual dataset on the pooled effect size and between-study heterogeneity. All analysis was conducted in Stata v16. 25 Narrative synthesis methods described by Popay et al. 26 were used to report outcomes with insufficient data to include in a meta-analysis, and to integrate the narrative and meta-analysis data. Preliminary synthesis involved grouping all data into themes based on outcomes reported and type of SES measure. The associations between SES determinants and pregnancy outcomes reported by the studies, or calculated using data reported in the studies, were tabulated according to pregnancy outcome themes (e.g. birth weight outcomes) and sub-grouped by the level of SES determinant (e.g. occupation). Where required, data were transformed to be comparable between studies (e.g. using reported frequency data to recalculate odds ratios into more comparable SES categories). Authors were contacted when insufficient data were reported in the published studies to calculate ORs. Relationships between studies are reported by discussion of reciprocal and refutational patterns in the data, including the statistical significance and direction of effect. The narrative synthesis is supplemented by a discussion of the wider evidence-base, and the strengths and limitations of this review including the gaps in the existing literature. Patients or the public were not involved in any aspect of the study design, conduct or in the development of the research question or outcome measures. The database searches identified 53,821 records after duplicates had been removed. A further 9,414 references and citations and 529 grey literature data sources were screened (Figure 1 ), of which 1,439 were screened at full-text level (reasons for exclusion are detailed in supplementary appendix S7). Forty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, six of these reported duplicate data (supplementary appendix S8). Thirty-five studies were included reporting unique data for 7,446,139 mothers and babies, 27 were conducted in the UK and eight in the ROI ( Table 1 ). The studies were published between the years 1999 to 2019 (with data reported from 1990 onwards), 10 were case control and 25 were cohort studies. The majority of studies reported national-level data and these datasets are assumed to be nationally representative. All studies scored between three and eight on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (supplementary appendix S9). The studies were rated as either high quality (n=4 case-control, 18 cohort) or moderate quality (n=6 case-control, 7 cohort), with no low-quality studies. Most studies (n=23) reported outcomes associated with occupation-derived social class using different classifications (supplementary appendix S10) which we grouped into: (i) highest-level (managerial/professional) occupations; (ii) intermediate-level occupations; and (iii) lowest-level (routine/manual/partly skilled) occupations. 27 Seventeen studies investigated associations with education, seven for employment and income/finances, four for housing, and one for car ownership. Pregnancy outcomes reported were mortality (stillbirth, neonatal, perinatal, maternal), low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), mode of delivery, maternal morbidity and congenital anomalies ( Table 1) .

A baseline questionnaire was used together with data recorded in the electronic maternity system.  Six studies reported stillbirth, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality and maternal mortality (supplementary appendix S11 tables a-d). Individual and household inequality measures reported were paternal, maternal and primary household occupation/social class. Stillbirth was reported by five studies 38 46 47 50 58 for 12,642,203 births (supplementary appendix S11, table a), and four 46 47 50 58 could be pooled into the meta-analysis. Perinatal mortality was reported by three studies 46 50 58 for 11,189 ,810 births (supplementary appendix S11, table b) and neonatal mortality was reported by three studies 50 . Heterogeneity was high for all meta-analyses ( Figure 2a ) and was not explained by any of the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Aiii, Biii, Ciii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of any individual studies for all stillbirth analyses (supplementary appendix S12Aiv) and for perinatal and neonatal mortality overall pooled meta-analyses and lowest versus highest occupation sub-groups (supplementary appendix S12Biv, Civ); however, the significance changed with the removal of the ONS 2002-2017 dataset in the intermediate sub-group for both outcomes. There was evidence of publication bias for stillbirth (supplementary appendix S12Aii), but not for perinatal or neonatal mortality (supplementary appendix S12Bii, Cii). One study 38 not able to be pooled in the stillbirth metaanalysis reported increased odds of stillbirth among unemployed mothers (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.54) and fathers (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.69-3.02) compared with those who were employed (supplementary appendix S11, table a). Maternal mortality was reported by one study 45 which showed a significantly increased odds among unemployed women compared to those in employment following adjustment for confounding factors (AOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.04, supplementary appendix S11 table d). GRADE scores showed very low-quality evidence for stillbirth and low-quality of evidence for neonatal, perinatal and maternal mortality (supplementary appendix S13). [Insert Figure 2  Thirteen studies 46 50 63-81 110-135 reported associations between low and high birth weight outcomes and paternal and maternal occupation/social class, education, housing, income/household finances and car ownership. A meta-analysis was possible for occupation and very low birth weight (VLBW), low birth weight (LBW) and macrosomia. Two studies 46 50 reported associations between occupation/social class and VLBW (<1,500g, n=10,284,045 births) and macrosomia (>4,000g, n=3,430,632 births) (supplementary appendix S11, tables e and g) and both were included in the meta-analysis. Six studies reported LBW (<2,500g, n=3,430,632 births) with four 46 50 34 42 that could be included in meta-analysis (supplementary appendix S11, (Figures 3a-c) . The subgroup meta-analysis identified that the highest odds for LBW were in the lowest-level occupation category (OR 1.55 95% CI 1.24-1.86, Figure 3a ) whereas for macrosomia only the intermediate-level versus highest-level occupation remained significant (Figure 3c ). There was significant heterogeneity in all meta-analyses for birth weight outcomes which were not explained by any of the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Diii, Eiii, Fiii). There was no evidence of publication bias (supplementary appendix S12Dii, Eii, Fii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results for birth weight meta-analysis were not robust. For LBW, results were robust for the overall pooled analysis and for the lowest-level sub-group. However, the exclusion of datasets in the LBW intermediate-level sub-group and all macrosomia groupings resulted in odds no longer being significant, whereas the exclusion of one dataset in the VLBW analysis resulted in the odds becoming significant for the pooled meta-analysis and both sub-groups (supplementary appendix S12Div, Eiv, Fiv). The GRADE score for LBW showed low quality evidence (supplementary appendix S13). [Insert Figure 3 here] Additional data were reported for occupation and mid-low birth weight (MLBW) <3000g 46 50 and small for gestational age (SGA) <5 th or <10 th percentile 34 48 61 (supplementary appendix S11, tables h and i). Predominantly, the data showed a significantly increased odds of SGA (following adjustment for confounding factors) and MLBW when mothers had lowest-level occupations compared to highest, 34 61 46 50 whereas the evidence was conflicting for intermediate/non-manual occupations. 48 34 46 50 No association was found between SGA and whether the mother had a contract post, worked shifts or long hours, or had an active, or stressful job. 48 Further SES exposures reported for birth weight outcomes were education, 40 43 48 62 41 57 61 , income/finance 32 40 62 41 57 and overcrowding, housing tenure and car ownership 31 ; the majority of which adjusted for confounding factors. There was significantly increased odds of LBW, 40 SGA 61 and IUGR 41 for lower levels of education when studies used degree-level education as the comparison group (supplementary appendix S11 -table j); however, studies using other comparison groups reported no significant associations with high or LBWs. 57 48 62 43 There was significantly increased odds of LBW in lower income groups 32 40 but not for VLBW 62 or IUGR, 41 or between other finance measures and SGA 57 (supplementary appendix S11, table k). One study 31 reported a significantly increased odds of LBW when babies were born to mothers living in overcrowded households and in council/housing association properties, but no significant associations with the number of rooms or renting (supplementary appendix S11, table l). One study 31 reported a significantly increased association between LBW and households with no cars, and a significantly decreased association for households with >1 car (supplementary appendix S11, table m). Eight studies 34 30 41 49 52 56 57 59 reported a combination of adjusted and unadjusted associations between PTB and occupation/social class, employment status, education, housing and income (supplementary appendix S11, tables n-q). Meta-analysis was possible for the association between occupation/social class and preterm birth which was reported by two studies 34 30 for 515,752 births (supplementary appendix S11, table n). The pooled meta-analysis for lowest/intermediate occupation compared with highest identified a significantly increased odds (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.50; Figure 4 ). The subgroup meta-analysis identified that the highest odds for PTB were in the lowest-level occupation category (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.60). Heterogeneity was moderate for the lowest-level occupation subgroup Figure 4 ) and these were not explained by the factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix S12Giii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of any individual studies (supplementary appendix S12Giv), and there was no evidence of publication bias (supplementary appendix S12Gii). The GRADE score for preterm birth showed very low-quality evidence (supplementary appendix S13). [Insert Figure 4 here] Additional data reported for PTB included employment, education, housing and income or other finance measures. Two studies 56 59 reported significantly increased odds of PTB (overall, spontaneous and elective) among unemployed women compared with employed (supplementary appendix S11, table n). Five studies 30 49 41 52 56 reported an overall lack of association between education and PTB (supplementary appendix S11, table o). Two studies 41 56 reported the association between income and PTB, and another 57 reported the association between financial difficulties and PTB (supplementary appendix S11, table p). For income, there was a significantly increased odds among women in the lowest income group 41 in one study but not in another. 56 There were also significantly increased odds among women "not managing financially" but not for "being behind with bills". 57 A significantly increased risk of PTB was reported for babies born to women living in crowded homes compared with non-crowded homes, 49 and there was conflicting evidence 49 56 for rented housing (supplementary appendix S11, table q). Five studies reported the associations between occupation/social class and caesarean delivery (emergency, elective or any, a combination of unadjusted and adjusted data), 28 33 35 51 instrumental delivery (all adjusted for confounders), 33 and induction (all unadjusted). 55 Meta-analysis was possible for caesarean delivery. Any caesarean section (elective or emergency combined) was reported by three studies 28 33 51 for 50,345 births, whereas emergency and elective caesarean were reported separately by four studies 28 33 35 51 for >47,496 births (sample size not reported for one study, 35 supplementary appendix S11, table r) and all were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis identified a significantly reduced odds of emergency caesarean (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94; Figure  5a ), elective caesarean (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.76-0.91; Figure 5b ) and any caesarean (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.86; Figure 5c ) for the pooled lowest/intermediate occupation/social class compared with the highest level. The sub-group meta-analysis identified that the lowest occupation/social class had the lowest odds of all caesarean categories (Figures 5a-c) . There was moderate heterogeneity for any caesarean delivery, and this was significantly reduced in the subgroup analysis (Figure 5c ). Heterogeneity was moderate for elective caesarean which was reduced by subgrouping ( Figure 5b ) and further partly explained by the date of data collection (supplementary appendix S12Iiii). There was high heterogeneity for emergency caesarean pooled data which was partly explained by subgrouping ( Figure 5a) and further explained to a very small degree by sample size, but not by the other factors included in meta-regression (supplementary appendix 12Hii). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the meta-analysis results were robust to the effect of individual studies (supplementary appendix S12Hiv, Iiv, Jiv) and there was no evidence of publication bias for any category of caesarean section (supplementary appendix S12Hii, Iii, Jii). The GRADE score for Caesarean section showed low-quality evidence (supplementary appendix S13). Additional data for caesarean delivery identified a significantly decreased odds among women in the lowest income quintile 41 (supplementary appendix S11, table s), living in council housing, housing association or privately rented accommodation (supplementary appendix S11, table t), and among women who bent or stood a lot and physically exerted themselves at work 51 , but an increased odds among women who mostly sat, undertook demanding tasks, worked during pregnancy and worked more than 50 hours (supplementary appendix S11, table v). 51 There was an overall lack of association with maternal education 41 33 (supplementary appendix S11, table u). There was limited data for instrumental delivery 33 and induction 55 (supplementary appendix S11, tables w-x) with some conflicting results depending on parity and previous mode of delivery. Six studies reported no significant associations between occupation and placental problems 36 , maternal morbidity 60 44 , myocardial infarction 29 , antenatal stroke 53 or amniotic fluid embolism 37 (supplementary appendix S11, table y). One study reported associations between education level and congenital anomalies 54 with significantly increased odds of congenital anomalies for educational attainment levels below a diploma, degree or higher degree qualification (supplementary appendix S11, table z). All data were unadjusted for confounding factors. Meta-analysis from this systematic review of 7,446,139 births in the UK and ROI identified that lower-level occupation/social class is associated with a significantly increased risk of stillbirth, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and LBW by approximately 40%. Additional data narratively summarised suggest there is also an increased risk of stillbirth, maternal mortality and preterm birth amongst unemployed parents. Further individual level SES factors with some, albeit limited, evidence of increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes include lowest-level of education (compared with women who have a degree), housing and income. Overall, the data on individual and household measures of inequality suggest women (and families) experiencing lower SES face generally worse pregnancy outcomes compared with women who have a higher social status. Education, housing, income, taxation and social protection policies have undermined social mobility, leading to widening and persistent inequalities. 1 Austerity has been associated with widening inequalities in a variety of health outcomes, including infant mortality rate. 2 136 In response to economic hardship, women are less likely to adopt positive health-related behaviours due to the need to focus on coping in the short term rather than planning for the future. 1 137 As such, poverty experienced by those in lower SES might also be a pathway leading to worse pregnancy outcomes alongside poorer nutrition, housing insecurity, financial stress 2 and the wider social determinants of health. These associations may be mediated by health behaviours and other risk factors, whereby mothers facing economic hardship are, for example, more likely to smoke during pregnancy. Our analysis has demonstrated a relationship between low SES and PTB (which increases the risk of subsequent infant mortality), and this is also related to low maternal weight and smoking. 61 Furthermore, deprivation is related to poor diet, 138 low levels of physical activity, 139 increased obesity, 140 late access to (and low engagement with) antenatal care, 141 increased drug 142 and alcohol use 143 and exposure to domestic violence. 144 Tackling the fundamental drivers of poor pregnancy outcomes is imperative as they are associated with lower educational attainment and disadvantage throughout the lifecourse, 145 146 therefore, contributing to the intergenerational cycle 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y of inequality. This has implications considering the post-COVID-19 economic recovery, and the need for governments to not follow austerity again and instead focus on policies which won't further exacerbate inequalities, particularly for women and children. This review has many strengths as well as limitations. Our search strategy was broad and wideranging, which included multiple databases supplemented by searching citations and reference lists and contacting experts in each of the four UK regions and the ROI. The grey literature sources resulted in several large datasets being included from national records in all nations of the UK and the ROI. Using national datasets, supplemented by additional academic publications, has resulted in large sample sizes for some outcome/SES combinations, particularly for occupation and for stillbirths, neonatal mortality, PTB and birth weight. We did not restrict by language, and all screening, data extraction, and quality assessments were carried out in duplicate to minimise human error. We also did not restrict by pregnancy outcome; consequently, we have wide ranging outcomes highlighting the effects of SES on the health of the mother and baby during pregnancy and up to 28 days postnatal. However, we did have to exclude studies which reported perinatal mental health or breastfeeding outcomes due to the lack of clarity in reporting the time periods of measurement for these outcomes and therefore these require further exploration capturing a longer postnatal period than 28 days. Using a validated quality appraisal tool, all included studies were rated moderate to high quality. However, our findings refer to UK and ROI only and therefore further research should be undertaken to enable an understanding of how pregnancy outcomes relate to socioeconomic determinants across other HICs. Furthermore, rich data sources from the ONS and NRS were used extensively in this review to document the association between occupationderived social class and birth weight, stillbirth, neonatal and perinatal mortality. Over the 28 years for which we had data, the occupational classifications evolved in line with changing labour market conditions as did the reporting of birth registrations, therefore the categories with which we analysed data are not directly comparable. Broad groupings of lowest, intermediate and higher-level occupations were required to be able to pool data which may not reflect any differences within these groups (e.g. any differences between unemployed versus manual employment which would have been grouped as lowest-level). Additionally, the use of national datasets such as ONS required the calculation of effect sizes using aggregate frequency data provided in the reports, therefore we were unable to account for potential confounding variables. There was inconsistency in the reporting of adjusted data throughout, where occupation-derived social class included mostly adjusted data for SGA and instrumental delivery, some adjusted data for LBW, preterm and caesarean delivery, and a lack of adjusted data for other outcomes such as offspring mortality, VLBW and macrosomia. However, most education, income/finances and housing data were adjusted; albeit reported to a lesser extent overall. We had intended to explore adjustment for confounding variables in the meta-regression as an a-priori factor; however, this was not possible due to the limited availability of adjusted data for occupation-derived social class used in the meta-analyses. There were some outcomes where both unadjusted and adjusted data were available (e.g. LBW supplementary appendix S11f). Comparing these, the effect sizes and significance were similar in the univariable and multivariable models which included multiple socio-demographic and behavioural factors. There are some additional limitations with the use of routine data sources such as issues of accuracy of data recorded in routine health records, and the comparability and granularity of variables between datasets. However, routine datasets tend to be nationally representative and adequately powered to explore patterns in population health, in a timely manner. These strengths are especially important for research where outcomes are relatively rare, such as stillbirth and congenital anomalies, which would require extensive funding and time to collect prospectively. In addition, for research into health inequalities the use of routine data is a timely method of identifying potentially vulnerable groups who require additional support. Alternative methods which incorporate lengthy data collection periods could be considered unethical when alternative existing data sources are available. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y 18 This review is subject to the usual limitations of observational research whereby we cannot claim that there is a causal relationship between individual and household measures of socioeconomic disadvantage and pregnancy outcomes. As such, the quality of evidence highlighted by GRADE was typically low or very low. Although outcomes were downgraded (e.g. for inconsistency as heterogeneity was high for all meta-analyses), due to the use of national datasets showing large effects, upgrading also occurred. We have also only found a limited number of studies for some outcome/SES combinations, and therefore it is possible that there is publication bias (that negative results are less likely to be published) and selective reporting within studies which may impact the assessment of risk of bias. To negate this, where possible, we calculated associations between inequality exposures and pregnancy outcomes when these had not been published (e.g. if frequency data were reported in a paper but no association, or by using frequency data published in nationally representative datasets such as ONS). In the meta-analysis, only stillbirth had significant evidence of publication bias. The positive associations with stillbirth may therefore be an artefact of significant associations being more likely to be published as only one reported association included in the metaanalysis was not significant. However, we should also consider the sample sizes which contributed to these significant associations, the largest being provided by the ONS (2002-17) and including >7.8 million women in the comparison of lowest versus highest occupation-derived social class, and >6.5 million women in the intermediate versus highest comparison. There are some methodological deviations from the published protocol. Firstly, we limited studies to the UK and ROI only, due to the volume of studies from European high-income countries that we retrieved in the search. Secondly, we anticipated only including a meta-analysis if there were three of more studies reporting associations between the same exposure and outcome. However, we made the decision to include meta-analysis of two studies in the final paper due to the limited amount of data available for some combinations of exposure and outcome. Most of these studies reported multiple effect sizes for subgroups of participants, which could contribute to the overall pooled estimate and be valuable to explore under-reported exposure and outcome combinations. Whilst there was substantial evidence for some SES measures, there was very limited data available for housing, income and car ownership, and a lack of data for other measures of individual or household inequality which may be important including other measures of poverty and social isolation. Further, there was a lack of consistency in definitions used between studies, particularly for education, which made direct comparisons difficult and it was not possible to pool this data in a meta-analysis. Future studies should explore these other axes of inequalities in addition to gain a broader insight into the relative importance and interplay of socioeconomic variables and pregnancy outcomes. Similarly, although we did identify a range of pregnancy outcomes, there was an absence of evidence available for other outcomes which require further exploration, such as miscarriage, postpartum haemorrhage, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, measures of newborn health (e.g. Apgar score), attachment, and the need for high-risk healthcare services (e.g. neonatal intensive care). This systematic review did not include pregnancy outcomes beyond 28 days postnatal, such as breastfeeding, postnatal depression and infant mortality. These additional inequality measures and health outcomes warrant further research to supplement the existing evidence-base and inform public health and maternity policy and practice, particularly in light of rising inequalities in infant mortality in the UK. 2 The early-life health outcomes and exposure to SES inequalities identified in this review have lifelong consequences, for example the prevalence of severe mental health problems is around three times higher among children in the bottom quintile of family income compared to those in the top quintile. 147 Over the last 10 years, austerity measures have impacted those poorest in our society the most. As a result of tax and welfare policies, between 2010/11 and 2015/16, the number of people in work and living in poverty has increased to 3.7 million. 148 Furthermore, funding for supporting Page 20 of 163 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y community services such as Sure Start Children's Centres have been widely cut, despite having been shown to reduce hospitalisations and improve inequalities, including reducing SES inequalities in infant mortality. 149 Indeed, research found that SES inequalities in infant mortality decreased during a period of social policy investment in England (the English health Inequalities strategy [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] . 136 Consequently, more children are born into poverty with associated inequalities in health outcomes such as those identified in this review, as well as infant mortality which disproportionally impacts deprived communities. 2 This study looked specifically for socioeconomic inequalities in pregnancy outcomes in the UK and Ireland alone. These countries have broadly comparable inequalities, which are typically higher compared to other parts of Europe owing to a minimal welfare state. 150 Cross-country analysis does however suggest there may be important differences in pregnancy outcomes 2 10 11 and health more generally. 151 Although evidence for occupation/social class differences was greatest in this review, there has in recent times been a move to reframe health inequalities away from individual 'labels' to instead focus on power relations and to interrogate the processes that produce them. 152 As such, identifying inequalities during pregnancy is a step towards informing where services could adapt provision to effectively support populations that are socioeconomically disadvantaged. However, targeting interventions solely at the most disadvantaged groups will not reduce the steepness of the social gradient, for example we identified that women in the intermediate-level occupations were also at increased risk of some adverse pregnancy outcomes. Proportionate universalism instead advocates a universal approach with a scale and intensity that is proportionate to the level of disadvantage. 153 This requires engagement between health professionals and people from lower socioeconomic groups in shared decision-making, which is too often characterised by less information giving, less directions and less socio-emotional and partnership building. 154 Our review demonstrated that lower SES women are less likely to have a Caesarean section which could be protective against the increased harm associated with an operative birth; however, this could highlight that women from deprived communities are less likely to request a Caesarean, or more worryingly, be involved in discussions around birthing options. A greater consciousness of structural constraints, and a willingness by health professionals to systematically break them down, may empower marginalised, lower socioeconomic patients to be more involved in decisions around their care and help reduce inequalities in the long-term. At a policy level, this review highlights that employment and workplace policies need to consider their role in supporting better pregnancy outcomes. The period of employment covers the years when people are starting and raising families and as such is instrumental in reducing the transmission of inequities to the next generation. 1 Yet austerity has driven fundamental shifts in the labour market and a push towards employment, whatever its quality or stability, leading to more precarious and part-time opportunities. Since the financial crisis, these changes have given rise to a reduction in real earnings, which for families is exacerbated further by a large reduction in benefits available for working age people and children. 155 Indeed, USA research suggests that pushing low income mothers into work has little health benefit. 156 Through shaping policies related to healthcare, public health and social policy, governments can influence the social determinants of health. 157 Social protection policies as well as active labour market policies and family policies may help reduce inequalities, although the evidence currently available is inconclusive. 155 158 This review has highlighted that systematic collection of routine data in pregnancy allows for associations between upstream socioeconomic factors and pregnancy outcomes to be established as evidenced in the included large national datasets for occupation-derived social class and various pregnancy outcomes. Thus, improvements to the quality and completeness of routinely collected 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Overall, the findings from this review highlight that pregnancy outcomes are also associated with factors which lie upstream of the health behaviours of women and the care they receive in pregnancy and labour. These findings support the need for 'whole system' approaches to explore and address socioeconomic inequalities and pregnancy outcomes. Key areas for action may include: improved surveillance; analysis of the policy landscape impacting pregnant women and their families, with consideration of the role of different sectors and settings (including the NHS); and timely and rigorous research and evaluation efforts to further develop understanding of population needs for pregnant women and their families, and the ways to address these needs. The findings from this review provide evidence that there is a worsening of health for both babies and pregnant women who experience higher levels of individual and household socioeconomic deprivation. The strongest current evidence-base is for increased risk of mortality, LBW and PTB among lower-level occupation-derived social classes. Strategies to improve pregnancy outcomes should consider this evidence-base and incorporate approaches which address the wider determinants of health to provide women and their families with the best chance of having a healthy pregnancy and baby, and to decrease pregnancy-related health inequalities in the general population. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 Elective caesarean section c.

(data synthes* or data extraction* or data abstraction* • Public health organisations and national statistical record offices (e.g. the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland) were also searched using keywords (e.g. pregnancy/deprivation). Experts in key organisations in each of the countries were also contacted to identify whether there were additional relevant literature not identified in the electronic database or grey literature searches. The following table details contact made with study authors. Contact was sought to obtain additional data not available online, to improve the quality of data extraction, or to increase the number of outcomes from the primary study included in our review (which involved requesting frequency data to recalculate odds ratios). The requests to national statistical organisations proved successful, and pre-2000 data was provided in scanned (or digitised form). However, other data requests querying outcomes or requesting frequency data were generally unsuccessful (only one of the four authors replied). 1 Paper described a 'work per week (hours/50)' outcome, with no further details provided in the text.

Dublin, Republic of Ireland, 1990 -3, 1999 Cohort studies Selection (note: exposure is individual socio-economic determinants) 1) Representativeness of the exposed cohort a a) truly representative of the average maternal population d in the community ‫٭‬ b) somewhat representative of the average maternal population d in the community ‫٭‬ c) selected group of users e.g. those with low education level or low income etc. d d) no description of the derivation of the cohort 2) Selection of the non-exposed cohort a a) drawn from the same community as the exposed cohort ‫٭‬ b) drawn from a different source c) no description of the derivation of the non-exposed cohort 3) Ascertainment of exposure b a) secure record (e.g. explicitly measured inequality d ) ‫٭‬ b) structured interview e.g. validated self-report d c) any self-report d) no description Comparability 4) Comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis c,e a) study controls for smoking d ‫٭‬ b) study controls for any additional factor ‫٭‬ c) no adjustments made Outcome (note: outcome is pregnancy health outcomes for mother and baby) 5) Assessment of outcome b a) independent blind assessment ‫٭‬ b) record linkage c) self-report d) no description 6) Was follow-up long enough for outcomes to occur b a) yes (select an adequate follow up period for outcome of interest: all women followed up until 28 days after delivery d ) ‫٭‬ b) no 7) Adequacy of follow up of cohorts a a) complete follow up -all subjects accounted for ‫٭‬ b) subjects lost to follow up unlikely to introduce bias -small number lost ->80% d follow up, or description provided of those lost) ‫٭‬ c) follow up rate < 80% d and no description of those lost d) no statement Total number of stars (out of a possible 8 stars): Note: A study can be awarded a maximum of one star for each numbered item within the Selection and Outcome categories. A maximum of two stars can be given for Comparability. Footnote: a) Questions assessing selection bias b) Questions assessing information bias c) Questions assessing confounding d) Red font indicates where the form was adapted to make questions relevant to this systematic review. e) Original question 4 "Demonstration that outcome of interest was not present at start of study" in the original scale is not applicable to this review as the outcomes relate to pregnancy and therefore by nature did not exist at the start of the study. Therefore, this item has been removed from the scale. The denominator value for the maximum number of stars a study can be awarded has been reduced from 9 to 8 due to the removal of the original question 4. Case-control studies Selection (note: outcome is pregnancy health outcomes for mother and baby) 1) Is the case definition adequate a a) yes, with independent validation ‫٭‬ b) yes, e.g. record linkage or based on self-reports c) no description 2) Representativeness of the cases a a) consecutive or obviously representative series of cases ‫٭‬ b) potential for selection biases or not stated. 3) Selection of controls a a) community controls ‫٭‬ b) hospital controls c) no description 4) Definition of controls a a) no history of disease (endpoint) ‫٭‬ b) no description of source Comparability 5) Comparability of cases and controls on the basis of the design or analysis c ,2 a) study controls for smoking d ‫٭‬ b) study controls for any additional factor‫٭‬ c) no adjustments d Exposure (note: exposure is individual socio-economic determinants) 6) Assessment of exposure b a) secure record ‫٭‬ b) structured interview where blind to case/control status ‫٭‬ c) interview not blinded to case/control status d) written self-report or medical record only e) no description 7) Same method of ascertainment for cases and controls b a) yes ‫٭‬ b) no 8) Non response rate b a) same rate for both groups ‫٭‬ b) non respondents described c) rate different and no designation Total number of stars (out of a possible 9 stars): Note: A study can be awarded a maximum of one star for each numbered item within the Selection and Outcome categories.
