To characterise urocortin and CRFR2 subtype expression and distribution in canine heart, tissue from dogs without evidence of cardiovascular disease was analysed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression of urocortin 1 and urocortin 3 and CRFR2a was present in all heart chambers, whereas urocortin 2 was found only in right atrium, and at barely detectable levels. CRFR2 was highly expressed in atrial tissue compared to other heart tissue. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated staining for urocortin 1 and urocortin 3, but not urocortin 2, in cardiomyocytes. To assess the potential usefulness of circulating urocortins as a marker of heart disease, plasma samples from 45 dogs with cardiac disease and 15 controls were analysed by radioimmunoassay. Both urocortin 1 (controls 1.71 (1.08/7.92) pmol/L; cardiac disease 1.59 (0.42/7.33) pmol/L) and urocortin 3 (controls 0.48 (0.48/4.01); cardiac disease 0.48 (0.48/4.76) pmol/L) were measurable (Data expressed as median (minimum/maximum). However, the presence of cardiac disease did not significantly alter the levels of either peptide. Therefore, while urocortins and CRFR2 are expressed in canine myocardium where they may play a role in the neurohumoral response to cardiac disease or failure, they do not appear to be a sensitive biomarker of cardiac disease in our canine patient population. Heart disease and chronic kidney disease often progress to become terminal conditions, even with optimal medical care. One factor potentially common to both conditions is anemia. A vicious cycle may exist between these three conditions, each triggering or exacerbating the other. We aimed at determining the prevalence of azotemia, hypokalemia, and anemia in canine heart disease, before and after the onset of pharmacotherapy. Physical examination, echocardiography and blood work parameters were retrospectively collected from 223 consecutive dogs with heart disease, and compared to those from 248 dogs with no cardiac or renal dysfunction. The mean creatinine levels in the study group were lower than those in the control group, while within normal range. The prevalence of azotemic dogs among heart patients was 24.1%. Mean hematocrit levels were higher in the study group compared to the control group, while within normal range as well. The prevalence of anemia among the cardiac study group was 22.8%, surprisingly lower than that in the control group. Six out of 156 cardiac patients (3.8%) were both anemic and azotemic. Cardiac disease severity and chronic cardiac therapy did not affect hematocrit, creatinine or potassium levels. Impaired renal function and anemia is uncommon in canine heart disease. It remains important, however, to identify these conditions so that adjustment of an appropriate treatment regimen, as well as an appropriate prognosis is facilitated. Traditional medical therapy can likely be followed as long as these parameters remain stable and within normal range. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of the ACEinhibitor, benazepril, to suppress circulating RAAS activation in normal dogs treated with furosemide. We hypothesized that benazepril would suppress plasma ACE activity and furosemide induced RAAS activation, as evaluated by urinary aldosterone:creatinine ratio. Twelve healthy hound dogs were used. Group1 (control) received furosemide (2 mg/kg PO, BID) for 7 days. Group 2 received furosemide (2 mg/kg PO, BID) and benazepril (1 mg/kg every 24 hours) for 7 days. To measure the response of the RAAS to the medications, plasma ACE activity and urinary aldosterone:creatinine ratio (A:Cr) were obtained on days -1, -2, 1, 3 and 7. Urinary aldosterone secretion, as indicated by the A:Cr, increased nearly 3-fold by furosemide monotherapy. This was maintained for the 7 days of the study. The addition of benazepril to group 2 dogs successfully suppressed plasma ACE activity but did not significantly reduce urinary aldosterone excretion. We have shown that, while benazepril successfully blunted ACE activity, it did not reduce urinary aldosterone excretion. The absence of circulating RAAS suppression accompanied by ACE activity suppression defines aldosterone escape. The discrepancy between these data and the documented benefits of benazepril likely reflects the efficacy of this ACE inhibitor in suppressing tissue RAAS rather than circulating RAAS. Congestive heart failure develops in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) secondary to volume overload, in part mediated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. We hypothesised that aldosterone would increase with left ventricular size in volume overload and be negatively associated with survival. Aldosterone concentrations (pg/ml) in serum and urine were measured in dogs with naturally-occurring MMVD and healthy controls using a commercially-available radioimmunoassay. Urine creatinine was measured by a commercial laboratory. Dogs with MMVD were examined twice, six months apart and categorised according to the percentage change in their normalised left ventricular diastolic diameter (%LVEDDN). Dogs with %LVEDDN 4 10% were classified 'progressive', and the remainder 'non-progressive'. Results are reported as [Median (IQR) ]. Comparisons of continuous variables were made between groups with Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, proportions were compared with the Fishers' exact test and survival times (all-cause mortality) compared by the log rank test and Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) [95%CI] . Correlations were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Fifty-four dogs with MMVD (16 progressive, 38 non-progressive) and 20 control dogs were studied. There was no difference in age or weight between the progressive, non-progressive and control groups. There was no difference in baseline LVEDDN between progressive [1.56 (1.38-1.88)] and non-progressive groups [1.69 (1.49-1.79)] (P 5 0.256). At visit one there was no difference in serum aldosterone (P 5 0.220) between progressive [59.39 (36.15-91.41) ], non-progressive [44.38 (17.88-87.23 )] and control [59.88 (29.79-136.21 )] groups. There was no difference in urine aldosterone: creatinine ratio (UAC) (P 5 0.117) between progressive [0.14(0.05-0.21)], non-progressive [0.07 (0.03-0.13)] and control [0.08 (0.06-0.14)] groups. There was no relationship between serum aldosterone (P 5 0.765) and survival. The relationship between UAC and survival tended towards significance (P 5 0.054). At visit two serum aldosterone was higher in the progressive [87.69(31.68-192.14) ] than the non-progressive group [40.70 (17.88-112.31 )] (P 5 0.048). UAC was higher in the progressive [0.17 (0.08-0.23)] than the non-progressive group [0.09 (0.05-0.15)] (P 5 0.014). There was no difference in proportions of dogs receiving furosemide (P 4 0.999) or ACE inhibitors (P 4 0.999) between groups. UAC was negatively associated with survival (P 5 0.005), HR 5 0.33 [0.14-0.74]. The relationship between serum aldosterone and survival tended towards significance (P 5 0.062). %LVEDDN 4 10% was not associated with survival (P 5 0.214). Serum aldosterone correlated with %LVEDDN (P 5 0.024). UAC correlated with LVEDDN (P 5 0.006) and %LVEDDN (P 5 0.007). In conclusion, serum aldosterone and UAC increase during ventricular remodelling. UAC appears to be negatively associated with survival. Changes in platelet aggregation responses and von Willebrand factor multimer levels have been reported in dogs with asymptomatic heart disease. Alterations in hemostatic pathways may be involved in the progression of canine mitral valve disease by causing microthrombosis and vessel changes in the myocardium, and it is being debated whether dogs with heart disease could benefit from antithrombotic therapy. We hypothesized that a global hypercoagulability is present in dogs with asymptomatic mitral valve disease. The study investigated Kaolin and Tissue Factor activated thromboelastographic (TEG) tracings in 3 groups of dogs: 11 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) with no or minimal mitral regurgitation (MR) (age 5.0 AE 1.8 years), 14 CKCS with severe MR (regurgitant jet size by echocardiography ! 50%) (age 7.1 AE 1.6 years), and 8 healthy Beagles with no or minimal MR (age 7.7 AE 2.3 years). Complete blood count (ADVIA 120) and biochemical screening were performed in all dogs. Differences between groups were analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA and the effect of platelet count, hematocrit and leukocyte count on TEG values was analyzed. Data revealed no significant differences between the 3 groups in any of the 4 analyzed TEG variables (R, K, Maximum Amplitude (MA) and angle) even when corrected for platelet count. Eleven of 25 CKCS had macrothrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 45 to 96 Â 10 9 /L, and surprisingly there was an inverse correlation between platelet count and Tissue Factor activated MA (r 5 À0.52, p 5 0.008) in this group of dogs. No correlation was found between hematocrit and TEG values, however, leukocyte count correlated with Tissue Factor activated values: MA (r 5 0.46, p 5 0.007), angle (r 5 0.46, p 5 0.007), and K (r 5 À0.47, p 5 0.006). These data do not support the hypothesis that a global hypercoagulability is present in CKCS with asymptomatic myxomatous mitral valve disease. Moreover, prospective longitudinal trials are needed to demonstrate a benefit of anti-thrombotic therapy in dogs with asymptomatic heart disease. The data supports previous findings that CKCS with macrothrombocytopenia have a normal coagulation response despite low platelet counts. Quality of life (QOL) is an important aspect of the management of animals with cardiac disease. Because owners often euthanize their animals with cardiac disease for quality of life issues, this parameter can influence survival time. Quality of life also can be a key outcome measure to assess the success of medical and surgical therapy of cardiac disease. Whereas many QOL assessment tools have been developed for use in people and dogs with cardiac disease, no validated QOL assessment tools are available for use in cats with cardiac disease. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a questionnaire to assess QOL for cats with cardiac disease. Items related to clinical signs of cardiac disease in cats (eg, appetite, urination habits, interactions with others) were generated and a QOL questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire included 16 questions assessing owner perceptions of the cats' clinical signs using a 0-5 scale, as well as an overall quality of life item. To evaluate the QOL questionnaire, the instrument was self-administered by owners of cats with cardiac disease between June and November, 2009. An independent measure of disease severity [International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) classification of heart failure] was recorded for each cat. The questionnaire was evaluated for internal consistency, construct validity, criterion-related validity, and test-retest reliability by Spearman rank correlation. The QOL questionnaire was completed by 75 owners of cats with cardiac disease and re-administered after an interval of 1 to 3 weeks to 10 owners. Mean age of the cats was 9.1 AE 4.9 years and the study included 51 male cats and 24 female cats. The most common underlying diseases were hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n 5 56), congenital diseases (n 5 9), dilated or unclassified cardiomyopathy (n 5 7), restrictive cardiomyopathy (n 5 2), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n 5 1). Cats were distributed between ISACHC class 1a (n 5 3), 1b (n 5 32), 2 (n 5 27), 3a (n 5 10), and 3b (n 5 3). Internal consistency was tested by evaluating the relationship between individual questions and the total QOL score, which ranged from 0.06-0.57. Cronbach's alpha was 0.90, indicating high internal consistency. Correlation between overall quality of life and the total QOL score was 0.64 (P o 0.001). The ISACHC class was correlated with the total QOL score (r 5 0.43; P o 0.001), suggesting moderate criterion validity. Among the 10 owners who completed the questionnaire twice to assess test-retest reliability, total scores on the two tests were highly correlated (P 5 0.94; P 5 0.001). We conclude that the QOL questionnaire for cats has good validity and reliability, and represents a promising new tool for assessment of quality of life in cats. Prospective evaluation of this QOL questionnaire in a larger population of cats with cardiac disease, including responsiveness to change, is ongoing. DNA vaccination against tumor specific proteins is a potential strategy for cancer therapy. In order to have a successful vaccine, one must identify tumor proteins that have a restricted expression pattern (i.e. tumor only) and can facilitate an appropriate immune response while not generating immune tolerance or significant auto-immunity. To this end, a vaccine has been developed for use in dogs with melanoma that has been shown to target the tumor-specific antigen, tyrosinase. Furthermore, pending the expression pattern of this tumor-specific antigen, this vaccine may also be considered in other appropriate species such as the horse. Unfortunately, the expression of this protein in canine (and equine) melanocytic tumors has not been described. In this report we describe the tumor-specific expression levels of tyrosinase in canine and equine melanocytic tumors. We also compare these levels to those found in normal cutaneous tissues from both species. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were collected from 50 dogs and horses previously diagnosed with a melanocytic tumor. RNA was isolated and quantified from these tissues using standard techniques. A TaqMan RT-PCR assay was then designed to amplify the exon 1/2 boundary. Relative expression levels (DDCt) were determined and compared to both pigmented and nonpigmented cutaneous tissues. Results demonstrate high tyrosinase expression in both pigmented and non-pigmented melanocytic tumors with insignificant levels found in the normal skin. No significant difference in tyrosinase expression was found between the different canine or equine anatomic locations of melanocytic tumors. The specificity and sensitivity of tyrosinase expression was also compared to traditional methodology of immunohistochemistry with S100 and MelanA and found to be similar; correctly classifying all amelanotic melanomas and three undifferentiated sarcomas. In summary, this methodology is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of tyrosinase expression in both fresh and fixed tumor samples and has demonstrated the tumor-specificity of this antigen. lower than those in BMCs obtained by aspiration method (15.3 AE 7.6 and 9.2 AE 3.6) (both P o 0.001). Percentage of CD34 1 cells was significantly higher by perfusion method (5.5 AE 1.9) than aspiration method (4.2 AE 1.8) (P o 0.01). Colony forming unit in culture (CFU-C) was significantly higher by perfusion method (63.7 AE 21.2) than aspiration method (21.9 AE 7.8) (P o 0.01). The present study indicated that the perfusion method was more appropriate than aspiration method to harvest bone marrow progenitor cells for transplantation in dogs. This study compares the inflammatory profile of normal dogs, dogs with lymphoma, and dogs with osteosarcoma to determine if dogs with an immune cancer (lymphoma) have a different inflammatory ''foot print'' then either dogs with non-immune cancer (osteosarcoma), or normal dogs. By characterizing inflammatory mediators we may also be able to increase dose intensity, and therefore median remission and survival times. We hope to provide a framework from which chemotherapy treatment can be based by using measurements of these mediators to predict which dogs may be at higher risk for sepsis. We hypothesize that dogs with lymphoma will have a blunted immune response compared to dogs with osteosarcoma or healthy dogs Blood was collected from healthy controls (healthy; n 5 3), osteosarcoma (OSA; n 5 2), and dogs with lymphoma (LSA; n 5 3), and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), peptidoglycan (PG) and control (PBS) were used to stimulate production of TNF and IL-10 using a whole blood culture system. Data were reported using descriptive statistics. Lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan induced TNF production from whole blood culture in all dogs. Whole blood from the LSA group produced less TNF in response to LPS, LTA and PG compared to the other groups (see figures). These pilot data suggest that dogs with LSA have a blunted proinflammatory response to both gram positive and gram negative bacterial pathogen associated molecular patterns. This is initial evidence that dogs with LSA have immunodysfunction and that those differences may be exploited to select a specific patient population which might tolerate higher doses of chemotherapy with less chance of sepsis. ABSTRACT #20 URETHRAL STENT PLACEMENT USING DIGITAL RADI-OGRAPHY: 10 CASES. Radhakrishnan, Anant. Bluegrass Veterinary Specialists, Lexington, KY. Urethral stent placement for lower urinary tract obstruction has been recently described. Neoplasia of the urinary bladder, urethra, or prostate are the most common reasons for obstruction though granulomatous urethritis and urethral strictures have also been described. The development of an interventional technique was necessary due to morbidity associated with surgical intervention for treatment of tumors in the lower urinary tract while medical management does not alleviate symptoms associated with lower urinary tract tumors including obstruction. The technique previously described utilized fluoroscopic guidance for placement of urethral stents to restore luminal patency. However, digital radiography is more readily available in small animal practice and the ability to utilize it for urethral stent placement may allow for more widespread availability of this procedure. 10 client-owned patients (8 female, 2 male) presented for lower urinary tract disease. 8 patients (7 female, 1 male) were diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder or urethra, 1 female patient was diagnosed with granulomatous urethritis, and 1 male patient was diagnosed with idiopathic detrusor-urethral dyssynergia. 3 patients (female) presented with urethral obstruction (2 TCC and 1 granulomatous urethritis). 6 TCC patients had significantly decreased luminal patency and therefore urethral stent placement was elected. With cystoscopic guidance, a guidewire was passed into the urinary bladder. Guidewires and catheters were used to perform positive contrast cystourethrograms and sequential digital radiograph images were taken to determine the appropriate size and location for stent placement. All stents were placed transurethrally over the guidewire and sequential digital images were taken to monitor stent positioning and deployment. Post-procedure urination was documented in 100%. All 10 patients were reported to have improvement in urine output post-procedure by their owners. 2 female patients with TCC developed urinary incontinence. Mild dysuria continued to be noted in 6/7 female TCC patients. Stent dislodgement into the urinary bladder occurred in one patient due to failure to maintain back tension on the stent. A second stent was placed in this patient without complication and the previous stent was removed via cystotomy. Seven patients are considered to have good-excellent outcome and three fair. Digital radiography can be used for trans-urethral stent placement. The still imaging requires multiple images to be taken sequentially during the procedure to monitor movement and positioning of guidewires, catheters, and stents as well as to interpret the contrast cystourethrogram and determine luminal patency. URETHRAL STENTING IN CANINE PATIENTS WITH UR-OTHELIAL CARCINOMA: A REVIEW OF 41 CASES (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . A. Blackburn 1 , A. Berent 2 , C. Weisse 2 , D.C. Brown 1 . 1 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA. 2 Animal Medical Center, New York, NY. Urethral stenting can be performed in a minimally invasive manner for immediate relief of malignant urethral obstructions in dogs. Traditionally, the most common cause for euthanasia in dogs with urethral/bladder/prostate tumors was local progression, resulting in severe stranguria/obstruction. The purpose of this study was to review canine cases that received a urethral stent for obstructive urothelial carcinoma between 2004-2008. Post-stent incontinence rates were determined. Multiple factors were analyzed to determine effect on the incidence of post-stent incontinence: stent size, length, patient sex, tumor size/location, etc. Survival times after stent placement were determined. Forty-one dogs (22 males, 19 females) were retrospectively evaluated. Incontinence rates, of any degree (mild or severe), were 47.6% and 75% in females and males, respectively, while only 28.6% of females and 20.8% of males were considered severely incontinent. The median survival time (MST) post-stent was 90 days. MST in dogs that did and did not receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) prior to stent placement were 181 and 54 days, respectively. MST for dogs that did and did not receive poststent chemotherapy were 120 and 43 days, respectively. Dogs that had tumor extension into the bladder had a MST of 33 days, versus no bladder extension had a MST of 90 days. In conclusion, post-stent incontinence rates were higher than previously reported, but a majority of these dogs were only mildly incontinent. Pre-stent use of NSAIDS and post-stent chemotherapy statistically increased survival, while extension of the tumor into the bladder significantly decreased survival. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of contrast ultrasound (CEUS) on urine protein concentration, enzyme activities and hematuria in healthy cats. The left kidney of eight, young (2-4 years) cats was imaged with CEUS (Esaote MyLab 70XVG) in a longitudinal plane using a 3-11 MHz linear transducer. The mechanical index was maintained at 0.04 and adjustable parameters were standardized. A 1.5 minutelong digital imaging series with a frame rate of 16-18 Hz was recorded after iv-bolus injections of contrast medium (0.1 ml Definity s ). Plasma and urine samples were collected before CEUS and at 4 h and 48 h thereafter. Urine enzymatic activities, specific gravity, pH, protein, creatinine, albumin and sediment, and plasma urea and creatinine concentrations were evaluated. ANOVA with repeated measurements was used to compare the laboratory parameters at times 0, 4 h, 48 h. The significant changes were tested with post-hoc Student's T-test. Statistical significance was set at P o 0.05. No changes were detected in serum samples, except a decrease in blood urea concentration at 48 h. A small rise in the N-acetyl-b-Dglucosaminidase (0.53 AE 0.35 to 1.43 AE 0.59 U/g) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (13.51 AE 3.28 to 18.19 AE 6.4 U/g) ratios was seen at 48 h, but not 4 h. This variation was less than the circadian variation (6.4 AE 2.7 U/g, 17.9 AE 13.5 U/g) reported in an earlier study in healthy cats. These results suggest that CEUS can be safely used to assess kidney perfusion in cats without detrimental effects on kidneys. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and human immunodefiency virus (HIV) are related lentiviruses that lead to immune dysregulation, opportunistic infections, inflammatory diseases, and neoplasia. Renal disease is diagnosed in up to 30% of HIV-infected humans and is the fourth most common cause of death associated with HIV. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FIV infection and renal disease in cats. Clinicopathological data were collected from FIV-infected (152) and FIV-noninfected (371) cats. Serum creatinine, urine specific gravity (USG), and urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) were recorded. In FIV-infected cats, CD41 lymphocyte count and CD4 1:CD8 1 lymphocyte ratio were measured by flow cytometry. Renal azotemia was defined as a serum creatinine concentration 4 1.8 mg/dL with a USG o 1.035. Proteinuria was defined as a protein:creatinine ratio 4 0.4. In univariate analysis, FIV-infection was associated with proteinuria (OR 5 2.76, 95% CI 1.51-5.06, P 5 0.001). Of those cats with a UPC 4 1.0, 67% were FIV-infected. No significant association was detected between FIV-infection and renal azotemia (P 5 0.385). There was a positive correlation between CD41 lymphocyte count and UPC (P 5 0.01), but not renal azotemia. No correlation was noted between CD41:CD81 lymphocyte ratio and renal disease. These findings suggest that renal disease, characterized by proteinuria but not azotemia, is associated with FIV-infection. In HIV-infection, low CD41 lymphocyte count is a risk factor for proteinuric renal disease; however, that does not appear to be true for FIV-infection. The Ragdoll is one of the most popular cat breeds worldwide. According to several breeder websites, Ragdolls are predisposed for chronic kidney disease (CKD), mainly due to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) . Although there is no evidence that Ragdolls are at increased risk for renal problems, screening of these cats is performed in several countries before breeding. In addition, information about the prevalence of PKD in Ragdoll cats is lacking. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the results of screening tests of Ragdolls at our institution to assess the prevalence of renal abnormalities in this breed. All Ragdoll cats that were presented for PKD and/or CIN screening (abdominal ultrasonography, PKD genetic testing, renal values) between September 2001 and November 2009 were considered for inclusion in this retrospective study. Ragdolls were excluded if only the renal values were measured without undergoing an abdominal ultrasonography (US) to evaluate the kidneys and liver and/or genetic testing for PKD. PKD negative cats only evaluated by US needed to be at least 9 months to be included. The signalment, serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations and US abnormalities of kidneys and liver were assessed. PKD was considered if at least one cystic structure was found in at least one kidney or the liver on US or if the cat was heterozygous for the PKD1 nonsense mutation on genetic testing. Cats with US changes compatible with CKD were considered at risk for CIN. The study included 257 Ragdolls with a mean age of 774 days (range 90-3190). Abdominal US was performed on 249 cats: 7 cats were diagnosed with PKD, 22 cats had one or more abnormalities that could be compatible with CKD, 8 cats had other renal abnormalities with uncertain significance and 2 cats showed right unilateral renal agenesis or aplasia. None of the cats showed hepatic cysts. All 29 genetically tested cats were homozygous for the wild PKD1 allele, including 1 cat that was considered PKD positive on abdominal US. Renal values were measured in 142 cats: 68 had an increased serum creatinine concentration and 3 had both serum urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations above the reference range. The mean serum creatinine concentration was 127.34 AE 30.67 mmol/ L (reference range: 87-124 mmol/L). Although this study is limited by its retrospective nature, the screening results for kidney disease of a large population of Ragdoll cats are evaluated for the first time. This study indicates that PKD occurs at a low prevalence in Ragdolls and that US findings possibly compatible with CIN can be detected in less than 10% of this Ragdoll population. Almost half of the cats had an increased serum creatinine concentration, therefore further examination will need to elucidate if this is due to a breed-specific feature or to decreased renal function. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is common in geriatric cats but often appears stable for long periods of time. Several studies have evaluated prognostic markers in cats with CKD, but few have identified which ones precede disease progression. The aim of this study was to find a marker which would predict deterioration of renal function in cats newly diagnosed with CKD. Feline CKD cases were recruited between 1992 and 2009 through geriatric cat clinics held at two first opinion practices. Diagnosis was based on concurrent findings of plasma creatinine 4 2 mg/dl and urine specific gravity (USG) o 1.035, with persistence of azotemia for 2 weeks. All cases were first screened using objective criteria and then classified by two clinicians. Renal function was approximated using the reciprocal of plasma creatinine concentration (1/creatinine) and linear regression was used to assess changes over time. For cases to be considered progressive, a negative slope in 1/creatinine (p o 0.1) was required. For cases to be considered non-progressive, they were required to have no significant negative slope in 1/creatinine, at least 3 plasma creatinine values spread over 40 weeks follow-up, and no linear weight loss (p o 0.05). Graphs of 1/creatinine and bodyweight against time were plotted for cats meeting the above screening criteria. These were randomised and classified independently by the clinicians (HS and JE). Further cases were excluded where classifications disagreed or extreme fluctuations in 1/creatinine were observed. Cats which developed hyperthyroidism were excluded from the study and urine protein-to-creatinine ratios (UPCs) from urine samples with a positive urine culture outcome were not used in the analyses. Baseline variables at diagnosis were assessed for associations with progression using binary logistic regression. The odds ratio (OR), confidence interval (CI), or interquartile range (IQR) is provided in parentheses. In total, 52 progressive and 42 non-progressive cases were identified out of 118 cases which passed the initial screening criteria. Lower packed cell volumes (PCVs) were associated with progression (OR: 0.916, 95%CI: 0.853-0.985, n 5 90, p 5 0.017). The median PCV for the progressive group was 32(IQR 29-36)% versus 36(IQR 34-41)% for the non-progressive group. The groups were matched for the degree of azotemia at diagnosis, with a median plasma creatinine concentration of 2.46(IQR 2.33-3.12) mg/dl for the progressive group and 2.51(IQR 2.26-2.92) mg/dl for the non progressive group. Plasma creatinine (n 5 94, p 5 0.544), urea (n 5 94, p 5 0.922), USG (n 5 93, p 5 0.216), phosphate (n 5 93, p 5 0.157), UPC (n 5 45, p 5 0.145) and potassium (n 5 94, p 5 0.544), did not predict CKD progression. The results of this study suggest that newly diagnosed cases of azotemic CKD which have low PCV values are more likely to progress. Thus, anemia may serve as a marker for cats which have more severe types of renal disease or may itself contribute to progression via hypoxic injury. Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is an uncommon complication of glomerular disease defined as the concurrent presence of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia (i.e. hypercholesterolemia), and ascites or other third space fluid accumulation. Although NS is wellrecognized in dogs, published information is limited to occasional mention of affected animals in larger case series of glomerular disease and sporadic case reports. The purpose of this study was to describe a larger population of dogs with NS, and determine whether or not the diagnosis of NS is associated with signalment or select clinicopathologic or histologic findings in patients with glomerular disease. Medical record databases were searched at 8 participating institutions using the term 'nephrotic syndrome.' Records were reviewed by participants, with inclusion requiring the concurrent presence of all four criteria. Two non-NS dogs with glomerular disease were selected as controls for each NS dog, using the search terms 'proteinlosing nephropathy,' 'glomerular disease,' and 'glomerulopathy'. Signalment, time until death, albumin, cholesterol, creatinine, BUN, sodium, UPC, and histopathologic diagnosis were recorded for each patient, and NS and control populations were compared using chi-squared or two-sample t-tests as appropriate. 78 dogs with NS and 156 control dogs were included in this interim analysis. Neither sex nor neuter status were associated with NS (p 5 0.748). Mixed breed dogs and 11 pure breed varieties had 4 5 animals within the 234 total dogs; however no breeds were over-represented in either group. Mean serum albumin in NS dogs was significantly lower than in control dogs (1.7 [95% CI 1. .5] vs. 8.2 [95% CI 7.1-9.2]) in NS dogs were significantly greater than in control dogs (p 0.001). There were no significant differences in sodium, creatinine, or BUN between the two groups (p 5 0.311, 0.854, and 0.919, respectively). Of the 38 NS dogs for which a histopathologic diagnosis was available, the most frequently identified diseases were membranous glomerulopathy (n 5 10), amyloidosis (n 5 8), and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (n 5 8); however, no individual diagnosis was overrepresented in NS dogs as compared to control dogs (p 5 0.344). There was no difference in mean survival between groups ( These preliminary results suggest that neither signalment nor histopathologic diagnosis affect the likelihood of dogs with glomerular disease being concurrently diagnosed with NS, and that NS is not associated with a concurrent diagnosis of azotemia or survival time in dogs with glomerular disease. These findings are in contrast to those in people with NS, in whom specific diseases are more likely to result in NS, and the diagnosis of NS may be a negative prognostic indicator. Use of cranberry juice decreased or eliminated recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women. In dogs, as with people Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common pathogen associated with UTIs. Cranberry proanthocyanidins (PACs) inhibit the attachment of the P-fimbriated E. coli (Pf E. coli) to uroepithelial cells. A supplement containing these PACs was assessed in six male dogs for anti-adhesion (AA) activity. Urine samples were tested in an in vitro assay for the ability of Pf E.coli to agglutinate human red blood cells. One Crananidin TM tablet containing 16 mg of bioactive PACs (mean dose 1.14 mg/kg bw) was administered daily for three weeks. Urine samples were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 21 at 0-3, 3-6, 6-12 and 21-24 hours post administration. AA assays were scored based on the following scale: 0 5 no AA activity, 0.5 5 25%, 1 5 50%, 1.5 5 75% and 2 5 100% AA activity. Control urine demonstrated hemagglutination activity. AA activity appeared within 3 hours of Crananidin TM administration, peaked on Day 7 at 80 AE 26.5% and remained elevated on Day 21 at 73 AE 28.5% over the 24hour period. No clinically significant clinical chemistry or hematology changes were observed. This innovational ex-vivo study shows that the bioactive PACs in Crananidin TM produce metabolites in the urine of dogs sufficient to reduce adhesion of Pf E. coli, and once daily usage may be beneficial in preventing E. coli associated UTIs in dogs. COX enzymes are involved in prostanoid synthesis, local mediators which modulate renal hemodynamics. Renal COX enzyme expression has not been described in cats, either with normal or diseased kidneys. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of renal COX enzymes is associated with progression in feline chronic kidney disease (CKD). Formalin-fixed kidney sections were accessed from the RVC pathology archive for this study. Non-azotemic cats with normal renal histology that were euthanized for reasons unrelated to renal disease were defined as non-CKD group and were categorized as young ( o 5 yrs) or old (4 9 yrs). Azotemic-CKD cats were diagnosed as having persistently elevated plasma creatinine (4 2 mg/dl) and urine specific gravity o 1.035 together with other CKD clinical signs. Azotemic cases were further classified. If plasma [creatinine] increased to 4 5 mg/dl (IRIS stage 4) or by 4 50% within 6 months of death, the case was categorized as progressive (CKD-P). Nonprogressive cases (CKD-NP) had a follow-up of at least 24 wks and plasma [creatinine] changed by o 25%. COX immuno-staining was validated and assessed by numerical scoring (0 to 3). Ten or 20 representative renal structures (glomeruli (G), arterioles (aa), macula densa (MD), tubules (proximal (PT), distal (DT), Henle's Loop (LoH), collecting ducts (CD)) were assessed per section and the grade point average intensity (GPAI) calculated and compared between groups using the Kuskal Wallis test. In non-CKD cats, COX-1 immunostaining was seen in G, MD, DT and CD whereas COX-2 was seen in G, MD, PT and thick limb of the LoH. In general, CKD-P and CKD-NP showed significantly higher intensity COX-staining than young and old non-CKD cases (p o 0.013) but CKD-P did not differ from CKD-NP. This was true for COX-1 in the MD [CKD-NP 1.43(1.33-1.72); CKD-P 1.23(1.01-1.62) vs. young non-CKD 0.75(0.55-0.81); old non-CKD 0.82(0.8-1.13)], aa, PT and DT (data not shown). For COX-2 more intense staining was found in DT [CKD-NP 1.43(1.07-2.13); CKD-P 1.55(1.19-1.96) vs. young non-CKD 0.45(0.27-1.13); old non-CKD 0.86(0.42-1.09)], the thick limb of the LoH and CD (data not shown). Up-regulation of COX isoenzymes in feline CKD supports their involvement in the compensatory mechanisms activated by nephron loss. No association was found between COX enzyme expression and progression of CKD. Further functional studies are required to understand the physiological importance of COX enzymes in the feline kidney and in the compensatory mechanisms that accompany loss of nephrons with age and CKD. Plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration has previously been found to be elevated in cats with hypertensive ocular disease, with NT-proBNP ! 202.7 pmol/L being both specific and sensitive for the detection of hypertension. As yet no studies have investigated plasma NT-proBNP concentration in hypertensive cats without ocular lesions. Since, in the absence of evidence of end organ damage, it can be difficult to clinically differentiate truly hypertensive cats from those with 'whitecoat' hypertension, the aim of the present study was to investigate plasma NT-proBNP concentration as a diagnostic marker in these patients. Sixty two cats were included in this study and were subdivided into four groups comprising; 12 normal cats, 14 normotensive (renal) azotemic cats, 13 hypertensive cats without ocular lesions and 23 cats with hypertensive ocular damage. Renal azotemia was defined as plasma creatinine 4 2.0 mg/dl with a concurrent urine specific gravity of o 1.035. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured indirectly using a Doppler flow detector and SBP 4 170 mm Hg on multiple visits or in association with ocular lesions was taken as the definition of hypertension. Of the hypertensive cats only 3/13 (23.1%) without ocular lesions and 13/23 (56.5%) with hypertensive ocular lesions were azotemic. All cats were 4 8 years of age. Plasma samples used in this analysis had been stored at À80 degrees since collection and were analysed using a NT-proBNP assay (VETSIGN Feline Cardio-SCREEN proBNP; Guildhay Ltd.). NT-proBNP concentrations in the normal and diseased groups were compared using non parametric statistical tests (Kruskal Wallis Test followed by post-hoc analysis using Mann Whitney U tests). Continuous data are presented as median [25 th , 75 th percentile]. NT-proBNP concentrations were significantly higher in cats with hypertensive ocular lesions (180.1 [7.0, 632.4 ] pmol/L), than in hypertensive cats (o7.0 [o7.0, 7.1] pmol/L; P o 0.001) and normal cats (o 7.0 [o 7.0, o 7.0] pmol/L; P o 0.001). All cats with NT-proBNP concentration 4 202.7 pmol/L (n 5 11) had hypertensive ocular lesions. Of the cats with hypertensive ocular lesions, 6/6 (100%) of those with SBP o 220 mm Hg. None of the hypertensive cats without ocular lesions had NT-proBNP 4 202.7 pmol/L and only 2/13 of these cats had SBP 4 220 mm Hg. NT-proBNP concentrations are not significantly increased in hypertensive cats without ocular lesions. This may be because these cats are suffering from 'white-coat' hypertension or because they have less severe elevation in blood pressure or are less susceptible to end organ damage. Further studies using radiotelemetric implants to monitor blood pressure at home in hypertensive cats without ocular lesions are required to determine whether these cats have 'white-coat' hypertension. Determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most reliable test to evaluate kidney function. Many plasma clearance markers can be used to estimate GFR, though recently iohexol and creatinine have been proposed as easily applicable clearance markers. A previous preliminary study suggested differences between clearance techniques to be related to the range of GFR estimate (van Hoek et al., JFMS 2009; 11:1028 -1030 . This study aimed to compare plasma creatinine, exo-iohexol and endo-iohexol clearance tests in a larger population of cats with low, normal and high GFRs. Healthy cats and cats with hyperthyroidism (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) that underwent a plasma exogenous creaitinine-iohexol clearance test (PEC-ICT) at the University of Ghent were considered for inclusion. The PEC-ICT was performed as described by van Hoek et al. (JVIM 2007; 21:950-958) . Cats were included only once if multiple PEC-ICTs were performed at different time points. The effect of health status on GFR was evaluated with a general linear model. A general linear model and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare GFR estimates according to the used clearance marker. All tests were performed with statistical software (Systat) and at the 5% significance level. Forty-four cats were included and divided into 5 groups: 16 untreated HT cats, 6 DM cats, 10 CKD cats (6 were previously treated for HT, 1 cat had both CKD and DM), 6 young (7-12 months) healthy cats and 6 old (9-12 years) healthy cats. The mean GFR (expressed in mL/kg/min) was 2.33 AE 1.29 for exo-iohexol, 2.63 AE 1.39 for endo-iohexol and 2.65 AE 1.36 for creatinine clearance. The GFR estimates were significantly lower (P o 0.001) in the CKD group and higher (P o 0.001) in the HT group than in the other groups. A significant effect (P o 0.001) of the clearance marker on the GFR estimate was observed in healthy (young and old) and CKD cats, but not in HT and DM cats. The number of cats showing a difference in GFR estimate of 4 0.5 mL/min/kg or 4 25% was 17/44 and 14/44 between plasma creatinine and exo-iohexol clearance, 20/44 and 19/44 between plasma endo-iohexol and creatinine clearance and 25/44 and 19/44 between plasma endo-and exoiohexol clearance, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots comparing endo-iohexol with the other 2 markers showed the largest discrepancies. Plasma creatinine clearance values were most often higher than those for exo-iohexol. In conclusion, discrepancies between GFR testing methods may exist according to the clinical status of the animal. It is therefore recommended to use the same method during a patient's follow-up and separate cut-off values for each marker. Limited sampling strategies (LSS) to estimate feline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are poorly documented and mainly assessed in healthy cats and/or using only one clearance marker. This study aimed to propose LSS in cats with normal, decreased and increased GFR for plasma exo-iohexol, endo-iohexol and creatinine clearance. A combined plasma exogenous creatinine-iohexol clearance test was performed in 44 cats (16 hyperthyroid, 6 diabetic, 12 healthy, 10 with chronic kidney disease). The best LSS was determined by comparing 510 sampling time combinations to the entire 9 blood sampling times set for calculating AUC values by the trapezoidal rule. The maximum error was calculated for each best sampling time combination. Optimal sampling times for 2-sample plasma clearance are 60 and 360 minutes for endo-iohexol and 60 and 480 minutes for creatinine and exo-iohexol, with a maximum error of À36.9%, À24.6% and 33.8%, respectively. Optimal sampling times for 3-sample plasma clearance are 30, 180 and 600 minutes for creatinine and 30, 120 and 480 minutes for exo-and endo-iohexol, with a maximum error of 11.4%, À18.2% and 18.2%, respectively. Blood sampling timing is GFR marker dependent. The GFR estimate is more accurate for 3-sample compared to 2-sample plasma clearance for all markers. The error observed on GFR estimate was lower for LSS using creatinine as GFR marker. Canine immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is a pro-inflammatory disease with high mortality. However there is poor characterization of the inflammatory response in this disease and in particular, if the nature of the inflammatory process correlates with outcome. It was recently reported that acute phase proteins may be useful for monitoring disease activity, but the study did not provide prognostic information. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if excess pro-or anti-inflammatory cytokine activity related to specific cell populations and whether this was correlated with outcome in primary canine IMHA. We prospectively enrolled twenty client-owned dogs with primary IMHA. Entry criteria included anemia (PCV o 37%) in combination with autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs' test, or the presence of moderate to marked spherocytosis with no evidence of underlying disease. Six healthy dogs were included as controls. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture at admission. Serum cytokine activity was assessed by a canine-specific multiplex assay (CCYTO-90K, Millipore, USA) for Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon-gamma and Keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC). Thirty day mortality was recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare cytokine level in controls vs. IMHA patients and survivors vs. non-survivors. Logistic regression was used to assess which cytokines were independently predictive of outcome in this population. P o 0.05 was considered significant. Increased concentrations of several cytokines were observed in IMHA patients compared to controls; IL-2, IL-10, KC and MCP-1 representing a mixture of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines of various cellular origins. Thirty day mortality was 25% (5/20 dogs). Cytokines with prognostic significance were IL-15, IL-18, GM-CSF and MCP-1, which are all secreted by and strongly associated with macrophage/monocyte activity and recruitment. Logistic regression analyses suggest that increased IL-18 and MCP-1 concentrations are independently associated with mortality in this population. A mixed cytokine response is present in IMHA patients compared to controls. Importantly, the two independent predictors of outcome in this population, IL-18 and MCP-1 are both secreted by activated macrophages and are involved in activation of macrophages and recruitment of monocytes. Our data suggest that excessive levels of mediators of macrophage activity and recruitment may serve as prognostic indicators for poor outcome in canine primary IMHA. ability potentially due to a consumptive process might be a negative prognostic indicator in these dogs. Using TEG, this study aimed to prospectively characterise coagulation status in dogs with IMHA on immunosuppressive therapy over time and to identify if patients with relative hypocoagulability had a poorer prognosis. We prospectively enrolled thirty client-owned dogs with primary IMHA; diagnosed on the basis of anemia (PCV o 37%) in combination with autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs' test, or the presence of moderate to marked spherocytosis with no evidence of underlying disease. Patients with thrombocytopenia (o 100,000 platelets/ml), patients pre-treated with aspirin, clopidogrel or heparin or patients pre-treated with glucocorticoids for 4 3 days were excluded. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture at admission and again 3 and 5 days later. Assays included prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-dimers, fibrinogen, antithrombin activity (AT), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes and recalcified, unactivated thromboelastography (TEG). Values for reaction time (R), clot formation time (K), clot formation angle (a) and maximum amplitude (MA) were recorded from TEG tracings. TEG tracings were compared with those obtained from 30 healthy control dogs. At admission, canine IMHA patients had significantly shorter K times (p o 0.001), greater a angles (p o 0.001) and greater MA values (p o 0.001) than controls. Prior corticosteroid therapy did not significantly affect TEG values at admission. Between admission and day 5, R and K times and MA values reduced significantly (p 0.02) and a angles increased significantly (p 5 0.003). By day 5, all TEG variables were significantly different from controls (p 0.002). No significant correlations were identified between R time and PT or aPTT. MA values were strongly correlated with fibrinogen concentrations (R 5 0.785, p o 0.001) and moderately negatively correlated with PCV (R 5 À0.376, p 5 0.001). 83.3% dogs and 80% dogs survived to discharge and to 30 days respectively. At admission MA values were significantly higher in survivors than in non-survivors at discharge and at 30 days (p 0.016). Logistic regression analysis suggested each unit increase in MA was associated with an increased odds of 30-day survival of 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.25). All dogs showed evidence of a hypercoagulable state. All TEG variables changed significantly between admission and day 5 but TEG tracings remained consistent with a hypercoagulable state 5 days after starting immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with higher MA values at admission were more likely to survive to 30 days post hospital admission. Our data supports the hypothesis that relative hypocoagulability may be a negative prognostic indicator in these patients. Vaccination is often cited as a potential cause of immunemediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) in dogs. While this association has been documented in humans, particularly in children, this relationship has not been definitively established in dogs. This case-controlled study sought to document the presence of an association between recent vaccination and diagnosis of ITP in dogs and to evaluate whether vaccine type or number of vaccines administered were more likely to be associated with a diagnosis of ITP. The medical records of 44 dogs diagnosed with primary ITP at the Purdue University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (PUVTH) over a 14 year period were reviewed and age-matched to a randomly selected control group of 88 dogs that were presented for reasons other than immune-mediated disease. Dogs with primary ITP were defined as cases with a platelet count of o 40,000/mL and no discernible underlying cause of thrombocytopenia. The age, sex, and breed of patient and control groups were recorded. The time from vaccination to the date of presentation to the PUVTH, the type of vaccine given, and the number of vaccines given per visit for both groups were recorded and compared. The median age at presentation for dogs with ITP was 7 years (range: 2 to 15 years). The majority of the ITP group was comprised of mixed breed dogs (39.4%); no pure breed was represented by more than 2 cases. The number of patients that were vaccinated within 42 days of presentation to the PUVTH did not differ between cases of primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and the control group. There was 9.3% of the immune-mediated thrombocytopenia cases vaccinated within 42 days of presentation compared to 16.5% of the control dogs (p 5 0.25). The total volume of vaccine administered in the latest visit was not different between groups (p 5 0.41). These results do not support a temporal association between recent vaccination and the onset of primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Thromboembolic disease is a common and potentially fatal complication of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA), and thromboelastography (TEG) has been proposed as a means of identifying hypercoagulability. The objective of this study was to characterize TEG in dogs with IMHA before and after treatment with prednisone, azathioprine and aspirin, and to evaluate its potential role in predicting survival. Inclusion criteria for this prospective study were: informed client consent; moderate to severe anemia (hematocrit o 0.25 L/L), with evidence of spherocytosis and/or agglutination and/or positive Coombs test; no evidence of an underlying cause including neoplastic and infectious diseases. Exclusion criteria included pre-treatment for 4 48 hours with corticosteroids, or treatment with heparin or clopidogrel. Blood was sampled for TEG on the day of admission to the hospital (day 0), and every 48 hours for the duration of hospitalization. TEG was performed on citrated whole blood without activator. The TEG parameters R, maximum amplitude (MA), G, coagulation index (CI) and Cl30 (% clot amplitude at 30 minutes) were evaluated. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry profile were performed on all dogs, and coagulation profile, activated clotting time (ACT) and D-dimer concentration were performed when there was sufficient sample. All dogs were treated with prednisone (2 mg/kg/day PO) or dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg/day IV), azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day PO) and aspirin (0.5 mg/kg/day PO). Survival analysis was performed using Day 0 samples and a univariate logistical regression analysis. Twenty dogs were enrolled in the study. The overall mortality rate was 50% (10/20). 16/20 (80%) were hypercoagulable based on a CI 4 3. Of the dogs that died, only 2 had been discharged from hospital. TEG variables associated with mortality at 90 days, presented as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (OR[95%]), include decreased Venous thrombosis is a common finding in dogs with lymphoma. Routine coagulation assays are insensitive for the diagnosis of hype-rcoagulability. Thrombelastograph (TEG) is a point-of-care hemostatic analyzer that provides an overall view of coagulation and is sensitive for the diagnosis of hypercoagulability. We hypothesized that dogs with multicentric lymphoma have hypercoagulable TEG tracings and that alterations in TEG parameters would improve with the clinical state of remission. Our objective was to characterize TEG tracings in dogs with multicentric lymphoma from the time of diagnosis, throughout chemotherapy and at the point of clinical remission once chemotherapy was completed. Sixteen client-owned dogs with naturally occurring, newly diagnosed multicentric lymphoma have been evaluated in this prospective cohort study. All dogs were clinically staged and treated with one of two doxorubicin-based protocols. Complete blood count and TEG were run at 4 times points during the course of the disease. Fifty-six percent (9/16) of the dogs were hypercoagulable at initial presentation (G value 4 8.1 dyn/cm 2 ) and 19% were hypocoagulable (G o 4.9 dyn/cm 2 ). After induction therapy, 50% (8/16) were hypercoagulable and none were hypocoagulable. Once weaned off corticosteroids, but still during chemotherapy, 83% (10/12) were hypercoagulable and none were hypocoagulable. After achieving clinical remission and completing their chemotherapy protocol, 71% (5/7) were hypercoagulable and none were hypocoagulable. Although most dogs tended towards hypercoagulability (increased G value) during chemotherapy treatment, there were no statistical differences in TEG parameters when analyzed serially between visits (repeated measures ANOVA, p 4 0.05). At initial presentation, platelet count, hemoglobin and fibrinogen concentration correlated with G value. In summary, 75% of dogs with lymphoma present with a coagulopathy as detected by TEG with the majority of dogs becoming more hypercoagulable as treatment progressed. Clinical remission did not correlate with resolution of their hypercoagulable state. ABSTRACT #37 THE EFFECT OF STORAGE TEMPERATURE ON THROMBELASTROGRAPHY ENDPOINTS USING CITRAT-ED CANINE WHOLE BLOOD. AG Ralph, BM Brainard, J Pittman, B Babski, A Koenig. University of Georgia, Athens, GA. Storage temperature of citrated whole blood could alter thrombelastography (TEG) results through alterations in contact pathway activation. This study documents the effects of storage temperature of whole blood on TEG endpoints. We hypothesize that storage of blood at 371C for 30 minutes prior to TEG testing will result in a shorter reaction time (R value), as compared to blood stored at room temperature or at room temperature with a 5 minute prewarming of sample to 371C. Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture from ten healthy dogs using a 19 gauge butterfly catheter. Collection tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate were allowed to fill by vacuum, and randomly assigned to one of three groups prior to TEG testing: room temperature storage for 30 minutes, 371C storage for 30 minutes, or room temperature storage for 25 minutes with 5 minutes of pre-warming to 371C. All TEG samples were run at 371C using 20 mL of calcium chloride added to 340 mL of citrated whole blood. Groups were analyzed using a oneway ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA. There was no statistically significant difference between R values (mean 5 5.75 1/À 1.705 minutes; P 5 0.362), angles (mean 5 42.323 1/À 9.738 minutes; P 5 0.710), or maximal amplitudes (MA) (mean 5 53.247 1/À 6.043 minutes; P 5 0.289) for the three storage protocols. The temperature variables tested in this study resulted in similar endpoints on TEG testing, indicating that these temperatures all provide accurate results and are valid options. recognized in humans that develop thromboembolic complications despite appropriate therapy. Human aspirin resistance may potentially be associated with platelet cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which provides an alternative pathway to platelet COX-1 for thromboxane A 2 synthesis. Human platelets were not believed to contain COX-2 until recently, when the intracellular presence of the enzyme was demonstrated via flow cytometry of permeabilized platelets. COX-2 has not as yet been demonstrated in canine platelets. Our study was designed to determine if canine platelets express COX-2, and to evaluate the effects of aspirin on COX enzyme expression. Canine platelet COX-1 and COX-2 expression was quantified by flow cytometry. Platelets were permeabilized with a nonionic detergent to enable detection of intracellular COX-2. Platelets were evaluated in 8 healthy dogs before and after receiving aspirin for 10 days (anti-inflammatory dose, 10 mg/kg PO BID). COX-1 mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) increased in all dogs after aspirin administration, on average by 250% (range 63-476%). COX-2 MFI decreased in 6 dogs (average decrease 70%, range 56-80%), and increased in 2 dogs (increased by 8% & 116%). Washout values for COX-1 and COX-2 (2 weeks post-aspirin) approached baseline in most dogs. Platelet function was assessed by point-of-care analysis (Siemens PFA-100 s ) during aspirin administration, and was markedly impaired in all dogs (prolonged closure times, EPI cartridge). Our study demonstrated that canine platelets express both COX-1 and COX-2, and that aspirin affects expression of both isoforms. Interestingly, aspirin caused increased COX-1 expression despite impairment of platelet function. Since our assay measured enzyme expression rather than function, increased COX-1 expression may be a response to aspirin-induced impairment of enzyme function. COX-2 expression tended to decrease in response to aspirin, but varied markedly between individual dogs. Individual variations in platelet COX-2 expression in response to aspirin implicate variable responsiveness of the COX isoforms as a potential mechanism for aspirin resistance in dogs. Further investigation of the effects of aspirin at both high and low doses on COX expression and function (including thromboxane synthesis) is warranted in both normal dogs and clinic patients. Cyclosporine has become increasingly popular for treating canine immune-mediated diseases such as immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). Cyclosporine has been shown to increase platelet procoagulant activity in humans, and may predispose to thromboembolic complications. Our study evaluated the effect of cyclosporine on platelet procoagulant activity in normal dogs. Platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometric evaluation of platelet P-selectin, phosphatidylserine, COX-1, and COX-2. Platelet function was assessed via point-of-care analysis (Siemens PFA-100 s ), and clot formation was evaluated via viscoelastometry (Si-enco SonoClot s ). Platelets were evaluated before and after immunosuppressive doses of cyclosporine were given for 1 week (8 dogs; starting @ 10 mg/kg PO bid, dose adjusted to trough blood levels 4 600 ng/mL); and again after 1 week of a cyclosporine dose approved for canine atopy (7 dogs; 5 mg/kg PO sid). Mean expression of P-selectin decreased by 36% after a week of high dose cyclosporine, and by 29% at low dose. Mean phosphatidylserine expression decreased by 58% at high dose, and increased by 6% at low dose. Mean COX-1 decreased by 35% and 2% after a week at high and low dose, respectively, and mean COX-2 decreased by 31% at both doses, although on the 1 st day of therapy at high doses there was a transient rise in COX-2 two hours after the 1 st dose. Mean PFA-100 s closure times using ADP cartridges increased by 61% at high dose, and decreased by 45% at low dose. Mean PFA-100 s closure times using epinephrine cartridges increased by 26% and 21% at high and low doses, respectively. No significant change in SonoClot s results was seen. Unlike human studies, our study suggests that cyclosporine does not tend to cause an increase in platelet reactivity during the first week of drug administration in dogs. Individual dog-to-dog variable responsiveness to cyclosporine may explain variations in drug pharmacodynamics, platelet thromboxane receptor function, thromboxane-mediated degranulation, and P-selectin expression. Further investigation of the effects of cyclosporine on platelet procoagulant activity with chronic administration is warranted both in normal dogs and in clinic patients. This study documents the effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 5 mg/kg PO q48 h) and meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q24 h) on feline platelet aggregation. Each medication was given to 8 cats for 14 days in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over design. It was hypothesized that both NSAIDs would decrease platelet aggregation. Outcome measures included oral mucosal bleeding time (OMBT) and whole blood (impedance) aggregometry (WBA) using adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 10 mM) and collagen (5 mg/mL) as agonists. WBA was performed before drug administration on days 0, 7, 15, and 17. OMBT was measured on days 0 and 15. Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture using vacuum into tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate. Groups were compared using repeated measures or paired tests appropriate for comparison and data distribution. Compared to baseline, neither medication affected WBA at any time point. There was no difference between baseline WBA (ADP: 12.6 AE 5.7 ohm, Collagen: 22.9 AE 7.8 ohm) in any group (P 5 0.190). Baseline OMBT did not differ between groups, and did not change from baseline in the placebo and meloxicam groups. OMBT, however, was significantly shorter on day 15 in the ASA group (from 73 AE 20 to 53 AE 7.5 sec, P 5 0.03). Platelet counts were stable for the study duration. At the doses studied, neither meloxicam nor ASA had an inhibitory effect on WBA or OMBT in cats. The use of ASA at the tested dose for platelet inhibition in cats should be reconsidered. In-hospital diagnostic testing allows the practitioner to make rapid assessments and provide timely interventions. This is especially important in medical oncology where a CBC is performed prior to administration of each dosage of chemotherapy and patients are typically treated on an out-patient basis. Prior to administration of chemotherapy in dogs it is important to determine HCT, platelet count, total WBC count and neutrophil count in a rapid manner. Impedance counter hematology instruments have traditionally been favored in oncology practices for their speed. Counts are performed based on cell size, thus the main draw back is poor accuracy. This is of particular concern in patients receiving chemotherapy since both the toxic nature of chemotherapy drugs on blood cells and the cancer itself can result in cytopenias, leukemias and other changes in blood cell morphology that may interfere with the accuracy of an impedance counter. A new hematology analyzer (IDEXX ProCyte Dx TM ) that uses laser flow cytometry and optical fluorescence in addition to impedance technology is under development as a point-of-care hematology analyzer. The CBC is performed on 30 mL of whole blood in less than 2 minutes. The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation of HCT, WBC, neutrophil count, and platelet count between the new IDEXX ProCyte Dx and the reference laboratory, in patients receiving chemotherapy. Fresh EDTA anti-coagulated venous blood samples were collected from 80 dogs receiving chemotherapy at Gulf Coast Veterinary Specialists. Samples were run on the ProCyte Dx running developmental software within 2 hours and at the IDEXX Reference Laboratory (Sysmex XT-2000i V Automated Hematology Analyzer) in Dallas, TX within 12 to 24 hours of collection. All instruments were maintained according to manufacturer's specifications, including handling of test materials and performance of quality control procedures. The regression scatter plot for the paired results showed a high degree of association between the two methods for all 4 parameters evaluated. Results were compared by Deming Regression and Bland-Altman plots using EP Evaluator v8. Correlation coefficients (R) and root mean square error (SEE) were: HCT (R 5 0.958, SEE 5 1.680), WBC count (R 5 0.995, SEE 5 0.495), neutrophil count (R 5 0.992, SEE 5 0.565), and platelet count (R 5 0.951, SEE 5 41.8). The results suggest that the IDEXX ProCyte Dx is a reliable hematology analyzer that provides rapid and accurate results on a minimal volume of blood, even in patients undergoing chemotherapy or with leukemia. It had excellent correlation with the reference laboratory for HCT, WBC, and neutrophil counts and very good correlation for platelet counts. Evaluation of both a bone marrow aspirate and core is indicated for some dogs with hematologic disease. A combined technique for collecting both specimens from the same site can be performed by advancing a core biopsy needle through the cortex, aspirating, and then advancing the needle to obtain the core. Advantages include decreased procedural time, material costs and patient discomfort compared with independent collection. However, gross and histologic distortion of core specimens has been documented in people. The aim of this study was to determine if core biopsy preceeded by aspiration (combined technique) results in a core of decreased histologic quality compared with one obtained without pre-aspiration (direct technique). Jamshidi needles were used to collect biopsies from 26 dogs immediately following euthanasia. Combined and direct techniques were performed on opposite humeri of the same dogs, with side and order randomized. Failed biopsy attempts were not repeated. Slides were prepared routinely, cut along the long axis of the core. Slides were evaluated in random order and blindly by a clinical pathologist (CBG) using a novel scoring system for predetermined criteria. The two slides from each dog were then paired (collection method masked) and overall histologic quality subjectively assessed to identify relative inferiority of either specimen. Comparisons involving numerical data were made by paired t-test for normally distributed data, or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Overall histologic quality was compared using Chi-square analysis (relatively inferior vs. not relatively inferior). A p value o 0.05 was considered significant. Biopsies were unsuccessful in 4 of 26 (15%) dogs when using the combined technique and in 1 dog (4%) with the direct technique. Histologic comparisons were performed on 22 pairs of cores. Length of actual marrow obtained as measured on stained slides was significantly smaller using the combined technique (mean AE SD, 9.8 AE 5.6 mm) compared with the direct technique (13.7 AE 6.3 mm; p 5 0.011). Specimens from the combined technique were of inferior overall quality compared with those from the direct technique (p 5 0.015). Combined-technique cores were considered inferior in 14 dogs and not inferior in 8 dogs (similar in 2 dogs, superior in 6 dogs). Features that contributed to consideration of relative inferiority included intramedullary hemorrhage, crush or fragmentation of specimen, and zones of decreased or absent cellularity. No differences were identified between techniques for overall cellularity, megakaryocyte count, M:E ratio, or iron stores. In conclusion, the combined technique of marrow collection yields core specimens with significantly shorter marrow length and poorer overall histologic quality compared with those obtained by the direct technique. Sternal bone marrow aspiration in the dog is reported to be simple to perform, less painful than humeral or ilial aspiration, and to yield quality samples. It does not appear to have widespread clinical use. In this study the feasibility, safety, and sample quality of sternal aspiration in small dogs were investigated. Bone marrow aspirates were obtained by the same investigator from three sites in a randomized order from 17 clinically healthy beagles (weight range 6.5-11 kg), under general anesthesia following terminal abdominal surgery. For sternal aspirates, dogs were positioned in sternal recumbency and a 1-inch, 22-23 ga hypodermic needle attached to a 12cc syringe was inserted into the cranial manubrium, directed caudally along the long axis of the sternum. Aspirates for comparison were obtained from the greater tubercle of the right humerus and right iliac crest using an 18 ga Rosenthal needle attached to a 12cc syringe. Difficulty of site localization, needle insertion and advancement, and specimen aspiration, were scored from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). Bone marrow smears were prepared by one investigator, and these were subsequently reviewed by a pathologist blinded to aspiration site and dog. Sample quality was scored from 0 (no marrow particles) to 5 (excellent) according to the number of wellsmeared marrow particles on the slide. Cellularity of the particles was scored from 1 (4 75% fat) to 3 (o 25% fat). Necropsies were performed to examine aspiration sites and for evidence of pneumothorax. Results [mean AE SE (range)] were: Megakaryocyte and lymphocyte/plasma cell proportions, myeloid:erythroid ratios, and iron stores were discordant between each site (Kappa), however still within reference intervals. At necropsy, sternal needle tracks could not be identified and there were no signs of pneumothorax. In conclusion: 1) Sternal aspiration of bone marrow using a 22-23 ga hypodermic needle is easier to perform than humeral and iliac aspiration and is safe in small dogs. 2) Sternal aspiration provides samples of equivalent quality to humeral and iliac samples in clinically normal dogs. IH is reported to occur in some cats following treatment of hyperthyroidism (HTH). Hypothyroidism reduces GFR in other species, therefore IH could contribute to the development of azotemia in hyperthyroid cats with underlying mild chronic kidney disease. Our hypothesis was that the incidence of post treatment azotemia would be greater in cats with IH than euthyroid cats. Records from two London-based first opinion clinics between 1999 and 2009 were reviewed to identify cats diagnosed with HTH without pre-treatment azotemia. Baseline age and plasma creatinine concentration was recorded. HTH was treated using anti-thyroid medication alone or in combination with thyroidectomy. Cats were monitored for the development of azotemia over a six month follow up period, and at the final visit the following plasma biochemical and physical examination data were recorded; total thyroxine (TT4) concentration, cholesterol concentration, creatinine concentration, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities, packed cell volume (PCV), heart rate and body weight. Only cats with a TT4 o 40 nmol/l at the end of the follow up period were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Plasma TSH concentrations at the same time point were measured using the Immulite canine TSH assay. IH was defined as TT4 o 10 nmol/l in combination with TSH 4 0.15 ng/ml. Cats of uncertain thyroid status (TT4 10-40 nmol/l and TSH 4 0.15 ng/ml) were excluded from the analysis. The Fisher's Exact Test was used to compare the proportion of cats with azotemia between the IH and euthyroid groups. Continuous data are presented as median [25 th , 75 th percentile]. Clinicopathological parameters were compared between the IH and euthyroid groups using the Mann Whitney U test. Statistical significance was defined as P o 0.05. Eighty-one cats were eligible for the study, of which 28 were classified with IH and 48 as euthyroid. Five cats were excluded as they were of uncertain thyroid status. No significant difference in age (P 5 0.063) or plasma creatinine concentration (P 5 0.963) at baseline was present between the two groups. Sixteen cats with IH (57%; 95% CI 39-75%) and fourteen euthyroid cats (29%; 95% CI 16-42%) developed azotemia. The proportion of cats with azotemia in the IH group was significantly greater than the euthyroid group (P 5 0.028). Cats with IH had significantly lower plasma alkaline phosphatase activity (21 [14, 41] In human medicine recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) increases the thyroid radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) allowing radioiodine ( 131 I) dose reduction and higher efficacy in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer and multinodular goiter. It can be expected that rhTSH has a similar effect in dogs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of rhTSH, administered 24 h and 48 h before radioiodine ( 123 I), on the thyroid RAIU in healthy dogs. 7 euthyroid healthy beagles were randomly divided in 3 groups in a prospective, blinded, cross-over study. On week 1, one group received 123 I for a baseline RAIU, one group received 100 mg of rhTSH IV 24 h before 123 I and one group received 100 mg of rhTSH IV 48 h before 123 I. All dogs received 37 MBq of radioactive 123 I IV and thyroid RAIU was determined 8 h, 24 h and 48 h thereafter. The study was designed in such a manner that each dog received the 3 treatments and a wash-out period of 3 weeks was respected between them. Blood samples were taken for measurement of serum total thyroxine (TT4) at baseline, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h after rhTSH administration. rhTSH caused no significant change on thyroid RAIU. The overall mean thyroid RAIU significantly decreased during the study independent of the treatment. rhTSH significantly increased serum TT4 concentration, which peaked 6 h after rhTSH administration. No adverse effects of rhTSH were observed during the study. Results suggest that 100 mg of rhTSH administered IV 24 h or 48 h before radioiodine have no influence on thyroid RAIU in healthy dogs. Further studies are needed to determine the best timing, dosage and route of rhTSH administration in healthy and thyroid carcinoma dogs. Previously Trilostane is licensed in the USA for dogs with hyperadrenocorticism. Although the brand product (Vetoryl s ) is widely available, many independent pharmacies market compounded formulations. Compounded trilostane was purchased from eight pharmacies. Twelve separate orders were placed with each over a six week period. Every order consisted of 30 capsules of 15 mg, 45 mg or 100 mg trilostane. Upon receipt, purchases were placed in unmarked vials and assigned a random identification code. For controls, a licensed pharmacist prepared capsules containing inert material (0 mg trilostane) or 15 mg of the brand product. These were placed in batches of 30 and labeled similarly to the compounded products. Four batches of Vetoryl 30 mg and Vetoryl 60 mg were also re-packaged and submitted as controls. Ninety-six batches of compounded trilostane and 16 control batches were submitted for analysis; 2 or 3 capsules from each batch of 30 were randomly selected for determination of content. No trilostane was detected in the 0 mg controls; these were excluded from further analysis. The averaged percentage of label claim (%LC) for the each batch of compounded product ranged from 39-152.6%, with a mean of 97.0%. In all, 20.5% of compounded capsules contained o 85% or 4 115% of LC. The averaged %LC for the active ingredient control batches (n 5 12) was 96.1-99.6%, with a mean of 97.7%. The variance for the compounded product (234.65) was significantly different (P o 0.0001) compared to that of the control samples (1.27). In addition, there was substantial variation in averaged %LC from one batch to the next from particular pharmacies, e.g., a 45 mg capsule may contain either 17.5 mg or 56 mg of active ingredient. These results indicate substantial unreliability in product content for compounded trilostane. In addition, substantial batch-to-batch variability was documented. Both factors may impact treatment outcome. Current testing for serum aldosterone uses a 5 mg/kg dose of Cortrosyn with sampling before and at 60 minutes post. Preliminary studies showed that a 1 mg/kg dose of Cortrosyn yields peak aldosterone concentrations at approximately 20 minutes. Thus, with the current test protocol, the peak concentration of aldosterone secretion may not be accurately being measured, making the current test non-diagnostic. The purpose of our study was to determine the ACTH dose necessary to maximally stimulate aldosterone secretion as well as to determine the time of maximal aldosterone response in relation to the dose administered. Ten healthy, privately owned dogs were used. The dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups. ACTH (Cortrosyn) was administered at 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg intravenously. Each group received a different dose of ACTH each day of the study with a washout period of at least 2 days in between injections. Three milliliters of blood were collected from the jugular vein before and 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 minutes after Cortrosyn administration. Samples were placed in a red-top tube and were centrifuged after clotting; the serum was separated and stored at À801C until analyzed by a previously validated radioimmunoassay (Coat-a-count aldosterone assay). Data were analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA with time and dose as the main effects. Since no dose effect was detected, the data were pooled and further analysis performed by repeated measures ANOVA on ranked data. Post hoc comparisons were done with the Tukey test. Significance was set at p 0.05. A significant increase in serum aldosterone concentration was found at all times in comparison to baseline. Serum aldosterone concentrations were consistently increased in each dog after administration of Cortrosyn. The concentrations at peak were approximately five fold that of baseline. The peak concentration for all doses was obtained at 30 minutes post-injection and was significantly higher than concentrations measured at 10, 60 and 90 minutes. In conclusion, 5 mg/kg cosyntropin was the minimum dose in the study that stimulated maximal serum aldosterone concentration. Serum aldosterone concentrations were consistently increased in each dog. The time of peak response was at 30 minutes, which is different from the 60-min sampling time currently recommended and suggests current testing protocols may be suboptimal. Previously presented at Auburn University, Phi Zeta Presentation. Defining treatment success in veterinary diabetes mellitus (DM) is generally limited to diminishing DM related clinical signs as well as demonstrating reductions in average blood glucose values. This study reports the design and application of a novel individualized, patient and owner-centered survey measuring perceived impact of DM on quality of life (QoL) of diabetic cats and their owners. Discussions and pilot-surveys were conducted with veterinarians, diabetic cat owners and human DM QoL survey designers, leading to the design of 29 specific DM-associated QoL questions (DIA-QoL-pet). Each item was scored according to frequency with which it impacts upon lives of owners and their cat (range: all the time...never) and perceived importance (range: very important . . . not at all important). The Item-Weighted-Impact-Score (IWIS) for each item was calculated by multiplying frequency and importance ratings; the Average-Weighted-Impact-Score (AWIS) by averaging all IWISs. Two overview questions measured overall QoL and diabetes-dependent-QoL. 221 owners of insulin-treated diabetic cats completed the survey. 87% of respondents originated from the UK and USA. The cats' average age was 12.41/À3.1years (mean1/ Àstandard deviation); body weight 5.71/À1.9 kg; 64% were domestic short or long hair. Average insulin dose was 0.471/À0.5 iu/kg and 82% received insulin 12 hourly. The 29-item DIAQoL-pet had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach a50.89) and could be summarized into an AWIS of À1.761/À2.4. Areas reported as most negatively impacting on QoL (based on IWIS) included: 'boarding difficulties' (À4.671/À5.3), 'owner wanting more control over DM' (À4.341/À4.7), 'difficulties leaving cat with friends/ family' (À4.211/À4.7), 'worry about cat's DM' (À4.101/À3.9), 'hypoglycemia worry' (À3.671/À3.5), 'adapting social life' (À3.481/À3.9), 'DM-related costs' (À3.041/À3.8), 'adapting work life' (À3.031/À3.7), 'pet's moods' (À2.871/À2.9) and 'limiting activities like holidays' (À2.811/À3.9). 51% considered their cat's present QoL 'as good as it could possibly be'; 49% felt their cat's life would be 'a little better' without DM. The DIAQoL-pet showed high internal consistency reliability and identified specific areas most negatively impacting on the QoL of a group of diabetic cats and their owners. This tool may prove useful for clinical use and whilst testing new diabetic treatment options. Previously Use of low-dose ACTH stimulation testing may be important in diagnosing mild degrees of adrenocortical insufficiency and a new syndrome, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (formerly known as relative adrenal insufficiency), which has been recognized in critically ill human and veterinary patients. Both 0.5 and 5 mg/kg doses of cosyntropin cause maximal adrenal stimulation with regard to serum cortisol concentrations in healthy dogs. The purpose of this study was to determine if low-dose ACTH stimulation testing was as accurate as standard-dose ACTH stimulation testing in determining adrenal function in critically ill dogs. Two dose-response trials were performed in 35 critically ill dogs admitted to the ICU at Auburn University, North Carolina State University, or Washington State University which had diagnoses of sepsis, trauma, or GDV. The same dose-response trials were also performed in 10 clinically healthy dogs. Each dog was given 0.5 and 5 mg/kg of cosyntropin IV with a 3-hour wash out period between doses. Blood samples for determination of serum total and free cortisol concentrations were obtained before and at 60 minutes after each cosyntropin administration. Samples were centrifuged after clotting, and the serum was separated and stored at À20C until analysis. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test, and Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks as appropriate. Post-hoc analysis was performed using Dunn's Method; significance was set at the p 0.05 level. In the critically ill dogs, median post-ACTH serum total and free cortisol concentrations did not differ between doses. Every critically ill patient that was identified to have insufficient adrenal function (ACTH-stimulated serum total or free cortisol concentration below the reference range or no response to stimulation) by the standarddose ACTH stimulation test was also identified by the low-dose test. Six additional dogs were identified with adrenal insufficiency by the low-dose ACTH stimulation test, which were not identified by the standard-dose test. Median post-ACTH serum free cortisol differed significantly for the 0.5 mg/kg dose when septic dogs were compared to trauma dogs. Median post-ACTH serum total and free cortisol concentrations differed significantly for both cosyntropin doses when critically ill dogs were compared to healthy dogs. In conclusion, cosyntropin administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg IV appears to be at least as accurate as the administration of 5 mg/kg cosyntropin in determining adrenal function in critically ill dogs. In fact, the low-dose ACTH stimulation test may be more sensitive in detecting mild degrees of adrenal insufficiency in ill dogs. The purpose of this study was to characterize urine sodium concentrations in hyponatremic dogs with and without hypoadrenocorticism. In the hyponatremic state, the kidneys should conserve sodium; expected urine sodium concentrations are less than 25 mEq/L. However, in the case of aldosterone deficiency, the kidneys cannot conserve sodium; urine sodium concentrations are increased. Medical records of hyponatremic dogs that had urine sodium concentrations measured were reviewed. Dogs were excluded if diuretics, mineralocorticoids, or intravenous or subcutaneous fluids were administered prior to urine collection. Fifteen dogs were included; 7 were diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism and 8 were diagnosed with hyponatremia of other etiology (control), including pyelonephritis, biliary mucocele, diabetic ketoacidosis, and heart disease. A Wilcoxon sum rank test was used to compare results between groups. Median urine sodium concentrations in hypoadrenocortical dogs was 125 mEq/L (interquartile range (IQR): 76.5-188.5) and in control dogs was 22 mEq/L (IQR: 7.5-58). Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism had significantly higher median urine sodium concentrations than control dogs (P 5 0.004). Diagnoses of the two control dogs with urine sodium 4 25 mEq/L included diabetic ketoacidosis with pyelonephritis, and biliary mucocele. These results suggest that urine sodium concentrations can be used to help to characterize the etiology of hyponatremia in dogs. Measurement of a single urine sodium concentration 4 25 mEq/L in a hyponatremic dog is supportive of, but not diagnostic for, hypoadrenocorticism. The pathophysiology of canine diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is incompletely understood. Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines has been documented in humans with DKA or poorly regulated type I diabetes. The purpose of this study was to compare cytokine, chemokine and hormone concentrations in dogs with DKA before and after resolution of ketoacidosis, and to compare concentrations before treatment of DKA to those measured in dogs with uncomplicated diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy dogs. GMCSF, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, IFNa˜, IP-10, TNFa, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Keratinocytederived chemokine (KC), GLP-1, glucagon, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin were assayed using the Milliplex MAP Canine kits (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). 27 dogs were enrolled (9 DKA, 9 DM, and 9 healthy age-matched dogs). Inclusion criteria for the DKA group included a blood b-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) concentration ! 2.0 mmol/L and a venous pH o 7.35. Dogs in the DM group had a blood BOHB concentration o 2.0 mmol/L and a venous pH ! 7.35. Data are presented as median (min-max) and all concentrations are in pg/ml. Resistin concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with DKA before treatment compared to after resolution of ketoacidosis and compared to healthy controls (65,430.9 (13,096.9-158,563) vs. 45,905.9 (9,105.6-135,108 .1), p 5 0. 046 and 18,424.5 (9,629.5-28,978 .7), p 5 0.004, respectively). IL-2 and IL-18 were significantly higher in dogs with DKA before treatment compared to after resolution of ketoacidosis .7) vs. 5.6 (1.7-248.0), p 5 0.028 IL-18: 32.1 (8.9-305.2) vs. 26.6 (4.4-155.5), p 5 0.025). GMCSF was significantly lower in dogs with DKA before treatment compared to after resolution of ketoacidosis (67.2 (20.9-247.9) vs. 69.5 (20.9-225.8 ) p 5 0.046). IL-8 was significantly higher in dogs with DKA (3,077.2 (1,089.6-18,059.7), p 5 0.001) and DM (2, 591.7 (1, 583 .0), p 5 0.009) compared to healthy controls (1,064.7 (827.8-1,906.7)). MCP-1 was also significantly higher in dogs with .1), p 5 0.019) and ), p 5 0.012) compared to healthy controls (100.9 (64.9-393.6)). KC was significantly higher in DKA dogs (2,032.4 (1,173.4-4,163 .8)) compared to 579 .0), p 5 0.019) and healthy controls (634.7 (221.5-982.5), p 5 0.003). Significant differences were not detected in concentrations of the other analytes that were measured. In conclusion, KC and resistin were higher in DKA dogs compared to DM and healthy control dogs. Resolution of ketoacidosis resulted in significant decreases in resistin, IL-2, and IL-18. IL-8 and MCP-1 were higher in all diabetic dogs compared to healthy control dogs. GMCSF was higher at resolution of ketoacidosis. Dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and hormone concentrations may be involved in the pathogenesis of DKA and DM, in dogs. Therapies recommended for treatment of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) in cats and the reported survival rates (78-82%) have not changed substantially in 20 years. There is no short-acting insulin registered for feline use and historically regular (crystalline) insulin is used for DKA. The glucose lowering effects of intravenous glargine and regular insulin in human patients are similar. The aim of this report is to describe outcome of administering glargine intramuscularly (IM) with or without subcutaneous (SC) glargine for initial stabilization of DKA in cats. The study involved a retrospective case series presented to an exclusively feline veterinary clinic. Included cases had a diagnosis of DKA and were initially treated with IM glargine with or without SC glargine. Cats were diagnosed with DKA when the blood glucose concentration was greater than 16 mmol/L and signs of systemic illness, glycosuria (3-41), ketosis (ketonuria and/or ketonemia (betahydroxybutyrate 4 0.6 mmol/L)) and acidosis (serum bicarbonate o 12 mmol/L) were evident. Approximately half the cases (7/15) were primary access and half were referrals. The protocol for insulin therapy using glargine was adapted from published protocols using regular insulin IM for managing DKA in cats, but substituting glargine. Initial IM and SC doses of glargine were calculated on a per cat basis rather than per kg or on the degree of hyperglycemia. All cats were initially administered intramuscular glargine (1-2 U) and in 12/ 15 cats this was combined with SC glargine (1-3 U); in 3/15 cats SC glargine was begun later. Intermittent IM glargine was administered as required 2-22 hours later and SC glargine (1-2 U) every 12 hrs. Cats were managed with subcutaneous glargine alone once appetite returned and dehydration had resolved. The outcome of using glargine IM in the initial stabilization of DKA cats was considered successful if ketosis resolved, appetite returned and the cat was discharged from hospital on SC glargine and survived for more than two weeks without requiring re-admission to hospital for management of DKA or related complications. All 15 cats survived and were discharged from hospital (median 4 days; range 2-5 days) and one third (5/15) of cats surviving to discharge subsequently achieved remission (median time 20 days; range 15-29 days). Of the 12 cats treated with intermittent IM and SC glargine from the outset, half (6/12) were managed with SC glargine as their sole insulin therapy within 18 hrs. This study demonstrates that glargine administered intramuscularly is an effective treatment for DKA in cats, and thus provides an alternative to regular insulin. It may also be more cost effective for owners because the same vial used for initial treatment of DKA can then be used for later management with subcutaneous glargine injections. A prospective randomized controlled trial is required to compare outcomes for intramuscular and intravenous administration of glargine and regular insulin in DKA cats. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a severe complication of diabetes mellitus with intensive treatment frequently required for a successful outcome. In people with DKA, studies have demonstrated the efficacy of subcutaneous (SQ) rather than intravenous administration of fast-acting insulin, thereby avoiding the costs of admission to the ICU and minimizing the length of hospital stay. A study in children with DKA has shown that the addition of subcutaneous insulin glargine to a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of regular insulin has led to a faster resolution of acidosis. The purpose of this study was to compare a simplfied regimen of intramuscular regular insulin and SQ insulin glargine to a CRI regular insulin protocol in cats with DKA. Cats presenting with DKA defined as a metabolic acidosis accompaning hyperglycemia and ketonuria or ketonemia, were eligible for inclusion. Newly and previously diagnosed diabetics were included. Cats were randomized to receive insulin therapy with either a CRI of regular insulin adjusted via a sliding scale (CRI group) or a simplified protocol which included glargine insulin SQ twice daily and intramuscular regular insulin up to every 8 hours (Intermittent group). The primary endpoint was defined as time to resolution of metabolic acidosis, with secondary objectives including 1) Duration of hospitalization, 2) Nadir of hematocrit, 3) Hours until resolution of ketonemia. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared using independent t-tests while changes between the two groups over time were compared using ANOVA with repeated measures with a p o 0.05 considered significant. Sixteen cats were enrolled (n 5 8/group). There was no significant difference in age, weight, sex, pH at admission, ketonemia, or chemistry profile and complete blood count results between the two groups at baseline. Eleven of the sixteen cats enrolled in the study survived to discharge (CRI: n 5 6; Intermittent: n 5 5; p 5 0.29). Cats in the intermittent group had a significantly faster time to resolution of metabolic acidosis [median 5 16 hr (range, 6-28 hr)] compared to the CRI group [median 5 38 hr (range, 11-96 hr); p 5 0.02]. No significant differences were detected between the two groups for hospitalization time (p 5 0.10), nadir of the hematocrit (p 5 0.65), or resolution of ketonemia (p 5 0.50). These data support the use of an intermittent protocol with a long-acting insulin for cats with DKA. The intermittent protocol resulted in faster resolution of metabolic acidosis and was simple, likely requiring less technical time and supplies than the CRI protocol. These results support a more simplified but effective approach to treating cats with DKA that may be more cost-efficient for owners. Obesity predisposes to a prothrombotic state in humans, but whether obesity affect hemostasis in animals is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in hemostatic parameters including thromboelastography (TEG) between lean, overweight and obese client owned indoor confined physically inactive cats. Following health screening by physical examination, urinalysis, hematology, coagulation and biochemical profiles, 73 cats (35 males and 38 females) were included in the study and informed consents were obtained. All cats were anaesthetized and body fat percentage (BF) was measured using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorbtiometry. A TEG analysis was performed with tissue factor (1:50,000) as activator. Data distribution was assessed using D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. The correlation between BF and individual TEG and traditional coagulation parameters (platelet count, PT, APTT, fibrinogen and D-dimer) was evaluated using Pearsons Rank Test. Significant difference between lean (BF o 30%, n 5 12), overweight (30% o BF o 40%, n 5 25) and obese (BF 4 40%, n 5 36) cats were identified using ANOVA. Results are given as Median (range). BF correlated positively with the rate of clot formation (a, P o 0.03) and absolute clot strength (MA, P o 0.002). Rate of initial fibrin formation (R) was fastest in obese cats (9.4 min (3.4-17) vs 11.5 min (3.9-20.5), pooled lean and overweight cats, P o 0.05). Significance was not achieved for other TEG parameters or traditional hemostasis parameters. In conclusion, Obesity in cats is associated with a hypercoagulable state as measured by TEG and it is defined by both faster clot formation and increased clot strength. This may be linked to obesity-related low grade inflammation. IMHA is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in dogs. Genetic predisposition and triggers such as infection, neoplasia or drugs mediate the loss of immunological self-tolerance. IMHA is deemed ''idiopathic'' when no underlying cause is found. Idiopathic IMHA is seasonal in the Eastern US, suggesting undetected environmental triggers. It is not known if idiopathic IMHA is seasonal in Southern California. Underlying disease testing often includes a serologic ''tick panel'' or a vector-borne disease PCR panel. However, causative agents may be excluded by such grouping. Furthermore the sensitivity of serology and PCR depend on the pathophysiology of the organism. For some organisms infection may be missed when testing is limited to one methodology. We hypothesized that idiopathic IMHA is seasonal in Southern California, and that Babesia, Bartonella, Mycoplasma spp and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (organisms associated with IMHA) are not included vector-borne disease screening (VBDS) as often as Rickettsia rickettsii, Borrelia burgdorferi (organisms not associated with IMHA) and Ehrlichia canis. To investigate the seasonality of idiopathic IMHA, cases were identified by searching patient databases from two large referral practices in San Diego and Los Angeles. Dogs presenting between June 2006 and June 2009 were included. Those with underlying disease were excluded. Increased incidence was predicted for May, June, July, September, October and November. To determine the frequency of VBDS, records of IMHA cases in Western University's student case log database for 7 affiliate teaching hospitals were examined. Anemia and spherocytosis, autoagglutination, or a positive Coomb's test were required for inclusion in both parts of the study. 25 cases of idiopathic IMHA occurred in the predicted months, while 11 cases occurred in other months (Chi squared test corrected for continuity, p o 0.05). 26 cases of IMHA were screened for vector borne disease. E canis (n 5 25), B burgdorferi (n 5 25) and R rickettsii (n 5 23) were tested for nearly twice as often as other organisms. No patient was tested using both serology and PCR. We conclude the incidence of idiopathic IMHA is seasonally variable in Southern California. Some causative organisms may be overlooked using currently available ''panels'' packaged by groups of organisms and methodology. The role of undetected tickborne illness in dogs with idiopathic IMHA deserves further investigation. Greyhounds have several clinicopathologic peculiarities that differ from other dog breeds. Since the adoption of retired racers is increasing every year, the knowledge of reference values in healthy Greyhounds is vital in daily clinical practice. Some biochemical values were reported decades ago in actively racing Greyhounds but, to our knowledge, values for full chemistry and acid/base panel have not been published in healthy retired racers using a critical care analyzer. The purpose of this study was to assess differences when compared to other breeds. Samples were obtained from the jugular vein of healthy adult dogs (57 Greyhounds and 30 non Greyhounds) and placed into heparinized tubes. Chemistry full panel was performed with a Stat Profile s Critical Care Xpress Analyzer (Nova biomedical, Waltham, MA). Results obtained for each group were compared statistically using unpaired ttest or Mann-Whitney test, depending upon normality of the sample. Greyhounds had lower potassium (p 5 0.0376; median, 3.930 mmol/L), ionized calcium (p o 0.0001; mean, 4.616 mg/dl) and ionized magnesium (p 5 0.0027; mean, 1.224 mg/dl) concentrations than the non-Greyhound group. In contrast, glucose (p 5 0.0005; median, 109 mg/dl), creatinine (p o 0.0001; mean, 1.887 mg/ dl), and standard bicarbonate (p 5 0.0111; mean, 22.84 mEq/l) concentrations were higher in retired racers. Some results of this study contrast with previous reports in racing Greyhounds.This study provides reference values for chemistry and acid/base panels in healthy adult Greyhounds, necessary to further detect abnormalities in patients. Hereditary equine regional dermal asthenia (HERDA) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder affecting horses of Quarter Horse lineage. 1 Although a mutation in the cyclophilin B gene has been linked to HERDA 2 , its causal association with the disease is not yet documented. Clinical parallels between HERDA and the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) prompted our laboratory to investigate the intermolecular cross-links of collagen, specifically pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD), which give collagen its tensile strength. We have previously demonstrated that horses homozygous for the HERDA trait can be identified from birth by a significant elevation of urine DPD and DPD:PYD ratio 3 and have significant decreases in skin tensile strength which are not restricted to the dorsum. 4 These findings are similar to those of human EDS VIA. 5 The purpose of this study was to determine if the decrease in skin tensile strength of HERDA horses could be explained by a similar collagen cross linking pattern in the skin of HERDA horses as has been identified in their urine. The collagen cross linking pattern and amino acid (AA) composition of skin acid hydrolysates from 22 horses (6 homozygotes, 6 HERDA carriers, and 10 HERDA negative horses) was determined using reversephase HPLC and a Biochrom AA analyzer, respectively. Data subjected to one way ANOVA with a Bonferroni post hoc analysis indicate significantly lower concentrations of PYD and significantly higher DPD and DPD:PYD ratios in HERDA homozygotes versus negative or carrier horses. Hydroxylysine (HL) concentrations were significantly lower in affected versus negative and carrier horses. Total pyridinium cross links were not significantly different between groups. This alteration in the biochemical composition of HERDA skin, which is known to correlate to poor tensile strength in human EDS, is the first evidence to explain the clinical syndrome of skin fragility that is characteristic of HERDA. Furthermore, the significant decrease in HL (for the precursor of pyridinium crosslinks) in HERDA horses suggests that altered collagen lysine metabolism may be physiologically relevant to the clinical manifestation of the disease. ( A key feature of effective immune responses against viruses and intracellular bacteria is the ability to destroy infected cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have this ability and are a critical component of the adaptive immune response. Unfortunately, eliciting protective CTL against several important intracellular pathogens by vaccination has been difficult in the horse. Efficient priming of naı¨ve CTL requires that antigens be delivered to and processed intracellularly by dendritic cells, which are derived from bone marrow precursors and are the principle antigen presenting cells for initiating T cell responses. Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus that causes persistent infection in horses, and CTL are critical in its control. Importantly, EIAV directly infects equine dendritic cells. Thus, a replication-defective vaccine vector based on EIAV could provide an effective means to elicit CTL in horses against a variety of intracellular pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine if such a vector could elicit durable CTL responses in horses. An EIAV Gag-expressing EIAV-based lentiviral vector was generated by co-transfection of 293 T cells with three plasmids: the EIAV viral core encoded by pEV53B; EIAV gag matrix and capsid by pSIN6.1p15/p26; and the EIAV 19 codon-optimized envelope encoded by pLGcoSU-TM. The vector was designated vSIN6.1-p15/ p26 and was confirmed to be replication incompetent after initial infection of equine kidney (EK) cells by repetitive passage of supernatants. Dendritic cells were transduced by this vector as determined by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, transduced dendritic cells were capable of stimulating Gag-specific memory CTL from persistently EIAV infected horses, as determined by 51 Cr release CTL assays using EIAV-infected, Gag peptide-pulsed, and vSIN6.1-p15/p26-transduced EK targets. Finally, 10 7 transducing units (TU) of vSIN6.1-p15/p26 were administered by a combination of ID and IM injections to each of two horses, and boosted three months later. Gag-specific CTL responses were elicited in both horses as early as 18 days after the first injection, and responses have persisted throughout five months of observation. Neither horse has developed clinical signs of EIA nor has viral RNA been detected in plasma using nested RT-PCR. Thus, robust and durable Gag-specific CTL responses were elicited by the vSIN6.1-p15/p26 vector, which was confirmed to be replication incompetent in vivo. In conclusion, the EIAV-based lentiviral vector described here targets dendritic cells and safely elicits durable CTL responses in horses. This vector could prove to be an effective vaccine strategy for inducing protective CTL responses against a variety of important equine pathogens. sinusitis, pneumonia, abscesses and dermatophilus. Although little is known about the mechanism of immune dysfunction in horses with PPID, it is presumed to result from chronically increased plasma concentrations of immunosuppressive hormones, such as cortisol or a-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH). We hypothesized that neutrophil function is impaired in horses with PPID has a result of high plasma MSH concentration. Three groups of horses were included, healthy young horses (mean age 5 8.9 AE 4.0 yrs), healthy aged horses (mean age 5 22.5 AE 4.5 yrs) and horses with PPID (mean age 5 24.6 AE 5.7 yrs). Horses with PPID were selected based on clinical signs and confirmed by plasma a-MSH concentration. Heparinized blood (40 mls) was collected and neutrophils isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll. Chemotaxis was assessed using IL8 and LTB4 as chemoattractants and calculating the percent migration of neutrophils through a 3 m pore filter. Neutrophilic oxidative burst was determined by oxidation of dihydrorhodamine (DHR) and phagocytosis was measured by the uptake of Pansorbin PI (PanPI) using standard flow cytometry methodology. To determine if a-MSH suppressed neutrophilic oxidative burst, blood from 6 healthy horses was incubated with 1000 pmol/L MSH or an equal volume of PBS for 6 hours at 371C, then processed for flow cytometry similar to other samples. There was no difference in chemotaxis between the aged and PPID group (IL8: P 5 0.6, LTB4: P 5 0.9). Old horses had a greater chemotaxis than young horses (IL8: 77.1 AE 4.9 fluoroscent units (FU), n 5 22 vs. 62.4 AE 5.0 FU, n 5 14, P 5 0.05; LTB4: 83.5 AE 6.6 FU, n 5 22 vs. 63.8 AE 6.9 FU, n 5 14, P 5 0.05). There was no difference in phagocytosis among the three groups of horses and no affect of age on oxidative burst (P 5 0.6). Horses with PPID had a decreased oxidative burst compared to healthy horses (mean burst: 242.2 AE 45.4 FU, n 5 9 vs. 381.9 AE 39.5 FU, n 5 26, P 5 0.06). Whole blood incubated with MSH showed a significantly reduced oxidative burst compared to saline treated blood (mean reduction 5 25.8%, P o 0.05). These data suggest high plasma a-MSH concentration may impair neutrophil oxidative burst and contribute to immunosuppression in horses with PPID. Previous studies suggest season regulates equine pituitary pars intermedia (PI) function, affecting plasma ACTH and MSH concentration and confounding diagnostic testing for pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Studies to date have examined horses residing in a restricted geographic location, making it unclear if the seasonal effect is geographically biased. Preliminary data also suggests ponies have a greater increase in plasma PI hormone concentration in the fall compared to light horses. It is unknown if other ''thrifty breeds'' differ from light horses. It is also unclear whether seasonal hormone fluctation is abolished in horses with PPID. The goals of this study were to determine if month-to-month variation in plasma a-MSH and ACTH concentration in horses is influenced by geographic latitude of residence, breed or PPID. Monthly plasma samples were collected over one year from healthy light breed horses residing in Florida, Massachusetts and Finland (n 5 12/location). In addition, healthy Morgan horses (n 5 13) and ponies (n 5 9) were selected from MA and Fin, respectively. Horses with a plasma ACTH concentration 4 50 pg/ml, MSH 4 35 pmol/L, evidence of equine metabolic syndrome, or those pregnant or lactating were excluded. Horses with clinical signs of PPID were selected from MA and confirmed by either increased plasma ACTH or MSH concentration. Plasma ACTH and MSH concentration were determined by RIA. Cosinor analysis was used to determine the time of peak hormone concentration. Mean hormone concentration in fall and non-fall months were compared by ANOVA or t-test. Differences were considered significant if P o 0.05. Horses in Finland had a significantly earlier fall peak of MSH (Aug 29) compared to horses in MA (Sept 10) or FL (Sept 15). ACTH rhythm was difficult to ascertain due to the relatively minimal seasonal fluctuation. Mean MSH concentrations were similar in all three locations, while ACTH concentration was greater in the fall in FL compared to MA (P o 0.01) and Fin (P o 0.05) and greater in MA than Fin (P o 0.05) in the non-fall months. Morgan horses had increased MSH and ACTH concentration compared with light horses from the same location during the fall months; there was no difference during the non-fall months. Hormone concentrations in ponies were not different than in horses during either season. In healthy horses, 8% of the non-fall samples had ACTH 4 50 pg/ml and 1% had MSH 4 35 pmol/L. In horses with PPID, 67% of non-fall samples had ACTH concentration 4 50 pg/ml and 83% had MSH 4 35 pmol/L. Both MSH and ACTH concentrations were significantly greater in the fall compared to spring in horses with PPID (P o 0.01). In summary, latitude of residence and breed may affect onset and/or amplitude of the seasonal increase in PI hormones. Horses with PPID continue to have seasonal variation in PI hormone concentrations. Obesity and insulin resistance have been associated with laminitis in equids. Adipose tissue (AT) produces many hormones (adipokines) that have important local and systemic effects on metabolism; two well-characterized adipokines are leptin and adiponectin. Leptin is an important regulator of satiety, and adiponectin can modulate inflammation and insulin sensitivity. In humans, expression of leptin and adiponectin in subcutaneous AT has been shown to decrease in reponse to chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC); however, acute inflammation increases AT leptin expression, suggesting a biphasic tissue leptin response to PIC. Recent work has shown depot-specific differences in PIC gene expression in equine AT, with nuchal ligament AT expression of IL-1 and IL-6 significantly higher than that of visceral and other subcutaneous AT depots. Depot-specific adipokine expression patterns (which may relate to PIC expression) have not been reported in the horse. This study evaluated gene expression of leptin and adiponectin in several AT depots of insulin-resistant (IR) and insulinsensitive (IS) horses. Eleven mares receiving an identical diet (8 Quarter horses, 2 Thoroughbreds, and 1 Standardbred) and categorized as IR (insulin sensitivity [SI] 5 0.58 AE 0.31 Lmin À1 mU À1 ; n 5 5) or IS (SI 5 2.59 AE 1.21 Lmin À1 mU À1 ; n 5 6) based on results of an insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test were studied. Omental, retroperitoneal, and mesocolonic AT was collected via ventral midline celiotomy; nuchal ligament and tail head AT biopsies were collected via skin incision. Tissue samples were snap-frozen; plasma samples were collected concurrently. For each depot, total RNA was extracted and cDNA produced and analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR to quantify expression of leptin and adiponectin; plasma leptin concentrations were measured with a commercially-available radioimmunoassay (Millipore; Temecula, CA). Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA for repeated measures or non-parametric equivalent (p 5 0.05). The expression of leptin and adiponectin were significantly lower in nuchal ligament AT compared with other depots (p 5 0.006 and p 5 0.0001, respectively), with no observed effect of insulin sensitivity status. Plasma leptin concentration did not differ significantly between the IR and IS horses, nor did it differ between these horses (BCS 5 7.2 1/À 0.7; scale of 1-9) and a lean historical cohort of horses (n 5 13; BCS 5 6.1 1/À 1.0) (p 5 0.38). The finding of decreased leptin and adiponectin expression in nuchal ligament AT is in keeping with the previously reported PIC expression data from this depot and suggests a relatively stable (chronic) inflammatory state in the tissue. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that nuchal ligament AT displays unique biological behavior in the horse relative to other depots. Metformin hydrochloride is used as a treatment for insulin resistance (IR) in equids. This drug may also be useful for controlling IR when insulin-resistant horses are reintroduced to pasture. We therefore tested the hypothesis that metformin alters glucose dynamics in insulin-resistant horses undergoing reintroduction to grazing. Six adult horses with chronic IR were transferred to grass paddocks after spending 4 15 months confined in stalls with attached gravel turnout areas. Glucose dynamics were assessed using the combined glucose-insulin test (CGIT) before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wk after horses were transferred to grass paddocks. After horses were housed in grass paddocks for 2 wk, they were treated with metformin (15 mg/kg q12h) for 2 wk, taken off treatment for 2 wk, and then treated with metformin at a high dosage (30 mg/kg q12h) for 2 wk. Horses were also reevaluated 2 wk later. Time effects were significant (P o 0.001) for resting plasma glucose concentrations and area under the glucose curve (AUCg) values. Insulin results are pending. Mean glucose concentrations increased from 81.2 AE 3.4 to 99.4 AE 6.7 mg/dL over 1 wk and then decreased to 81.9 AE 4.0 mg/dL by 10 wk. No differences were detected between pre-and post-metformin mean values for resting glucose concentrations or AUCg at either dosage level. However, mean AUCg significantly decreased (18.6%) across the 10-week study period. Metformin did not affect glucose dynamics in this study, but AUCg decreased over time when insulin-resistant horses were transferred to grass paddocks. Recent evidence suggests that laminar inflammatory events, similar to those previously reported in the black walnut extract model, also occur during the developmental phase of carbohydrate (CHO) induced laminitis. In the CHO model, early increases in laminar mRNA concentrations of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL8 and GRO are followed by increases in proinflammatory cytokines and monocyte chemokines. Digital hypothermia has been shown to reduce the severity of laminitis after induction with the CHO oligofructose (OF). Because hypothermia has been reported to reduce inflammatory injury in several diseases including traumatic brain injury in humans, we hypothesized that digital hypothermia inhibits inflammatory signaling during the development of laminitis induced with OF. Eight horses were administered 10 g/kg OF by nasogastric tube and had one forelimb (CRYO) continuously cooled using ice and water. The other forelimb (NON-RX) was maintained at ambient temperature. Sections of dorsal laminae were harvested 24 h after OF administration for both snap freezing and paraffin embedding. mRNA was purified from 3 laminar sections of each forelimb, and cDNA produced for real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of mRNA concentrations of chemokines (IL-8, CXCL1), endothelial adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6), COX-1, COX-2, and three housekeeping genes (used to generate a normalization factor). Data were analyzed using nonparametric tests. When compared to control laminar samples (horses administered water instead of CHO during a previous study), CXCL1, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 were increased (P o 0.05) in the NON-RX laminae from the present study. Interestingly, digital hypothermia resulted in a marked decrease in laminar expression (P o 0.05) of the neutrophil chemokines (CXCL1 and CXCL-8 see graph), MCP-2, IL-1, and ICAM-1 when compared to the laminae from the untreated (NON-RX) limbs. These data indicate that digital hypothermia effectively blocks early inflammatory events in the laminar tissue, including the expression of chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines and endothelial adhesion molecules. Inhibition of chemokines and adhesion molecules may result in decreased leukocyte emigration into the laminar tissue, an event likely to play an important role in laminar injury and failure in the septic horse. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the relative changes in estimated cardiac output (CO) derived from uncalibrated pulse power analysis (PulseCO s ) would predict changes in CO measured using an indicator-dilution method (LiDCO s ), previously validated in exercising horses. Four adult healthy horses were studied. At baseline and at four stages of exercise, CO was measured using LiDCO s while continuous CO was estimated using Pulse-CO s applied to averaged pulse waveforms. The ratio of the CO at each exercise level to CO at rest was compared between the LiDCO s and PulseCO s algorithms. Passing and Bablok regression analysis was used to evaluate the agreement between LiDCO s measured and PulseCO s estimated CO ratios at each exercise condition. Raw data and residuals were found to be normally distributed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, meeting the requirements for the application of the regression analysis. A best fit slope and intercept, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined by Passing and Bablok regression analysis (slope 5 0.963, CI: .578-1.67; intercept 5 .360, CI: À1.68-1.69). These data suggest that uncalibrated, signal averaged PulseCO s analysis accurately detects changes in CO in exercising in horses, but confidence intervals are wide. Further validation with larger numbers of horses is needed to verify this preliminary finding, and to determine if this minimally invasive technology will be useful for identifying subtle cardiac disease in poorly performing horses. The mode of transmission of Neospora hughesi has remained unknown; however, in comparison to bovine neosporosis caused by N. caninum, the parasite may potentially be transmitted transplacentally or orally via the ingestion of oocysts from a domestic or wild definitive host. The goal of this study was to investigate the possibility of congenital transmission of N. hughesi in a herd of horses with high prevalence of antibodies to this apicomplexan protozoal pathogen. P=0.008 The study was performed over two years (2006 and 2007) and the population was composed of 60 adult Percheron broodmares living on a breeding farm in northern California. The study originated from the diagnosis of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) due to N. hughesi in a 4-month old Percheron filly and from seroprevalence data showing that 15% of resident horses had antibodies to N. hughesi in 2005. Pre-and post-nursing serum of each foal, serum and colostrum of each periparturient mare and serum of each mare and foal pair collected at 3 months intervals were tested using an indirect fluorescent antibody test for N. hughesi. Further, whole blood, colostrum and placentae were tested for the presence of N. hughesi by real-time PCR. The mares' seroprevalence at birth was 48% and 6.5% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Colostral antibodies against N. hughesi were detected in 66% and 12% of the mares in the two study years. With the exception of three foals, all remaining foals were born seronegative to N. hughesi and passive transfer of colostral antibodies to N. hughesi was documented in 43% and 12% of the foals in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Three foals born from two different mares had pre-colostral antibodies titer ranging from 2,560 to 20,480. All three foals were born healthy and have remained healthy since birth. Two foals were born from the same dam that also gave birth to the weanling diagnosed with EPM in 2005. The third foal was born from a second mare with no previous foaling history at the farm. Seroconversion was documented in 11 foals and 6 mares over the two study years. All blood and colostrum samples tested PCR negative for N. hughesi. Only one placenta collected in 2007 from the mare with the two congenitally infected foals tested PCR positive for N. hughesi. In conclusion, natural exposure to N. hughesi via the feces of as yet unidentified reservoir host was low in the study population; however, N. hughesi persisted in the horse population via transplacental infection. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common disease affecting newborn foals but there are currently no ante-mortem diagnostic tests. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase1 (UCH-L1) and axonal neuron-enriched neurofilament H (pNF-H) levels were measured to evaluate their efficacy as biomarkers of neuronal injury. Concentrations of UCH-L1 and pNF-H in plasma were measured by ELISA in 33 foals with a clinical diagnosis of HIE and 17 healthy foals. The performance of the assays for the diagnosis of HIE was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The overall diagnostic performance of UCH-L1 (AUC 5 0.86; P 5 0.0001) was significantly higher (P 5 0.001) than that of pNF-H (0.52; P 5 0.497) for the diagnosis of HIE. Median concentrations of UCH-L1 (6.57 ng/mL; 2.35 to 11.90 ng/mL) in foals with a clinical diagnosis of HIE were significantly (P o 0.001) higher than those of healthy controls (2.52 ng/mL; 1.4 to 4.01 ng/mL). Using a cut off of 4.01 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of the UCH-L1 assay for the diagnosis of HIE were 70% and 94%, respectively. UCH-L1 has potential as a marker of brain injury in neonatal foals with CNS disorders. Low-dose hydrocortisone replacement therapy has been shown to improve outcome in people with Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a proposed hydrocortisone replacement therapy regimen on ex vivo measures of immunity in healthy neonatal foals. A hydrocortisone dose of 1.3 mg/kg/day was divided and administered as six intravenous boluses to 11 healthy 2-day foals for 24 hours. This dose was halved for another 24 hours, halved again for 12 hours, and then discontinued. Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected from foals before treatment, at 48 hours, and 12 hours after cessation of therapy. A separate group of 12 age-matched foals received saline and served as the control group. Endotoxin-induced mononuclear cell gene expression of TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was measured by RTqPCR. Neutrophils were incubated with labeled, killed S. aureus or E. coli for assessment of phagocytic function, and with phorbol myristate acetate, zymosan, or endotoxin for measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Data were compared between groups with Mann Whitney tests and ANOVA, with significance set at P o 0.05. No adverse effects were observed in any foals receiving hydrocortisone. Neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS production were similar in both groups. However, foals receiving hydrocortisone had significantly decreased endotoxin-induced production of TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b. These data suggest that this hydrocortisone replacement therapy regimen is both safe in foals and effective at ameliorating endotoxin-induced inflammatory cytokine expression without significantly altering innate immune responses needed to combat bacterial infection. Hepatic failure is one of the most common complications in foals requiring blood transfusions to treat neonatal isoerythrolysis. The strong association between development of liver failure and the volume of blood transfused as well as the nature of the histologic lesions suggest that iron toxicity is the likely cause of hepatic injury. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of deferoxamine on iron elimination following blood transfusion in neonatal foals. At 1-3 days of age, foals received either 3 L of washed packed mare's red blood cells (RBC) or 3 L of saline IV once. Foals were treated with deferoxamine (1 g) or saline (5 mL) subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days. Foals were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: RBC/deferoxamine (deferoxamine; n 5 5), RBC/saline (placebo; n 5 5), or saline/saline (control; n 5 3). Blood, urine, and liver biopsies were collected at selected time points for measurement of hematological, biochemical, and iron metabolism variables. Hematocrit, RBC count, and hemoglobin were significantly higher in the 2 groups transfused with packed RBC compared to controls at all times. Biochemical variables were not significantly different between groups. Urine iron concentrations and fractional excretion of iron were significantly higher in foals treated with deferoxamine compared to controls and foals receiving a placebo. By day 14 posttransfusion, liver iron concentrations in foals treated with deferoxamine were significantly lower than that of foals receiving a placebo and similar to that of controls. This study demonstrates that deferoxamine enhances iron elimination and decreases hepatic iron concentration following blood transfusion in foals. Second generation echocardiographic contrast agents have been used in human medicine to assess myocardial perfusion (MP). More recently, contrast echocardiography has been proposed as a method to estimate pulmonary transit time (PTT) in dogs. Six healthy dogs were enrolled in the study. Two boluses (0.03 ml/ kg) and a CRI (0.035 ml/kg/min) of the contrast agent BR38 s (Bracco Research SA, Switzerland) were sequentially administered to each dog. Ejection fraction (EF%), PTT and nPTT (PTT/mean RR) were measured after each bolus. EF% was also measured without contrast. The Real-time MP was performed in 4 regions of interest (ROIs) of the left ventricle: two basal and two mid-parietal. A qualitative assessment was also performed. A plasma sample was collected before and one hour after the study and cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) was analyzed by a high sensitivity assay (Beckman Coulter Accu TnI s ). Intra-and inter-observer variability were calculated for the echocardiographic measurements. There were no differences between the EF% values with and without contrast. Both PTT and nPTT values were similar to those previously reported. There was a good reproducibility for the realtime and the qualitative MP. The real-time MP had a coefficient of variation (CV%) less than 15% for the basal ROIs only, while it was higher for the mid-parietal ROIs. No differences were detected between the pre-and the post-contrast cTnI values. In conclusion, contrast echocardiography appears to be a feasible and safe technique for the evaluation of MP and PTT in healthy dogs. Mitral insufficiency is the more prevalent heart disease in dogs and can induce left atrial enlargement. General heart enlargement can be monitored by radiographic objective measurement (VHS) but to date, no method to objectively estimate left atrial size on radiographs has been reported. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a new radiographic measurement, named Left Atrial Bisecting Line (LAB) to detect left atrial enlargement. LAB measurements were compared to left atrial to aortic root ratio (LA/Ao) and Vertebral Heart Size (VHS) in normal dogs and dogs with mitral insufficiency. Physical exam, blood pressure, CBC, biochemistry panel, thoracic radiographs and echocardiographic exam were performed in 14 normal dogs (4.8-19 kg) and 28 dogs with mitral insufficiency (5.1-21.2 kg). LAB was obtained by bisecting a line from the 90 degree angle formed between the long and short cardiac axis lines used to calculate the VHS in right lateral thoracic view to the roof of the left atrium and measured in vertebral bodies length from the 4 th thoracic vertebra to the nearest 0.1 vertebra (v). VHS was measured as described previously (Buchanan, 2000) . LA/Ao ratio was obtained by two-dimensional ultrasonic mode from right parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valves in early diastole. Results from all 42 dogs are summarized as follows: ROC curves showed the values which provided greater sensibility and specificity for LAB, VHS and LA/Ao ratio, being respectively 1.95v, 11v and 1.75 (maximal reference values). LAB not only showed good significant correlation with both LA/ Ao and VHS but also appears to be a more specific radiographic measurement than VHS for evaluating left atrial size which can be clinically useful. LAB would bring to clinicians a simple and costeffective tool to evaluate and monitor left atrial enlargement and help differentiating cardiac from respiratory origin of cough. Further ongoing studies in a larger number of dogs are needed in order to validate these preliminary conclusions. ABSTRACT #70 USE OF PIMOBENDAN IN 161 CATS (2006 -2009 Pimobendan is an inodilator that has been shown to be a useful treatment for dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF). There is limited data regarding the use of pimobendan in cats with heart disease. The purpose of this report is to describe use of pimobendan in a population of client-owned cats with naturally occurring heart disease. The medical records of three institutions were reviewed for cats receiving pimobendan for management of heart disease. Data were extracted from the medical records including disease process, presence of CHF, pimobendan dose, and certain echocardiographic data. The median age was 11 years (0.5-24.0 years) and cats were predominantly neutered males (n 5 107) and domestic short or long haired cats (n 5 129). 161 client-owned cats received pimobendan at a median dose of 0.23 mg/kg twice daily (range: 0.08 mg/kg BID -0.42 mg/kg BID). Pimobendan use was discontinued in 5 cats. Discontinuation was due to recovery from the inciting cause in 2 cats, cost in 1 cat, difficulty administering medication in 1 cat and vocalization/agitation in 1 cat. Potential side effects were noted in 5 cats including unusual agitation in 2 cats, and anorexia, vomiting, and constipation in one cat each. 154 cats had active or historical CHF when pimobendan was first administered. In non-CHF cats, indication for pimobendan included reduced contractile function, post-surgical myocardial depression, and suspicion of imminent CHF. The inciting cause for CHF was hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 62 cats, unclassified cardiomyopathy in 55 cats, and dilated cardiomyopathy in 27 cats. 110 cats (68%) had a fractional shortening o 40%, 107 (66%) had a left ventricular end systolic dimension 4 1.0 cm and 8 (5%) cats had neither of these criteria but were judged to have systolic dysfunction based on subjective assessment of LV function on 2-D echo. Median left atrial M-mode diameter was 2.09 cm (0.98-3.43 cm). 148/161 cats were treated with furosemide either prior to or simultaneous to the initiation of pimobendan. 148 cats were treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and 128 cats were treated with an anti-thrombotic agent concurrently with pimobendan. Median survival of cats from first pimobendan administration was 102 days (0-870 days). Censored data included cats still alive (n 5 47) and cats lost to follow up (n 5 10). Fifteen cats died at home of unknown causes and 89 cats were euthanized. Contributing factors to euthanasia included signs of CHF (n 5 33), aortic thromboembolism (FATE; n 5 12), azotemia (n 5 7), non-cardiac medical disorders (n 5 7), anorexia (n 5 5), neurologic signs (n 5 4) and reasons not specified in the medical record (n 5 21). Of 12 cats experiencing FATE during pimobendan administration, 5 had prior FATE. Eight cats with prior FATE experienced no recurrence while receiving pimobendan. Pimobendan appears to be well tolerated in cats at a similar dose to the canine dose. Further study is needed to determine whether pimobendan is efficacious in managing feline heart disease. Ischemia leading to fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and possibly sudden death is a pathophysiologic hall- mark of HCM. Heart rate (HR), a major determinant of myocardial oxygen consumption, has become a novel treatment target in people with ischemic heart disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute effects of ivabradine, a selective HR-lowering drug, on LV function in cats with naturally-acquired HCM. Six control cats and 6 cats with HCM were anesthetized, instrumented, and studied over a range of hemodynamic states induced by treatments with esmolol (200-400 mg/kg/min, IV), esmolol and dobutamine (5 mg/kg/min, IV), ivabradine (0.3 mg/kg, IV), and ivabradine and dobutamine. Cardiac output, 1dP/dtmax, tau, and LV end-diastolic pressure were acquired and compared to baseline and control using 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Ivabradine reduced HR in control cats (meanAESD, À22 AE 10%, P 5 0.006) and cats with HCM (À33 AE 4%, P o 0.001) without decreasing cardiac index (P 4 0.05). The rate-pressure product decreased in cats with HCM after ivabradine (À31 AE 21%, P 5 0.009). Ivabradine reduced 1dP/dtmax only in cats with HCM (À29 AE 16%, P 5 0.01). Tau did not change after ivabradine (P 4 0.05) in both groups. However, ivabradine resulted in a significant increase in LVEDP (control 165 AE 40%, P 5 0.001; HCM 154 AE 61%, P 5 0.006). Results suggest that ivabradine reduces HR and the rate-pressure product in a predictable manner, has minor negative inotropic effects, does not affect LV relaxation, increases LV end-diastolic pressure, and blunts the positive chronotropic effects of sympathetic stimulation in anesthetized cats with HCM. Studies in awake cats with HCM are needed to clinically validate our findings. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a familial disease in the Doberman pinscher (DOBE) that often causes sudden death or heart failure. We have shown DOBE DCM to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. In humans, causative genes for familial dilated cardiomyopathy have been identified including cystoskeletal, sarcomeric and mitochondrial genes. We and others have excluded many of these genes as candidates for DOBE DCM. We hypothesized that a genome-wide SNP genotyping array might identify a genetic alteration associated with familial DOBE DCM. DNA samples from 48 adult DOBEs with DCM (LVDD 44.8 cm and FS o 20%) and 48 apparently unaffected (! 10 years of age, normal physical examination) DOBEs were evaluated with a genome-wide SNP genotyping array. Association analysis suggested an area of statistical significance on canine chromosome 14). Finemapping of 13 additional SNPs within the region localized a signal to one strong candidate gene of potential cardiac importance. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that contributes to cardiac regulation of glucose metabolism. Additional DNA sequencing of 121 DOBEs (64 affected, 57 unaffected) identified a 16 base pair deletion in a splice site region in affected dogs (p 5 o 0.0001). This deletion was also observed in 21/ 57 apparently unaffected DOBEs, but not in any of 100 unaffected dogs of 10 other breeds. Although the deletion was observed in some apparently unaffected dogs, their health status may reflect a later onset or variable penetrance of the disease. Affected dogs were either homozygous or heterozygous for the deletion. The deletion disrupts several splice site enhancer sites and leads to the presumed use of a cryptic splice site within the intron. Electron microscopy of myocardium from affected dogs demonstrated mitochondrial disruption. We conclude that a 16 base pair deletion in a splice site region of a gene encoding for a mitochondrial protein located on chromosome 14 is associated with the development of DCM in at least some DOBE families. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and shortterm effectiveness of cutting balloon valvuloplasty (CBV), followed by high pressure balloon valvuloplasty (HPBV) in dogs with severe subaortic stenosis (SAS). Eleven dogs o 30 months old with severe SAS (peak Doppler systolic left ventricular pressure gradient (PG) 4 80 mmHg) underwent CBV and HPBV and were reexamined at one day (n 5 11), one month (n 5 11), and three months (n 5 8) post-procedure. Under general anesthesia, cardiac catheterization was performed via the carotid artery. Left ventricular and aortic root pressures were obtained before and after valvuloplasty. An 8 mm cutting balloon catheter was inflated twice in the subaortic stenotic region in all dogs. A single high pressure balloon catheter was selected to be approximately 100% the diameter of the aortic annulus (mean balloon:aortic annulus ratio 0.96; range 0.86-0.99) and inflated in the subaortic stenotic region ! 2 times in all dogs. CBV combined with HPBV significantly reduced the intra-procedure peak-to-peak systolic PG in all dogs from 78. Subvalvular aortic stenosis is one of the most commonly reported canine congenital heart defects and is inherited in Newfoundland dogs and human beings. The golden retriever is over-represented in dogs with subvalvular aortic stenosis; however, the phenotype of this disease in golden retrievers and familial nature has not been described. We report the echocardiographic findings of subvalvular aortic stenosis and pedigree analysis of thirty-two golden retrievers. Thirty-two adult golden retrievers diagnosed with subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) by Doppler echocardiography were retrospectively evaluated. All golden retrievers studied were previously evaluated by board certified ACVIM (cardiology) diplomates. Auscultation and echocardiography (2D, M-mode and Doppler) were performed. A subcostal continuous-wave Doppler aortic velocity ! 2.5 m/s and presence of a left basilar systolic ejection murmur was required for study inclusion. Three possible echocardiographic characteristics of SAS were recorded: evidence of aortic insufficiency (AI), a subvalvular ridge, or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). A disease status score was calculated by totaling the number of echocardiographic characteristics per subject. Descriptive, Spearman rank correlation and logistic regression statistics were performed. Aortic velocities were as follows: range 2.5-6.8 m/s, median of 3.4 m/s and standard deviation 1.2 m/s. Presence of echocardiographic characteristics was distributed as follows: LVH 12/32, AI 20/32, and subvalvular ridge 20/32 dogs enrolled. Disease status score ranged from 0-3 with a median of 2. Spearman rank correlation revealed a statistically significant correlation between aortic velocity and disease status score (r 5 0.644 P o 0.0001). For every 1 m/s increase in aortic velocity (4 2.5 m/s) a statistically significant odds ratio (OR) for demonstrating presence of subvalvular ridge, LVH and AI was identified (OR 5 2.95, P 5 0.007; OR 5 4.65, P 5 0.0001; OR 5 2.54, P 5 0.01 respectively). The combination of LVH, AI and subvalvular ridge was reported in 10 of 11(90%) golden retrievers with aortic velocities ! 4.0 m/s. Subvalvular aortic stenosis was observed in multiple generations of several families and appears familial. Evaluation of pedigree data has ruled out an autosomal dominant or X-linked dominant mode of inheritance as two unaffected parents produced affected offspring. X-linked recessive mode of inheritance is ruled out as an affected female produced an unaffected male offspring. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance seems most likely as the trait appears to skip generations and unaffected parents are observed to produce affected offspring. Subvalvular aortic stenosis in the golden retriever is familial and best fits an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Characterization of SAS in golden retrievers suggests a similar phenotype to other reported breeds. Severity of stenosis determined by aortic velocity correlates well with the cumulative presence of echocardiographic characteristics (LVH, subvalvular ridge and AI). Cardioembolic events are a devastating complication of myocardial disease in cats. Multiple antithrombotic agents have been used in cats but evidence of clinical efficacy with any agent is lacking while new antithrombotics are constantly being evaluated. Arixtra s (fondaparinux) is a synthetic pentasaccharide and selective inhibitor of factor Xa. Unlike heparin or the low-molecular weight heparins, fondaparinux is a homogenous preparation of pentasaccharide units that has a long half-life and antithrombotic effects confined to Xa inhibition; rendering anti-Xa activity a reliable marker of drug effect. An acute single dose trial was performed in four adult healthy cats where anti-Xa activity was measured at 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr after drug administration. Based on a pharmacokinetic model using these results two chronic (7 day) protocols were evaluated in 6 healthy adult cats. One thromboprophylactic protocol was of 0.06 mg/kg SC q 12 hr and the second was for thrombosis treatment using 0.2 mg/kg SC q 12 hr. For both protocols anti-Xa activity was measured at 2 and 12 hr after drug administration on days 1 and 7 and also at 12, 24 and 48 hr after the last dose of fondaparinux on day 7. Thromboelastography (TEG) and platelet aggregation studies were performed at the same time points. Prophylactic and treatment protocols achieved median (range) peak anti-Xa activities of 0.59 mg/L (0.36-0.77) and 1.60 mg/L (1.52-1.76), respectively; approximating levels in humans. Median (range) trough anti-Xa activities [0.19 mg/L (0.00-0.37)] for the prophylaxis protocol also approximated levels in humans; the median (range) for the treatment protocol [0.16 mg/L (0.11-0.35)] was below levels in humans. While there was no significant effect on TEG parameters with the prophylactic protocol, there was a median 2.43 and 5.34 fold increase in the R and K, respectively (p o 0.05) along with a decrease of 56% and 28% in the a-angle and MA, respectively (p o 0.05) at peak on day 7 in the treatment protocol. There was a significant decrease in MA (9.8%, p o 0.05) 12 hr after drug discontinuation although anti-Xa activities were below the peak levels achieved in the prophylactic protocol. The changes in TEG parameters resolved by 24 hr after drug discontinuation. There was no change in platelet aggregation noted with either protocol. A thromboprophylactic protocol of 0.06 mg/kg SC q 12 hr approximates anti-Xa activities seen in humans considered effectively treated with fondaparinux while a thrombosis treatment protocol of 0.2 mg/kg SC q 12 hr approximates only peak anti-Xa activities seen in humans. This study only provides a starting point for fondaparinux therapy in cats; clinical efficacy and final dosing protocol of fondaparinux for thromboprophylaxis or thrombosis treatment in cats must be determined through future large, multi-center clinical trials. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occlusion with the Amplatz s Canine Duct Occluder (ACDO) is an extremely effective method for the treatment of PDA in dogs. However, the procedure requires the use of relatively large diameter delivery systems, which limits its application in small dogs. Consequently, we are investigating the use of a prototype low profile ACDO and an investigational 4F delivery catheter to occlude PDA in dogs weighing 1.5 to 3 kg. Five dogs weighing 1.51 to 2.85 kg have been enrolled in the study to date. Femoral arterial access has been achieved in all cases using a cut-down technique, a 21 G micropuncture needle, and a 0.018 inch diameter wire guide. The delivery catheter is advanced over the wire guide and angiography identified type IIA PDA morphology in 4 dogs and type IIB in 1. Angiographic minimal ductal diameter ranged from 0.4 to 1.85 mm. Low-profile ACDOs with waist diameters of 3 mm (n 5 2) and 4 mm (n 5 3) were deployed via the delivery catheter, and angiography demonstrated complete ductal occlusion in 4 dogs, and trivial residual flow in 1. These results were confirmed by echocardiography 1 day post-procedure. Complete PDA occlusion at 3 months was confirmed by echocardiography in the 1 dog in which this follow-up evaluation has been completed to date. Further research and development is required before the low profile ACDO and investigational 4F delivery catheter can be made available for routine PDA occlusion in small dogs. However, our preliminary results suggest that minimally invasive per-catheter PDA occlusion with this device and delivery catheter is feasible and effective in dogs weighing 1.5 to 3 kg. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common cause of feline heart disease. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (betablockers) are one of the most frequently prescribed treatments for affected cats; however, there is significant variation in clinician preference regarding initiation of therapy and the anticipated response. In humans, two genetic polymorphisms within the Beta-1 adrenergic receptor (1-AR) gene have been shown to correspond to variable pharmacologic responses. Identification of specific 1-AR polymorphisms has allowed physicians to optimize beta-blocker therapy on a genomic basis. It is possible that cats also have polymorphisms that may impact individual response to therapy. The hypothesis of this study is that polymorphisms are present in the feline 1-AR gene, which could result in an altered pharmacologic response to beta-blocker therapy. The objective of the study was to sequence the feline 1-AR gene in unrelated cats of several different breeds to evaluate for the presence of polymorphisms. The feline 1-AR gene was amplified with specifically designed and optimized primers using the feline and human 1-AR sequence, standard PCR techniques, and PCR-based genomic sequencing. DNA samples from 7 cats of 5 breeds (Domestic Shorthair, Maine Coon, Siberian, Ragdoll, and Bengal) were evaluated. Two polymorphisms were identified within the 1-AR gene, each occurring in an apparently low frequency. One polymorphism was identified in four Siberians and two Maine Coons and consists of an A/C substitution; both heterozygous and homozygous animals were identified. The change did not alter the amino acid produced. A second polymorphism was identified in two Domestic Shorthair and four Ragdolls and consisted of an AA/CC substitution. Five animals were heterozygous and one animal was homozygous for this mutation. This alteration changed the amino acid produced from Proline to Glutamine at position 277 (Pro277Gln). Computer modeling (PolyPhen software) of this region predicts a damaging structural change to the 1-AR protein. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown; however, the identification of1-AR polymorphisms in the cat could suggest variability in response to beta blocker therapy in the cat as it does in humans. One of the main determinants of ischemia, a pathophysiologic characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), is heart rate (HR). Unwanted tachycardia may trigger decompensation in previously asymptomatic cats with HCM. The purpose of this study was to determine an effective oral dose of ivabradine, a pure negative chronotropic drug, in healthy cats. In this single blinded, placebo controlled, randomized, fullycrossed study 8 healthy cats received placebo or one dose of ivabradine at 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, or 0.5 mg/kg, PO. HR and blood pressure were monitored continuously for 24 hours via radiotelemetry after each treatment. Response to stress was studied twice by 15-min acoustic startle applied at baseline and 4 hours after drug. Statistical comparisons were made using a linear mixed model and 2-way repeated measures ANOVA. Peak negative chronotropic effect was observed 3 hours after ivabradine administration. HR (min À1 ) decreased significantly (p o 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner (meanAESD for placebo: 144 AE 20; ivabradine 0.1 mg/kg: 133 AE 22; ivabradine 0.3 mg/kg: 112 AE 20; ivabradine 0.5 mg/kg, 104 AE 11). HR (min À1 ) was still reduced (p o 0.05) at 12 hours after ivabradine (0.3 mg/kg: 128 AE 18 and 0.5 mg/ kg: 124 AE 16) compared to placebo (141 AE 21). HR response to acoustic startle was significantly (p o 0.01) blunted at all 3 doses of ivabradine. No effect of ivabradine on blood pressure was identified and no clinically discernable side effects were observed. These findings indicate that ivabradine at 0.3 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/ kg PO predictably lowers HR for at least 12 hours in healthy cats. Further studies in cats with HCM are needed. Arterial thromboembolism in cardiomyopathy is predisposed by left atrial (LA) enlargement and dysfunction. Drugs may further influence LA function via inotropic or chronotropic effects. We hypothesized that atenolol would depress, pimobendan enhance, and ivabradine minimally affect LA contractile function in cats. Nine cats were studied prospectively using a double-blind, fullycrossed design. Cats were healthy based on physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistries, blood pressure, ECG, and 2D echocardiography. LA function was evaluated by echocardiography over four study periods: control, atenolol (1.8-2.5 mg/kg q12h), pimobendan (0.2-0.3 mg/kg q12h), and ivabradine (0.3-0.5 mg/kg q12h). Treatments were randomized and continued for 7 days prior to measurements. Peak LA appendage (LAA) inflow and outflow velocities; velocity and duration of the atrial reversal (AR) wave; and HR were measured. Treatments were compared by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison test. Statistical significance was p o 0.05. HR (min À1 ) was 223.1 AE 27.3 at baseline (meanAESD) and significantly decreased following atenolol (146.2 AE 19.9) and ivabradine (125.3 AE 26.9). The inodilator pimobendan mildly increased LA function indices (p 4 0.05). Atenolol significantly depressed LAA and AR velocities while prolonging AR duration relative to baseline, pimobendan, and ivabradine. Mean LAA outflow velocity was reduced by atenolol (-46 cm/s) compared to baseline. The I f blocker ivabradine reduced LAA inflow velocity (-21 cm/s, p o 0.05), but other effects on LA function were not significantly different from baseline. HR correlated weakly to LAA outflow velocity (r 2 5 0.25). These data suggest that beta-blockade with atenolol could impair LA contractile function in cardiomyopathy; however, clinical studies are required to delineate this risk. ABSTRACT #80 NT-proBNP LEVELS IN 30 CATS WITH DYNAMIC RIGHT VENTRICULAR OUTFLOW OBSTRUCTION. JW Allen, K Yee, MH Buckner, SJ Ettinger. California Animal Hospital Veterinary Specialty Group, Los Angeles, CA. Dynamic right ventricular outflow obstruction (DRVO) is an echocardiographic finding that has been described as a physiologic cause of a systolic murmur in cats. NT-proBNP has been evaluated as a biomarker for the presence of cardiac disease in cats; levels are elevated in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and cats with renal insufficiency. As a murmur is a frequent indication for echocardiography, we sought to better characterize the relationship between DRVO and NT-proBNP levels, concurrent cardiac and urinary disorders, and clinical outcome. Thirty client-owned cats with systolic murmurs were evaluated via echocardiography over a two year period. Doppler and 2-D echocardiographic studies were examined for evidence of DRVO and additional structural and electrocardiographic abnormalities according to previously identified criteria. Doppler BP, USG, serum BUN, Creatinine, TT4, and plasma NT-proBNP values were recorded. Medical history, concurrent diagnoses and communication with the owners or referring veterinarians were evaluated for the presence of non-cardiac disease. Follow up studies were available for 22 cats. Cats with DRVO had a high prevalence of concurrent cardiovascular abnormalities (17/30, 57%), most commonly HCM (16/17, 94%). Eight cats died or were euthanized during the study period, with one cardiac cause of death. NT-proBNP was 4 44 pmol/L in 26/30 cats (87%), all of which had either HCM, urinary tract disease, or both. The four cats with NT-proBNP o 44 pmol/L had isolated DRVO (no concurrent urinary or cardiac disease). 11/13 cats with DRVO and urinary tract disease (CKD, FLUTD, UTI) had NT-proBNP levels o 165 pmol/L. 7/8 cats with NT-proBNP 4 754 pmol/L had severe cardiac disease, including the patient who died of cardiac causes. NT-proBNP levels in cats with DRVO are associated with concurrent cardiac and/or urinary tract pathology. Isolated DRVO did not result in NT-proBNP elevation and was not predictive of future cardiac events in the cats in this report. In the absence of urinary tract disease, NT-proBNP may be helpful in diagnosing clinically significant cardiac disease in cats with DRVO. Mixomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. Once a dog is in congestive heart failure (CHF), survival time is variable and the long-term prognosis is guarded. Medical treatment is palliative only. The only definitive treatment is valve replacement or valve repair, which require cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The goal of this research is to describe and evaluate the mitral valve annuloplasty by external plication in dogs with CHF due to MMVD, performed without CPB. Four ISACHC Class IIIa CHF dogs were submitted to the surgery, after the owner's consent was granted. After left thoracotomy and pericardiotomy, a buttressed double row running suture was inserted in the left ventricle myocardium parallel with the atrioven-tricular groove, avoiding injury to any coronary branch. Knots were tied when the left atrial thrill could not be palpable anymore. Every dog underwent physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and cardiac tropononin I (cTnI) measurement before and after the procedure. Two dogs had a decrease in the regurgitant jet after surgery (from severe to mild-to-moderate). One of them improved clinically during a 30-day post-surgery period of evaluation. Nevertheless the second dog died from acute renal failure two days after the surgical procedure. The cTnI level increased after the plication in both dogs and returned to basal values 30 days after surgery in the dog that survived. The two remaining dogs died trans-op because of myocardial rupture and uncontrolled hemorrhage. The mitral annuloplasty by external plication can decrease the mitral regurgitant jet and improve clinical signs in dogs with MMVD and severe CHF. However this procedure has high mortality, at least in dogs with severe CHF. Further long-term studies in order to clarify if this surgery could avoid the progression of the disease in less-severe cases are suggested. The objective of this study was to compare safety and efficacy of phenobarbital (PB) and potassium bromide (KBr) monotherapies for treatment of canine idiopathic epilepsy. Specific aims were to determine which drug was associated with fewer adverse effects and which was more effective at controlling seizures over a one year period. Sixty-two client-owned pet dogs with idiopathic epilepsy were enrolled in the study. Dogs were randomly assigned to either PB or KBr treatment groups (PB n 5 30, KBr n 5 32). Data collected at time of enrollment and at 1, 4 and 12 months after start of therapy included physical examination, detailed medical and seizure histories, serum biochemical and CBC analyses, and serum drug concentrations. Drug dosages were adjusted based on seizure control, adverse effects, and serum drug concentrations. Dogs with unacceptable seizure control or intolerable adverse effects not responsive to drug dosage alterations were removed from the study. Analyses included comparisons between groups for signalment variables, biochemical and CBC values outside normal, proportions of individual adverse effects, proportions of dogs not completing the study for various reasons, seizure frequency and seizure severity. Associations between presence of adverse effects and risk factors including all signalment variables and drug dosage, serum drug concentration and other variables were evaluated using logistic regression models. Correlations between drug dosage and serum drug concentrations were determined. Poisson regressions and Hazard ratios were used to determine risk factors for increased seizure frequency and severity. Statistical significance was set at P o 0.05 throughout. Results showed that PB monotherapy was associated with better seizure control and a lower incidence of adverse effects than was KBr monotherapy. Significantly more KBr-treated dogs were removed from the study due to poor seizure control or intolerable adverse effects (7 KBr-treated dogs vs. 1 PB-treated dog). Other significant differences between groups included overall higher seizure frequency and seizure severity scores with KBr treatment compared to PB, and higher incidence of marked lethargy with KBr. Prevalence of vomiting (23 KBr-treated dogs, 15 PB-treated dogs) and inappropriate defecation in the house (6 KBr-treated dogs, 1 PBtreated dog) were higher with KBr but P values were 4 0.05. Other adverse effects noted in both groups included polyuria/polydipsia, polyphagia, anorexia, hyperactivity, aggression, ataxia, skin problems, pancreatitis, elevate amylase and lipase. Although differences were not significant between groups for these variables, in general prevalences were higher with KBr treatment. In conclusions, study results indicate that PB is superior to KBr as a monotherapy for most cases of canine epilepsy, providing better seizure control and incurring fewer adverse effects over a one-year period of time. Transient post-ictal hyperammonemia has been reported in people, but has not been documented in the veterinary literature. This study was designed to determine whether blood ammonia concentrations are increased after generalized tonic-clonic seizures in dogs and the duration of the increase. We hypothesized that hyperammonemia is common after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, but that the ammonia concentration returns to normal within one hour after cessation of seizure activity in dogs that do not have hepatic dysfunction. Twelve client-owned dogs that had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure while at the University of Florida Veterinary Medical Center or Florida Veterinary Specialists were enrolled. Blood ammonia concentrations were measured immediately, twenty, and sixty minutes after the end of the seizure. Dogs with hepatic dysfunction were excluded. Blood ammonia concentrations were higher (p o 0.002) immediately after the seizure than 20 or 60 minutes later; mean concentrations (1/À one standard deviation) were 32.3 AE 30.5 vs. 11.9 AE 10.8 and 9.4 AE 11.1 mmol/L, respectively. There was no evidence of a difference between concentrations measured 20 and 60 minutes post-ictally or between hospitals. Ammonia concentrations were higher than analyzer normal values in 4/12 (33%) dogs immediately after the seizure and none of the dogs 60 minutes later. It appears that a transient hyperammonemia is common after a generalized seizure, but that the blood ammonia concentration returns to normal within one hour. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting people and dogs. Chronic administration of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is often associated with serious adverse effects. The NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System (SAS) is designed to provide real-time advisories indicating the likelihood of seizure occurrence. We hypothesized that the SAS could safely and effectively be used in dogs to provide advisories of high seizure susceptibility and the opportunity to intervene with the use of acute AEDs. Sixteen monitoring electrodes were implanted subdurally over both cerebral cortices in 6 healthy research dogs diagnosed with epilepsy. Continuous, real-time intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals were received via electrodes by an implanted, rechargeable telemetry unit located in the thoracic body wall. iEEG data from this device was transmitted wirelessly to an external device placed in a vest and stored on replaceable data cards. Algorithms for detecting seizure activity were assessed in 3 of 6 dogs with recurrent seizures. The seizure detection algorithm detected all seizures with no false positive detections noted. Seizure prediction algorithms developed with human iEEG data are being assessed in the 3 dogs with recurrent seizures. 2 of 6 dogs have been seizure-free and one dog died from status epilepticus. We conclude that implantable seizure advisory devices can be safely used in the dog to collect iEEG data needed to study seizure detection and susceptibility algorithms. Dogs may provide a useful large animal model of spontaneously occurring epilepsy allowing for translational human epilepsy research. (MRI) units, a 3.0 T and a 7.0 T. We hypothesized that MRI at 7.0 T would allow superior resolution and provide superior image quality and anatomical detail. Four healthy Beagle dogs with no history of neurologic disease were imaged with both scanners. Dogs underwent general anesthesia and were positioned in sternal recumbency for all imaging. A 3.0 T and a 7.0 T MRI units (Achieva, Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH) were used. Low-resolution turbo spin echo (TSE) T2weighted images (T2-WI) were acquired in the transverse, dorsal and sagittal planes. High-resolution T2-WI and TSE proton density-weighted images (PD-WI) were obtained in the transverse and dorsal planes. A list of selected anatomical structures were identified and blindly assessed by 3 experienced reviewers for image contrast and definition. Overall image quality and the presence of artifacts were also evaluated. Quantitative assessment of regions of interest (ROIs) was also performed. MRI at both 3.0 T and 7.0 T provided good spatial and contrast resolution of the canine brain anatomy. Although some structures were visualized with superior image contrast at 3.0 T MRI and other anatomical structures showed improved image contrast at 7.0 T, the majority of the neuroanatomical structures evaluated had comparable image contrast and definition at both 3.0 T and at 7.0 T. The overall image quality for low resolution T2-WI was comparable at 3.0 T and 7.0 T. High resolution T2-WI showed superior image quality at 3.0 T. Absent to mild artifacts were seen at 3.0 T and mild to moderate artifacts were noted at 7.0 T. ROIs analysis indicated slightly superior grey and white matter contrast at 7.0 T. The results obtained in our study show that both 3.0 T and 7.0 T magnets offered high quality images and excellent definition of the canine cerebral cortex and selected anatomical structures. No remarkable differences were noted on the images obtained at 7.0 T. In our study, special importance was given to thalamocortical structures, which are the areas of the brain where seizure activity originates and spreads from, both in humans and dogs. Definitive diagnoses of intracranial diseases often remain elusive. Several markers have shown promise for systemic malignancies, but none have been fully evaluated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of veterinary patients in association with specific intracranial diseases. Current examination of CSF in canine veterinary practice is based on cellular examination and total protein measurement, though additional analyses may be useful. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and has a pivotal role in tumor angiogenesis. VEGF was evaluated in the CSF of dogs with various intracranial diseases to probe its utility as a biomarker. CSF was prospectively banked in patients with intracranial disease during routine diagnostic evaluation or immediately post-mortem after euthanasia. VEGF concentrations were assayed using a commercially available ELISA kit, which has been validated for use in dogs. VEGF was readily quantifiable in canine CSF. Samples were subdivided into neoplastic (primary intracranial, n 5 28), inflammatory (n 5 22), and other neurologic disease (n 5 35). There were significant differences in VEGF levels between all groups (mean values in pg/ml were 159.4, 50.9, and 2.2, respectively, P o 0.0001). Within the neoplastic group, there were significant differences in VEGF levels between specific malignancies (P 5 0.035); choroid plexus (631.1) and glial cell (300.2) tumors demonstrated the highest average levels, followed by meningiomas (13.1), CNS lymphoma (3.0), and pituitary adenomas (2.12). Inflammatory brain diseases had variable VEGF levels (range 0-489.96), while other intracranial disease rarely had detectable VEGF in the CSF. These observations provide a potential basis for differentiating etiologies of intracranial masses. Central nervous system (CNS) neoplasia has been reported in 1-3% of canine necropsies and occurs in approximately 14 in 100,000 dogs. Parallels exist between primary canine and human brain tumors including frequency, tumor types, classification, immunohistochemical markers, and tumor behavior. While it is generally accepted that both genetics and environmental factors contribute to CNS neoplasia, the etiologies for human and, particularly canine brain tumors, are largely unknown. Over the past decade, DNA and RNA viruses have been identified in various primary human brain tumor types. However, the causal relationship between CNS viral infection and primary brain tumors in humans has been a source of debate because of conflicting laboratory reports documenting the presence or absence of viruses in various brain tumor types. Here, we hypothesize that viruses are not associated with primary canine brain tumors. Our objective was to apply broadly reactive, pan-herpes-and pan-polyomavirus consensus, degenerate oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOP PCR) to paraffin-embedded brain tumors to evaluate for viral DNA. An inherent limitation to specific PCR testing is that it may fail to identify atypical or novel viruses within a viral family, whereas CODEHOP PCR avoids a priori bias towards specific viral species. The utility of the CODEHOP PCR approach is that it would allow us to detect unsuspected or even novel herpes-and polyomaviruses in primary canine brain tumors. DNA was extracted from 10 mm shavings from 99 paraffin embedded, formalin fixed archived primary canine brain tumors (meningiomas, gliomas, sarcomas, choroid plexus tumors, lymphoma, and ependymomas). PCR for the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase gene was completed for all 99 samples to confirm the integrity of extracted DNA. All samples were tested for the presence of herpes-and polyomaviruses using CODEHOP PCR methods. For each PCR reaction, rigorous positive and negative controls were included. PCR reactions were evaluated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, with amplicons assessed under ultraviolet light after the addition of ethidium bromide. All positive (porcine respiratory virus, JC virus) and negative controls (eg no template PCR, PCR of water extracted in parallel to brain tumor tissues) yielded expected results. None of the 99 samples were positive for herpes-or polyomavirus DNA. The absence of herpes-and polyomavirus DNA in these 99 cases makes an association between these viral families and primary canine brain tumors unlikely. MRI is routinely used to investigate brain diseases in dogs, but the consistency and accuracy of radiology reports remain largely unknown. Five board-certified veterinary radiologists with variable MRI experience interpreted MR (1.5 T) brain images of 44 dogs, acquired with transverse T2w, T2w-FLAIR and T1w-FLAIR; transverse, sagittal and dorsal T2w and T1w-FLAIR post-contrast. Imaging parameters that were scored included: lesion (present/absent); lesion characteristics (localization, mass effect, edema, hemorrhage, cavi-tation); contrast enhancement characteristics; and, most likely diagnosis (normal, tumoral, inflammatory, vascular, metabolic or toxic, or other) . MRI diagnoses were determined initially without patient information, and then repeated providing history and signalment. For all cases and readers, MRI diagnoses were compared to final diagnoses established histopathologically (when available), or with other pertinent clinical data (CSF analysis, clinical response to treatment and/or MRI follow-up). MRI scores were compared between examiners with kappa statistics. Interobserver agreement for presence of a lesion was substantial to excellent (0.67 k o 0.86). However, presence of edema was less consistently recognized (0.30 k o 0.52) or graded (0.49 k o 0.78). Presence and distribution of contrast enhancement was scored with moderate to substantial agreement (0.40 k o 0.70), whereas pattern and border definition were scored with more variability (0.29 k o 0.70). Interobserver agreement was moderate to substantial for establishing an imaging diagnosis without patient information (0.56 k o 0.75), and increased when patient information was provided (0.65 k o 0.76). Agreement between MRI and final diagnoses was substantial for all radiologists (0.62 k o 0.73). In conclusion, while some imaging parameters such as edema are interpreted less consistently, radiologists are reasonably constant and accurate when providing diagnoses. Blastomycosis is a systemic mycotic infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Central nervous system (CNS) infection is uncommon in dogs and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of canine blastomycosis have not been previously reported. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively describe the clinical presentation, MRI findings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and case outcome in four dogs with cytologically confirmed CNS blastomycosis. The medical record database at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital was searched for dogs with a diagnosis of blastomycosis that underwent MRI examination between 2000 and 2009. Data collected from the medical record included signalment, clinical history, physical and neurologic examination findings, results of thoracic radiography and CSF analysis, and results of MRI examination. Cases without cytologic diagnosis of blastomycosis were excluded. Three dogs had multifocal intracranial granulomas and presented with seizure activity; one dog had a focal cervical spinal cord granuloma and presented with hemiparesis. Three dogs had signs of disease in other organ systems, including the lungs, eyes, and skin; one dog only had CNS involvement. Diagnosis of blastomycosis was made by cytologic examination of an intracranial mass, two pulmonary masses, and a skin lesion. On MRI examination, lesions were hypo-to isointense on T1-weighted (T1W) images and variably hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2W) images. On T1W images after intravenous gadodiamide administration, lesions most often strongly contrast enhanced; a small number of lesions ring-enhanced. Meningeal enhancement was present in all dogs with intracranial lesions and peri-lesional edema was seen in all cases on T2W images. Three dogs had CSF analysis and all had a neutrophilic pleocytosis and elevated total protein concentration. Blastomyces organisms were not detected in the CSF in any of the dogs. One dog was euthanized without treatment. Antifungal therapy and monitoring of response to treatment via serial MRI examination were initiated in three dogs, two of which survived. In one dog that survived, resolution of intracranial disease was seen on MRI examination after 6 months of therapy. In the other dog, the spinal granuloma reduced in size but persisted on MRI examination after 2 years of therapy despite resolution of clinical disease and normal CSF analysis. Blastomycosis in the CNS is a rare disease with a guarded prognosis and antemortem diagnosis can be difficult. The ability to identify characteristics of blastomycosis using MRI examination and CSF analysis can provide clinicians with valuable diagnostic and prognostic information. Long-term therapy and monitoring is necessary and serial MRI examination is recommended since neurologic examination and CSF analysis may not identify persistent CNS infection. ABSTRACT #90 PLASMA CELL NEOPLASIA OF THE VERTEBRAL COL-UMN: IMAGING, CLINICOPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS, AND LONG-TERM OUTCOME WITH TREATMENT. L. Gerlach 1 , B. Sturges 1 , K. Vernau 1 , P Dickinson 1 , M. Knipe 1 , W. Berry 2 , R. LeCouteur 1 . 1 University of California -Davis, Davis, CA, 2 Southern California Referral Group, Irvine, CA. Plasma cell neoplasms arise from malignant proliferation of Blymphocytes and may affect the vertebral column as solitary plasmacytomas or multiple myelomas. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate treatment of these tumors with respect to long-term outcome. Our hypothesis was that surgical cytoreduction and stabilization combined with chemotherapy (melphalan/prednisone) provides significantly better outcome than no treatment or chemotherapy alone. Twenty-one dogs diagnosed by histopathology with vertebral plasma cell neoplasia were studied. Dogs commonly presented for clinical signs of spinal pain, pelvic limb paresis, and lameness of months duration. On neurological exam, 5/21 dogs had spinal pain only while 11/21 dogs had a T3-L3 myelopathy. 18/21 dogs were ambulatory at the time of diagnosis. Spinal radiographs had bony changes consistent with vertebral neoplasia in 20/21 dogs, while 4/ 21 dogs had vertebral fractures. Extradural compression was evident in all dogs that had a myelogram (15/21). Images on 4 dogs diagnosed with MRI showed similar findings including enlarged vertebral venous sinuses, T2 hyperintensity within affected vertebrae, and T1 iso-to hyperintensity with mild contrast enhancement. Results of CSF analysis confirmed mild pleocytosis in 5/12 dogs and significant protein elevation in 10/11 dogs. Seven dogs were treated with chemotherapy alone, 8 dogs with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and 6 received no treatment. Dogs treated with surgery and chemotherapy had longer survival times (median 5 24 months) than dogs treated with chemotherapy alone (median 5 5 months). Longer survival with surgery is likely due to the effects of cytoreduction and internal fixation on compromised vertebral structure. The purpose of this study was to investigate if relative stenosis of the vertebral canal predisposes Doberman Pinschers to develop clinical signs of DAWS and to evaluate if morphometric MRI parameters could be identified to differentiate between clinically relevant and irrelevant spinal cord compressions. Fifty-four dogs were prospectively studied: Doberman Pinschers with clinical signs of DAWS (n 5 17), clinically normal Doberman Pinschers (n 5 20), and clinically normal Foxhounds (n 5 17). All dogs underwent MRI (0.2 T) of the caudal cervical spine. To evaluate relative vertebral canal stenosis, the following ratios were calculated at the cranial, middle, and caudal levels of C5, C6, and C7: canal occupying ratio of the spinal cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) column, defined as the cross-sectional area (CSA) of respectively the spinal cord and CSF-column, divided by the CSA of the vertebral canal. To evaluate the degree of spinal cord compression, the following ratios were calculated at the site of most pronounced compression: compression ratio, defined as the smallest dorsoventral diameter of the spinal cord divided by the broadest transverse diameter; remaining spinal cord and CSF-column area, defined as the CSA of respectively the spinal cord and CSF-column at the compressed area divided by the CSA at the adjacent, non-compressed segment. To evaluate the amount of disk protrusion, the following ratios were calculated at the site of most pronounced compression: vertebral canal compromise ratio, defined as the protruded disk area divided by the CSA of the vertebral canal; dorsoventral vertebral canal compromise ratio, defined as the maximum dorsoventral diameter of the protruded intervertebral disk, divided by the dorsoventral diameter of the vertebral canal. There was a global influence of assessed group of dog on the canal occupying ratio of the spinal cord at the cranial and caudal vertebral body level and for the canal occupying ratio of the CSF-column at the caudal vertebral body level. For each assessed canal occupying ratio, there was a significant difference between clinically affected Doberman Pinschers and clinically normal Foxhounds at the level of C7. The remaining spinal cord area was the only useful ratio to differentiate between dogs with clinically relevant and irrelevant spinal cord compression. ROC-statistics demonstrated that a remaining spinal cord area of 0.8 corresponded with a sensitivity of 0.9 and a specificity of 0.7 to discriminate between dogs with and without clinical signs of DAWS. The results of this study suggest that relative stenosis of the caudal cervical vertebral canal predisposes Doberman Pinschers to the development of DAWS and that the CSA of the remaining spinal cord can be used to differentiate between clinically relevant and irrelevant spinal cord compressions. Acquired myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease that occurs in dogs and people and is the most commonly diagnosed neuromuscular disease in dogs. Associations between genetic factors and MG are reported in people, but genetic studies have not been done in dogs. A familial predisposition for MG is reported in some dog breeds including the Great Dane and the Newfoundland, suggesting the possibility of a genetic association. In dogs, associations between the Dog Leukocyte Antigen (DLA) Class II genes and other autoimmune diseases are reported. The purpose of this study is to use a candidate gene approach to determine if there is a genetic association between specific DLA class II genotypes and MG in Newfoundland dogs. DNA from 13 Newfoundland dogs (9 female, 4 male) with confirmed myasthenia gravis (positive acetylcholine receptor antibody titers) was collected. Dogs ranged in age from 11 months to 4 years. DNA from 38 healthy Newfoundland dogs greater than 7 years of age, with no clinical evidence of MG served as controls. The exon 2 regions of DLA-DRB1, DQA1, and DQB1 were sequenced on 8 of the affected and 9 of the healthy dogs. Genotype and haplotype assignment was made from this data, and affected and control animals were compared. Sequence data demonstrated a strong association with a specific DRB1 allele among affected dogs with a significant odds ratio of 8.6 (p 5 0.006 CI: 1.7-42.6). Additional dogs in each group are being tested. Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is an adult onset fatal neurodegenerative disease. The initial upper motor neuron spastic paraparesis and general proprioceptive ataxia progress to a flaccid lower motor neuron tetraparesis. Recently, a missense mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene was found to be a risk factor for DM suggesting that DM is homologous to human amyotrophic lat-eral sclerosis (ALS). Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is an electrophysiologic technique for quantifying motor unit function and has proven useful in assessing disease progression in ALS patients. If the technique can reliably be established in normal dogs and applied to DM affected dogs, MUNE could be used as a biomarker for DM and an outcome measure for monitoring therapeutic trials. The objective of this study was to adapt the incremental method for MUNE in normal healthy dogs and establish a reference range. A version of the McComas incremental stimulation technique was used to study MUNE in extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) muscles of nine neurologically normal dogs (age: 1-9 years; body weight 4.9-13.4 kg). Both pelvic limbs were evaluated. Monopolar stimulating needle electrodes were inserted caudal to the long digital extensor muscle tendon at the level of the tuber calcanei to stimulate the deep peroneal nerve. Direct evoked muscle potentials were recorded with the active surface electrode placed over the EDB motor point and the reference surface electrode over digit IV. The ground electrode was placed subcutaneously between cathode and recording electrode. Supramaximal compound muscle action potential (CMAP) negative peak area was first recorded. Then starting at the subthreshold level, stimulus intensity was slowly increased until the first all-or-none single motor unit potential (SMUP) was evoked. Successive small increments (0.026 mA, 50 msec) were applied to elicit a total of 10 SMUP responses. The mean SMUP negative peak area was divided into the maximum CMAP negative peak area to yield the MUNE value. Multiple trials were performed on each limb to assess reproducibility. EDB MUNE values were obtained from all dogs. The median CMAP area was 4.48 mV mS (range 2.00-9.32) with 25 and 75 percentile of 3.67 and 5.37, respectively. The median SMUP area was 0.09 mV mS (range 0.03-0.78) with a 25 and 75 percentile of 0.06 and 0.13, respectively. The MUNE median was 53.5 (range 8-154) with 25 and 75 percentile values of 30 and 71, respectively. There was no significant difference in MUNE between age groups older and younger than 7 years (P 5 0.301), between right and left limbs (P 5 0.735) or trials performed per limb (P 5 0.677). We show that EDB MUNE using the incremental method can be reliably recorded from normal dogs. These results provide potential to apply the described technique for longitudinal monitoring of lower motor neuron signs in DM affected dogs. Between 2000-2008, muscle and/or peripheral nerve biopsies from 36 Bengal cats with neuromuscular weakness were submitted to the Comparative Neuromuscular Laboratory, University of California, San Diego. There is anecdotal information about juvenile onset polyneuropathy in Bengal cats, but more specific characterization with evidence based medicine is lacking. The aim of this retrospective study was to use this cohort of cats to characterize the clinicopathologic features and clinical course. Medical records from all cases were evaluated. Parameters included history, physical and neurological examination, standard hematological and biochemical assays, testing for infectious diseases, electrodiagnostic evaluation, CSF analysis, and pathological changes in muscle or peripheral nerve biopsies. Clinical outcome was determined from either the medical record, through a survey questionnaire completed by the submitting veterinarian, or by phone consultation with the veterinarian or owners. The mean age of onset was 10.8 mo (range 3-45, SD 1/À 8.2) with a male predominance (23/36 cases). Progressive weakness and lower motor neuron dysfunction, most notably in the pelvic limbs, was most often reported. Of the 23 cases where infectious disease titers were reported, two had positive toxoplasma titers, two had mildly elevated coronavirus titers, and one was positive for feline leukemia virus on bone marrow IFA. Electromyography showed fibrillation potentials in 17 cats and positive sharp waves in 15 cats. Motor nerve conduction velocity or waveform was reported as decreased or abnormal in 12 of 21 cats (range 13-59 m/s). Histopathologic changes in muscle biopsies were consistent with denervation. A frequent finding was depletion of myelinated fibers in intramuscular nerve branches with variable mononuclear cell infiltration. Edema, onion-bulb formations and inappropriately thinly myelinated fibers were most common in peripheral nerve biopsies. Information regarding treatment and recovery was available for 24 cats. Of these cats, 12 were treated with corticosteroids with or without additional medications or supplements, 7 received medications and supplements without corticosteroids, and 5 were not given any treatments. Complete recovery was reported in 12 cats and partial recovery in 9 cats. One or more relapses were reported in 8 cases. Although 4 cats were euthanized either at the time of diagnosis or during relapse, none of the cats died from the disease. In conclusion, this study documents a peripheral neuropathy in young Bengal cats. The prognosis for recovery is good although relapses may occur. It is not clear if corticosteroids are of benefit as improvement and remission also occurred in untreated cats. Exercise-induced collapse (EIC) in Labrador Retrievers is a neurological disease manifested by limb weakness, ataxia, and collapse. Susceptibility to EIC is very strongly associated with homozygosity for a dynamin 1 gene (DNM1) mutation. However, a small population of collapsing Labradors are clear or carriers of the recessively inherited mutation. The objective of this study was to compare characteristics of collapsing Labradors genetically susceptible to EIC based on DNM1 genotype with those that are not. Our hypothesis was that dogs unaffected by the mutation have different clinical characteristics from those affected. Collapse descriptions were obtained via surveys from 244 Labradors with reported collapse; 186 were homozygous for the DNM1 mutation (genotype EE) and 48 were unaffected (NN or EN). All surveys were reviewed blinded to the DNM1 genotype. Several significant differences were found. The EE dogs were a fairly homogenous population exhibiting decreased muscle tone and strength originating in the pelvic limbs with collapse usually limited to these limbs. In contrast, NN and EN dogs were more diverse with a larger proportion exhibiting collapse in the thoracic limbs or all four limbs simultaneously and often resulting in paresis or ataxia without full collapse. Additionally, NN and EN dogs were more likely to have an abnormal mentation during collapse. This study demonstrates that clinical features of collapse in Labradors that are clear or only carriers of the DNM1 mutation differ from the classic collapse description in dogs homozygous for the mutation. The cause(s) of this ''atypical'' collapse has not been determined. Idiopathic chylothorax in small animals has an inconsistent response to medical and surgical management. Glue embolization of the thoracic duct through an abdominal lymphatic does not require entering the thorax, theoretically improves thoracic duct branch penetration, simultaneously embolizes the cisterna chyli to reduce potential for recanalization, and permits simultaneous lymphangiography to document complete occlusion. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the resolution of idiopathic chylothorax and subsequent complications following glue embolization of the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct in dogs and cats. Requirements for inclusion included patients diagnosed with idiopathic chylothorax that had not received previous surgical therapy. Owner consent was required and follow-up information was collected through contact with the client or referring veterinarian. Two dogs and 1 cat each received corn oil or heavy cream hourly for four hours pre-operatively. A ventral midline laparotomy was performed and an efferent lymphatic was catheterized. Lymphangiography was performed followed by D5W flush. A 1:1 or 2:1 combination of Lipiodol:cyanoacrylate was mixed and injected under fluoroscopic guidance. Lymphangiography was repeated to confirm complete occlusion of the thoracic duct; the procedure was repeated until complete occlusion confirmed. Minor complications (3/3) included glue entering the venous system (2/3) and one catheter being glued in place. There were no major complications. There has been no evidence of significant recurrent chylothorax or chyloabdomen in these patients 21, 78, and 230 days post-operatively. Early experience suggests that glue embolization of the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct may be feasible in patients with idiopathic chylothorax. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial fibrotic pulmonary disease, mainly described in West Highland White Terrier (WHWT). The diagnosis is challenging and ultimately relies on lung histopathology. Identification of blood biomarkers specific for the disease would be very helpful. Endothelin-1 (ET1) has been shown to be elevated in the serum of humans with IPF. The aim of the present study was to compare serum ET1 level in healthy versus dogs with IPF. Twelve dogs with IPF (eleven WHWT, one Scottish Terrier, mean age 12 years, range 8-15), thirteen privately-owned healthy WHWT from Finland (9 years, 3-14) and twelve healthy experimental beagle dogs from Belgium (7 years, 3-11) entered the study. IPF was diagnosed based on the presence of typical clinical findings, exclusion of other respiratory diseases, and confirmation by histopathology. Serum ET1 concentration, determined by ELISA was significantly elevated in dogs with IPF as compared to both healthy beagle dogs and WHWT. Median ET1 was 2.32 pg/mL (interquartile range 2.05-3.38) in IPF dogs vs 1.56 (interquartile range 1.25-1.85) in WHWT (p o 0.001) and 1.28 (interquartile range 1.07-1.53) in beagle dogs (p o 0.001). No significant difference (p 5 0.066) was detected between healthy beagle dogs and WHWT. The present study shows that serum ET1 values are not significantly influenced by differences in breed, and suggest that ET1 might possibly be a blood marker of IPF in dogs. Comparison with serum ET1 concentration in dogs with other chronic pulmonary diseases is needed to assess the specificity of serum ET1 in the diagnosis of canine IPF. Asthma is a common lower airway disorder in pet cats and there is a need to discover biomarkers which could be used to discriminate it from other airway disorders, monitor efficacy of treatment and provide prognostic information. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is expressed primarily in the lung and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases through its pro-inflammatory, profibrotic and bronchoconstrictive properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of healthy cats and experimentally asthmatic cats for the presence of ET-1 to further our understanding of the pathogenesis of feline asthma and evaluate ET-1 as a potential biomarker. We hypothesized that exper-imentally asthmatic cats, but not control cats without airway inflammation, would have elevated concentrations BALF ET-1. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from healthy control cats (n 5 6) and cats with experimentally induced asthma (n 5 5). The BALF total and differential cell count was evaluated for each cat. The concentration of immunoreactive ET-1 in BALF was determined using a capture ELISA (Biomedica Gruppe, Austria) according to manufacturer's instructions. The lower limit of detection (LD) is 0.625 fmol/mL. Two cats in the control group had BALF ET-1 concentrations below the LD of the assay; for statistical purposes the ET-1 concentration was reported as ET 0.625 fmol/ mL. Data were analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test with p o 0.05 considered significant. A Pearson product moment correlation was used to evaluate for correlation between BALF ET-1 concentration and BALF total cell numbers and eosinophil numbers. The meanAESD BALF total cell numbers, eosinophil numbers and eosinophil percentages were significantly higher in asthmatic cats (2236 AE 80 cells/ml, 883 AE 559 cells/ml and 37 AE 12%) compared to control cats (476 AE 195 cells/ml, 22 AE 24 cells/ml and 4 AE 3%) (p 5 0.004 for all). The BALF ET-1 concentration was also significantly higher in asthmatic cats (1.470AE0.471 fmol/mL) compared to control cats (0.817AE 0.168) (p 5 0.009). In addition BALF ET-1 concentrations were positively correlated with both BALF total cell numbers (R 5 0.779) and eosinophil numbers (R 5 0.793); correlation was significant at the 0.01 level. Cats with experimentally induced asthma had significantly increased BALF ET concentrations compared to control cats without evidence of airway inflammation. While this study provides promising pilot data regarding the potential utility of ET-1 as an asthma biomarker, future studies with larger numbers and cats with naturally developing asthma are needed. Additionally, since collection of BALF is invasive, analysis of ET in blood should be investigated. For cats with asthma, clinically useful biomarkers to help with diagnosis, monitoring therapeutic efficacy and providing prognostic information are needed. Asthma in cats is believed to be allergic in etiology, orchestrated by T helper 2 cytokines which activate multiple inflammatory cascades and effector cells. This ultimately leads to airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity and airway remodeling. Our laboratory has previously reported poor sensitivity of commercially available feline-specific cytokine ELISAs when used on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in experimentally asthmatic cats and pet cats. We hypothesized that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) could be analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for small molecules that would be manifest in higher quantities in experimentally asthmatic cats. Cats were previously sensitized and challenged using Bermuda grass allergen (BGA). The asthmatic phenotype was confirmed by demonstrating eosinophilic airways inflammation using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis (defined as eosinophils 4 17%). To maintain the asthmatic phenotype, cats were administered an aerosol of BGA once weekly. On the morning of their BGA aerosol challenge, cats first had collection of EBC by placing them in an airtight plexiglass box fitted for an air compressor at one end and an outlet attached to a U shaped stainless steel tube at the other end. The stainless steel tube was submerged in an ice bath to collect exhaled condensate. Approximately 0.5 ml was collected from each cat over 30 minutes. Cats were then challenged with BGA by aerosol and 6 hours later had repeat collection of EBC. Samples were stored at -201C until analysis. Immediately prior to 1 H NMR spectroscopy, EBC was sterile filtered (22 mm syringe filter), buffered to pH 7.0, and spiked with 1 mM of dimethyl-silapentane-sulfonate (DSS). 1 H NMR spectroscopy of EBC from BGA challenged cats resulted in changes among several small molecules when comparing pre-and post-allergen challenge samples. Formate and succinate showed a two-fold increase in signal post-allergen challenge. Lactate showed a 100-fold decrease in signal post-allergen challenge. Our investigations suggest a difference in small molecule expression with allergen exposure in asthmatic cats. Results from this pilot study suggest that 1 H NMR spectroscopy of EBC can be used to identify differences in small molecule expression of cats after acute allergen challenge. Future studies are warranted to demonstrate differences between 1) non-asthmatic and asthmatic cats and 2) preand post-treatment in asthmatic cats. These assays and future studies will be used to identify small molecules as potential biomarkers of active inflammation and response to treatment. Recommendations for tapering of glucocorticoid therapy in cats with lower airway disease (eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation) have traditionally been based on resolution of clinical signs and radiographic abnormalities. In people, resolution of clinical signs is a poor predictor of airway inflammation. In cats, there are no reports on the sensitivity of clinical signs in predicting airway inflammation, in particular while receiving glucocorticoid treatment. Since assessment of the presence of clinical signs is often the driving force behind recommendations to alter therapy in cats with lower airway disease, it is essential to determine if they can reliably predict the presence of airway inflammation. We hypothesized that subclinical inflammation is present in cats with lower airway disease being treated with oral glucocorticoids. Cats with clinical signs of lower airway disease (cough, wheeze, or expiratory respiratory distress) and a definitive diagnosis of lower airway disease diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology (defined as eosinophils 4 17% or neutrophils 4 5%) and no evidence of pulmonary infection were enrolled. Cats were required to have complete resolution of clinical signs and BALF collected while asymptomatic and still receiving glucocorticoid therapy (minimum of 3 weeks in duration). Data were analyzed using a paired t-test with p o 0.05 considered significant and presented as meanAESE. Nine cats were included in the study. The group percentage of BALF eosinophils and neutrophils prior to treatment were 25 AE 7% and 28 AE 9%, respectively. After the baseline BAL, variable treatments with antibiotics and bronchodilators were initiated by preference of the attending clinician and all cats had oral glucocorticoid therapy. Cats were treated with prednisolone (n 5 8) or prednisone (n 5 1) at a dose of 1.8 AE 0.2 mg/kg/day. There was no significant difference before and after treatment between the percent of BALF eosinophils (p 5 0.616) or neutrophils (p 5 0.808) despite complete resolution of clinical signs. After treatment, only 3/9 asymptomatic cats had complete resolution of airway inflammation based on BALF (eosinophils, 3 AE 2%; neutrophils, 4 AE 1%). The remaining 6/9 cats had persistent airway inflammation (eosinophils, 29 AE 11%; neutrophils, 43 AE 12%) despite resolution of their clinical signs. Two-thirds of pet cats with lower airway disease treated with steroids had subclinical airway inflammation as determined by BALF cytology. Since persistent airway inflammation can lead to permanent structural and functional changes in the lungs, therapeutic decisions based solely on the resolution of clinical signs in cats receiving glucocorticoids should likely not be made. We conclude there is a need to reassess how we monitor efficacy of therapy in these cats. Future studies should focus on developing more comprehensive schemes of airway pathology including lung function testing and other, ideally less invasive tests of airway inflammation and remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are zinc-and calcium-dependent endopeptidases involved in the pathogenesis of many disorders in which excessive degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) occurs (e.g., periodontitis, asthma). In cats with experimentally induced asthma, acute exposure to allergen leads to significant increases in eosinophil counts and MMP-2 and -9 activities in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), suggesting that the enzymatic breakdown of the ECM might contribute to the allergen-induced bronchial inflammation. This study aimed at investigating the effects of doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic displaying MMP inhibitory activity, on allergen-induced airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness in Ascaris suum (AS)-sensitized cats. Eight AS-sensitized cats were enrolled in a randomized controlled three-way crossover study in which they underwent three AS-challenges at 1-month intervals. AS-stimulated cats were randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q12h; gold standard), doxycycline hyclate (5 mg/kg PO q12h) or no drug. Each treatment was administered the day before (D À1 ) and until 2 days following AS challenge (D 0 , D 11 , D 12 ), D 0 being the day of allergen exposure. Airway responsiveness (AR) towards inhaled carbachol was evaluated by means of barometric whole-body plethysmography prior to (D À5 ) and 48 hours (D 12 ) after AS challenge and was expressed as the provocative dose of carbachol increasing Penh to 300% of baseline values (C-Penh 300 , in %). BALF and blood samples were collected 72 hours (D 13 ) after AS stimulation. Treatment-related changes in AR, BALF cytology, total protein content and 8-iso-prostaglandin F 2 a concentrations were assessed along with changes in plasma and BALF MMP-2 and -9 activities. No significant differences (P 4 0.05) in mean DC-Penh 300 ([C-Penh 300 D 12 ] -[C-Penh 300 D À5 ], in %) were found among treatment groups. Treatments did not show any significant differences among themselves, with reference to BALF total cell counts (P 4 0.05). Mean BALF eosinophil % in cats treated with prednisolone (8.6 AE 1.7) were significantly lower, compared with values in control (40.1 AE 7.6, P o 0.001) and doxycycline (40.2 AE 6.7, P o 0.001) groups. Decreased BALF total protein content (mg/l) was found after steroid treatment (Untreated: 258.7 AE 37.7; Prednisolone: 120.8 AE 17.6, P 5 0.011; doxycycline: 237.5 AE 31.5; P 4 0.05). Results showed significantly lower plasma and BALF MMP-2 activities in prednisolone-treated cats than in other groups (P o 0.05). There were no significant differences among groups in BALF 8-iso-PGF 2 a concentrations, nor in plasma and BALF MMP-9 activities (P 4 0.05). Oral doxycycline in the present experimental setting failed to decrease airway eosinophilic inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, suggesting that it should not be advocated as the sole therapy for feline allergic asthma. Barometric Whole-Body Plethysmography (BWBP) is a non-invasive pulmonary function test that has been validated in many species, including dogs. In cats, airway reactivity has been shown to decrease significantly in elderly animals. In dogs, however, effect of age on respiratory variables has not been reported. The objective of this study was to assess and compare BWBP respiratory function parameters (RFP) in beagle dogs at different ages. BWBP measurements were obtained in 3 different groups: (1) 10 young beagles evaluated twice, at 7 (1a) and at 16 months of age (1b); (2) 9 healthy adult beagles, aged 5 to 8 years (MA adults, Median 5 7 y 6 m); (3) 8 healthy elderly beagles, aged 11 to 13 years (Old adults, Median 5 12 y 6 m). Airway reactivity was also measured in all dogs using bronchial provocation test with nebulization of histamine at increasing concentrations (0.1 to 1.6%) until Penh (enhanced pause, parameter used as a bronchoconstriction index) exceeded 300% of baseline (H-Penh300). Growth induced a significant increase in most parameters (see table) , except for RR which was higher in group1a compared to group1b. Some parameters (TV/BW, Te, PIF/BW, PEF/ BW) decreased significantly with aging. H-Penh300 was significantly higher in middle-aged adults compared to young adults. This study shows that growing and aging processes have an influence on BWBP parameters. Pulmonary maturity, believed to occur around 1 year old in dogs, might explain the differences in growing dogs. Airway reactivity seems to be the lowest in middleaged dogs. Modifications related to growing and aging are to take into account when analyzing BWBP RFP as part of a diagnostic investigation or treatment efficacy evaluation in dogs with pulmonary diseases. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a mucolytic and antioxidant which is thought to cause bronchoconstriction in cats when delivered by aerosol. A recent abstract reported no adverse effects or alterations in enhanced pause (Penh) after delivery of 150 mg of NAC into a barometric whole body plethysmography chamber in 27 pet cats. However, delivery of NAC by nebulizing into a 38 L chamber likely resulted in minimal distribution to lower airways. Moreover, Penh is an indirect measure of airway resistance and may be insensitive to some changes in airway function. We hypothesized that in experimentally asthmatic cats aerosol delivery of NAC into an endotracheal tube with direct ventilator acquired mechanics would allow detection of airflow limitation. Asthmatic cats (median %BALF eosinophils 5 63%) were monitored during NAC administration (n 5 4) and methacholine (MCh) challenges (n 5 3) 4 1 week apart. Cats were anesthetized with ketamine and propofol and mechanics measured by a ventilator set to neonatal mode (Engstrom Carestation, GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT). Cats were intubated with 4 mm ID, 14 cm long endotracheal tubes and mechanically ventilated. Airway resistance (Raw) was continuously calculated by the ventilator. Sterile saline was delivered first for 30 seconds through an Aeroneb solo in-line nebulizer followed by 4 minutes of data collection (baseline). Delivery of NAC solution 10% for inhalation (American Regent, Inc, Shirley, NY) was followed by 4 minutes of data collection after each dose; the dosing scheme was 50 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg. Data were expressed as the % increase in baseline Raw. MCh challenge was performed by delivering doubling doses of MCh (from 0.0625-32 mg/ml) for 30 seconds followed by 4 minutes of data collection. MCh data were expressed as the concentration of MCh that increased Raw by 200% (EC200Raw). The first 3 study cats had a % increase in baseline Raw after NAC of 123%, 159%, and 170%, and an EC200Raw of 2.7 mg/ml, 3.7 mg/ml and 12.8 mg/ml, respectively. The fourth cat had a % increase in baseline Raw after NAC of 158%. At least one adverse effect was noted in each of the first 3 cats: subjectively excessive tenacious oral secretions, increased lower airway secretions (crackles), and transient unilateral strabismus, respectively. The fourth cat died during anesthetic recovery immediately post-NAC challenge (necropsy pending). Results of this pilot study are in contrast to the previous study which did not report changes in airflow limitation or other perceivable adverse reactions. It is unclear if the NAC caused or contributed to death in one asthmatic cat. We used a direct measure of airway resistance and used a higher dose of NAC (extrapolated from the human infant dosage of 200-400 mg) through the endotracheal tube. Extreme caution should be taken if using this drug in cats with airway disease, if at all. RR, respiratory rate (rpm); BW, body weight (kg); TV, tidal volume (ml); MV, minute volume (ml); Te, expiration time (s); Ti, inspiration time (s); PIF, peak inspiratory flow (ml/s); PEF, peak expiratory flow (ml/s) Ã : Significant difference between groups 1a and 1b (paired t-Test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disease characterized by an abnormal deposition of collagen into alveolar walls. IPF affects mainly West Highland white terriers (WHWT). Procollagen type III amino terminal propeptide (PI-IINP) is a marker of collagen type III synthesis and degradation. The aim of this study was to investigate the concentrations of PI-IINP in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum of dogs with IPF and compare them with those of healthy controls. Fourteen WHWTs and one Scottish terrier with IPF (mean age 12.4 years, range 8-15) and 13 healthy WHWTs (mean age 9.5 years, range 3-14) were included in the study. IPF diagnosis was based on clinical findings and exclusion of other respiratory diseases, and in ten dogs it was confirmed by histopathology. PIIINP concentrations were analyzed from BALF and serum by using a commercially available radioimmunoassay ( Uniq PIIINP RIA, Orion Diagnostica, Finland). Statistical significance was set at P o 0.05. BALF PIIINP concentrations were significantly elevated in dogs with IPF (median 0.37 mg/L; interquartile range, IQ, 0.02-0.61 mg/L) compared with controls (median 0.02 mg/L; IQ 0.02-0.05 mg/L), P 5 0.033. Serum PIIINP concentrations did not differ between the groups. The median value in dogs with IPF was 6.03 mg/L (IQ 4.49-9.40 mg/L) vs. 7.48 mg/L (IQ 6.17-8.86 mg/L) in controls, P 5 0.573. No correlation between serum and BALF PIIINP concentration was detected. Our results suggest that elevated PIIINP concentrations in BALF, but not in serum, serve as a marker of collagen type III turnover in canine IPF. Concerns have been expressed about adverse renal effects of high salt diets. The objective of this blinded study was to compare the effects of normal versus high salt diets on renal variables in aged cats. Twenty healthy neutered cats (10.1 AE 2.4 y.) were included. Following baseline measurements, cats were randomly allocated in 2 groups according to their glomerular filtration rate (GFR), gender, age and body weight. One group was fed a high salt diet (1.30% sodium, 2.27% chloride as fed basis (4000 kcal ME/kg)) and the other one a control diet (0.35% sodium, 0.70% chloride). Body weight, urine specific gravity and protein/creatinine ratio, plasma urea, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, total proteins, systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressures and GFR were measured before, and again 3 and 6 months after diet implementation. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model. None of the variables was affected by the dietary treatment. In conclusion, over a six month period, a high salt diet has no adverse effects on renal function in healthy aged cats. Previous studies have shown the efficacy of canned and dry magnesium-restricted, urine acidifying diets in dissolving struvite stones in cats; the mean times to dissolution in these studies were 26-36 days (canned food) and 34 days (dry food), respectively. Studies have shown that urine supersaturation is primarily responsible for the formation and dissolution of crystals within the urinary tract. A previous study showed the efficacy of a dry diet formulated to generate a urinary struvite relative supersaturation (RSS) o 1 (Royal Canin Urinary S/ O), in dissolving feline struvite uroliths in vitro. The present study was undertaken to determine if a diet with efficacy for dissolving struvite stone in vitro also had efficacy of dissolving struvite stones in vivo. Ten privately owned cats suspected of struvite urolithiasis based on radiographs taken by local practitioners were initially included. Cats were kept in their home environment and owners were instructed to feed Urinary S/O either wet (5 cases) or dry (5 cases) as the exclusive diet for the duration of the study. Investigational parameters at inclusion included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, urine culture, and abdominal radiographs. Radiographs and urinalysis were repeated on a weekly basis and evaluated by two board certified internal medicine specialists to mark time of stone dissolution. Eight spayed female and 2 neutered male cats with a mean age of 7.05 AE 3.34 years were included. Struvite stones dissolved in a median of 24 days (range 14-56 days) and of 19 days (range 10-39 days) in cats fed wet or dry food respectively. Our preliminary results suggest that a diet designed to create urine undersaturated for struvite (RSS o 1) is effective both in vivo and in vitro in dissolution of struvite bladder stones. These results suggest that in vitro studies might be sufficient to predict dissolution times in vivo. We hypothesize that several demographic factors are associated with increased risk for urate urolithiasis in cats. Cases consisted of 5,072 cats with urate uroliths submitted to the Minnesota Urolith Center between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 20081. Controls consisted of 437,228 cats without urinary tract diseases identified in records of the Veterinary Medical Database (Urbana, IL) during the same period. Crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to test the hypothesis. Mixed breed, age group o 1 year, female, intact cats were the reference groups for statistical analysis. Purebred cats had significantly higher risk of developing urate uroliths than cats of other breeds (OR 4 2). Abyssinian, American Shorthair, Himalayan, and Manx cats had significantly lower risks of developing urate uroliths than did other breeds (OR o 0.5). Neutered cats were 12.2 times as likely to develop urate uroliths as were sexually intact cats (CI: 10.64 -13.92). Mean AE SD age of cats with urate uroliths was 6.2 AE 4.3 (range: 0.3 to 16.8) years. Cats in all age groups had a significantly increased risk of developing urate uroliths. Cats ! 4 but o 7 years old had the highest risk of developing urate uroliths; they were 51.4 (CI: 40.59-62.40) times as likely to develop urate uroliths as were cats o 1 year old. The prototypical cat with urate uroliths is a purebred neutered cat 4 to 7 years of old. This information may be helpful in predicting mineral composition of uroliths in vivo. ABSTRACT #108 URINARY ph IS NOT A MAJOR FACTOR IN URINARY caox SUPERSATURATION OF HEALTHY CATS. I van Hoek 1 , S Aladenise 1 , H Dumon 2 , C Tournier 1 , F Garnier 1 , C Venet 1 , Y Soulard 1 , S Vialle 1 , V Biourge 1 . 1 Royal Canin Research Center, Aimargues, France. 2 National Veterinary School Nantes, France. Acidifying diets for treatment of struvite uroliths are regarded as a risk factor for formation of calcium oxalate (CaOx) uroliths, by increasing urinary calcium concentration and excretion. This study investigated the relationship between urinary pH and CaOx relative supersaturation (CaOX-RSS) in healthy cats. A dry expanded control diet served as basis for 12 diets inducing different urinary pH. Diets differed only by addition of various acidifying agents and their concentration. Diets were fed in random order for 2 weeks to 5 adult DSH cats (2 neutered males, 3 females [2 neutered]). Urinary CaOx-RSS was calculated using SUPER-SAT TM software after measurement of pH, Ca, Mg, Na, K, NH 4 1 , phosphate, citrate, sulfate, oxalate and uric acid in pooled urine of each cat from the last 5 days of each study period. Results were analyzed by repeated measurements ANOVA (p o 0.05) and expressed as mean AE SD (range). Urinary pH was 6.1 AE 0.2 (5.7-6.9) and CaOx-RSS was 5.9 AE 2.0 (2.5-12.6). There was no significant effect of urinary pH on CaOx-RSS, urinary excretion of calcium, oxalate or citrate. This study does not support a major role of urinary pH on CaOx-RSS. This suggests that is possible to formulate a diet to reduce both struvite and CaOx urine saturation. Although dissolution diets effectively eradicate struvite urocystoliths, we hypothesize that a maintenance food to prevent struvite crystalluria will also dissolve them. To test this hypothesis we fed 5 cats (3FS, 2MC) with struvite urocystoliths a dry kibble maintenance food formulated to provide 0.06% Mg (DM), 35% protein, and a calculated target urine pH (UpH) of 6.2-6.4. The food was fed exclusively in an amount to maintain body condition. The diagnosis of struvite urolithiasis was based on the radiographic density of uroliths. Weekly follow-up radiographs were performed until urolith resolution, enlargement or 8 weeks, whichever was sooner. Initial mean USG 5 1.047 (range 1.029-1.068) and mean UpH 5 6.12 (range 5.82-6.30). Urine cultures were negative at screening in 4/5 cats. The fifth, was from urine obtained from the cat carrier. The cat was not treated since this was considered environmental contamination. A second cat became positive at the last visit after urolith dissolution and was treated with antibiotics. All cats had negative cultures when dismissed from the study. Infection with calculogenic bacteria was not observed. Dissolution of the uroliths occurred in 4/5 cats. Radiographic resolution occurred in 2 wks (n 5 2), 4 wks (n 5 1) and 5 wks (n 5 1). At resolution cats had a mean USG 5 1.057 (range 1.043-1.078) and mean UpH 5 6.44 (range 6.0-7.1). The fifth cat was taken to surgery at 6 weeks; the urolith was 100% ammonium urate. This case series provides evidence that a maintenance dry kibble diet formulated with a restricted Mg content and moderate target UpH dissolves struvite urocystoliths. Further investigation is warranted to determine the implications of these findings in a larger population. Contaminated veterinary equipment has the potential to spread infections if not cleaned properly between patients. We determined the prevalence of bacterial contamination of 4 surfaces from 10 small animal private practice hospitals in Kansas at 2 announced visits, 4 months apart. One swab each from a cage door, stethoscope, thermometer, and mouth gag, as well as a survey about cleaning protocols, were collected. Selective media for enterococci and enterics and one broad-spectrum medium were used. Speciesspecific PCR and sodA sequencing were used to identify enterococci. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed using the disc diffusion method with Mueller-Hinton agar. Enterococci were isolated from cage doors (7/10 hospitals), stethoscopes (7/10 hospitals), thermometers (4/10 hospitals), and mouth gags (1/10 hospitals), while enterics were rare. Enterococcal contamination was not consistent; only one hospital had substantial contamination at both visits. Enterococcal isolates selected for further analysis (n 5 192) were mainly represented by E. faecium (40%), E. hirae (33%), and E. faecalis (23%). Enterococcus faecium were frequently resistant to enrofloxacin (79%), erythromycin (78%), ampicillin (77%), doxycycline (22%), nitrofurantoin (21%), and gentamicin (12%), while other enterococcal species were mostly susceptible to all nine antibiotics. Seven of ten hospitals reported cleaning cage doors between patients, but only 2/10 allow 10-minute contact time with disinfectant. Fifty percent of veterinarians reported almost-never cleaning their stethoscopes. Contamination with multi-drug resistant enterococci is a concern and may increase risk of hospital-acquired infections. Cleaning cage doors, stethoscopes, and thermometers between patients and allowing 10-minute disinfectant contact time on surfaces is recommended to reduce bacterial contamination. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) are recognized as significant pathogens in veterinary medicine. To date there have been no studies examining MRSA or MRSP colonization rates in animal shelters in the United States. There is potential for animals to serve as a source of MRSA or MRSP re-infection in humans. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of MRSA and MRSP colonization in cats and dogs housed in a northern Colorado animal shelter. Nasal and perianal swabs were collected from 200 cats and 200 dogs in an open admission shelter. This included 100 cats and 100 dogs housed in respective stray wards and 100 cats and 100 dogs available for adoption. Samples from each animal were pooled and inoculated on selective media to isolate MRSA/MRSP. Antimicrobial sensitivity was confirmed via Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion. Overall MRSA/MRSP prevalence rates and prevalence rates by subgroup for MRSP were calculated. MRSA (0.5%) or MRSP (3%) samples were isolated from dogs. The MRSA dog was housed in the stray ward. Of the MRSP, 33% (2/6) were obtained from dogs housed in the stray ward while 66.7% (4/6) were obtained from dogs on the adoption floor. The length of stay at the time of sampling for the MRSP dogs ranged from 1 to 8 days. The MRSA (0.5%) isolated from a cat was from a 3 month old kitten housed in the stray ward. Results reveal a low prevalence of MRSA and are consistent with previous findings of 1-2% prevalence in dogs and cats in animal hospitals. The MRSP results were slightly higher than the 0-2% prevalence reported in other canine studies. The cat colonized with MRSA was housed with 4 MRSA negative littermates. These results suggest animals housed in a regularly cleaned shelter environment are not at greater risk of acquiring MRSA/MRSP and pose no more risk to adopters than animals in the general population. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) infections are an important problem in veterinary medicine. This unmatched casecontrol study tested the hypotheses that the prevalence of MRS infections of small animals presented to the PUVTH is increasing, and that breed, previous antibiotic treatment, previous surgery, hospital visit or ICU stay are risk factors for MRS infection. The PUVTH microbiology results database was searched for Staphylococcus species infections between 1/1/2006 and 11/30/2009. MRS was defined as an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for the mec-A gene. Data abstracted from medical records included case number, species, breed, age, gender, neuter status; Staphylococcus species; PCR result; site of sample collection (skin, lungs, urinary tract, wound/ surgical site, other); date and season of MRS diagnosis; admitting department (dermatology, medicine, surgery); antibiotic use, surgical procedure, or veterinary visit 30 days prior to diagnosis; and ICU stay of 4 1 day prior to diagnosis. Hospital prevalence per year was determined by dividing the number of MRS infected animals by the total number of small animal visits to PUVTH per year. Only infections of dogs were considered for risk factor analysis. Controls were randomly selected from dogs with oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus infections (n 5 64). Risk factors were evaluated by logistic regression using R (r-project.org) statistical software; p o 0.05 was considered significant. Abbreviations used: MRS aureus (2007). Hospital prevalence increased significantly over time for MRSA (p 5 0.026) and MRSE (p 5 0.002). The dermatology department diagnosed more patients with MRSE than did other departments (p 5 0.002); skin was the most common site of infection. Previous antibiotic treatment was associated with increased risk for MRSA infection (p 5 0.010). Dogs undergoing surgery, visiting a veterinarian, or hospitalized in the ICU 30 days before MRS diagnosis were not at increased risk for MRS infection. MRS infection was not associated with season, age, gender, neuter status or breed. To conclude, hospital prevalence of MRS infections of animals presented to PUVTH increased significantly from 2006 to 2009. MRSA infections were more common than other MRS, and MRSE infections were predominant in patients with dermatologic conditions. MRSI infection was uncommon. Finally, prior antibiotic use was a risk factor for MRSA infection. In previous studies, DNA of feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) and Mycoplasma spp. were the most likely to be amplified by PCR assays from nasal discharges of cats with rhinitis and ocular discharges of cats with conjunctivitis. However, both organisms can colonize healthy cats and in the previous studies, only small numbers of samples from normal cats were included as controls. Thus, the significance of positive PCR test results for FHV-1 and Mycoplasma spp. in samples from clinically ill cats is unclear. The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence rates for FHV-1 DNA and Mycoplasma spp. DNA in samples from cats with and without conjunctivitis. Cats housed in two animal shelters in Oregon were used for the study. Cats with conjunctivitis with no obvious exogenous cause, with or without rhinitis were included in the study. For every two cats with conjunctivitis, samples were to be collected from a cat housed in the shelter without conjunctivitis. Conjunctival cells were collected by rubbing a sterile cotton swab gently in the conjunctival fornix of both eyes after application of topical 1% proparacaine to induce local analgesia. Samples were stored at À20C until shipped to Colorado State University where they were processed and assayed for total DNA as well as DNA of FHV-1 and Mycoplasma spp. using adaptations of previously published PCR assays. Differences in prevalence rates were compared by Fisher's exact test with significance defined as p o 0.05. Overall, samples were collected from 69 cats with conjunctivitis and 30 cats without conjunctivitis. The results of the PCR assays are shown in the following table. Results of Mycoplasma spp. and FHV-1 PCR assay results do not always document a disease association. However, while both organisms can be amplified from cats with and without conjunctivitis, Mycoplasma spp. were amplified from a greater percentage of cats with conjunctivitis suggesting that this microbial group may be common primary pathogens in cats with this syndrome. The objective of this ongoing study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of the urine and serum blastomycosis antigen tests (performed by MiraVista Diagnostics) for the diagnosis of blastomycosis in dogs and to compare the results with the established agar immunodiffusion (AGID) antibody test in clinically relevant populations of dogs with infiltrative respiratory disease. In total, the study will involve the collection of serum and urine from 20 dogs definitively diagnosed with blastomycosis by cytology and/or histopathology and serum and urine samples from 20 dogs with a definitive diagnosis of other infiltrative pulmonary disease as non-fungal, respiratory disease controls. Dogs with histoplasmosis infection will not be included in this study. The testing laboratories are fully masked as to the disease status of each case. To date the study has recruited 13 dogs with blastomycosis and 7 dogs with other non-fungal infiltrative pulmonary disease. The results for these 20 dogs produced a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% for both the urine and serum MiraVista antigen tests, compared with a sensitivity of 57% and a specificity of 100% for the AGID serum antibody test. It is anticipated that data for all 20 cases and all 20 respiratory controls will be compiled by mid 2010. In conclusion, based on this initial data, the MiraVista antigen test appears to be a very sensitive and specific non-invasive means of detecting blastomycosis infection in dogs with respiratory disease. Commercially available urine and serum tests measuring Blastomyces antigen show high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of blastomycosis in dogs. The purpose of this study was to monitor the levels of urine and serum Blastomyces antigen throughout antifungal therapy and evaluate their relationship with clinical remission. Dogs were prospectively enrolled on the basis of: 1) cytologic or histopathologic confirmation of Blastomyces infection, 2) serum and urine samples obtained within 14 days of beginning antifungal therapy, and 3) adequate follow-up to the point of clinical remission. Dogs failing to survive the first month of treatment were censored from analyses. Dogs were evaluated monthly with a physical exam, fundic exam, chest radiographs (if abnormal at diagnosis), and additional specific imaging as indicated by clinical presentation. Dogs were considered to be in clinical remission when no active disease was identified on physical exam, and radiographs or other imaging were normalized, or static for at least one month. All dogs were treated with fluconazole or itraconazole until one month beyond clinical remission. Serum and urine samples were obtained at each visit for Blastomyces antigen levels via enzyme 08-14.90 ). For dogs achieving negative urine antigen levels during treatment (n 5 9), there was no significant difference in the time to negative urine antigen levels (median 117 days, range 32 -230), compared to the time to clinical remission (median 130 days, range 73-215; P 5 0.60). However, there was a significant difference in time to negative serum antigen levels (median 30 days, range 0-133) and clinical remission (P 5 o 0.0001). The median urine antigen levels at the time of clinical remission were 2.20 EIA units (range 0.31-10.04), and at treatment discontinuation (approximately one month later) were 1.17 EIA units (range 0.53-5.87). The sensitivity and specificity of Blastomyces urine antigen in predicting clinical remission were 41% and 92%, respectively. These results indicate that a negative Blastomyces urine antigen level is associated with clinical remission with a high degree of specificity; work is underway to determine a cut-off with higher sensitivity. Serum Blastomyces antigen levels become negative quickly after the initiation of therapy and significantly prior to clinical remission, and should not be used to determine resolution of disease. Babesia rossi infections in dogs are frequently complicated and patients have a high mortality rate within the first 24-hours after admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hypoglycemia and hypercortisolaemia at admission as well as persistent hyperlactataemia have been identified as strong prognosticators, indicating metabolic dysbalance to be important to outcome. Recently, the cytokine monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1 was identified as a strong predictor of mortality in human sepsis and has also been reported to increase in experimental canine sepsis. The aim of the study was to determine whether MCP-1 is a marker for mortality in complicated babesiosis caused by B.rossi. This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study included 72 client-owned dogs diagnosed with canine babesiosis and admitted to the ICU of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria. Diagnosis was based on morphological demonstration of the intraerythrocytic trophozoites on blood films. Dogs with concurrent infections or with a history of treatment for an infection in the preceding 7 days were excluded. Infection with B.rossi was confirmed by PCR. Dogs infected with B.vogeli, or concurrent Ehrlichia canis or Theileria spp. infection, and dogs euthanized for reasons other than poor prognosis were excluded. Five healthy dogs were included as controls. Blood samples were collected at admission. Serum MCP-1 concentration was assessed by a canine-specific assay (CCYTO-90 K, Millipore, USA) and glucose by standard enzymatic methodology. Mortality during hospitalization was recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the cytokine level in controls vs. babesiosis patients and in survivors vs. non-survivors. Analysis of the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) was used to compare the prognostic abilities of MCP-1 and glucose. P o 0.05 was considered significant. Mortality fraction was 19% (14/72), all within 24 h of admission. Significantly increased levels (median [range]) of MCP-1 was observed in babesiosis patients (431 pg/mL [99;20270 pg/mL]) compared to controls (118 pg/mL [85;634 pg/mL]) and in non-survivors compared to survivors (757 pg/mL [291;7951 pg/mL] and 421 pg/ mL [99;20268 pg/mL], respectively). The prognostic abilities (ROC-AUC) of MCP-1 and glucose were similar (0.71 and 0.74, respectively, P 5 0.65). Increased concentrations of MCP-1 were observed in dogs infected with B.rossi compared to healthy controls and furthermore MCP-1 was seemingly a prognostic biomarker comparable to one of the strongest known predictors for outcome in this disease. Previous experimental studies have demonstrated MCP-1 as an important immunomodulator in sepsis and the results of this study indicate that dysbalances in immunoregulation play an important role in the outcome of babesia caused by B.rossi, in addition to the previously described metabolic dysbalances. The inflammatory response to infection can activate the coagulation system via complex interactions. If uncontrolled, this may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has been identified as a major risk factor for poor outcome in both human and canine medicine. Studies have indicated that patients naturally infected with Babesia rossi suffer from Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) with possible DIC, without clinical signs of bleeding. We hypothesized that a consumptive coagulopathy is present in dogs with B. rossi infection and that the extent of the coagulopathy is related to outcome. This prospective, cross-sectional, observational study included 72 client-owned dogs diagnosed with canine babesiosis and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria. Infection with B.rossi was confirmed by bloodsmear and PCR. Dogs infected with B.vogeli, or Ehrlichia canis, and dogs euthanized for reasons other than poor prognosis were excluded. Blood samples were collected at admission to hospital. Coagulation factor-, antithrombin-(AT), protein C activity and fibrinogen were assessed using an automated coagulometric analyzer (ACL top 500, Instrumentation Laboratory). D-Dimer was measured using an immunometric flow-through principle (D-Dimer Single test, Nycocard Reader II, Medinor A/S). Mortality during hospitalization was recorded. Levels between the non-survivors and survivors were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. P o 0.05 was considered significant. Mortality fraction was 19% (14/72). The individual median coagulation factor activity percentage was significantly lower in the non-survivors than the survivors: FII was 40.5% vs. 76.7% (p o 0.01); FV was 56.8% vs. 106.4% (p o 0.001); FVII was 46.9% vs. 73.4% (p o 0.05); FVIII was 60.3% vs. 109.7% (p o 0.001); FIX was 56.5% vs. 101.7% (p o 0.001); FX was 35.4% vs. 73.9% (p o 0.001); FXI was 43.4% vs. 74.9% (p o 0.01); FXII was 48.9% vs. 77.4% (p o 0.01). Median AT activity was not significantly different between the two groups. Median protein C activity was significantly lower in the non-survivors than the survivors; 44.0% vs. 74.0% (p o 0.05). Median fibrinogen level was not significantly different between the two groups; 3.7 g/L vs. 4.8 g/L (p 5 0.25). The median D-Dimer value was significantly higher in the dogs that died than in the dogs that survived; 1.6 mg/L vs. 0.4 mg/L (p o 0.01). This study demonstrated that mortality was associated with a consumptive coagulopathy in dogs infected with B.rossi. The presence of activated coagulation (decreased coagulation factor activity), inhibitor consumption (low protein C) and increased fibrinolytic activity (high D-dimers) in non-survivors of virulent canine babesiosis are indicative of DIC, possibly secondary to a hypercoagulable state caused by the inflammatory response. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (PCR) are increasingly being used to document the presence of DNA or RNA of infectious agents in samples collected from dogs suspected to have infectious causes of respiratory disease. Dogs are often administered modified live vaccines (MLV) against some of the infectious agents including adenovirus 2, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and parainfluenza. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of vaccination on results of the FastPanel TM PCR Canine Respiratory Disease Profile (Antech Diagnostics) for these agents. Young adult, mixed sex, apparently healthy beagles retired from a breeding facility were housed in two separate groups of six. On Day 0, Group 1 was administered a MLV DA2PP and an inactivated coronavirus vaccine subcutaneously (SQ), an inactivated canine influenza virus vaccine SQ, and a MLV Parainfluenza and B. bronchiseptica vaccine intranasally (IN) and Group 2 was administered a MLV DA2PP vaccine SQ and an inactivated B. bronchiseptica vaccine SQ. On Day 14, all dogs were administered a canarypox vectored canine distemper virus, adenovirus 2 and parvovirus vaccine SQ and a MLV adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, and B. bronchiseptica IN. Swabs of the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa were collected prior to vaccination on Days 0 and 14 as well as on Days 3, 7, 10, 17, 21, 24 and 28 and were shipped on cold packs by overnight express for DNA/RNA extraction and assay in the FastPanel TM . Adequate DNA/RNA was present on all swabs. Nucleic acids of B. bronchiseptica (12 of 216 samples; 5.6%), parainfluenza (5 of 216 samples; 2.3%), or adenovirus 2 (6 of 216 samples; 2.8%) were amplified from some samples. DNA of B. bronchiseptica was amplified from two Group 1 dogs (Dogs 5 and 6) and five Group 2 dogs (Dogs 2-6) prior to vaccination. Over the remainder of the study, only three dogs were positive for B. bronchiseptica DNA on one sample date each (Group 1, Dog 2, day 17; Group 2, Dogs 2 and 4, day 17). Parainfluenza RNA was amplified only from Group 1 dogs (Dogs 1-3 and 5, day 3; Dog 2, day 7). Adenovirus 2 RNA was amplified from four dogs on one sample date (Group 1, dogs 4 and 5, day 17; Group 2; dogs 4 and 5, Day 17). Nucleic acids of adenovirus 2, B. bronchiseptica, and parainfluenza can be amplified from adult beagles without respiratory signs of disease and so positive test results do not conclusively prove the agent was the cause of illness in dogs with clinical signs. However, the MLV vaccines studied here either did not induce positive test results or positive test results were short-lived suggesting that prior vaccination will have minimal effect on the positive predictive values of these assays in adult dogs. Further studies are indicated to define duration of positive test results in previously unvaccinated puppies. Canine Leishmaniasis (CanL) is a severe systemic disease caused by Leishmania infantum and its prevalence in the Mediterranean basin is as high as 67%. Clinical signs are caused by the parasite itself, the circulating immune complexes and their deposition, leading to polyarthritis, uveitis, glomerulonephritis and vasculitis. It has been recently described an unusual presentation of CanL with a generalised vasculitis and myocarditis. Thus, CanL should be added to the differential diagnosis list of cardiomyopathy. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) has a high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial damage and it has never been investigated before in dogs suffering from CanL. CTnI concentration was measured in 160 dogs diagnosed of CanL by ELISA between January 2007 and December 2008. Sixty (37.5%) CanL positive dogs had cTnI values over the reference range. CTnI values showed statistical significant correlation with age (r 5 0.401, n 5 150), PCV (r 5 -0.279, n 5 103), albumin (r 5 -0.489, n 5 125), A/G (r 5 -0.365, n 5 125), urea (r 5 0.195, n 5 131) and creatinine (r 5 0.245, n 5 130). Table shows number of animals (n) and median (Mdn) with the P 2.5 -P 97.5 interval [P] for the studied parameters, grouped according to cTnI categorized as mildly, moderately or markedly increased (statistically signficant differences between groups are noted with different letters, p o 0.05). Older, anemic, hypoalbuminemic animals and those with renal failure had higher cTnI values. High cTnI values were not associated with high Leishmania serology values. When cTnI values where correlated with age, creatinine, PCV and Leishmania serology in a multiple lineal regression model, the interaction of all four parameters only explains 7.5% of the variation in cTnI values, being the age the most important parameter affecting cTnI. In conclusion our study shows that 37.5% of animals with CanL have an increase in cTnI values. Anemia and renal failure affect cTnI, but age and albumin should also be considered. The reason for cTnI increase in animals with CanL might be related to the direct effect of Leishmania on myocytes and/or the presence of vasculitis associated to CanL, as previously described. Biomarkers are needed to aid in the diagnosis and prognostication of canine sepsis. We evaluated if TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 could be used as biomarkers for canine sepsis. Blood was collected from dogs with sepsis (n 5 8), non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (n 5 7) and healthy controls (n 5 13) at hospital presentation. Because plasma TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 were often undetectable, dogs were categorized as either having an inflammatory mediator response (i.e., inflammatory mediator detected in plasma) or not (i.e., inflammatory mediator not detected). Groups were compared using a Fisher exact test with p o 0.05 considered significant. Significantly more dogs in the sepsis and SIRS groups had TNF (sepsis, 8/8, p o 0.001; SIRS, 5/7, p 5 0.001; control, 0/13) and IL-6 (sepsis, 4/8, p 5 0.047; SIRS, 6/7, p 5 0.001; control 1/13) response compared to the control group. There was no difference in the number of dogs with TNF or IL-6 response between sepsis and SIRS groups (TNF, p 5 0.21; IL-6 p 5 0.28) or IL-10 response among groups (sepsis 3/8; SIRS 2/7; control 9/13; p 4 0.15). Mortality was 75% in the sepsis and 28.5% in the SIRS groups. Using Spearman rank order correlation, plasma TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were not significantly correlated with mortality in the sepsis or SIRS groups. TNF and IL-6 are detectable in plasma during infectious (i.e., sepsis) and non-infectious forms of SIRS in dogs while the presence of IL-10 in the plasma is variable during health and inflammation. Plasma TNF, IL-6 and IL-10 at hospital presentation do not differentiate sepsis from SIRS or predict mortality in dogs. Sepsis is a serious problem in cats that is associated with morbidity and mortality rates of 22-79%. Understanding the inflammatory response to infection in cats may help in the diagnosis, treatment and prognostication of sepsis in this species. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and inflammatory parameters among cats with sepsis (n 5 16), non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (n 5 19) and healthy controls (n 5 8) at presentation to the hospital. Clinicopathologic abnormalities in the sepsis group included increased band neutrophil percentage, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperbilirubinemia. Comparing the sepsis and SIRS groups, the only significant differences in the CBC and plasma biochemical findings were the percentage of band neutrophils and plasma albumin concentration. Cats with sepsis had significantly greater plasma TNF activity than control and were more likely to have detectable concentrations of IL-6 than the control or SIRS group. Plasma IL-1b activity was not significantly different among groups and CXCL-8 was not detectable in the majority of cats. Mortality was greater for cats with sepsis (43.75%) than cats with non-infectious SIRS (26.3%). Plasma IL-1b, IL-6 and chloride concentrations were the only parameters evaluated that significantly correlated with mortality in the sepsis group. This study demonstrated that cats are more likely to have band neutrophils and hypoalbuminemia than cats with SIRS and that sepsis is associated with TNF, IL-1b and IL-6 production in cats. Interleukin-1b and IL-6 may be promising prognostic biomarkers for feline sepsis; additional investigation is needed to confirm these findings. Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent used to treat many canine diseases. Optimal dosing regimens remain unclear, primarily because standard methods that monitor effectiveness of immunosuppression have not been established. Our study was designed to evaluate a comprehensive panel of biomarkers of immunosuppression in 7 normal dogs at two different oral doses of cyclosporine. For our panel, we used flow cytometry to measure expression of cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, & INF-a˜) and surface antigens (CD25 & CD95) on T-lymphocytes activated with PMA/ionomycin and concanavalin A, and quantitative real-time PCR to measure IL-2 and INF-a. Dogs were first given a high dose of cyclosporine (starting dose 10 mg/kg bid), with doses adjusted to attain established immunosuppressive trough drug blood levels of at least 600 ng/mL (measured by HPLC). Biomarkers were evaluated on Day 8 of therapy, 8 hours after dosing. Flow cytometric expression of cytokines IL-2 & INF-a˜was significantly reduced in all dogs, whereas results with cytokine IL-4 and surface markers CD25 & CD95 were more variable. After a washout period, dogs were given cyclosporine at the dose approved to treat atopy (5 mg/kg sid), and flow cytometric expression of IL-2 & INF-a˜was again measured at steady state. Mean T-cell expression of IL-2 & INF-a˜measured by flow cytometry was significantly decreased below baseline values at both cyclosporine doses, although suppression of cytokine expression was much less marked at the lower dose of cyclosporine, and much more variable in individual dogs. No difference was detected between baseline and post-treatment IL-2 & INF-a˜real-time PCR results 8 hours after drug administration (Day 8, high dose cyclosporine). However, a follow-up study in two of the dogs demonstrated suppression of IL-2 & INF-a˜by real-time PCR at 4 hours post-dosing, demonstrating that, in contrast to cytokine expression as measured by flow cytometry, detectable effects of cyclosporine on T-lymphocyte cytokine mRNA as measured by PCR are more transient. Our study confirms that cyclosporine suppresses selected biomarkers of immunosuppression in a dose dependent manner. Further investigation of the effects of cyclosporine on these biomarkers in normal dogs at different doses and blood levels of the drug, and in clinic patients, is warranted. Dogs are susceptible to a wide variety of immune mediated diseases, many of which are life-threatening. Corticosteroids, usually the first drug of choice, cause important morbidity. Alternative and adjunctive immunosuppressive drug treatments have met anecdotal success. One such drug is leflunomide. It is converted to an active metabolite teriflunomide (A77 1726), which is responsible for its immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory effects. Currently there is no data available on the pharmacokinetics of this drug in dogs. The objective of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of leflunomide and its active metabolite teriflunomide in healthy dogs. Four female dogs with normal CBC, chemistry and urinalysis were used. Heparinized blood samples were collected at hour 0,1,2,4,8,12, and day 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,17 after oral administration of 4 mg/kg leflunomide. The plasma was separated by centrifugation within 30 minutes of collection and frozen (À801C) until analysis. Concentrations of leflunomide and its active metabolite, teriflunomide, were measured by HPLC analysis at NCSU. Concentrations of the parent drug, leflunomide, were undetectable in most samples. Pharmacokinetic analysis was subsequently performed on the metabolite teriflunomide. In these dogs, the mean terminal half life (T 1/2 ) was 21.33 (1/À 1.93) hrs and mean peak plasma concentration (C MAX ) was 5.01 (1/À 1.37) mg/mL. The mean residence time (MRT) of the metabolite was 26.8 hrs (1/À 10.8). These results were drastically different from what has been reported in people, in which the half-life of teriflunomide was 15 days, and the plasma concentration was 12 mg/mL three hours after a single loading dose of 100 mg per person (approximately 1.4 mg/ kg). In dogs, when doses were simulated to steady-state (6 doses), the peak concentration attained after multiple doses was 7.3 mg/mL and the trough was 3.7 mg/mL, which is less than the therapeutic trough concentrations reported for people of 20 mg/mL. A single dosage of 4 mg/kg of oral leflunomide in these dogs was well tolerated and resulted in a half-life that will permit 24 hour dosing intervals. The limited anecdotal information to date has indicated that dogs with immune mediated and inflammatory diseases have responded to an oral dosage of 4 mg/kg once daily, but these doses were not critically evaluated in controlled studies. In our study, we observed that plasma concentrations of the active metabolite obtained after 4 mg/kg of leflunomide reached a peak of only 5 mg/mL. Although a loading dose is used in people and has been suggested for dogs, loading is likely unnecessary in dogs because of the short halflife in this species. Steady-state concentrations in dogs, assuming pharmacokinetic values obtained from this study, will be achieved after once-daily dosing in approximately 4 days. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this drug. Endocrine dysregulation of energy metabolism is well documented in critically ill human neonates, but limited information exists in critically ill neonatal foals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between hormones that regulate energy metabolism (insulin, glucagon, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin and growth hormone) and their association with blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations in healthy and critically ill neonatal foals. We hypothesized that concentrations of insulin and leptin will be positively correlated with serum glucose and negatively correlated with serum triglyceride concentrations. Glucagon, ghrelin, growth hormone (GH) and adiponectin will be positively correlated with triglycerides and negatively correlated with glucose concentrations. Further, ghrelin will be associated with GH. We included 44 septic, 62 sick non-septic, and 19 healthy foals of o 7 days of age. Blood samples were collected on admission. Foals with a positive blood culture or a sepsis score ! 12 were considered septic. The Spearman rank order statistic was used to define correlations between variables. Serum glucose concentrations were positively correlated with insulin and leptin (insulin only in septic foals), and negatively correlated with glucagon, adiponectin, ghrelin and growth hormone (growth hormone only in septic foals). Serum triglyceride concentrations were positively correlated with glucagon, ghrelin and growth hormone (glucagon and ghrelin only in septic foals). Glucose, triglycerides, insulin, ghrelin and glucagon were also associated with the sepsis score (data not shown). Correlations between the hormones are shown in table. This study showed that energy endocrine dysregulation is frequent in septic foals as a result of increased caloric needs and systemic inflammation. We observed a complex hormonal response, as demonstrated by the association between hormones, glucose, triglycerides, and the sepsis score. Ghrelin and GH were associated with insulin and glucagon, supporting their role in energy regulation. Reducing insulin resistance may decrease the incidence of laminitis in horses with Equine Metabolic Syndrome. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drug, modulates transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism in humans. The ability of pioglitazone to influence insulin sensitivity and gene expression in equine tissues in an endotoxin-infusion model of induced insulin resistance was investigated. Sixteen mature horses were randomly allocated to receive either 14 days of pioglitazone (1 mg/kg, orally, q24h, n 5 8) or control (n 5 8). On days 12 and 14 a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) test with minimum model analysis was performed and a skeletal muscle biopsy (middle gluteal) was harvested. Whole tissue RNA was extracted to determine, by qRT-PCR, the expression of insulin receptor and insulin responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4). On day 13, all horses received an endotoxin infusion (Escherichia coli 055:B5 lipopolysaccharide, 35 ng/kg, IV, over 30 min). Serial assessment of clinical and leukocyte parameters, indicies of insulin homeostasis and gene expression were compared prior to, and following, endotoxin infusion. Heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (RT) increased and white blood cell count (WBC) decreased following endotoxin infusion (P o 0.001), however maximal change from baseline did not differ between pioglitazone treated horses or their controls (P 5 0.3719, P 5 0.6695, P 5 0.3611 HR, RT, WBC, respectively). Twelve days of pioglitazone did not increase insulin sensitivity (P 5 0.278) nor protect against endotoxin induced insulin resistance (P 5 0.241). Pioglitazone increased insulin receptor (P 5 0.018), but not GLUT4 transcript levels in skeletal muscle. Endotoxin infusion reduced GLUT 4 transcript levels (P 5 0.059), but had no effect on insulin receptor (P 5 0.396) in both treated and control horses. Pioglitazone treatment had no effect on GLUT4 transcript levels (P 5 0.418) following endotoxin infusion. Although no physiologic changes in insulin sensitivity were identified following pioglitazone treatment, the finding of increased insulin receptor expression may warrant investigation of either the effects of a longer treatment period or in horses with obesity-associated insulin resistance. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic routinely used in veterinary medicine. Ketamine has demonstrated positive cardiostimulatory effects, immunomodulation, decreased leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and analgesia in various species challenged by lipopolysacchride (LPS). A recent report in canids demonstrated significant blunting of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) production using subanesthetic doses of ketamine during periods of endotoxemia. In-vivo and in-vitro immunomodulation following endotoxemia has been demonstrated in mice through direct inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B and inhibition of LPS-induced TNFa and interleukin-6 production in an equine macrophage cell line model, respectively. TNF-a is considered the earliest cytokine released during endotoxemia along with the induction of the vasoactive substance thromboxane (TXB 2 ). The aim of this prospective study was to determine if a subanesthetic continuous rate infusion (CRI) of ketamine could be safely administered and result in positive immunomodulation in horses with experimentally induced endotoxemia. Specifically, this pilot study addressed whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could attenuate both the LPS-induced production of TNF-a and TXB 2 , and the induction of clinicopathologic findings of endotoxemia. 20 mares of various breeds were randomly assigned to two groups, control or ketamine treated. Each horse in the ketamine group received a subanesthetic CRI (1.5 mg/kg/h over 5 h) of racemic ketamine, following a loading dose, while the control group received an equal volume of 0.9% saline. Both groups were administered endotoxin (LPS, Escherichia coli 055:B5, 30 ng/kg over 30 min) 1 hour after initiation of the ketamine or saline CRI. Clinicopathologic parameters and sample collection were monitored at half-hour and hourly intervals relative to LPS administration. All horses completed the study uneventfully. The most significant clinical findings were transient excitation in horses during the initial ketamine loading dose period. Respiratory rates were significantly elevated in the ketamine group at 1 and 6 hours post-LPS compared to controls. A neutrophilic leukocytosis was observed in both groups, with a significantly greater elevation in the ketamine group 5 hours post-LPS. No significant difference was observed between groups regarding plasma TNF-a production whereas a trend towards decreased TXB 2 levels was observed in the ketamine group. The targeted plasma steady state of ketamine (100 ng/ml) was attained. This study indicates that a subanesthetic CRI of ketamine can be safely administered to endotoxemic horses. Although TNF-a levels were not lower in the ketamine treated group than controls, this study documented a trend in lower TXB 2 levels in ketamine treated horses. Results of this study may have been limited by endotoxin dose and ketamine treatment duration. Given these findings, further studies regarding the clinical utility of a subanesthetic ketamine CRI are warranted. Endotoxemia is responsible for the severe illness in horses associated with colic, diarrhea, pleuropneumonia, peritonitis and metritis. It is possible for the body to develop a state of 'tolerance', in which it becomes unresponsive to the endotoxin molecule. This has direct survival value, as laboratory rodents with induced endo- however, the cytokine responses associated with this have not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to describe a method for inducing ET in equine cells in vitro, and to describe the cytokine profile which is associated with the ET. Blood was collected from 6 healthy horses and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated. ET was induced by culturing cells with a variety of concentrations of endotoxin (0.1, 1.0 and 10 ng/ ml), followed by a second endotoxin challenge (1.0, 10 and 100 ng/ ml). The state of tolerance was identified by assaying cell culture media for TNF-a concentration (ELISA). ET was confirmed when the TNF-a production was reduced by greater than 75% compared to non-tolerized control cells. The relative mRNA expression of IL-10 and IL-12 was measured in tolerized and non-tolerized control cells by use of RT-PCR at the time of the second endotoxin challenge and 6, 12 and 24 hours after the second endotoxin challenge. ET was induced in all cells exposed to the 2-step endotoxin challenge compared with non-tolerized cells. The most consistent results were achieved when cells were exposed to 1.0 ng/ml of endotoxin initially and then challenged with 10 ng/ml of endotoxin. The TNFa production was reduced by greater than 85% in all cells exposed to this protocol compared with non-tolerized control cells. For the second aim of this study ET was induced in equine cells by exposure to 1.0 ng/ml of endotoxin followed by challenge with 10 ng/ml of endotoxin. While not statistically signifi-cant, the relative mRNA expression of IL-10 in tolerized cells was increased twofold when compared to non-tolerized control cells. The relative mRNA expression of IL-12 in tolerized cells was decreased significantly by fourteen-fold at 6 hours and five-fold at 12 hours after the second endotoxin challenge compared with non-tolerized control cells at the same time points. This experiment demonstrated a reliable method for the ex vivo induction of ET in equine lymphocytes. A marked suppression of IL-12 production is associated with ET. The production of IL-10 does not appear to be related with the development of ET. The equid hemoprotozoan parasite Babesia equi is endemic in most nations worldwide. Infected horses cause significant economic loss due to treatment, fatalities and restriction on trade with nonendemic nations. To date, no drug has been shown to completely eliminate infection and infected horses create a risk of transmission. Ponazuril, a metabolite of toltrazuril, has been used as an anti-protozoal agent to successfully treat equine Sarcosystis neurona and other domestic animal protozoa such as Toxoplasma gondii. In an attempt to establish the in vitro activity of this drug against B. equi, tissue cultures containing the Florida strain of B. equi were established. Ponazuril was diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then added to the culture media to create 1% DMSO solutions with varying concentrations of ponazuril. Prior to treatment, all cultures were evaluated by light microscopy, combined and redistributed to yield separate culture wells with similar percent parasitemias. Treated media was created at 100 mg/mL, 250 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, 750 mg/mL, and 1000 mg/mL concentrations. Control culture wells were also maintained with media containing only 1% DMSO. The treated media was substituted for the normal media during maintenance of the cultures once daily for 5 days. The cultures were treated in triplicate at each drug concentration. After the 5 day treatment period, routine maintenance of the cultures resumed. The cultures were evaluated via light microscopy of giemsa stained slides for percent parasitemia daily for the 5 treatment days and then daily for 30 days after discontinuation of the drug. Slides were prepared and labeled as to prevent evaluator bias. The control cultures continued to grow as expected. Degree of parasite inhibition was variable between drug concentrations. The 100 mg/mL inhibited parasite growth during the treatment period but the parasite was never completely eliminated. The 250 mg/mL, 500 mg/mL, 750 mg/mL, and 1000 mg/mL did completely eliminate detectable parasitemia during the treatment period. However, the 250 mg/mL culture growth recrudesced at 7 days post treatment in all cultures. No recrudescence of growth was noted in the 500 mg/mL or 750 mg/mL cultures during the 30 day period following treatment. The 1000 mg/mL percent parasitemia results were inconsistent. One of the 3 wells exhibited recrudescence of the parasite at 27 days after the cessation of treatment. This inconsistency was potentially related to the difficulty encountered with complete dissolution of this high concentration of drug within the culture media. However, the development of parasite resistance to the drug cannot be ruled out. Results indicate that ponazuril inhibited B. equi in cell culture with a minimum concentration of 500 mg/mL. Future research to evaluate this drug in vivo is warranted. Bartonella are emerging, potentially zoonotic pathogens, found in several wild and domestic animals, causing various clinical syndromes. Bartonella was not detected in horses until recently when serological and blood culture data suggested that horses could be naturally infected with Bartonella sp. This study aimed to induce clinical signs, bacteremia and seroconversion in horses following experimental infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella bovis. Twelve healthy adult horses were divided into two groups of six. In Group One, an equine isolate of B. henselae was inoculated intradermally into four naı¨ve horses, and a saline control was inoculated into two sentinel horses. In Group Two, this procedure was followed using B. bovis. Horses were examined daily for sixty days, and blood was collected regularly over 5 months for CBC, culture, PCR, and serology. Beyond injection site abscess in two B. henselae-inoculated horses, Bartonella-associated clinical signs did not occur. One B. henselae-inoculated horse became blood culture and PCR positive. Three and one infected horse seroconverted to B. henselae and B. bovis, respectively. All sentinels remained PCR, culture, and serology negative. In conclusion, experimental inoculation of B. henselae and B. bovis in horses did not induce clinical signs beyond injection site abscessation. The detection of Bartonella sp. in blood supports bacteremia and seroconversion. To be determined is if seroconversion was due to local replication of organisms or humoral immune response to inoculums. Additional research is warranted in healthy horses and in those displaying signs consistent with Bartonella infection to correlate positive tests with clinical signs. Both Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum have been associated with clinical disease in horses, and the frequency with which horses are exposed to these organisms is relevant information to regional veterinarians and horse owners. However, the seroprevalence of these agents in horses residing in the state of Oklahoma is currently unknown. Serum samples from 120 horses in Oklahoma were randomly obtained from the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Serologic testing was performed using IDEXX Laboratories Canine SNAP Ã 4Dx Ã which detects antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis. All horses were negative for A. phagocytophilum. One horse tested positive for B. burgdorferi exposure, and 12 horses (10 percent) had antibodies reactive to E. canis. These findings indicate exposure of horses to A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi is uncommon in Oklahoma. The relatively large percentage of horses with antibodies reactive to E. canis was unexpected. It is likely that these positive test results indicate crossreactivity of the E. canis assay with E. chaffeensis or another Ehrlichia species; however, seroconversion of horses to these organisms has not previously been reported. Due to the significant exposure of horses in Oklahoma to a presently unidentified Ehrlichia species, further investigation with polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing is indicated to identify the organism(s) responsible. To determine the prevalence of Salmonella spp. shedding in healthy foals, crias and their dams in the New York State (NYS) area. A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and August 2009. Single fecal samples were collected from mare-foal and cria-dam pairs on breeding farms in the NYS area. Salmonella cultures were performed within 24-h using standard enrichment techniques. For the apparent prevalence, the 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as the exact binomial. A total of 349 samples were collected from 14 broodmare farms. The median number of animals per farm was 133 (range 32-523), with a median of 20 (range 10-76) animals sampled per property. Median age of the foals was 18 days (range 4-67) and mares was 10 years (range 4-31). Salmonella spp were not detected. The apparent prevalence was 0% (95% CI 0-1.1). A total of 221 samples were collected from 14 alpaca breeding farms. The median number of animals per farm was 75 (range 45-330) with a median of 16 (range 10-18) animals sampled per property. Median age of the crias was 36 days (range 2-111), and dams was 5 years (range 2.5-19). Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was isolated from a healthy 16 d cria. The estimated prevalence for crias was 1% (95% CI 0.02-5.0) and dams was 0% (95% CI 0-3.3). The prevalence of Salmonella spp. in healthy foals, crias and their dams in the NYS area appears low, although serial fecal sampling may increase the likelihood of detection leading to a higher prevalence. Infection of horses with Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and Equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) may cause a range of clinical diseases, including febrile respiratory disease, and typically results in establishment of latent infection. During periods of stress, such as transportation, re-housing, and hospitalization, latent virus can become reactivated, resulting in shedding of virus in respiratory tract secretions. Such reactivated virus may subsequently spread to susceptible in-contact animals. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of shedding of EHV-1 and EHV-4 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in nasal swab samples collected from horses that developed a rectal temperature of ! 101.31F (38.51C) while hospitalized in a referral hospital. We hypothesized that fevers are a result of EHV-1 or EHV-4 replication in the respiratory tract following either recrudescence of virus from latency or following horizontal virus transmission prior to or during admission into the hospital. Over a nine-month period, nasal swab specimens of the ventral nasal meatus were collected from 56 febrile, hospitalized horses. The swabs were obtained within 12 hours of detection of a fever. Over the same time period and at least once a month, nasal swab samples were collected from 10 randomly chosen but afebrile horses within the hospital. After collection, swabs were immersed in virus trans-port medium and frozen at À201C. For analysis, the samples were thawed, and routine DNA extraction was performed using a commercially available kit. A validated, qPCR assay was used to detect and quantify genomic DNA of EHV-1 and EHV-4. Genomic DNA of EHV-4 was detected in the nasal swab specimen of one of 56 febrile horses (1.8%). EHV-1 DNA was not detected in any of the febrile horses. All samples collected from the afebrile horses were negative for both viruses. Considering the known high seroprevalence of EHV-1 and EHV-4 in the horse population, we anticipated finding a higher percentage of PCR positive nasal swab samples collected from febrile patients. Fevers detected were likely a result of the active disease processes for which the horses were hospitalized. It is also possible that inappropriate timing of sample collection relative to the onset of fever may have resulted in a low diagnostic sensitivity. Further studies are warranted to examine the frequency of Equine herpesvirus reactivation in horses in response to stressful conditions such as hospitalization. Equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis is an emerging disease with yet unaddressed preventative measures. We hypothesized that the intra-rectally administered avirulent live vaccine of Lawsonia intracellularis would prevent disease. Another question of interest was whether naturally infected foals would display lower total solid concentrations and lower average daily weight gains, as potentials markers of subclinical disease, when compared to vaccinated herd mates. A total of 202 healthy weanling Thoroughbred foals were randomly assigned into two groups (vaccinated and non-vaccinated). Vaccinated foals received 30 mls of avirulent, live Lawsonia intracellularis vaccine intra-rectally twice, 30 days apart. Foals were monitored daily for clinical signs of EPE until yearling age, blood was collected monthly to determine concentration of total solids by refractometry and L. intracellularis specific antibodies by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Monthly weight measurements were performed and average daily weight gains were calculated on 116 horses. There was no significant difference (P 4 0.05) in the occurrence of the disease between the vaccinated (1 case) and the non-vaccinated group (3 cases). Eighty-two percent of vaccinated horses seroconverted following vaccine administration and 59% of nonvaccinated horses seroconverted to natural infection. Vaccinated foals maintained a significantly higher total solids concentrations (two-way repeated measures ANOVA; P 5 0.023) throughout the study period when compared to naturally infected foals. No difference in average daily weight gain was found. The small number of clinical cases precludes interpretation of vaccine efficacy. Vaccination may prevent subclinical disease, which is often characterized by lower concentration of total solids and decreased weight gain. Low clearance of exogenously administered lactate is predictive of non-survival in severely ill normo-or mildly hyperlactatemic human patients independent of other known risks. Hyperlactatemia, persistent hyperlactatemia and low change in lactate over time are predictive, albeit imperfectly, of non-survival in sick foals and horses. Development of an equine specific exogenous lactate clearance test should allow for both improved prognostic ability and exploration of causes of lactate dysmetabolism in horses. 500 mL of a solution containing 1 mmol/kg body weight Na-lactate in 0.9% saline was infused intravenously to 6 healthy horses over 15 min.Venous blood was collected in sodium citrate for lactate concentration [LAC] determination using the YSI Lactate Analyzer at 5, 10 and 15 min during infusion, at each minute for 15 min postinfusion and at 30, 45, 60 and 120 min following the start of infusion. [LAC] increased 4 4-fold from baseline at the end of infusion (P 5 0.005). A two compartmental model was used to specify the pharmacokinetic parameters of exogenous [LAC] including terminal elimination half-life (62.1 AE 19.9 min), central volume of distribution (279.3 AE 61.2 L), steady state volume of distribution (396.6 AE 110.2 L) and systemic clearance (4.49 AE 1.29 L min À1 ). [LAC] remained $60% above baseline (P 5 0.008) at 60 min but was returned to baseline at 120 min. Clearance of exogenous lactate appears slower in healthy horses when compared to published values for normo-or mildly hyperlactemic sick humans. Return to baseline is also delayed by comparison, underscoring the need for species specific test development. Blood lactate is a marker of tissue perfusion and inflammation in critically ill patients. In humans, lactate clearance has largely replaced single measurements in predicting mortality due to improved accuracy. The association between lactate clearance and outcome in acute colitis warrants further investigation. This retrospective study aimed to determine the prognostic value of lactate clearance in horses with acute colitis. Medical records for horses with colitis between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. Early (admission to 4-8 h post) and late (admission to 24 h) lactate clearances were calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of different lactate clearance cutoffs were calculated. Two way ANOVA was used to evaluate differences in lactate between survivors and nonsurvivors and horses with and without systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Mortality was compared between lactate clearers and nonclearers using Fisher's exact test and odds ratios. 96 cases were included. An early lactate clearance of ! 40% and a late clearance of ! 50% had the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. When these cutoffs were used, early and late lactate clearance were significantly associated with outcome (P 5 0.02, OR: 3.35 [1.27-8.80] and P 5 0.02, OR: 3.62 [1.26-10.41], respectively). Horses with SIRS had higher lactate concentrations over the first 24 h as compared to those without, however there were no significant differences in lactate concentrations between survivors and nonsurvivors. The association between lactate clearance and survival, and lactate concentrations over time with SIRS, suggest an importance in early identification and treatment of hyperlactatemia in colitis cases. Equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) resulting from equine herpes virus (EHV) infection continues to be associated with high mortality in the horse. Therefore, appropriate prophylaxis and treatment is important to the equine industry. Previous pharmacologic research has focused on acyclovir and its prodrug, valacyclovir. However, the higher potency of ganciclovir makes it an attractive candidate for use in horses already infected with EHV. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of ganciclovir after intravenous administration of 2.5 mg/kg of injectable ganciclovir as a slow bolus to five horses. Plasma ganciclovir concentrations were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography and preliminary noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. Ganciclovir pharmacokinetic characteristics were similar to those of intravenous acyclovir, with a volume of distribution at steady state of 9.2 AE 2.5 L/kg and clearance of 4.0 AE 1.2 mL min À1 kg À1 . The pronounced multi-compartmental decay and extended elimination half-life of 24-58 hr also resembled those of acyclovir, and are expected to similarly produce accumulation of ganciclovir at steady state. Although up to one week of dosing may be required for steady state conditions to occur, a rapid onset of action would be required during an EHM outbreak. Nonparametric superposition predicted that a loading regimen of 2.5 mg/kg of intravenous ganciclovir every 8 hours for the first day, followed by 2.5 mg/kg every 12 hours, would maintain trough ganciclovir concentrations above the targeted IC 50 of 0.1-0.4 mg/mL, within the first day of beginning therapy. Further studies are needed to examine the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of ganciclovir in horses. Equine motor neuron disease (EMND) resulting from prolonged vitamin (vit.) E deficiency has a poor prognosis. Diagnostic criteria include vit. E o 2 mg/dl and neurogenic atrophy in the sacrocaudalis muscle. We hypothesized that an early stage of reversible myogenic atrophy may exist in horses with low serum vit. E prior to occult EMND. The first objective of this study was to retrospectively characterize clinical cases and muscle pathology of horses that had myofiber atrophy in the sacrocaudalis muscle. The second objective was to prospectively describe the clinical attributes and muscle pathology of 10 horses that presented to the UMN Equine Center with moderate weakness, muscle atrophy and low vit. E that successfully responded to treatment. Objective 1: From records of the Neuromuscular Diagnostic Laboratory 36 horses were identified that had sacrocaudalis muscle fiber atrophy. Horses were of varying breeds, with 14 mares, 18 geldings and 4 stallions and a mean age of 12.5 yrs (range 1-30 yrs). Weight loss (13/3), muscle atrophy (15/36), weakness (17/36) and fasciculations (19/36) were reported. A clear diagnosis of EMND was made based on numerous angular atrophied fibers in 20 horses and 16 horses had a pattern of myofiber atrophy more typical of myogenic atrophy. Where measured, vit. E was below 2.5 mg/dl. Resectioning and re-evaluation of frozen sections of sacrocaudalis muscle from 9 horses with low vit. E revealed anguloid atrophy (9/ 9), angular atrophy (4/9) and moth eaten fibers in NADH stains indicative of oxidative stress (5/9). Thus, in 54% of cases with myogenic atrophy, moth eaten fibers could potentially have been early indicators of oxidative stress and EMND. Objective 2: Horses of varying breeds, 6 geldings and 4 mares; mean age of 10.6 yrs (range 2 -20 yrs) that were diagnosed with muscle weakness at the University of Minnesota Equine Center and had vit. E levels between 0.2-1.94 mg/dl were included. Clinical signs were subtle with generalized weight loss/muscle wasting (10/10), weakness (10/10) or fasciculations (3/10). Serum CK activities were elevated with a maximum of 5,805 U/L in 3/7 horses. Biopsy of gluteus medius and sacrocaudalis muscles obtained in 6/10 horses showed lesions in sacrocaudalis samples that included anguloid atrophy (6/6), rare angular atrophied fibers (3/6), macrophages (1/6) and moth eaten fibers in NADH stains (6/6). There was no clear evidence of neurogenic atrophy, but myopathic changes were evident. Horses were treated with 4,000 IU-15,000 IU vit. E/day and vit. E levels were normal (2-4 mg/dL) in horses where assessed (4/4) after 4 weeks and all horses had improved muscle mass and strength after 2-6 months. Since muscle wasting and progressive weakness are insidious, clinical acumen, awareness of this early presentation of EMND and characterization of myofiber atrophy and moth eaten fibers in sacrocaudalis muscle biopsies are necessary to identify the disorder in its early stages and ameliorate clinical signs with vit. E therapy. Serum Hp is an acute phase protein that has been identified in cattle with a variety of inflammatory conditions. Serum from healthy cattle contains very little haptoglobin. Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP 9) is a proteolytic enzyme released from neutrophil granules and other cellular sources including macrophages and has been reported to increase in the sera of sick animals. An Hp-MMP 9 protein complex was identified in neutrophil granules and the serum of cattle with acute bacterial sepsis (Bannikov, et al. 2007) . The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of an Hp-MMP 9 complex ELISA in comparison to Hp or MMP 9 alone in the diagnosis of acute septic inflammation in cattle. A total of 35 animals were sampled. Twenty two (22) were admitted to The Ohio State University VTH for evaluation of a variety of disorders and the remainder (13) were from OSU's Waterman Dairy. Animals were either bled for routine clinicopathologic work-up or as part of a herd infectious disease survey. Serum was harvested in routine fashion by centrifugation after clotting and frozen at À20C until analyzed. Animal age (3.5 AE 1.7 yr; range 0.4-8 yr), breed and sex (M 5 3, F 5 32) were recorded. Study animals were placed into 3 categories: 1) acute septic (12), 2) chronic disease (13), and 3) normal animals (10) based upon history, clinical examination, and the results of clinicopathologic evaluation as well as pathologic evaluation in those animals that died or were euthanized. Serum Hp was determined by commercial ELISA kits. Serum MMP 9 was determined using a monoclonal antibody (clone 10.1; MAb) to bovine MMP 9. Serum Hp-MMP 9 complexes were determined by ELISA using MAb 10.1 as a capture antibody and an HRP conjugated rabbit anti-bovine Hp antibody. Concentrations of analytes were arranged categorically and analyzed using Kruskil-Wallace One-way ANOVA on ranks. Serum Hp concentrations in all study animals ranged from 0-945 ug/mL; MMP 9 ranged from 0.1-9.4 ug/mL; serum Hp-MMP 9 complexes range from 0-2.9 ug/mL. When grouped according to disease, serum Hp was higher in acute septic conditions (495 AE 268 ug/mL) compared to chronic (221 AE 198 ug/mL) and normal animals (4 AE 8.5 ug/mL); however, there was no statistical difference between acute and chronic animals. Serum MMP 9 concentrations were similar in acute (2.6 AE 2.4 ug/mL) and chronic disease (2.7 AE 1.5 ug/mL) and were significantly lower in normal animals (0.67 AE 0.9 ug/mL). Serum Hp-MMP 9 concentrations were significantly elevated in animals with acute septic conditions (1.4 AE 0.6 ug/mL) compared to animals with chronic disease (0.13 AE 0.23 ug/mL) and absent in normal animals (none detected). Serum Hp-MMP 9 concentrations were elevated in acute septic conditions; however, individual components of this complex were not reliable in defining acute septic disease in these study animals. The epidemiology of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), including its modes of transmission and maintenance has been well described. However, few studies have examined insects as indirect vectors of BVDV. The horn fly (Haematobia irritans) is the most prevalent insect affecting cattle in the southern US and this study sought to evaluate the potential for BVDV transmission by horn flies. Horn flies were collected from four persistently infected (PI) cattle and distributed into fly cage cylinders, with 25 flies per cage. An additional aliquot of 50 flies per PI animal was tested for BVDV by RT-PCR. Four principal and four control BVDV naı¨ve calves were housed in individual isolations rooms. Two cages were attached to each animal. While cages on principal calves allowed flies to feed, a plastic barrier prevented feeding from control calves. After 48 hours, the cages were removed and fly homogenates from each calf were tested for BVDV by RT-PCR. Blood samples were collected from each calf on days 0, 3, 6-10, 14, 21, and 28 and tested by virus isolation and virus neutralization. Fly homogenates from three of four PI cattle were positive for BVDV by RT-PCR. Of the fly homogenates removed after 48 hours, three were positive from principal calves and four from control calves. Virus isolation and serology remained negative throughout the study. These results indicate that BVDV may be detected in horn flies that are feeding on PI animals, but they do not appear to be an important vector for BVDV. Previously Antemortem diagnosis of aberrant migration by Parelaphostrongylus tenuis (P. tenuis) has not been documented in cattle. This report describes an outbreak in limousin calves. Calves from 2 beef farms presented for evaluation of progressive neurological signs. Neurological exams and lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection was performed. The 2 worst affected calves were euthanized and necropsied. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on spinal cord. The farms were 12 miles apart and had wetter pastures than normal. Large numbers of snails and slugs were observed around common feeding areas. A total of 5/29 calves between 3-5 month old were affected, with 2 heifers, 2 steers and 1 bull. Clinical signs were consistent with upper and lower motor neuron spinal cord disease and were present for 4 1 m in 3 animals, with the remainder affected for o 10 d. CSF analysis revealed marked pleocytosis (mean 369 WBC/uL, range 113-1026 WBC/uL) and elevated protein (mean 81 mg/dL, range 66-101 mg/dL). Acute cases showed severe eosinophilic pleocytosis, chronic cases had a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Histopathology revealed lymphoplasmacytic and eosinophilic meningiomyelitis, with intramedullary lymphoid nodules containing nematodes. Histopathologic characteristics and PCR results, showing a faint band at 200 bp, were suggestive of P. tenuis. Surviving calves showed rapid improvement following treatment with anthelmentics and anti-inflammatories. This case series identifies P. tenuis as a cause of weakness and ataxia in beef calves and highlights the need for vigilance against aberrant parasite migration in calves grazing wet, snail infested pastures. Duration of disease may affect CSF cytology and response to therapy. Primigravid dairy heifers are a source of entry for mastitis pathogens into the lactating herd. The average prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) in heifers at calving ranges between 30-40%, with coagulase negative staphylococci as the predominant bacterial cause, followed by S. aureus or streptococci. Currently, there is no universally recommended procedure to predict IMIs in heifers at calving. Many producers are unwilling to collect prepartum secretions for fear of predisposing the mammary gland to an IMI. Some producers prophylactically treat all prepartum heifers to control IMI at calving. This study was designed to evaluate the util-ity of pre-partum samples (pre-partum mammary secretions and teat skin swabs) for predicting IMI in heifers at calving and to evaluate whether this sampling increases the likelihood of IMI postcalving. Pre-partum samples were collected 2 weeks prior to expected calving date and quarter milk samples were collected once weekly for the 1 st 3-weeks post-calving for bacterial culture. Heifers were systematically assigned to 1 of 3 study groups (n 5 392 quarters each) as follows: 1) pre-partum secretions from all mammary quarters, 2) pre-partum secretions from two diagonal quarters, and 3) no pre-partum secretions collected. Skin swab samples were collected from all heifers. Bacteriology was performed according to NMC guidelines and isolates were categorized as coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS), coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS), streptococci, Gram-negatives, mixed infections (2 types) or contaminated samples (! 3 types). Using phenotypic characterization of bacterial isolates the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) and accuracy were calculated to define the utility of pre-partum parameters for predicting IMI at calving. Mammary quarters sampled during the pre-partum period were compared with non-sampled quarters to determine if sampled quarters had a higher occurrence of post-calving IMI (Chisquare; P o 0.05). Data from 262 mammary quarters were used to calculate Se, Sp, PPV, NPV and accuracy of pre-partum secretions for predicting an IMI at calving. The results were 0.81, 0.67, 0.36, 0.94, and 0.70, respectively. No CPS were isolated from teat skin, 92% (102/112) of mammary quarters that had a CNS on teat skin did not have a CNS IMI at calving, 3% (3/112) had an IMI, and 5% (6/112) were infected with a different bacterial pathogen. A greater proportion of mammary quarters (26%; 103/396) that were not sampled pre-partum had IMIs at calving than quarters that were sampled (19%; 61/327) (P 5 0.024). Based on the calculated Se (0.81), pre-partum secretion culture is marginally useful for predicting IMIs in heifers at calving. However, given that 52% of quarters were culture negative prepartum and only 6% of these culture negative quarters acquired new infections after calving, prepartum sampling would be useful to producers for preferentially treating mammary quarters prepartum. Prepartum sampling did not increase the likelihood of IMI at calving. Otitis media appears to be a common disease of young calves however the true prevalence is unknown. Diagnosis is based upon clinical signs and radiography, which often can be difficult to interpret. The purpose of this study was to compare radiography and computed tomography in the diagnosis of otitis media in calves. Seventeen Holstein calves between 5 to 7 weeks of age were included. All calves following neurological examination were sedated with intravenous xylazine (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) for routine radiographs (3 views) and computed tomography of the tympanic bullae followed by necropsy. Based upon necropsy findings, 11 of 17 calves were affected with otitis media, 4 unilaterally and 7 bilaterally. Radiographic and computed tomographic changes associated with otitis media included increased soft tissue opacity within the bulla, thickening of the bulla wall, enlarged bulla, and osteolysis of the bulla wall and trabeculations. The most reliable radiographic change was lysis of the trabeculations within the tympanic bulla which was present in 92.3% of affected bullae. However, 50% of normal bullae were considered affected based upon radiography. On computed tomography images, increased soft tissue opacity within the bulla was present in all affected calves. Sensitivity of radiography and computed tomography was 72.2% and 94.4% and specificity was 50% and 100% respectively. The kappa value for agreement between the two imaging modalities was 0.29 indicating slight agreement. Results indicate that computed tomography is more specific and sensitive, faster to perform and easier to interpret than radiography in the diagnosis of otitis media in the calf. The purpose of this study was to use computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to provide descriptions of anatomic brain structures in normal calves. Four normal Holstein calves, 23-28 days old, were included in the study. Calves had normal physical and neurological examinations, hematology, and biochemistry profiles. CT and MRI of the brain were performed after induction of general anesthesia. For MRI, pre-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2-FLAIR, and T2 Ãweighted, and post-contrast T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR sequences were acquired. Following completion of imaging, cerebrospinal fluid was collected from the cerebellomedullary cistern and submitted for cytology and culture. All calves had cerebrospinal fluid within normal limits. Two calves were humanely euthanized while anesthetized, preserved, and the heads sectioned. The remaining two calves were recovered from anesthesia. Transverse sections were photographed and compared to the CT and MRI brain images. Results conclude that the CT and MRI images correspond to normal gross anatomic structures. Computed tomographic images provide adequate evaluation of the ventricular system and excellent anatomic detail of bony structures, while MRI images provided greater parenchymal soft tissue anatomic detail of the brain when compared to CT. It is concluded that CT and MRI are useful in the evaluation of the brain and surrounding structures when compared to conventional radiography and could be useful in the evaluation of intracranial disease in calves. Mammary infections caused by Escherichia coli are generally considered to be of short duration and non contagious. However, in some cases, persistent infections seem to occur. Hence, it is important to characterize E. coli isolates from both single and recurrent excreting cows to elucidate bacterial differences which may be associated with clinical outcomes. The objectives of the present study were to confirm persistent infection of the udder in cows recurrently excreting E. coli from the same quarter, to identify possible spread of the organism between quarters and to examine antimicrobial resistance in these isolates. Antimicrobial resistance was also examined in isolates from transitory cases of clinical mastitis to compare results with persistent or contagious isolates. E. coli isolates studied are part of a collection provided by the Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network (CBMRN). Milk samples were collected over a two year period, from the winter of 2007 to the summer of 2008. The National Cohort of Dairy Farms, part of the CBMRN, consisted of 91 herds in the first year and 75 in the second year. Cows of interest (n 5 300) were selected and among these cows infected with E. coli, 22 cows repeatedly excreted the organism twice or three times from the same quarter. The first isolation was always associated with clinical mastitis. In addition, 16 cows were chosen because E. coli was isolated twice, but in different quarters. Persistent infection was confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Susceptibility to ampicillin, cephalothin, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMS) was tested by broth microdilution. Of the 22 cows recurrently excreting E. coli from the same quarter, 18 were persistently infected with the same pulsotype. Proportion of persistently infected cows is 6% for this two year study. In two cows infected twice, but in different quarters, both isolates possessed the same pulsotype, suggesting contagion between quarters. Each persistently infected cow was matched with a singly infected cow for antimicrobial resistance comparison. In persistent strains the highest frequency of resistance was to ampicillin and tetracycline (both at 28%). In isolates from single cases, the highest frequency of resistance was to tetracycline (33%). None of the isolates were resistant to enrofloxacin. Excluding tetracycline, antimicrobial resistance was always higher, but not significant (p > 0.1), in persistent isolates: ampicillin (28% and 6%) cephalothin (22% and 0%), ceftiofur (11% and 0%), spectinomycin (6% and 0%) and TMS (11% and 6%). Isolates (4) associated with possible contagion did not show antimicrobial resistance. In conclusion, most cows (82%) repeatedly excreting E. coli from the same quarter were persistently infected. However, a low potential of spread between quarters was detected (13%). Overall, antimicrobial resistance was low. The sheep flock (394 F, 49 M; composed by Texel, Ile de France and crossbreeds) of the University of Namur was thoroughly followed on a daily basis and clinical signs at detection of BTV-8 were recorded for each animal. An overall clinical score was calculated by summing up the scores for each relevant clinical sign (1 point/clinical score). Affected subjects were either treated with antibiotics alone (AB, longacting tetracycline) or with antibiotics combined with steroidian (SAI, dexamethasone) or non-steroidian anti-inflammatory (NSAI, flunixin meglumine) drugs. The duration of treatment was estimated by the mean number of administrations per drug per treated animal. Among 443 sheep, 203 (46%) were clinically affected by BTV-8 in summer 2007 (start week 29, end week 47; maximum of new clinical cases at week 31). The most frequent clinical signs were apathy (46%), salivation (45%), weight loss (31%), head edema (30%), followed by nasal discharge (16%), muzzle and lip lesions (12%), lameness (6%), submandibular edema (5%) and pulmonary signs (4%). Cyanosis of the tongue (''bluetongue'') was observed in one ram only. Clinical scores were distributed as follows: score 1: 49%; score 2: 29%; score 3: 13%; score 4: 1%; score 5: 6%, score ! 6: 2%. Sheep younger than 3 years were more frequently and more severely affected than sheep older than 3 years (P o 0.001). Texel sheep (58%) and crossbreeds (44%) were more often affected than Ile de France (22%). The most severe clinical scores were recorded in crossbreeds (score 1: 42%; score 2: 25%; score ! 3: 33%) and Texel sheep (score 1: 46%; score 2: 31%; score ! 3: 23%), whereas Ile de France sheep were less severely affected (score 1: 65%; score 2: 19%; score ! 3: 16%). Finally, the most severe clinical scores were associated with longer duration of treatment with any of the administered drugs: [AB] score 1: 1.52, score 2: 1.84, score 3: 2.04; [NAIS] score 1: 1.41, score 2: 1.63, score 3: 1.65; [AIS] score 1: 1.11, score 2: 1.11, score 3: 1.00. These field data recorded in a sheep flock after natural BTV-8 infection provide interesting information regarding incidence of the disease as well as type, frequency and severity of BTV-related clinical signs. These results also point out differences among breeds, Ile de France sheep being the less frequently and severely affected ones. Conversely, sheep younger than 3 years are more sensitive than others. Longer duration of treatment is needed in severely affected animals. Together, these findings might be helpful for early diagnosis and management of BTV-8 in sheep flocks. Research groups from many countries have recently identified methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a common colonizing agent in pigs, and that people with frequent contact (eg. veterinarians and producers) have increased risks for colonization and infection. MRSA has also been identified as one of the most common causes of outbreaks of nosocomial infections in veterinary hospitals. The Colorado State University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (CSU-CVMBS) utilizes commercial pigs in veterinary student training. These pigs are a potential source of environmental contamination as well as nosocomial and zoonotic infections. The objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of MRSA colonization in young pigs used in teaching laboratories at the CSU-CVMBS and to evaluate associated environmental contamination. Environmental samples were collected twice weekly from walls and hand contact surfaces of the holding facility (n 5 28) and twice daily from floors and hand contact surfaces in the teaching laboratory (n 5 140) using a commercially available electrostatic dust collection wipe (Swiffer, Procter and Gamble). Additionally, swabs were collected twice from each pig (n 5 100) including nasal, perineal, and rectal samples. All samples were cultured for the presence of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus spp by a previously reported method. Overall, the frequency of MRSA colonization in young pigs at the holding facility and teaching laboratory was 65.6% and 80%, respectively. The pigs arrived in two different groups (n 5 50) one month apart. The frequency of colonization was markedly different between pig groups. There was environmental contamination as well as evidence of residual contamination between cleaning. This study demonstrates a previously unrecognized risk associated with the use of young pigs in training and research in both veterinary and human medicine. Colonization of these pigs does not preclude their use rather it demonstrates the importance of biosecurity and hand hygiene measures to control the associated risks. Calves are considered more susceptible to MAP infection than adult cows. It is generally accepted that the young heifer group should be targeted to reduce the transmission of MAP in infected herds. Scientific evidence indicates that both colostrum and milk may contain MAP organism. The objective of this study was to systematically review the scientific literature concerning risk factors associated with MAP transmission to calves. Relevant literature to the following questions was studied: 1) Does feeding pasteurized colostrum or milk replacer reduce the risk of transmission of MAP? 2) Does raising calves individually and separate from the adult reduce the risk of transmission of MAP? 3) Is there a relationship between the characteristics of the immediate neonatal calves' environment and risk of infection with MAP? An electronic search of PubMed and CAB was conducted in September 2009. A first selection was based on the title of the manuscript. Papers published in non-peer-reviewed journals or not relevant to any of the three questions were eliminated. The abstracts of the remaining papers were read and retained if they appeared pertinent to any of the three questions. The remaining articles were reviewed by 3 authors and then assessed for pertinence.. The PubMed search yielded 399 references. Thirty-four were not in English, French or Spanish. Of the 365 papers remaining, 246 were discarded based on the title. Sixty-nine were eliminated after the abstract was read. The same selection was performed for CAB and yielded 7 additional articles. Fifty manuscripts were reviewed, of which 21 were considered relevant to the objective. The year of publication varied from 1992 to 2009 and originated from 10 different countries. The majority of the study designs was cross-sectional (n 5 15). The number of farms in each study varied from 1 to 2,953. The definition of a positive herd was variable, but most often based on an ELISA results (n 5 15). Thirteen papers addressed the question 1. Six concluded that feeding raw milk and/or colostrum represents a risk of transmission. Seventeen manuscripts addressed question 2. Nine of these concluded that raising calves individually and/or away from adult feces was protective. Finally, sixteen manuscripts pertained to question 3. Ten found that a better hygiene in the immediate environment of the calf was protective. The results of the systematic review will be used to refine a questionnaire to estimate the risk of transmission in the neonatal period. Breeding soundness evaluation of rams allows the veterinarian to assess the capacity of a ram to impregnate a defined number of ewes through natural service. The influence of ram fertility on pregnancy rate, lamb crop, and certain ranch economic indices is well established. Guidelines set by the Society for Theriogenology (SFT) are frequently applied to classify tested rams as satisfactory, questionable, or unsatisfactory potential breeders. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the reasons for unsatisfactory or questionable SFT classification in breeding soundness examination for 12,716 rams from over 100 flocks in CO, WY, and UT that were examined from 2000-2007. Breeding soundness examinations consisted of a cursory physical examination, body condition score, palpation of the scrotal contents, scrotal circumference measurement, manual exteriorization of the penis, collection of semen by electroejaculation, microscopic evaluation of sperm motility and morphology, and, for selected rams, serologic testing for infection with Brucella ovis by ELISA. Rams determined to be seropositive for B. ovis were classified as unsatisfactory potential breeders. Approximately 1 in 4 rams tested were classified as unsatisfactory or questionable potential breeders. The most common reasons for rams to be classified as such included (in decreasing order of frequency) abnormal sperm morphology, poor sperm motility, leukospermia, thin body condition, ulcerative posthitis, small scrotal circumference, abnormal palpation findings for one or both epididymides or testes, and seropositive status on B. ovis ELISA. Of all rams seropositive for B. ovis, nearly 50% had leukospermia and only 5% had palpable abnormalities of the epididymes or testes; importantly, nearly 30% of seropositive rams were otherwise normal on breeding soundness examination. Taking the temperature has been an essential part of routine physical examination for over 100 years. Recently, some veterinarians have switched from the use of mercury (Cornell) thermometers to digital thermometers designed for use in people to measure rectal temperature. This abstract reports some of the common errors with digital thermometers designed for use in people and a method of obtaining reliable results. Fifteen crossbred cows were used for student measurement of rectal temperature on 53 separate occasions over a 3 month period. Student's initially measured rectal temperature using techniques gained from previous experience, then retook the temperature following instruction to immerse the thermometer in the rectum to the beginning of the display window. Rectal temperature was also measured with a Cornell mercury thermometer completely inserted in the rectum. Student initial rectal temperature measurements were 38.46 1/À 0.521C (mean 1/À 1 SD, n 5 53) which are approximately 0.51C lower, and more variable, than those obtained with Cornell mercury thermometers 38.95 1/À 0.381C. Values with dig-ital thermometers inserted to the display window were 38.77 1/À 0.411C, which are closer to the Cornell mercury thermometer method. Separately, the accuracy of student digital thermometers was compared against traceable (reference) digital and mercury thermometers in a water bath. In general, most digital thermometers designed for human use were accurate but one showed a large error, possibly because it had been poorly maintained. The affect of angle of insertion on rectal temperature measurement was determined to be of minor importance. Accurate temperature measurements can only be obtained using digital thermometers if the thermometer is inserted to the window. The thermometer's accuracy should be checked periodically. The objective of this project was to validate pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) integration and modelling approaches to dose schedule design, by generating and correlating data on the PK and PD of five drugs (oxytetracycline, amoxicillin, florfenicol, marbofloxacin and tulathromycin) commonly used to treat calf pneumonia. This abstract describes the results for florfenicol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for florfenicol were determined in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) and calf serum, using 5 overlapping sets of doubling dilutions of 6 clinical isolates of each of 2 organisms M.haemolytica and P.multocida. Time-kill relationships were established for florfenicol in broth and serum using multiples of MIC (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 times). Pharmacokinetic data and ex vivo bacterial kill curves were established for three biological fluids; serum, exudate and transudate using a tissue cage model of inflammation. The PK study used 10 healthy female Aberdeen Angus Holstein Friesian Cross calves aged 3-5 months, with florfenicol (Nuflor) administered subcutaneously as a single dose at 40 mg/kg. Mean MICs for M.haemolytica and P.multocida in MHB were 0.52 mg/ml and 0.39 mg/ml respectively and were not significantly different from those measured in serum (0.58 mg/ml and 0.48 mg/ml). In vitro time-kill studies in MHB indicated concentration dependent bactericidal activity of florfenicol with a 3-log reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml after 4 h incubation at 2 times MIC and a reduction to 33 cfu/ml following 8 h incubation at 4 times MIC. In the ex vivo study florfenicol exhibited bactericidal activity in serum, exudate and transudate with a 4-log reduction in cfu/ml after 4 h of incubation in samples collected at 12, 24 and 48 h post drug administration. Eradication occurred after 8 h incubation in these samples. Pharmacokinetic variables (mean AE SEM) were; C max 5 6.20 AE 1.56 mg/ml, T max 5 2.28 AE 0.13 h and AUC 24 5 133.8 AE 6.6. h. mg/ml. Surrogate markers of antimicrobial activity are presented in Table 1 . Targeted partial areas were used to express the ratio of average serum concentration relative to a targeted MIC for three consecutive 24 h periods after dose administration (Table) . The data indicates that, following a single subcutaneous dose, serum concentrations of florfenicol were above the MIC for both pathogens for greater than 72 h, and that at concentrations achieved under clinical conditions florfenicol exhibited bactericidal activity. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of tramadol (2 mg/kg) and its metabolite M1 after intravenous and intramuscular administration to llamas. Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that possesses opioid agonist features that has been used to treat moderate to severe pain in humans. Camelids are a rapidly growing aspect of small ruminant agriculture in the US. The popularity and numbers of llamas being kept as pets, packing animals, and show animals has increased in recent years. With the increased numbers of animals there is an increased demand for veterinary service; however, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for use in camelids and pharmaceutical companies cannot economically justify seeking approval of drugs in this species. Six healthy adult male llamas were used to determine the metabolism of tramadol. In a prior study we demonstrated that current methods of estimating ideal body weight for weight loss feeding are inaccurate in dogs having ! 45% body fat. The purpose of this study was to develop simple and accurate methods of measuring body composition in clinical practice in overweight to morbidly obese dogs. Current morphometric measurement methods do not adequately predict body composition in obese dogs. Additionally, these methods tend to be difficult to use and have poor accuracy. This study evaluated two methods of predicting lean body mass (LBM) from animal morphology, radiographic measurement of skeletal size and external physical measurement of body size. Thirty-six client-owned overweight or obese adult dogs (28% to 64% body fat) weighing 5 to 73.6 kg underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning to assess their body composition. Nine measurements were made from digital radiographs to assess skeletal size and 16 external physical measurements were made to assess body size. Body weight was also measured. Multiple regression analysis using DXA results as the dependent variable was used to develop regression equations for the prediction of LBM from the skeletal size and body size data. Several equations were developed that had high (4 0.9) correlation coefficients for both methods when the dogs were divided into 2 size groups ( 40 lbs and 4 40 lbs). The best equations were applied to the data from the same group of dogs to evaluate how well values for individuals were predicted (within AE 10% of the DXA value). The best equations using skeletal size data resulted in a r 2 5 0.99 and a predictability (AE 10%) ! 86% using 8 variables (including BW) for both size groups. The best equations using body size data resulted in a r 2 5 0.99 and a predictability (AE 10%) 5 100% using 8 variables (including BW and age) for both size groups. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that both methods could be used to predict LBM using a variety of regression equations. This approach shows great potential for the development of simple and accurate tools to be used in clinical practice. Further studies must be done to validate the equations in a population of dogs other than those used to develop the equations. With an estimated 35-40% of pet dogs being overweight or obese, veterinarians must accurately assess energy needs to prescribe appropriate food doses. Body condition scoring (BCS) is the most popular and accessible method for estimating degrees of obesity in dogs, but these scales were designed to assess animals with body fat percentages below about 45%. Many obese dogs have body fat percentages of 50% and greater. This project compared the accuracy of using body fat percentages to the 5 and 9 point BCS systems for estimating ideal body weight and resting energy requirements (RER) in overweight dogs. Thirty-six healthy, client-owned dogs ranging from 5 to 73.6 kg underwent dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning to assess their percentage of body fat (BF). BF percentage was then used to estimate ideal body weight, calculate RER, and classify each animal into the 5 and 9 point BCS system. Once a BCS was assigned, the median body fat percentage for each score was used to estimate ideal body weight and RER (5 point scale -4 5 30%, 5 5 40%; 9 point scale -6 5 30%, 7 5 35%, 8 5 40%, 9 5 45%). Based on DXA, body fat ranged from 28.3% to 63.7% with a mean of 45.9%. To assess the accuracy of BCS for moderately versus morbidly obese dogs, patients were divided into two groups: o 45% body fat (n 5 15) and 4 45% body fat (n 5 21). Compared to DXA, estimations of ideal body weight were significantly higher using the 5 (23.0 vs. 19.2 kg) and 9 (21.1 vs. 19.2 kg) point BCS in dogs with BF 4 45% (p o 0.001) but did not differ in dogs with o 45% BF (p 4 0.05). DXA estimations of RER were also significantly lower than estimations using the 5 (709 vs. 616 Kcal/day) and 9 (665 vs. 616 Kcal/day) point scales in dogs with BF 4 45% (p o 0.001), but did not differ in dogs with o 45% BF (p 4 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate current BCS systems provide good estimates of ideal body weight and RER in dogs with less than 45% BF, but are inadequate for calculating RER and ideal body weight in morbidly obese dogs (BF 4 45%). As a result, food dose calculations will be overestimated and this may affect weight loss efficacy. As canine obesity rates climb, we must develop new methods to assess our most obese patients and provide better weight management. Adiponectin, an adipokine that attenuates insulin resistance, decreases with obesity in humans and cats. In particular, the more biologically active HMW (high molecular weight) isoform decreases to a greater degree in human subjects than the less active LMW (low molecular weight) isoform. We determined plasma concentrations of total, LMW and HMW adiponectin in client-owned, lean and obese adult, neutered, domestic shorthaired cats. Following health screening by physical examination, urinalysis, hematology, coagulation and biochemical profiles, 73 cats (35 males and 38 females) were included in the study and informed consents were obtained. All cats were anaesthetized and body fat percentage (%BF) was measured using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Total adiponectin was determined using a commercial ELISA kit. LMW and HMW concentrations of adiponectin were determined by Western blotting after sucrose-gradient velocity centrifugation. Adiponectin multimer distribution (S A 5 HMW/(HMW 1 LMW)) was calculated and linear regression used to assess the relationship between %BF, total adiponectin and multimer distribution. Differences between lean/normal weight (%BF o 35, n 5 26) overweight (35 o %BF o 45, n 5 28) and obese cats (%BF 4 45, n 5 19) were evaluated by ANOVA. Results are given as mean AE SE. Total adiponectin was lower in male than female cats (2.29 AE 0.62 vs 4.16 AE 0.60 ug/mL, P o 0.04) while there was no correlation with body composition. Increasing %BF correlated negatively with multimer distribution (S A , obese, 0.55 AE 0.04; overweight 0.65 AE 0.03; and lean cats, 0.68 AE 0.03; P o 0.02). In this study, obesity was associated with lowered HMW adiponectin while total adiponectin was not significantly decreased. Changes in adiponectin distribution parallel results obtained in obese humans. The lack of difference in total adiponectin between lean and obese cats was surprising and differs from a previous report. The observed gender difference correlates with observations in healthy human subjects but may not only be attributable to testosterone and estrogen levels because all study cats were neutered. Obesity is a growing global problem in companion animals. Dietary fiber has been reported to possess physiological effects on satiety and hypolipidemia while carnitine acts to enhance fat utilization. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of dietary fiber and carnitine on 1.) short-term satiety and 2.) weight loss and lipid metabolism in obese Beagles. Two diets were fed differing in fiber and carnitine content: Purina ONE s healthy weight formula (LFC) vs. Purina ONE s plus a fiber and carnitine containing canned dietary supplement (HFC, Diet Delite s mixer for canine weight control). Total dietary fiber and carnitine contents of the foods fed were 3.5 g/100 kcal and 0.5 mg.100 kcal (LFC) vs 4.5 g/100 kcal and 38.9 mg/100 kcal (HFC) respectively. Two studies were conducted. For the shortterm satiety study, 14 female adult Beagles (body fat (BF) 37.5 AE 1.4% (SEM), body weight (BW) 13.4 AE 0.6 kg, were randomly assigned into 2 diet groups. Diets were fed at 8am and 3pm (7 h interval) or, during a second trail, at 8am and 11am (3 h interval) for 15 min each over a 2-3 day period. The amount of food offered was 1.2XMER at each feeding using a cross-over design with 3 day washout period. Blood samples were collected after the 8am feeding at 0, 45, and 120 min.Food intake and plasma Peptide YY (PYY) were measured as satiety markers. For the weight loss study, 7 obese Beagles were selected (BF 45.1 AE 1.6%, BW 15.2 AE 1.0 kg) and randomly assigned into 2 groups. The diets were fed once daily (ca. 60% of obese MER) for 42 days. Postprandial blood samples were collected at 60 min (days 1,28, and 42) for b-hydroxybutyrate analysis (a measure of fat oxidation) plus lipid, and lipoprotein analyses. Because the HFC diet contained high b-carotene due to its high pumpkin content, plasma retinoids were also measured. Food intake and BW were recorded daily and weekly, respectively. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed under a 5 0.05. Where there was significance, paired t-tests or one-wayAOV/Kruskal-Wallis tests with Tukey multiple comparisons were perfomed after checking normality by Shapiro-Wilks test. In the satiety studies, daily energy intake during the 7 h interval study was not different beween diets. However, the HFC diet significantly decreased daily and 2 nd feeding energy intake during the 3 h interval compared with the LFC diet (P o 0.05). Plasma PYY was not different between diets. In the weight loss study, all dogs lost BW; however, only the HFC diet significantly decreased both BW and BF at 42 days compared with day 1 (P o 0.02). Moreover, plasma postprandial b-hydoxybutyrate was signficiantly greater in the HFC than the LFC group at day 42. Plasma TG, total cholesterol (TC), lipoproteins (LPs), PYY, and retinoids did not change over time or with diet. In conclusion, the HFC diet provided satiety with lower energy (i.e. calorie) intake after a 3 h interval and increased b-oxidation thereby promoting more efficient weight and body fat loss without modifying TG, TC, LPs, and retinoid responses. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM on clinical and biological measures when fed to dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Thirty-one beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.5 AE 1.27 kg, age, 11.0 AE 2.23 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with DJD in at least one joint were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by canine j/d. Canine j/d contains increased levels of EPA and DHA, glucosamine, chondrotin sulfate, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Blood and urine samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on canine j/d. Serum fatty acids, cartilage biomarkers, urine biomarkers, and plasma metabolomics were measured. Orthopaedic exams were performed every 14 days during the study and collars with activity watches were worn throughout the study. Dogs fed canine j/d had significantly higher serum eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid at day 14. After consuming canine j/d, arthritic dogs had improved orthopaedic scores at day 14, and reduced night activity compared to while on the control food. They also had lower mean serum concentrations of bone specific alkaline phosphatase, BAP:NTx ratio, CS846:KS ratio, C-reactive protein, and C1,2C at day 14 on canine j/d. As well, serum CPII, CPII:C2C ratio, IGF-1, keratan sulfate, urine LTB4, and urine PGE2 were elevated after consuming canine j/d. Arthritic dogs fed Canine j/d had lower plasma IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL10, IL-15, IL-18, IFN-gamma, KC, and MCP-1. Metabolomic changes after consuming the canine j/d were consistent with decreased inflammation (kynurenine, histidine, 3-methyl-histidine, arachadonic acid). In summary, feeding dogs with arthritis Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM resulted in improved orthopaedic responses, reduced inflammation, and a reduction in cartilage and bone degradation biomarkers. Furthermore, the activity data may suggest improved comfort at night, similar to that observed with NSAIDs. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical use of a lipid-free, ready-made parenteral nutrition (PN) solution in dogs and cats. Medical records of all dogs and cats that received this PN solution between November 2006 and September 2009 were reviewed and data pertaining to patient profile, time to initiation and duration of PN support, characterization of caloric and protein provision, complications, and outcome were recorded. PN was provided to 61 dogs and 9 cats using a ready-made, lipidfree, amino acid (59 grams protein/L) and dextrose (100 g/L) solution. This PN solution also contains electrolytes, including potassium (20 mEq/L). The median time to initiation of PN support was 3 days (range 0-26 days) and this was administered via a peripheral catheter in most cases (n 5 51). The median duration of PN administration was 60 hours (range 6-228 hours) in dogs and 36 hours (range 24-96 hours) in cats. The median level of protein provision was 6 gm/100 kcal (range 1-10 gm/100 kcal), while the median fraction of the resting energy requirements provided by the PN solution was 57% (range 9-100%). The median rate of glucose provided was 2.2 mg/kg/min (range 0.8-5.2 mg/kg/min). Metabolic complications were seen in 36 patients, of which hyperglycemia (n 5 19) and hyperkalemia (n 5 15) were the most common. The median maximal glucose concentration post-initiation of PN in the patients that developed hyperglycemia was 135 mg/dL (range 120.7 -477.5 mg/dL). The amount of glucose provided by the PN did not influence the development of hyperglycemia (P 5 0.4). Azotemia developed following PN administration in 7 animals but the amount of protein provided did not influence the development of this complication (P 5 0.5). Mechanical complications were seen in 27 patients, all of which involved administration via peripheral catheters. Suspected catheter infections were investigated via bacterial cultures of catheters and this resulted in a positive culture in 4 cases (all dogs). Thirty-one (44%) patients were discharged from the hospital, whereas 17% died and 39% were euthanized. The median duration of hospitalization was 6.5 days (range 2-31 days). The occurrence of mechanical or septic complications did not affect the outcome of these patients, however patients without pre-existing hyperkalemia that developed this complication following PN administration were less likely to survive (P 5 0.015). The presence of azotemia both prior to and following PN administration was associated with a poor outcome (P 5 0.016 pre-PN and P 5 0.003 post-PN). Pre-existing or the development of hyperglycemia was not associated with a poor outcome (P 5 1.0). Concurrent enteral nutrition with PN was not found to influence outcome (P 5 0.73). This form of PN appears to be a viable alternative to compounded PN but may be associated with higher rates of complications compared with previous reports of PN in animals. Recently, it has been shown that the intestinal microbiota is altered in obese mice and humans, and that obesity leads to a state of chronic subclinical intestinal inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in the fecal microbiota and in the fecal inflammatory markers calprotectin and S100A12 between lean and obese adult dogs. Sixteen healthy lean adult pet dogs (median body condition score (BCS) 5/9, range: 4-5) were compared to 13 obese, but otherwise healthy, adult pet dogs (median BCS 8.5/9, range 7-9). The pet dogs were of various breeds and ages and were fed different commercial diets. Additionally, 9 healthy adult research Beagles were enrolled, five of which were fed ad libitum over 6 months to a mean BCS of 7.5/9 (range: 7.5-9) and 4 were fed the same diet restrictively and served as lean controls (mean BCS 4/9, range 4-5). Samples were taken at baseline (T0), after 3 months (T3), and after 6 months (T6). The fecal microbiota was analyzed by massive parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Fecal concentrations of calprotectin and S100A12 were measured using in-house radioimmunoassays. Data were analyzed using parametric or non-parametric tests when appropriate and contingency tables. Significance was set at p o 0.05. Differences in the fecal microbiota between lean and obese dogs were mainly seen in the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Erysipelotrichales. In the pet dogs, obese animals had a higher proportion of the genus Catenibacterium (p 5 0.04) and a lower proportion of Streptococcus constellatus (p 5 0.0005) and Clostridium cluster II (p 5 0.01). In the research dogs, proportions of Peptococcaceae (p 5 0.03), Clostridium bartlettii (p 5 0.02), and C. sordellii (p 5 0.02) were higher, while proportions of Clostridiales Family XIII Incertae Sedis (p 5 0.02) and Anaerovorax sp. (p 5 0.02) were lower in the dogs fed ad libitum compared to the lean controls at T6. No significant differences (p 5 0.6) were seen in fecal calprotectin concentrations between lean and obese pet dogs and all values were within the reference interval (2.9-137.5 mg/g). In the research dogs, fecal calprotectin concentrations were higher in the dogs fed ad libitum compared to the lean controls at T3 (p 5 0.03) or T6 (p 5 0.02). S100A12 was below the detection limit of 0.5 mg/g in all samples. These results suggest alterations in the fecal microbiota of obese dogs. The most notable changes were observed within the orders Clostridiales and Erysipelotrichales (i.e. Catenibacterium sp.), which is similar to findings in obese mice and humans. Fecal calprotectin concentrations were significantly increased only in the research dogs fed ad libitum, possibly reflecting a state of inflammation of the intestinal tract during the early stage of obesity. Cycads (also called sago palms) are commonly encountered in various parts of the world. They are part of the native flora in tropical and subtropical regions. Additionally they have been extensively used in residential landscaping in the South of the USA. Cycads produce a variety of toxins that are poisonous to humans and animals. These toxins can be found in all parts of the plant, but seem to be present in highest concentration in the seeds and roots. After ingestion the main toxin cycasin is metabolized by the intestinal flora to its active compound, which is most likely responsible for GI and hepatic toxicity in dogs. The goal of this retrospective study of a cohort of affected dogs is to evaluate the outcome of cycad intoxication and identify possible prognostic factors. Medical records of the LSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital were searched for cases of documented or suspected cycad ingestion presented over a 5 year period (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ). All information including history, clinical signs, laboratory abnormalities, applied treatment modalities and survival was tabulated. Depending on the outcome, cases were assigned either to the surviving or the non-surviving group. Variables recorded at the time of presentation were compared between both groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test or the Fisher's exact test. Additionally, all variables were evaluated as possible prognostic indicators in a univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 45 cases were retrieved. Eating or chewing a cycad root or seed had been directly observed in 22 dogs, while there was strong evidence suggesting cycad intoxication in the remaining 23 cases. Nineteen (42.2%) dogs survived and 26 (57.8%) died or were euthanized as a direct consequence of cycad intoxication. The following significant differences were documented between survivors (Sv) and non-survivors (NSv) dogs (p o 0.05): median serum alkaline phosphatase was higher in NSv while median platelet count, serum glucose and serum albumin were lower in NSv, Additionally, coagulation times PT and PTT were more frequently prolonged in NSv than in Sv. Significant variables in the univariate model (p o 0.05) were platelet count, serum glucose and serum albumin, frequency of prolonged PT, and administration of fresh frozen plasma. However, dogs probably received plasma due to the severity of their condition. Time between ingestion and presentation, presence of neurological signs, or documentation of confirmed vs. suspect ingestion did not significantly affect the prognosis. Low platelet count and low blood glucose were negative prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Cycad intoxication is associated with a much higher mortality rate than previously published. Several laboratory parameters may be helpful in determining the prognosis of intoxicated dogs on presentation. They likely reflect the severity of the liver function decrease, the presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, DIC, or a combination of these problems. Liver disease resulting from trauma or inflammation compromises the ability of the tissue to heal and regenerate. In dogs, chronic liver inflammation leads to life-threatening damage. The liver regenerative process relies on the critical participation of pro-inflammatory mediators which are responsible for priming hepatocytes to release growth factors necessary for regeneration. Hepatocytes, the main cellular constituent of liver, account for the regenerative capacity of liver. They also detoxify and metabolize noxious agents. We have developed a hepatocyte culture model that facilitates adhesion, proliferation, and maintenance of hepatocyte phenotype. We used this hepatocyte model to induce inflammation and oxidative stress with the cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1). We then determined whether S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and silybin (SB), which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, can attenuate this response. SAMe and SB are commonly used to support liver function and are found in commercially available Denamarin s . Both SAMe and SB have been reported to promote protein synthesis in hepatocytes, protect against oxidative stress by synthesizing intracellular glutathione (GSH) for detoxification, and suppress inflammation by inhibiting leukotriene production. Primary canine hepatocytes (Celsis IVT; 5 Â 10 5 cells/well) seeded in type I collagen-coated 6-well plates were incubated for 24 hrs with: (i) control media alone or (ii) combinations of clinically relevant concentrations of SAMe (30 or 2000 ng/ml) and SB (298 ng/ ml). Cells were activated for 24 hrs with IL-110 ng/ml). Supernatants were analyzed for production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) and the cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) by ELISA. Hepatocytes were lysed and analyzed for GSH content using a method modified from Prieto-Sagredo et al. (Photochemistry and Photobiology. 71:487-492. 2000) . Immunostaining of cells plated on 8-well chambers (1 Â 10 4 cells) for albumin and cytokeratin 8 (CK8) verified that they continued to express the liver phenotype. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and the Student-Neuman-Keuls post-hoc test with significance set at p o 0.05 using 2 to 3 animals. Stimulation with IL-1 induced pro-inflammatory PGE 2 and IL-8 production while reducing GSH cellular content compared to non-activated controls. Pre-treatment with the combination of different concentrations of SAMe and SB significantly reduced PGE 2 and IL-8 production and maintained baseline GSH cellular content (all p o 0.05). The present study shows for the first time that pre-treatment with the combination of SAMe and SB inhibits induction of inflammation and oxidative stress. This observation supports their role in hepatoprotection. Doberman hepatitis (DH) is strongly associated with homozygous DLA class II haplotype DRB1 Ã 00601/DQA1 Ã 00401/DQB1 Ã 01303 and especially homozygous allele DLA-DRB1 Ã 00601. This DLA class II association clearly indicates a role for the immune system in the development of the disease. The DLA class II expression is primarily controlled at transcriptional level through the use of proximal promoters, several transcription factors and an essential co-activator, the MHC class II trans-activator (CIITA). The aim of this study was to evaluate proximal promoters of DLA genes in Dobermans and the potential association of these promoters with DH. We included 35 DH cases and 15 controls in the study, all homozygous for DLA-DRB1 Ã 00601/DQA1 Ã 00401/ DQB1 Ã 01303. The promoter regions of DLA-DRB, -DQA and -DQB genes were amplified using dog specific primers. Low levels of polymorphism were found within the DLA promoter regions, and no significant differences were noted between dogs with or without DH. However, when evaluating all the 50 homozygous DLA-DRB1 Ã 00601/DQA1 Ã 00401/DQB1 Ã 01303 Dobermans, a strong linkage disequilibrium was found between each promoter variant and exon 2 allele. In this breed, DLA-DRB1 Ã ;00601 and DLA-DQB1 Ã 01303 were clearly associated with 2 previously unrecognized promoter variants and DLA-DQA1 Ã 00401 was strongly associated with promoter allele DQAp Ã 2. The importance of hepatocytes presenting DLA class II antigens in connection with DH is unknown. However, an immune response is clearly maintained and modulated through the interaction between immune cells and cells of the target organ. Our results indicate that in Dobermans DLA alleles are in linkage disequilibrium with their promoters. However, in DH, the aberrant DLA class II expression by the affected hepatocytes is not due to variation in promoter sequences per se but indicates the involvement of additional factors. A retrospective study was conducted to characterize the diseases, clinicopathologic findings, and outcomes associated with hyperbilirubinemia in cats presented to Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital over a 39-month period. Criteria for inclusion were a serum total bilirubin (TB, mg/dl) concentration 4 0.2 on presentation and a complete medical record. History, physical exam findings, laboratory data, imaging, cytology, and histopathology were analyzed to identify the cause of hyperbilirubinemia. The mean TB concentration for all 180 cats was 1.93 (range 0.3-24.9). Diagnoses were categorized as shown in the table. Non-survivors either died or were euthanized due to their disease. Patients that recovered or were lost to follow-up were counted as survivors. Overall survival rate was 62% (survivor TB 5 1.64, non-survivor TB 5 2.41). Survival rate was assessed for three TB levels: mild (TB o 0.5, 73% survival), moderate (TB 5 0.5-1.9, 60% survival), and severe (TB ! 2.0, 45% survival). Mildly elevated TB in cats with identifiable non-hepatic disease is likely clinically insignificant, whereas severely elevated TB was associated with primary causes of hyperbilirubinemia and lower survival rates. Virtual-reality simulation is rapidly entering the mainstream of human medical training for teaching and competence assessment of technical skills, including endoscopy. Such trainers would be of great benefit in veterinary medicine through decreased laboratory animal use and flexible training time. However, only human virtualreality endoscopy trainers (VRET) are available. The purpose of this study was to determine if a human VRET is an acceptable alternative to a traditional live-dog laboratory (LDL) for teaching early veterinary endoscopy skills based on feedback from trainees Note that total n is greater than 180, as some cats were diagnosed with multiple conditions. Data for cats that fit more than once within a larger category were only counted once for the purposes of the descriptive statistics. and comparisons of endoscopic performance between training methods. Subjects were residents or interns who had performed o 10 endoscopic procedures. During a 4 week period, all subjects underwent: a 3-hour lecture; hands-on training with either a human VRET (AccuTouch s Endoscopy Simulator; n 5 6) or a LDL (n 5 6); 2 recorded esophagogastro-duodenoscopies (EGD) on live dogs for evaluation purposes; and lastly, hands-on training with the alternate method. Subjects were prospectively randomized for initial training method. Hands-on training by either method consisted of 2-3.5 hours of EGD, colonoscopy, and bronchoscopy. Subjects anonymously completed questionnaires with Likert scales prior to any hands-on training and post-training to rate aspects of their experiences. Prior endoscopy and computer game experience was also reported. Digital recordings of evaluation EGDs were subjectively assessed by 1 evaluator (SAB), blinded to training method. ANOVA was used to compare questionnaire responses and endoscopy performance, and statistical models controlled for order of training method (questionnaires) and order of evaluated EGDs (1 st or 2 nd ), with P 0.05 significant. Of 12 subjects, 9 had no prior endoscopy experience and 4 had 4 1 year of computer game experience. Subjects found the VRET to be less stressful than the LDL (P50.02). Subjects initially VRET trained also found this method more useful for learning the different functions (knobs/dials) of the endoscope than subjects initially LDL trained (P50.03). No significant differences were found for learning how to manipulate/''drive'' the endoscope or perform an EGD procedure, or for rating the overall usefulness of the training method. All 12 subjects indicated the VRET was a useful and acceptable alternative to the LDL for early training. When performance was evaluated, subjects initially VRET trained had longer total procedure times than LDL subjects (P50.02), and those with computer game experience had shorter procedure times (P50.03). No significant differences were found for successful completion of the EGD, esophageal transit time, % time vision was maintained or the ability to stay centered in the esophageal lumen. In conclusion, the human AccuTouch s VRET is an acceptable alternative to the LDL for early endoscopy training of veterinarians based on trainee feedback. Procedural time was shorter with LDL training, but was also shorter with prior computer game experience. Endoscopic mucosal biopsy is routinely performed in veterinary medicine. This minimally invasive procedure can be a very helpful diagnostic tool, however quality of samples can vary with operator experience. Furthermore, there is question regarding the reliability of mucosal samples for diagnosing intestinal disease in cats, particularly as it pertains to small cell gastrointestinal lymphoma. This study compares results obtained by gastroduodenoscopy with laparoscopic-assisted full thickness intestinal biopsy. Eleven client-owned patients underwent gastroduodenoscopy followed by laparoscopy for evaluation of suspected gastrointestinal disease. Mucosal samples of the stomach and duodenum were obtained first. A two-port laparoscopic-assisted technique was used to obtain a full thickness jejunal biopsy. Mesenteric lymph node biopsy was obtained if lymphadenopathy was identified and samples of liver, spleen or other internal structures were obtained as clinically indicated. Comparison of the full-thickness samples with endoscopic samples yielded comparable to identical results in 7 cases. In 2 cases, a more severe inflammatory description of a non-malignant process was obtained from the full-thickness samples. Two other patients were diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from the mucosal sample but with lymphoma by the full thickness, laparoscopically obtained sample. Of the 11 cases, four were diagnosed with lymphoma with two cases having identical results between the mucosal and full thickness samples. Laparoscopic-assisted full thickness intestinal biopsy may be preferred over endoscopic biopsy for diagnosing intestinal disease in cats. Further study is needed to assess the consistency of endoscopic samples with full thickness samples for the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma. In humans, vincristine induces gastrointestinal motility disorders due to its neurotoxicity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric motility after vincristine administration and the prokinetic effect of mosapride citrate in these dogs. We used ultrasonographic evaluation to assess daily changes of gastric motility in dogs. The validity of this method was confirmed by its correlation with gastric emptying assessed by the 13 C-octanoic acid breath test in advance. Five healthy dogs were administered vincristine (Oncovin) intravenously at a dose of 0.75 mg/m 2 . Motility index (MI) of antral contraction was ultrasonographically evaluated before injection and daily over a 6-day period after injection. Gastrointestinal adverse events observed during the study were recorded. A significant decrease (P o 0.05) in MI was observed on day 3 (6.64 AE 0.38, mean AE SD) and day 4 (8.02 AE 0.72) compared with pre-injection (10.00 AE 0.62). Gastrointestinal adverse events were observed in 4 dogs (anorexia in 3 dogs, and vomiting, diarrhea, and hematochezia in 1 dog each). When 2 mg/kg of mosapride citrate (Pronamide) was orally administered to same dogs with vincristine and throughout the subsequent 5 days, MI improved significantly on day 3 (11.20 AE 0.52) and day 4 (11.11 AE 1.65). Furthermore, gastrointestinal adverse events occurred less frequently (vomiting and hematochezia in 1 dog each). In conclusion, administration of vincristine induces gastric hypomotility in dogs. Preventive administration of prokinetics such as mosapride citrate improves the hypomotility and may be effective for reducing the adverse gastrointestinal effects of vincristine. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) associated with general anesthesia is one of the most common causes of canine esophagitis and stricture. The ability of proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics to reduce intra-operative gastric and esophageal acid exposure is uncertain. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of esomeprazole and cisapride on intraoperative gastric and esophageal pH, and on the frequency of acid and non-acid GER episodes. Dogs undergoing elective orthopedic surgery procedures were randomized to receive either: 1) IV esomeprazole at 1 mg/kg 18 hours and 1-hour prior to induction; 2) IV esomeprazole and IV cisapride both at 1 mg/kg 18 hours and 1-hour prior to induction; or 3) saline placebo. Immediately following induction, a pH/impedance probe was endoscopically placed in the esophagus with the pH sensor 6 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction. The probe was attached to a recorder and data was downloaded onto a computer for interpretation and analysis. Forty-five dogs were randomized. Mean (AE SD) age of the cohort was 4.91 AE 3.13 yrs, and mean body weight was 26.74 AE 12.59 kg.The most common surgical procedures were extracapsular cruciate ligament stabilization (31%), tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (20%), and elbow arthroscopy (13%). There was no difference between age, gender, or body weight among groups (p 4 0.05). The mean (AE SD) gastric pH was 4.55 AE 1.98 for the placebo group, 7.39 AE 1.61 for the esomeprazole group, and 6.67 AE 1.30 for the esomeprazole plus cisapride group (p o 0.05). The mean (AE SD) esophageal pH was 5.77 AE 1.54 for the placebo group, 6.41 AE 0.93 for the esomeprazole group, and 6.20 AE 0.84 for the esomeprazole plus cisapride group (p 4 0.05). The mean AE SD number of reflux episodes was 0.71 AE 1.05 for the placebo group, 0.50 AE 0.94 for the esomeprazole group, and 0.29 AE 0.61 for the esomeprazole plus cisapride group (p 4 0.05). The mean (AE SD) percentage of time that the esophageal pH was o 4 was 12.63 AE 29.9% for the placebo group, 1.65 AE 6.17% for the esomeprazole group, and 0.00 AE 0.00% for the esomeprazole plus cisapride group (p 4 0.05). Pre-operative intravenous esomeprazole and esomeprazole plus cisapride significantly increases intraoperative gastric pH. Trends suggest that pre-operative esomeprazole and esomeprazole plus cisapride may decrease intraoperative gastroesophageal reflux. The addition of cisapride to esomeprazole does not appear to offer additional benefit. Citrulline is an amino acid, synthesized almost exclusively by the enterocytes from luminally-absorbed glutamine. Several studies have shown that fasting plasma citrulline concentration is correlated to the functional length of the small intestine in human patients with short bowel syndrome, and to the severity of disease in patients with celiac disease or radiotherapy-induced gastrointestinal damage. To the best of our knowledge, plasma citrulline has never been studied in dogs with gastro-intestinal disease. Therefore the objective of this study was to document plasma citrulline concentration in canine parvovirus enteritis, a spontaneous canine model of acute and severe intestinal failure. Moreover, plasma citrulline concentration was also compared between dogs that died and dogs that survived. The study enrolled 61 dogs with acute parvovirus enteritis and 14 age-matched, healthy control dogs. Parvovirus infection was confirmed by fecal electron-microscopy. The group of parvovirus infected dogs was subdivided into dogs that died (n 5 12) and survivors (n 5 49). An EDTA blood sample was collected from each dog at admission. The plasma was immediately separated by centrifugation at 141C and stored at À801C until measurement of citrulline. Citrulline was measured by liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) after deproteinization with acetonitrile and derivatization with propyl chloroformate. Plasma citrulline concentration was compared between the three groups with a Kruskal-Wallis test and the post-hoc Dunn's test. Plasma citrulline concentration was severely decreased in parvovirus-infected dogs (median 2.7 mol/L, range 0.5 to 28.9 mol/L) when compared to control dogs (median 53.8 mol/L range 11.4 to 96.1 mol/L, p o 0.001). The plasma citrulline concentration at admission was not statistically different (p 5 0.059) between the dogs that died (median 2.1 mol/L; range 0.5-6.4) and survivors (median 2.8 mol/L; range 0.29-49.05). However, this statistical comparison was underpowered by a post hoc calculated power of 0.3. This study is the first to report citrulline as a possible marker of enterocyte metabolic activity in dogs in a spontaneous model of acute intestinal failure. Further investigations of plasma citrulline as a possible marker of global enterocyte metabolic failure in other disease conditions should be considered. Such information may be of prognostic value in dogs with parvoviral and other enteropathies and may also help validate the value of therapeutic interventions such as enteral nutrition to provide substrate to the enterocytes in metabolic failure. Cobalamin is a hydrophilic vitamin involved in numerous metabolic processes. Marked hypocobalaminemia (B12 low ) is observed with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders resulting in malfunction of multiple organ systems. This retrospective study was conducted to identify breed predispositions for B12 low ( o 100 ng/l) in dogs, with signs of gastrointestinaldisease, tested at the Comparative Gastroenterology Laboratory of the University of Liverpool, UK. Entries from 1990 to 2002 were analyzed. Dogs with TLI 5.0 g/l and breeds with less than thirty different samples were excluded. Risk for B12 low was determined by calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each breed against the rest of the database. Significance was assessed using 2-sided Fisher's exact test (P o 0.05). Folate ( o 3.5 g/l vs. ! 3.5 g/l) was then assessed in breeds with an increased risk of B12 low ; proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test, with a modified Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A total of 13,069 records were reviewed and 9,997 dogs, 40 breeds, were considered for analysis after exclusion of EPI cases. B12 low was present in 1,431 dogs (14.3%) with the following breeds identified to be at higher risk . Concurrent low folate and B12 low were observed in 0% of SPs, 2% of GSDs, 6% of MIX, and 4% of SBTs. Low folate without B12 low was observed in 0% (SPs), 8% (GSDs), 12% (MIX), and 13% (SBT). SPs had significantly fewer cases with low folate concentrations than the other breeds predisposed to B12 low (P o 0.0001 for both), whilst GSDs had significantly fewer low folate results than SBTs (P o 0.0065) and MIX (P o 0.0001). This study shows that breed differences exist in the risk of developing B12 low . The SP is at highest risk, as previously demonstrated in North American dogs. The absence of concurrent low folate concentrations would be consistent with a carrier mechanism defect or disease process localized in the distal small intestine, rather than diffuse malabsorptive disease. Interestingly, other breeds not previously reported were also predisposed to B12 low (SBT, GSD, and MIX). Further studies are warranted better to understand the underlying mechanisms for these different breed predilections. Omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, raises intragastric pH by binding to the parietal cell H 1 ,K 1 -ATPase pump. In people, optimal gastroduodenal ulcer healing occurs at an intragastric pH of ! 3 and omeprazole has been shown to suppress gastric acid secretion more consistently than histamine-2 receptor antagonists. In dogs, effective clinical doses of anti-secretory drugs have not been established, but clinical experience suggests that the recommended oral omeprazole dose (0.7-1.0 mg/kg q24h) may not suppress acid secretion adequately. Additionally, only human or equine formulations of omeprazole are available for use in dogs and a comparison of their efficacy has not been conducted. The purpose of this study was to compare the gastric acid suppressing qualities of oral famotidine and two omeprazole formulations in dogs. Six normal adult dogs were used in a randomized, crossover, open-label study. All dogs received omeprazole tablets (1.5-2.6 mg/ kg q24h), omeprazole paste (Gastrogard s diluted in sesame oil at 40 mg/ml) (1.5-2.6 mg/kg q24h), famotidine tablets (1.0-1.3 mg/kg q12h), and placebo. Ambulatory pH monitoring (Bravo system s ) was utilized to continuously record intragastric pH for four days (treatment days 4-7) followed by a 10-day washout period. Plasma omeprazole concentrations at 1 and 2 h post treatment (days 1, 7) were determined by HPLC with ultraviolet detection. Mean percentage of time the intragastric pH was ! 3 and 4 was compared among treatment groups using ANOVA. Tukey's Standardized Range test was used to determine which groups were different with a 5 0.05. Mean percentages of time that intragastric pH was ! 3 and ! 4 were significantly (p o 0.0001) greater for dogs receiving omeprazole tablet and paste compared to famotidine and placebo. Famotidine and placebo were not significantly different from each other. Mean AE SD percentage of time the intragastric pH was ! 3 was 62.5 AE 6.1% for omeprazole tablet, 54.1 AE 8.3% for omeprazole paste, 21.5 AE 13.6% for famotidine, and 6.1 AE 16.8% for placebo. Mean AE SD plasma omeprazole concentrations on day 7 were similar in dogs receiving tablet (0.81 AE 0.67 mcg/ml) compared to paste (0.73 AE 0.63). These results demonstrate that both omeprazole formulations provide superior acid suppression in dogs compared to famotidine or placebo. For once-daily administration, higher than commonly recommended oral doses of omeprazole is supported. The aims of this study were the following: find the most common diagnoses of dogs referred for vomiting, determine the usefulness of various diagnostic investigations and assess the effect of antiemetic therapy. 307 dogs referred for vomiting were analysed regarding signalment, history and clinical examination. Various diagnostic investigations were reviewed to assess their usefulness to reach a final diagnosis. The usefulness of a diagnostic investigation was categorized into the following four groups: enabled a diagnosis (ed); assisted a diagnosis (ad); no assistance, diagnosis reached by another procedure (dop); no assistance, no final diagnosis made (nand). The dogs were retrospectively assigned to one of the following diagnostic groups: gastrointestinal (stomach, small intestine, large intestine, nonspecific); abdominal (peritoneum, hepatobiliar, spleen, pancreas, renal, urogenital) ; systemic disease (metabolic, toxic, drug associated); neurologic; miscellaneous; no diagnosis. The following diagnostic investigations were looked at: haematology/biochemistry (CBC/BC), radiography (RX), ultrasound (US), urinalysis (UA), endocrine testing (ET), faecal analysis (FA), fine needle aspiration (FNA) and histopathology (Histo). Success of antiemetic therapy was grouped according to drug used and whether emesis stopped within 24 hours. In 291 dogs (94.8%) a diagnosis was found and was classified into the following groups: gastrointestinal (43.1%), abdominal (26.2%), miscellaneous (19%), systemic (9.7%) and neurologic (4.8%). Usefulness of clinical investigations is shown in table 1. 65 dogs (21.1%) were treated with antiemetics (maropitant n 5 50; metoclopramid n 5 5). Therapy with maropitant and metoclopramid were successful within 24 hours in 24 dogs and 0 dogs, respectively. In 10 dogs therapeutic outcome was not clearly documented. Over 50% of dogs referred for vomiting had extragastrointestinal diseases. Of the diagnostic investigations Histo, FNA and ET were the most useful. In 21.1% of dogs referred for vomiting antiemetic therapy was clinically indicated, but was successful only in half of dogs. Recurrent constipation is a common problem in cats. These cats often require long-term laxatives as part of their medical management to improve their quality of life. Despite the common use of these medications, there is very limited data in veterinary medicine regarding the efficacy, dosage and safety of different oral laxatives. Numerous studies have shown that polyethylene glycol oral preparation (PEG 3350) is one of the most effective and safe laxatives for treating chronic constipation in humans. Side effects in humans are rare, but include life-threatening hyponatremia. PEG is readily available in a powder form, which can be added to a cat's regular food. This aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and palatability of PEG for long term use in cats. Six (6) healthy, research cats were included in this study. PEG3350 with electrolytes was administered by adding it to a commercial diet (canned and dry) and the dosage was titrated in each cat to achieve soft, but formed stool. A complete blood count and serum biochemistry panel with electrolytes were obtained prior to administration of PEG, as well as two and four weeks after PEG administration was initiated. Food intake, fecal scores (using a standardized fecal grading scale) and weights of the cats were monitored daily. All cats completed the study with no significant side-effects. Sporadic vomiting was observed in one cat during the treatment. Soft to very soft stools were achieved in all animals. Food intake (p 5 0.86) and body weight (p 5 0.92) was not significantly influenced by PEG administration. Mild erythrocytosis was found in 1 of 6 cats, before and after the treatment (11.3-12 Â 10 12 /L, reference values: 6.89-10.8 Â 10 12 /L). No changes in serum sodium were found in any of the cats, however, 3 cats developed mild hyperkalemia (5.6-6 mmol/ L, reference values: 3.9-5.5 mmol/L). The change in potassium was not statistically significant between any time points (p 5 0.11 and p 5 0.06). The cause was unknown, but may have been secondary to mild non-clinical dehydration. No clinical signs of hyperkalemia were observed in any of the cats. This study showed that polyethylene glycol is a safe and palatable oral laxative in cats for long term use. Potential side effects may include hyperkalemia. Subclinical dehydration may also occur. Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) in dogs has anecdotally been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease; however there is limited published evidence to support this association. The aim of this study was to determine whether dogs with PLE are hypercoagulable and if present, to characterize the nature of the hypercoagulable state using thromboelastography (TEG) in combination with conventional coagulation tests. Fifteen client-owned dogs with PLE were prospectively enrolled. PLE was diagnosed on the basis of a history of gastrointestinal disease, panhypoproteinemia, exclusion of hepatic dysfunction and proteinuria and histopathological confirmation of a disease process associated with PLE. Dogs with PLE were scored using the canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI). Assays included prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), D-dimers, fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT) activity and recalcified, unactivated TEG. Values for reaction time (R), clot formation time (K), clot formation angle (a) and maximum amplitude (MA) were recorded from TEG tracings. TEG tracings were compared with those obtained from 30 healthy control dogs (HC) of various breeds. A subset of 9 PLE patients were reassessed 4-24 days after initiation of immunosuppressive treatment for IBD. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were used to compare variables from PLE dogs with those from HC and to compare pre-and post treatment values in dogs with PLE. P values o 0.05 were considered significant. When compared to HC, all dogs in the study were significantly hypercoagulable with decreased R (PLE: median 7.8, range 2.4-11.2; AT activity was borderline low in PLE dogs (median 65% (50-121%), reference range 65-145%), however, mean serum albumin concentration was severely decreased, mean 1.67 g/dl AE 0.5 (reference range 2.8-3.5 g/dl). Despite significant improvements in serum albumin (2.31 g/ dl AE 3.5, p 5 0.01) and CCECAI (pre-treatment: median 12 (6-17), post-treatment: 3 (0-8), p 5 0.003), all 9 dogs re-examined remained hypercoagulable based on TEG. Our data demonstrates that dogs with PLE are in a hypercoagulable state, which cannot be solely attributed to loss of AT but may be multifactorial in origin. Despite a good clinical response to treatment, dogs with PLE remained hypercoagulable and may therefore continue to be predisposed to thromboembolic complications even after clinical improvement. Chronic diarrhea is a common problem in pet cats. In prior studies, more than half of cats with chronic diarrhea improved when fed an appropriate dry diet. The objective of this cross-over study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new canned diet relative to the leading veterinary-prescribed diet formulated for cats with chronic diarrhea. Sixteen adult cats with chronic large and/or small bowel diarrhea were divided into two groups, and randomly assigned to test diet A a or B b . All cats were fed a common canned diet during baseline evaluations, then were fed their assigned test diet for 4 weeks. Following this, each cat was switched to the alternate test diet for an additional 4 weeks. No additional treatment for diarrhea was allowed during the study. Fecal scores (7 5 very watery; 1 5 extremely dry and firm) were analyzed daily during the last week on each diet. Serum biochemistry was assessed at baseline and at the end of each feeding period. Fresh fecal samples, collected during the final week of each period, were analyzed via PCR for Clostridia, Bifidobacteria, and Lactobacillus. Data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and are presented as means 1/À standard error. Fifteen cats completed all phases of the study. Relative to baseline (5.3 1/À 0.37), fecal scores improved for both groups of cats, with significantly greater improvement seen in cats when fed diet B (4.4 1/À 0.37 v 3.6 1/À 0.37 for diets A and B, respectively; p o 0.01). Normal stools (fecal score 2 or 3) developed in 34.8% of cats fed diet B compared to 14.7% of cats fed diet A (p o 0.05; odds ratio 3.1). Fecal microflora did not differ by diet, although there was a significant diet Â period interaction where C. perfringens was lower in cats fed diet B during the second period. Numerous serum values differed significantly after cats were fed diet A versus diet B: serum Ca, P, Mg, K, albumin, AST, cholesterol, total protein, globulin, T3 and urea nitrogen were lower in cats fed diet A, while serum glucose was greater in cats fed diet A. In conclusion, in this study of cats with refractory diarrhea, a significant improvement in fecal quality was seen when cats were fed a therapeutic diet designed for cats with diarrhea. Improvement was significantly greater in cats fed diet B compared to diet A. Dietary changes should always be considered for cats with chronic diarrhea. Tylosin-responsive diarrhea (TRD) refers to canine diarrhea that responds to tylosin in a few days, but reappears in many dogs a short time after discontinuing the treatment. The daily dosage recommendations for tylosin in canine enteropathies vary in textbooks from 30 to 80 mg/kg. A total of 17 client-owned dogs with diagnosed TRD responding to tylosin at a dose of 25/mg/kg q 24 h were enrolled in the study. The aim of our randomized, blinded prospective clinical trial was to assess if an even lower dose of tylosin is sufficient to stop the diarrhea. At the beginning of the trial all the dogs were taken off tylosin and had normal fecal consistency. A follow-up period of a maximum of two months commenced to determine whether diarrhea would reappear. The owners evaluated and marked down the fecal consistency of each stool according to previously published guidelines using a nine-point scale of one to five with half point intervals. No additional medical treatment or dietary changes during the trial occurred. During the two month follow-up 15/17 of the dogs developed diarrhea, reaching a fecal consistency of at least four on the scale. After onset of diarrhea, the dogs were randomly assigned to two different dosage groups receiving tylosin orally either 5 mg/kg (n 5 8) or 15 mg/kg (n 5 7) q 24h for seven days. The owners were blinded to the dosage. Treatment outcome was evaluated as the mean of fecal consistency scores assigned during the last three days of the treatment period. A responder was defined with a mean value of 3, a non responder of 4 3. Of the dogs 8/8 responded to the 5 mg/kg dose, whereas 6/7 responded to the 15 mg/kg dose and one did not. It is noteworthy that 93% (14/15) of the dogs responding to tylosin at a dose of 25 mg/kg q 24h responded also to the 5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg q 24h tylosin treatment. The study indicates that a suitable dose of tylosin for the treatment of canine TRD is thus less than the current recommendations in textbooks and could be as low as 5 mg/kg once a day. Dendritic cells are thought to play a vital role in the regulation of gut immunity and maintenance of tolerance to commensal microflora and dietary antigens. Disturbances in dendritic cell number and function may therefore be implicated in the breakdown of gut homeostasis seen in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In mice and humans, CD11c serves as a marker for dendritic cells, and cells expressing this marker have been shown to have similar morphological and functional characteristics in the canine system. The aim of this study was to quantify the expression of CD11c positive cells in the duodenum of dogs with and without IBD using immunofluorescence. Endoscopic biopsies from the duodenum were obtained from 12 dogs diagnosed with IBD. Full thickness biopsies from the duodenum were taken from ten healthy beagle dogs upon euthanasia as controls. All biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at À801C until used. The fresh frozen sections were blocked with rabbit serum and treated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-canine CD11c) followed by incubation with secondary antibody (FITC labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab) 2 antibody). Cells positive for fluorescent staining were quantified in the duodenal sections. Counts were made in six areas measuring 400 mm by 300 mm (central villus tip, central mid-villus, left villus tip, left mid-villus, right villus tip and right central villus) in healthy and diseased sections and the total number of cells expressed in 720,000 mm 2 . In addition, counts were also made in three additional areas (central crypt base, left crypt base and right crypt base) in the control sections so that a comparison could be made between the number of CD11c positive cells in the crypt and villus in dogs without IBD. Statistical comparison between areas in normal duodenal sections was made using Kruskal-Wallis test and a comparison between cases with and without IBD was performed using Mann-Whitney U test. The number of CD11c positive cells in the duodenum of dogs with IBD was significantly reduced compared to controls (p o 0.000, median healthy controls: 61.5 cells/720,000 mm 2 , IBD: 18 cells/720,000 mm 2 ). In the control dogs, CD11c positive cells were exclusively present in the lamina propria and there were significantly more CD11c positive cells in the crypt base compared to mid villus (p 5 0.001) and villus tip (p 5 0.014). Our data suggests that an imbalance in intestinal dendritic cell populations may play a role in the initiation and/or the maintenance of chronic inflammation in canine IBD. The depletion of CD11c cells seen in the duodenum of dogs with IBD may reflect an increased migration of these cells to the local mesenteric lymph node to activate naı¨ve T cells and this may be driving the continued T cell inflammation seen in this disease. Future studies will determine whether CD11c is useful as a marker for the diagnosis and monitoring of canine IBD. Nucleotide oligomerisation domain two (NOD2) is an important cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, recognizing muramyl dipeptide (MDP) from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Although single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes have been implicated to play a role in the etiology of Crohn's disease in humans, the most prominent are those in NOD2, with a relative risk of 44 and 38 for compound heterozygotes and homozygotes developing Crohn's disease respectively. Previous studies have shown up-regulation of NOD2 expression in a canine colonic epithelial cell line following challenge with various infectious stimuli, thus suggesting a potential role for this receptor in the pathogenesis of canine IBD. However, to date no studies have been performed to investigate the presence of SNPs in the NOD2 gene in dogs with IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SNPs in the canine NOD2 gene are associated with IBD in German shepherd dogs (GSDs). Four non-synonymous SNPs in exon 4 of the NOD2 gene (G1357A, C1578T, G1693C and A1885G), identified in a mutational analysis, were evaluated further in a case-control study using sequence based typing. Sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, UK) and analyzed using an ABI3100 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). Sequencing information from 48 GSDs with IBD from the UK were compared to a control group consisting of 55 GSDs from patients treated for non-inflammatory disease at the Royal Veterinary College, University of London (UK). In addition, genotyping of 192 non-GSD dogs were performed; 96 IBD cases and 96 non-breed matched control with no history of inflammatory disease. All four SNPs were in complete linkage. In the GSD population, all four SNPs were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. When the GSD case population was compared to the GSD control group, the heterozygote genotype for all four SNPs was found to be significantly more frequent in the IBD population (p 5 0.04, OR 5 2.34, CI 5 1.03-5.28). These results were also mirrored in the non-GSD breeds: The heterozygote genotype for all four SNPs was significantly more frequent in the IBD population compared to the non-GSD control population (p 5 0.0009, OR 5 3.06, CI 5 1.55-6.05). Our study suggests that the four SNPs in exon 4 of NOD2 when analyzed in an over-dominant model are significantly associated with IBD in GSDs as well as in other canine breeds with IBD. Our data may suggest a significant role of NOD2 in canine IBD. Further functional data would be needed to elucidate the exact role of NOD2 in canine IBD. Canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is one form of chronic enteropathy thought to be caused by the interplay of genetic, immunologic, and enteric microbial factors. Although an important role for mucosal bacteria in the pathogenesis of IBD has been proposed, studies investigating the association between microbiota composition and host gene expression are lacking. Using unique molecular tools, we examined the relationship of differential gene expression (determined by Affymetrix DNA microarrays) to microbiota composition (determined by bacterial tag-encoded FLX 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing) in intestinal tissues of healthy dogs and in dogs with IBD. Samples of intestinal mucosa were collected by endoscopy or surgery from healthy dogs (n 5 6) and dogs diagnosed with moderateto-severe IBD (n 5 18; CIBDAI ! 6). Total RNA was extracted and utilized for microarray analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip s Canine Genome 2.0 Array. Pyrosequencing was performed on aliquots of cDNA from each dog. Permutation testing yielded over 1730 probe sets differentially expressed (FDR 1%, expression change 2 fold or greater) between the IBD and control samples, suggesting that each canine group had a distinctive gene expression pattern. Analysis confirmed that a total of 1461 (84%) of these transcripts were down-regulated and included genes associated with protein synthesis, transcription/ translation, and cell signaling. A lesser number of genes were upregulated in IBD dogs, including genes encoding for calcium binding proteins, the matrix metallopeptidases, and immune function. Pyrosequencing yielded 152,000 16S rRNA gene sequencing tags. Intestinal inflammation in IBD dogs was accompanied by significant differences in composition of the intestinal microbiota. Specifically, the proportions of members of Bacteroidales and Clostridiales (i.e., genus Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Dorea within the Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa) were significantly reduced in the IBD dogs (p o 0.01). In contrast, proportions of Gamma-Proteobacteria (i.e., Moraxellaceae and Xanthomonadaceae) were significantly higher in the IBD dogs (p 5 0.012). In summary, transcriptional profiling documented differential gene expression that was associated with significant compositional differences of the intestinal microbiota in IBD dogs. Observed patterns of mucosal gene expression and altered microbial diversity in dogs are similar to those reported for humans with intestinal inflammation (i.e., IBD or infectious colitis). These data suggest that potential molecular targets for diagnostic monitoring and therapeutic intervention of disease prior to the onset chronic mucosal inflammation may exist in dogs with IBD. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of genes encoding IL-12p35 and p40, IL-23p19 and IFN-g in duodenal biopsies taken from cats with histological evidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Cats referred to the Feline Centre, University of Bristol for chronic signs of gastrointestinal disturbance were examined and those fulfilling a set of inclusion criteria were recruited (n 5 13). Endoscopic duodenal biopsies were also collected from 21 healthy barrier-maintained cats which were used as controls. Formalin-fixed duodenal biopsies were processed for routine histopathology. Peroxidase immunohistochemistry was used to detect majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on snap-frozen duodenal biopsies to detect various cytokine gene expressions. The majority of cats with IBD had moderate to severe colitis (histological score 2), even those cats without signs of large bowel disease. The density of cells expressing MHC class II within the lamina propria and the epithelial expression of this molecule by enterocytes were both slightly higher in cats with IBD than in healthy cats, but the difference was not significant (p 4 0.05). IL-12p35 mRNA was significantly lower in the duodenal mucosa of cats with IBD compared with the mucosa of healthy cats (p 5 0.000). In contrast, IL-23p19 mRNA expression was significantly higher in duodenal biopsies from IBD cats than healthy controls (p 5 0.001). There was no significant difference in expression of IL-12p40 and IFN-g mRNA (p 4 0.05). The severity of histopathological infiltration suggestive of inflammation did not correlate with the levels of mRNA expression for any cytokine. The results of this study suggest that IL-23 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of feline IBD. Chronic enteropathies are widely thought to result from dysfunction of innate and/or adaptive mucosal responses to intestinal antigens in a susceptible individual. Lymphoproliferative disease is a well-recognised sequela to chronic intestinal inflammation in people, and though this has not been critically examined in dogs and cats, the increasing prevalence of intestinal T cell lymphoma in cats in particular could be preceded by chronic inflammation. The mucosal cytokine milieu is thought to play a pivotal role in neoplastic transformation in people, with IL6, TGFb and TNFa implicated. There is growing evidence that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in particular plays a central role in the intiation and maintenance of intestinal neoplasia in people. We hypothesize that intestinal cytokine responses differ in healthy cats versus those with IBD and lymphoma and that cytokine profiling might be a useful adjunct to disease diagnosis. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies were obtained from 16 cats referred for evaluation of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) signs. Biopsies from 8 healthy DSH cats were included as controls. Tissue was collected into RNA later (cytokines), and formalin (histology and T cell receptor gamma, TCRG, gene analysis). Cytokine mRNA (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TGFb, TNFa, IFNg) was measured by probe-based real-time RT-PCR, normalised to GAPDH, and expressed as CT. TCRG gene clonality was evaluated by PCR amplification (CDR3) and PAGE on native and denatured PCR products, with samples classified as clonal (C), oligoclonal (OC), polyclonal (PC) and pseudoclonal (PS). The histological diagnosis was lymphoma in 6 cases (4/6 confirmed as T cell by immunophenotyping), IBD in 7, and equivocal for IBD/lymphoma in 3. TCRG gene analysis in lymphoma cases was OC in 4/6, C 1/6, PC 1/6; in IBD cases was OC in 2/7, C 1/7, PC 3/7, PS 1/7; and in equivocal cases was OC in 2/3, and PC 1/3. Cytokine profiles for IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TGFb, TNFa and IFNg analyzed by histologic diagnosis were similar in lymphoma, IBD, and healthy cats. Amplification of IL-6 was significantly associated with the presence of GI disease (p o 0.01, Fisher's exact). IL-6 was quantifiable in only 2/8 healthy cats, (mean CT 13.15) versus 6/7 IBD (mean CT 3.34), 6/6 lymphoma (mean CT 2.83) and 3/3 equivocal cases (mean CT À0.32). There was no difference in IL-6 levels between IBD and lymphoma. When IBD and lymphoma were analyzed according to TCRG gene clonality there was no significant difference in IL-6 levels between OC/C and PC/PS. We conclude that mucosal IL-6 is a potentially useful adjunctive diagnostic marker for feline IBD and lymphoma. The IL-6 dominated intestinal cytokine milieu in feline enteropathies suggests that IL-6 mediated resistance to apoptosis may be associated with inflammation and neoplastic transformation, as has been recognized in people. Spirocerca lupi (S.lupi) is a nematode with an indirect life-cycle with the dog as the predominant definitive host. Canine spirocercosis typically results in nodule formation in the caudal esophagus. It has been found that these nematodes shed eggs intermittently. Dogs may become re-infected, presenting with multiple nodules in various stages. Nodules can undergo neoplastic transformation into fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas and sarcomas. It is reported that worms within these neoplastic nodules do not exist, are not viable or do not shed eggs. The goal of this study was to determine if fecal examination using a novel modified centrifugal flotation method was sensitive in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic patients. Feces were collected from 42 dogs which were diagnosed with spirocercosis using esophageal endoscopy at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital. A modified centrifugal flotation method was used as it has been shown to have the highest sensitivity and egg count. This method required centrifugation (1400 G) of the fecal solution (1 g feces mixed with 5 mls of sodium nitrate flotation solution, SG 1.22) for 10 minutes after which 0.1 ml of the supernatant was aspirated from the surface for microscopic examination. Nodules were classified as neoplastic based on histopathology (n 5 6) and non-neoplastic based on regression in response to therapy determined by endoscopy or histopathology of the entire nodule (n 5 30). Dogs with multiple non-neoplastic and neoplastic nodules were excluded (n 5 6). A total egg count on the 0.1 ml supernatant was also performed on the first 27 cases (5 neoplastic and 22 non-neoplastic). Fecal examination was positive in 67% of the non-neoplastic group which was not significantly different from the neoplastic group, where 33% were positive (P 5 0.13, Chi Square Test). The overall sensitivity of detecting S. lupi eggs was 64%. The mean egg count was 1 AE 1.73 in the neoplastic group and 61 AE 95 in the nonneoplastic group (p 5 0.049, Mann-Whitney Test). The results show that dogs with neoplastically transformed S. lupi nodules do shed eggs but egg-shedding was higher in dogs with nonneoplastic nodules. This difference was not however significant. The number of eggs per case was significantly lower in the neoplastic group. This may indicate that neoplastic nodules may contain fewer worms or that these worms shed fewer eggs. The negative results in some of the non-neoplastic cases might be due to intermittent shedding and immature worms, factors which complicate such an analysis. The use of fecal examination as a tool to differentiate between dogs with neoplastic and non-neoplastic spirocercosis does not appear to be useful, although non-neoplastic cases tend to shed more eggs. The presence of multiple benign nodules concurrently with neoplastically transformed nodules in the 6 dogs (14%) which were excluded makes fecal examination unsuitable as a diagnostic tool in this group. Signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) is used for identification of ventricular late potentials (LP), low-amplitude electrical signals that occur in fibrous myocardium and are predictors of risk of sudden death. The objective of this study was to determine normal values of SAECG in healthy German Shepherd (GS; n 5 21) and Boxer (B; n 5 17) dogs. Animals were screened by physical examination, arterial pressure measurement, electrocardiography, echocardiography, thoracic radiography, laboratory tests, and 24-hour Holter monitoring. In face of normal results, dogs were submitted to SAECG performance without sedation. The parameters analyzed to detect late potentials were QRSd (width of filtered QRS complex), LAS o 40 mv (low amplitude signal in terminal portion of filtered QRS) and RMS 40 (root mean square of last 40 milliseconds of QRS complex). Statistical analyses was performed by T Student test (P o 0,05) to identify differences in each parameter between the two groups. Boxer dogs may have two forms of cardiomyopathy, the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), both of them with frequent ventricular tachyarrythmias. Time domain high-resolution or signalaveraged electrocardiogram (SAECG) identifies ventricular late potentials (LP), low-amplitude electrical signals that occur in fibrous myocardium, markers of risk of sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of late potentials on SAECG of Boxers with ARVC and DCM. Animals were screened by physical examination, arterial pressure measurement, electrocardiography, echocardiography, thoracic radiography, laboratory tests and 24-hour Holter monitoring. Depending on results of these evaluations, the animals were divided into three groups: normal (group 1; n 5 22), ARVC (group 2; n 5 20) and DCM (group 3; n 5 14). All dogs were submitted to SAECG performance without sedation. Parameters analyzed to detect LP were QRSd (width of filtered QRS complex), LAS o 40 mv (low amplitude signal in terminal QRS) and RMS 40 (root mean square of last 40 milliseconds of QRS Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a familial disease in Boxer dogs, first described by Harpster in the early 1980s. It is characterized by myocyte atrophy and fibrofatty infiltration in the ventricular myocardium, sometimes resulting in sudden death by ventricular arrhythmias. The involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the arrhythmogenesis is unclear. Thus, Boxer dogs affected by ARVC were submitted to analyses of heart rate variability in the time domain aiming to evaluate the influence of this disease on the autonomic nervous system of these animals. Ten dogs were enrolled in the study. The ARVC group (n 5 5) were 8 to 11 years old (mean age, 9.6 years), there were 1 male and 4 females and the range of VPCs per 24 hours was 1,006 to 8,346 VPCs/24 h. Five out of five dogs were asymptomatic and free from medical therapy. A second group (n 5 5), comprised of 2 males and 3 females, 3 to 7 years old (mean age, 5.8 years), clinically normal non-Boxers dogs, with no VPCs per 24 hours, served as a control group. Chamber abnormality, valvular insufficiency or systolic dysfunction were not detected in any of this dogs. Twenty-four hours electrocardiography were obtained with a 7-lead, 3-channel electrode system and acquired with a digital recorder. Analyses of heart rate variability were performed in the domain of time. Six variables were assessed. Mean of the normal RRs, SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index, pNN50 e rMSSD. Dogs were kept in the same environment under the same conditions during the Holter registration. Data was submitted to a normality test and then analysis between the groups were performed by using unpaired Student's t-test. In Indexes based on the mean of individual RR intervals (SDNN, SDANN and SDNN index) represent the global variability and reflect both systems, sympathetic and parasympathetic. On the other hand, indexes based on the comparison between adjacent cycles (rMSSD and pNN50) reflect, predominantly, vagal tonus. Therefore, presented data suggest increase in the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and decrease in the activity of parasympathetic nervous system in dogs affected by ARVC, even in asymptomatic dogs. Such findings could help in the comprehension of arrhythmogenic mechanism of dogs affected by this disease. Exercise intolerance is one of the most frequent complaints in dogs with heart disease, obesity and pulmonary disease, but it is difficult to quantify. The six minute walk test (6MWT) is used in humans to evaluate patient exercise capacity. It is an important component of quality of life assessment because it reflects the capacity to perform common daily activities, is easily performed, inexpensive, well tolerated and it has been adapted for dogs. The test is based on the maximum distance walked by the patient over six minutes. The purpose of this study was to standardize the 6MWT for healthy Dachshund, Poodle and Labrador Retriever dogs. Twenty healthy dogs of each breed were enrolled based on complete clinical and cardiovascular evaluations. Morphometric variables were measured [as nose-to-tail length (L), thoracic (TC) and abdomen (AC) circumferences, rotula-to-heel distance (RH) among others]. The dogs were walked on a leash at their own pace, only guided by the conductor, for 6 minutes in a 30 meter hallway that was marked every 5 meters. Labradors walked longer distances ( Regular physical activity has been widely used in human cardiovascular therapy, promoting better autonomic control, heart function, life quality and decreasing sudden death risks. In dogs, however, there is not a standardized guideline to be used. This research has the goals of evaluating the effects of standardized treadmill training over the autonomic and hemodynamic functions of healthy dogs. Six dogs (4 Beagles; 2 mixed breed), with mean weight of 13,1 Kg, were enrolled in this study. Twenty-four hour time domain heart rate variability (HRV), and echocardiography were analyzed before and after four weeks, five days a week, 40 minutes a day training. The intensity of training was individually determined by a maximal heart rate (MHR), observed in a maximal progressive effort test. Gradually, the intensity of training was increased in 50% of MHR, in the first week, to 60%, 70% and 80% of MHR in the second, third and fourth weeks, respectively. The paired t test was used to compare data before and after training. The improvement in functional capacity of the dogs was attested by a better performance on the physical test after training, achieving higher levels of intensity (9,0 km/h to 11,1 km/h; p 5 0,0155) and decreasing the area under the curve of lactate (31,2 to 26,0; p o 0,0001). Increase in parasympathetic tone on HRV was verified by SDANN (155,5 AE 35,2 ms to 231,7 AE 46,7 ms; p 5 0,0059), rMSSD (115,3 AE 50,4 ms to 181 AE 51,9 ms; p 5 0,0118), amplitude of heart rate (188,5 AE 21,9 bpm to 200,3 AE 17,5 bpm; p 5 0,0033), and by a higher percentage of respiratory sinusal arrhythmia on a maximal progressive effort test (4 50% until 2 km/h before training and 8 km/h after training). On the hemodynamic aspect, training lead to increase diastolic interventricular septum thickness (0,78 AE 0,12 cm to 0,91 AE 0,16 cm; p 5 0,0294), decrease left atrial diameter (2,37 AE 0,22 cm to 2,15 AE 0,19 cm; p 5 0,0369), left ventricular end-diastolic (4,47 AE 0,80 to 3,82 AE 0,62; p 5 0,0068), and end-systolic (2,27 AE 0,39 to 1,88 AE 0,48; p 5 0,0104) wall stress indexes, suggesting preload and afterload reduction. Improvement of diastolic function was confirmed by mitral E/A waves (1,42 AE 0,19 to 1,83 AE 0,46; p 5 0,0467). No differences (p 4 0,05) were detected on systolic function (EF%, SF%, left and right ejection time, left pre-ejection time, ejection index, and mean velocity of circumferential fibers shortening), left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indexes, and on Tei index of myocardial performance. As observed in a human being, training results in better autonomic and hemodynamic control in healthy dogs. In a near future we expect that this therapeutic modality cold be helpful for cardiovascular improvement in the canine species. Exercise and stress are important factors in the development of congestive heart failure. The present study evaluates the influence of exercise upon circulatory function and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in healthy dogs. A placebo or benazepril hydrochloride was administered to four dogs and then heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II (Ang II), aldosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline and urinary aldosterone were measured in the dogs before and after running on a treadmill at 7 km/h for 10 minutes. Benazepril hydrochloride significantly (P o 0.05) decreased ACE (0.9 AE 1.0 U/l) and aldosterone (21.1 AE 16.1 pg/ml) compared with the placebo (4.0 AE 1.5 U/l, 42.9 AE 29.8 pg/ml). Plasma renin activity, Ang II, aldosterone and adrenaline levels increased during exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure significantly (P o 0.05) increased with both placebo and benazepril hydrochloride during exercise, and heart rate and blood pressure did not significantly differ between the two groups. These results suggest that the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise is related to activation of the RAAS and sympathetic nervous system. Therefore, ACE inhibitors might modulate circulatory function and the RAAS during exercise. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has previously been described in British Shorthair cats (BSH), but until now, no reports have been published on how prevalent the disease is within this breed. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of HCM in a large cohort of BSH and to evaluate the effect of gender, weight and age as potential risk factors to presence of the disease. The study was conducted as a prospective study including all BSH presented at the Small Animal Hospital for HCM screening in the period of April 2006-August 2009. All cats were examined by the same two trained ultrasonographers using a Vivid 7 ultrasonographic system (GE Medical) with a 10 S phased array transducer (8-10 MHz). Measurements of the left ventricle were obtained by conventional 2D-and M-mode imaging of right parasternal longand short axis views. Diagnosis of HCM was based on an overall assessment of echocardiographic findings, but cats were classified as to have a concentric hypertrophy if the interventricular septum (IVS) and/or left ventricular free wall (LVFW) measured 4 5.5 mm in diastole. To rule out other causes of left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, a complete blood count, biochemical profile, thyroxin level and blood pressure were measured in affected cats. In the statistical analyses occurrence of HCM was expressed as a percentage and age, weight and echocardiographic variables as mean AE standard deviation (SD). A logistic regression analysis was used to test the effect of gender, weight and age on HCM as outcome and a pvalue of o .05 was considered significant. A total of 282 cats were examined, 189 (67.0%) females and 93 (33.0%) males. The average age of the cohort was 40 (AE 29) months and the average weight was 4.5 (AE 1.1) kg. Twenty-three cats (8.2%) were classified as HCM positive, 14 (4.9%) as equivocal and 242 (85.8%) as HCM negative. Three cats (1.1%) were diagnosed with other heart disease and excluded from further analysis. The average diastolic wall thickness of the IVS and LVFW in the HCM affected cats were 7.0 (AE 1.2) mm and 7.1 (AE 2.4) mm, respectively. In the HCM negative group the corresponding measurements were 3.9 (AE 0.5) mm and 3.8 (AE 0.5) mm. Male cats had a significantly higher occurrence of HCM (20.4%) compared with the females (2.1 %) corresponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 12.7 (95 % CI 4.2-38.6) for male gender (p o 0.001). No effect of weight and age on presence of HCM could be identified. Eighteen of the HCM positive cats had diffuse, symmetric hypertrophic changes of the entire left ventricle, whereas 5 had an asymmetric or regional hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium. The conclusion of this study is that the BSH in our cohort had a high occurrence of HCM. Most affected cats presented with pronounced, diffuse hypertrophic changes affecting the IVS, LVFW and papillary muscles. As in many other breeds, male gender predisposed to development of the disease. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by progressive and irreversible lesions to the nephrons which result in renal failure and, often, in systemic arterial hypertension secondary to the chronic activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the canine species is used as an experimental model for humans, information about cardiac function, compensatory enzymatic activation and biomarkers for myocardial lesion are scarce. The objective of this study was to clinically characterize the hypertensive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in dogs with CKD. For this purpose, 30 dogs, males and females, with a mean age of 10 years and 16 kg of body weight, were distributed into two groups composed of healthy dogs (control -CG, n 5 10) and dogs with CKD of glomerular origin (CKDG, n 5 20). Both groups were evaluated using non-invasive blood pressure measurement, radiographs, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, as well as measurement of cardiac markers as troponin I, creatine phosphokinase-MB (MB-CK) and enzymes as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), aldosterone and renin. Mitral endocardiosis (ME) and obesity are frequently observed in dogs and as in human patients, lower life time expectation and higher sudden death risks can be expected. Researches enrolling predisposed dog breed to develop ME or using experimental induction of mitral insufficiency indicated decrease in parasympathetic tonus. In the same way, obesity in dogs induced by supplementation of rich saturated fat diet seams to impair the autonomic control. Therefore, to verify in natural conditions we evaluated dogs with Ib functional class of endocardiosis or natural morbid obesity using time domain heart rate variability (HRV). Thirty-two mature dogs (10 male; 22 female), with mean weight of 17,8 Kg, were enrolled in the study. The ME group (MEG -5 male; 7 female) and obese group (OG -1 male; 8 female) were compared to a control group (CG -4 males; 7 females) composed by healthy dogs. Electrocardiograms were registered in the same day time (9 to 11am) and environment, using a three channel digital holter recorder. The variables mean NN, SDNN, SDANN, SDNNi, rMSSD and pNN50 were calculated from two hours of revised ECG. All 32 dogs were free from medical therapy, and other diseases associated with ME or obesity. Normality of data was attested by the Anderson-Darling test, and groups evaluated by ANOVA. MEG and OG were compared with CG by the Dunnett test with 95% probability. The mean values of mean NN (CG-570 AE 51 ms/ MEG -580 AE 94 ms/OG -650 AE 130 ms), SDNN (CG -175,6 AE 46,8 ms/MEG -169,5 AE 56,3 ms/OG -192,3 AE 62,4 ms), SDANN (CG -100,5 AE 33,9 ms/MEG -93,8 AE 34,0 ms/OG -100,0 AE 37,9 ms), SDNNi (CG -139,9 AE 40,8 ms/MEG -137,1 AE 40,1 ms/ OG -164,3 AE 58,1 ms), rMSSD (CG -171,4 AE 51,3 ms/MEG -170,5 AE 76,1 ms/OG -222,1 AE 93,6 ms), and pNN50 (CG -44,6 AE 13,7%/ MEG -51,5 AE 15,8/OG -53,95 AE 13,5%) were not statistically different (p 4 0,05) in comparison between the diseased dog groups (MEG or OG) and the healthy dog group (CG). Although small amounts of sudden death in initial stages of ME in dogs are described, possibly involving decrease in parasympathetic activity, our results allowed concluding that the Ib class of ME class had no influence on the autonomic nervous systems. Similarly, the natural morbid obesity in dogs had no effect on autonomic control, refusing the observations of induced obesity. These values should prove useful for future investigation about advanced phases of ME or obesity in this species. Pulmonary edema is the most common complication of congestive heart failure in dogs. Interstitial pulmonary edema, which usually precedes more severe alveolar edema, may not be radiographically detectable. In human medicine, transthoracic ultrasonography is used to detect narrow repetition artifacts, or comet-tail artifacts, that indicate the presence of edema in the lung. The hypothesis of this study is that comet-tail artifacts can be identified using ultrasonography in dogs with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and that these artifacts occur in greater numbers and are more widely distributed in dogs with congestive heart failure than in normal dogs. Transthoracic ultrasonography was performed on a normal group of clinically healthy dogs and a heart failure group of dogs with radiographic and echocardiographic signs of congestive heart failure. Physical examination, two-view thoracic radiographs, twodimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram and heartworm antigen test were performed on all dogs. During ultrasonography, dogs were gently restrained in a standing or seated position. The thorax was divided into 4 quadrants on each side, and video clips and still images of each quadrant were recorded. Distribution, characteristics and number of comet-tails were determined using Qlab software (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA). Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 31 dogs were recruited in the normal group and 6 dogs were included in the heart failure group. Transthoracic ultrasonography was easily and quickly performed on all dogs, with an average examination time of ten minutes or less. Comet-tails were detected in 32% of the normal dogs, with a mean of 2 tails per dog. No statistical association was found between the variables age, sex, side and distribution using a phi correlation coefficient. In dogs with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, comet-tails occurred in greater numbers and were more widely distributed. In severe cases, comet-tail artifacts were so numerous that they became confluent and obscured the borders of the pleura. The presence of artifacts was consistent with the distribution of edema on radiographs. Artifacts are rare and isolated in normal dogs, but numerous and widely distributed in dogs with congestive heart failure, as has been described in human patients. Further studies are needed to determine if the number and distribution of comet-tail artifacts in dogs with pulmonary edema correlates with the severity of clinical and radiographic signs. Thoracic ultrasonography is a fast, easy, and effective method to characterize pulmonary edema in dogs with mitral valve disease. It may provide additional information in combination with traditional diagnostic tests for the assessment of dogs with heart failure, the most important being the detection of early signs of heart failure and monitoring of the response to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of measuring plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations for assessing the severity of degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD) in dogs. Eighty five dogs with MMVD and 16 healthy control dogs were prospectively examined from October 2009 to December 2009. ANP was measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Results of the physical examination and echocardiogram were recorded for dogs with DMVD. ANP was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD (ISACHC Ia: 52.1 AE 45.8, Ib: 78.6 AE 55.5, II: 158.0 AE 132.7, IIIa: 306.7 AE 188.3) as compared with control dogs (12.9 AE 4.0). ANP rose significantly in the groups with progressive heart failure. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.96 (95%CI, 0.93 to 0.99). An ANP concentration 4 15.6 pg/mL could be used to discriminate dogs with DMVD from control dogs with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 81%. In dogs with DMVD, ANP was significantly correlated with heart rate, the left atrium/aorta ratio, and end-diastolic left ventricle internal diameters. The results indicate that ANP rose with an increase in the left heart load. The ANP may be useful for assessing disease severity in dogs with DMVD. The cardiac biomarkers N-terminal-pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro-BNP) and N-terminal -pro-Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro-ANP) have been shown to be of value in the diagnosis of heart disease and heart failure in cats. In humans, it is well known that natriuretic peptides are influenced by factors other than primary cardiovascular disease, including hyperthyroidism. The purpose of this study was to investigate natriuretic peptide concentrations in hyperthyroid cats before and after anti-thyroid treatment and to compare them to normal cats. Hyperthyroid cats were recruited from two first opinion clinics in central London. All cats received a full physical examination, plasma biochemistry, total thyroxine (tT4), PCV and systolic blood pressure (SBP; Doppler technique) measurement. Hyperthyroid cats (tT4 4 55 nmol/l) were treated medically and/or surgically and cats achieving euthyroid status (tT4 o 40 nmol/l) were selected for inclusion in the study. A control population of old (4 9 years) normal euthyroid cats (n 5 21) was also selected. NT-pro-ANP and NT-pro-BNP were assayed retrospectively on stored samples (VETSIGN Feline Cardio-SCREEN proBNP; Guilday Ltd. and proANP (1-98); Biomedica). The sample population was compared to normal euthyroid cats by using a Mann-Whitney test. Spearman's rho was determined to evaluate potential associations between heart rate, tT4, creatinine, SBP and natriuretic peptide concentrations. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare circulating natriuretic peptides and other clinical parameters before and after treatment. Results are reported as median [25 th , 75 th percentile]. Eighty four cats were enrolled in the study. When compared to control euthyroid cats, hyperthyroid cats had significantly higher 369.8] vs. 30 [12.2, 42.2] pmol/L, p o 0.0001) but not NT-pro-ANP concentrations. A significant association was found only between NT-pro-BNP concentration and tT4 (r 5 0.29, p 5 0.01) but not with any other parameter. A significant difference in 369.8] vs. 100.8 [58.5, 248.9 ] pmol/L, p o 0.0001), tT4 (152.7 [91.5, 173.3 vs. 20.6 [4.7, 19.4 ] nmol/L, p o 0.0001), heart rate (200 [190, 240] vs. 180 [160, 192] min À1 , p o 0.0001), creatinine (98.5 [80.05, 120.2] vs. 136.7 [110.5, 161 ] mmol/L, p o 0.0001) and PCV (35 [34, 40] vs. 33 [32, 38]%, p 5 0.002) was found before and after treatment. These findings demonstrate that hyperthyroid cats may have elevated NT-pro-BNP but not NT-pro-ANP concentrations compared to normal cats and that NT-pro-BNP but not NT-pro-ANP concentrations decrease following anti-thyroid treatment. Thyroid status should be taken into account when interpreting circulating NT-pro-BNP concentrations in cats. NT-proBNP plasma concentration is elevated in cats with heart disease and may be useful in detecting asymptomatic disease and in diagnosing congestive heart failure. Variability of NT-proBNP results could affect the diagnostic utility of the test by causing different diagnoses during different time points. We sought to evaluate the 7-10 day variability of plasma NT-proBNP in healthy cats and cats with cardiomyopathy and how this variability affected diagnosis of disease based on a previously proposed diagnostic threshold of ! 100 pmol/L. Two populations of cats were recruited: healthy cats with no heart murmur, hypertension, or significant abnormalities on echocardiogram and cats with echocardiographic evidence of cardiomyopathy (CM). Plasma samples for NT-proBNP assay were obtained at baseline and repeated 7-10 days later. Cats were excluded if their clinical status or medications changed during the study period. The study recruited 51 cats from 2 sites. The median NT-proBNP of the normal group (n 5 38) at baseline (49 pmol/L; range, 49-98 pmol/L) was not statistically different from recheck (49 pmol/L [49-128]; p 5 0.68). In 36 of 38 (95%) healthy cats, NT-proBNP at both sample points was o 99 pmol/L, and in 32 cats (89%) was o 50 pmol/L. The median NT-proBNP of the CM group (n 5 13) at baseline (479 pmol/L [49-1211]) was not statistically different from recheck (421 pmol/L [49-965]; p 5 0.20). In 10 of 13 (77%) cats NTpro-BNP was ! 100 pmol/L at both samples points. In 3 cats (23%) with cardiomyopathy, NT-proBNP measured o 99 pmol/L at both sample points. Diagnoses in these cats were mild focal left ventricular hypertrophy (n 5 2) and excessive left ventricular moderator bands (n 5 1); none had ever experienced clinical signs or required cardiac medication. The difference between the individual NT-proBNP values obtained at the two sampling points was o 10 pmol/L in 70% of cats, 11-100 pmol/L in 13%, and 4 100 pmol/L in 16%. We conclude that 7-10 day variability of NT-proBNP measurements is low and unlikely to confound interpretation of NT-proBNP assay, however, cats with mild disease may demonstrate false-negative values and longitudinal studies in this population are needed. cats have some sort of hypercoagulable state, none have been definitively identified although hyperactive platelets have been one suspected mechanism. The platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) receptor binding of fibrinogen is the hallmark of platelet aggregation regardless of agonist used. The GP IIb/IIIa antagonist abciximab (ReoPro s ) has been shown to improve arterial flow in an in vivo feline model of arterial thrombosis, presumably due to an antiplatelet effect. Concentrations of 5 mg/ml abciximab in vitro achieve 4 80% GPIIb/IIIa receptor blockade in humans and non-human primates. However, to date no study has been published which establishes the concentration of abciximab required to achieve 4 80% GP IIb/IIIa receptor blockade in the cat. The objective of this study was to determine the concentration of abciximab that would result in 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation in healthy cats in vitro and to use this response to identify cats with hyperactive platelets where there was reduced inhibition of platelet aggregation to abciximab. Five healthy, male neutered, client-owned volunteer cats were used for the study. Blood was collected atraumatically from the jugular vein directly into 3.8% sodium citrate to a final ratio of 9 parts blood to 1 part citrate (v:v). Whole blood platelet aggregation was measured with 5 mM ADP and 1 mg/ml collagen as agonists. Maximal platelet aggregation (Ohms) was measured before the addition of abciximab (baseline) and after 10 minutes of incubation with 5 mg/ml, 20 mg/ml, 50 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml abciximab. The samples were also observed during incubation for spontaneous platelet aggregation due to the known possible outside-in signaling of abciximab. For all abciximab concentrations, there were no significant changes noted in platelet aggregation compared to baseline. Spontaneous platelet aggregation was not seen at any concentration of abciximab. Our results suggest that abciximab does not exhibit an antiplatelet effect in the cat even at concentrations 20 fold higher than those identified in humans. This is not unexpected given that abciximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the human GP IIb/IIIa complex. However, our results are discordant with data from an in vivo feline model. This could suggest that abciximab may have antithrombotic effects outside of the inhibition of platelet-mediated effect on blood coagulation. Concerns have been expressed about adverse cardiovascular effects of high-salt diets. The objective of this blinded study was to compare the effects of normal-versus high-salt diets on systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP), ECG, and several echocardiographic and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) variables in aged cats. Twenty healthy neutered cats (10.1 AE 2.4 years old) were included. Following baseline measurements, cats were randomly allocated in 2 groups according to their glomerular filtration rate, sex, age and body weight. One group was fed a high-salt diet (1.30% sodium, 2.27% chloride, 4000 kcal ME/kg) and the other one a control diet (0.35% sodium, 0.70% chloride). Systolic and diastolic ABP, heart rate, myocardial wall thicknesses, shortening fraction, left atrium/aorta ratio, and lastly, radial and longitudinal systolic and diastolic TDI variables assessed in the left ventricular free wall were measured before, and 3 and 6 months after diet implementation. Statistical analysis was performed using a general linear model. All variables were unaffected by the diet. In conclusion, over a 6-month period a high-salt diet has no adverse effects on ABP and cardiac function in aged healthy cats. We previously reported that dogs developed hypercytokinemia after mitral annuloplasty and were in a state of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that could have been alleviated by steroid administration before starting extracorporeal circulation (2008 and 2009 ACVIM FORUM). However, the complication rate of pulmonary edema is often high after mitral annuloplasty whereas the incidence of preoperatively elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) counts is low. Such preoperative inflammation is thought to facilitate postoperative SIRS. The present study assesses the relationship between prognosis and preoperative inflammation in 20 dogs after mitral annuloplasty. Pre-surgical values for WBC, CRP, Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were obtained, and differences in preoperative clinical signs (ISACHC classification), cardiac murmur grade, LA/Ao, WBC, CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 between five dogs that died postoperatively (deceased group) and 15 that survived (surviving group) were determined. Mean age was significantly higher (12.3 AE 1.7 vs. 9.5 AE 1.8 y), and mean body weight was significantly lighter (4.3 AE 1.1 vs. 7.5 AE 2.7 kg) in the deceased, than in the surviving group. Neither WBC nor CRP significantly differed between the groups. Values for IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly higher in the deceased, than in the surviving group (IL6, 197.8 AE 198.1 vs. 4 .3 AE 8.3; IL-10, 29.9 AE 47.3 vs. 2.9 AE 4.6; p o 0.05). These results suggest that besides age, increased IL-6 and IL-10 that indicate preoperative inflammation can help to predict postoperative prognosis. DISEASE. S Yamano 1,2 , M Uechi 1 , K Tanaka 2 , H Harada 1 , Y Ukai 1 , M Nishida 1 , S Kohno 1 . 1 Nihon University, Kanagawa, Japan. 2) Kanie animal hospital, Aichi, Japan. We examined endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) and serum iron levels in 51 dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease (DMVD; Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) stages Ia, n 5 19; Ib, n 5 11; II, n 5 14; IIIa, n 5 7) and15 healthy dogs. Complete blood counts, serum creatinine, EPO, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were measured. Levels of EPO were significantly elevated in dogs with DMVD stages Ib, II and IIIa compared with healthy dogs (20.7 AE 8.6, 21.0 AE 9.2, and 21.5 AE 5.6 vs. 11.7 AE 2.0 mIU/mL; P o 0.05). Hematocrit did not differ between each stage. Red blood cell counts were significantly higher in dogs with DMVD stages Ia and Ib compared with healthy dogs (6.50 AE 0.82 and 6.52 AE 0.52 vs. 5.72 AE 0.67 Â 106/ml; P o 0.05). Hemoglobin was significantly higher in dogs with DMVD IIIa than in healthy dogs (17.8 AE 5.71 vs. 13.9 AE 1.61 g/dl; P o 0.05). Serum iron concentrations were significantly lower in dogs with DMVD Ib than in healthy dogs (121 AE 29.4 vs.73.3 AE 42.6 mg/dl; P o 0.05) and TSAT was significantly lower in dogs with DMVD stages Ib and II than in healthy dogs (29.5 AE 8.11% and 30.6 AE 9.07% vs. 42.4 AE 6.80%; P o 0.05). These results suggest that mitral regurgitation modifies erythropoietin production. Right to left (R-L) shunt concurrent with pulmonary stenosis (PS) may cause an unexpected paradoxical embolism and worsening of cyanosis post balloon valvuloplasty due to augmented tricuspid and/or pulmonary regurgitation. The purpose of the study is to investigate the prevalence of R-L shunt due to patent foramen ovale (PFO) in dogs with PS. Clinical signs, echocardiography and CBC were evaluated in 33 dogs diagnosed with PS. Patent foramen ovale was diagnosed when intravenously injected microbubbles appeared at the left atrial level in PS dogs with intact atrial septum on echocardiogram (bubble-positive dogs). In addition, atrial septum was directly observed in 54 hearts from clinically healthy Beagle dogs who were euthanized due to other experimental purposes. Prevalence of R-L shunt due to PFO was 36.4% (12 out of 33 cases). In contrast, prevalence of PFO in healthy Beagle hearts was 0%. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve and relative thickness of the right ventricle (RVWd/LVPWd) were significantly increased in bubble-positive dogs compared with bubble-negative dogs. None of the dogs with mild or moderate PS (pressure gradient o 80 mmHg, n 5 2) demonstrated R-L shunt. Clinical signs were frequently observed in bubble-positive dogs, although polycycemia was not a common abnormality. Tricuspid regurgitation was observed in 83% of bubble-positive dogs (48% in bubble-negative dogs). Transient worsening of cyanosis was observed in 2 out of 9 bubble-positive dogs immediately after balloon valvuloplasty. Diastolic hypertension due to thickened right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation appeared to be responsible for the occurrence of R-L shunt due to PFO. Juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy (JDCM) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease in the Portuguese water dog causing myocardial dysfunction that typically progresses to heart failure and death prior to four months of age. The autosomal recessive inheritance pattern suggests carrier dogs have 50% reductions in the mutant protein, however these dogs do not exhibit any cardiovascular abnormalities and lead normal life spans. Dobutamine stress testing (DST) can identify the extent of myocardial contractile reserve, and has been utilized to predict systolic function improvement with medical therapy in humans, dogs and mice with dilated cardiomyopathy. This study sought to investigate whether DST could identify subclinical myocardial dysfunction in carrier dogs with the genetic mutation for JDCM and to determine if affected dogs demonstrate reduced contractile reserve prior to development of clinical disease. Thirteen age-matched (mean 8.7 weeks old) juvenile Portuguese water dogs from an existing colony were evaluated including 5 normals, 5 carriers and three affected dogs. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline and at incremental increases of dobutamine infusion ranging from 5-20 mcg/kg/min. Echocardiographic parameters assessed included measurements of left ventricular internal dimensions and wall thickness, flow velocities, as well as systolic and diastolic function parameters. The only absolute variables which were significantly different between normal and carriers were pre-ejection period (PEP)/ejection time (ET) at 10 mcg/kg/min, and ET at 20 mcg/kg/min. Assessment of percentage change in echocardiographic variables at increasing dobutamine rates compared to baseline revealed that normal dogs had a significant response to dobutamine (fractional shortening (FS), heart rate) beginning at 10 mcg/kg/min, while the carrier and affected dogs did not have a significant FS response until 15 mcg/kg/ min. Additionally, FS was lower for affected dogs compared to carrier and normal dogs at 10 mcg/kg/min, but not at other infusion rates. Taken together, these findings suggest contractile reserve is maintained in dogs which carry and dogs which are affected with JDCM. However, compared to normal dogs, carriers and affected animals appear to require a higher dose of dobutamine to demonstrate a comparable increase in FS from baseline. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to present DST findings from normal puppies (all previous studies have reported on adult dogs). DST was capable of identifying affected, subclinical JDCM dogs, but not carriers. Differences between normal dogs and carriers were ex-tremely subtle (and likely not clinically relevant), suggesting the causative mutation affects a protein, which if expressed at 50% normal levels, enables the affected animal to maintain normal cardiac function and a normal response to dobutamine. This finding will be important for researchers who continue to search for the causative mutation. This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics of oral ivabradine (Procoralan), a negative chronotropic drug, in healthy cats after administration of a single dose and repeated doses. Eight healthy female spayed experimental cats were used in this study. Ivabradine (0.3 mg/kg) was administered as a single dose on Day 1, followed by twice daily dosing on Days 2 through 5. Plasma samples were collected at the following time points on Day 1: predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration. Additional plasma samples were collected on Day 4 at pre-dose and 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours after administration. Plasma was collected, frozen and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometrymass (LC/MS/MS). Both, the parent compound (S16257) and its major metabolite (S18982) concentration were measured. Individual plasma concentrations versus time from each cat were used in a noncompartmental analysis using the Phoenix WinNonlin 6.1 software. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimations include C max (60.60 AE 40.15 ng/mL for parent drug and 2.89 AE 1.62 ng/mL for metabolite), CL/F (1.30 AE 0.75 L/hr/kg for parent drug and 21.87 AE 14.03 L/hr/ kg for metabolite), terminal half-life (6.42 AE 1.9 hr for parent drug and 3.29 AE 1.01 hr for metabolite), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 4 to 24 hours (AUC 4À24 ) (183.29 AE 140.05 hr Ã ng/mL for parent drug and 13.88 AE 12.23 hr Ã ng/mL for metabolite). There was no significant difference for C max and AUC 4À24 on day one compared to day four for either parent drug or metabolite. Single and repeated oral doses of ivabradine were clinically well tolerated and resulted in a plasma half-life suitable for 12 hour dosing intervals in healthy cats. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is marked in the dog. There are thought to be central mechanisms originating in the nucleus tractus solitarius and medulla (CNS), and peripheral mechanisms from the pulmonary stretch, intrathoracic pressure, and vascular pressure receptors, all of which affect vagal and sympathetic centers.ą Based on clinical observations during the apneic period of thiamylal anesthesia in dogs that revealed sinus rhythm (SR) and then RSA without respiration, this study was performed to substantiate the derivation of RSA primarily from the CNS. Fifty-one dogs of various breeds and both sexes were studied. Instantaneous heart rate, 2-lead EKG, and thoracic movement were recorded in all animals. Impedance pneumography detected any thoracic movement which might otherwise escape detection. All dogs were sedated with acepromazine (.55 mg/kg) and oxymorphone (.05 mg/kg), after which baseline recordings were taken. All dogs were then anesthetized by IV injection of thiamylal sodium (10 mg/kg over 15 seconds) to produce apnea, and recording was continued. In all 51 dogs before thiamylal anesthesia, RSA was exhibited and consisted of an increase of at least 4 beats per minute associated with inhalation (4-50 bpm, 26.7 AE 40.3 [sd]). Large-chested dogs showed the greatest RSA. In general, amplitude of RSA was reduced in all dogs in plane 4 of stage III anesthesia. Cardiac rate returned to pre-thiamylal levels in all dogs after they resumed breathing. Thiamylal produced tachycardia in all dogs within 21 AE 12 seconds, which reduced rapidly and then progressed to a SR or RSA. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in 17 dogs with 5 exhibiting PVCs and 8 showing bigeminal rhythm. These arrhythmias often lasted longer than the apneic period. Apnea occurred in 42 dogs within 29 AE 19 seconds after induction and lasted from 10 to 105 seconds, with an average length of 37 seconds. Fifteen of these dogs did not exhibit a return of RSA during apnea. Of the resulting 27 dogs who exhibited RSA during apnea, 10 at first had an SR which progressed to RSA in apnea before inspiration occurred. The apneic period was as long as 75 seconds, and RSA during apnea ranged from 15-50 seconds. In summary, thiamylal anesthesia causes apnea by anesthetizing the respiration center, which allows tachycardia and, in some, arrhythmia. As anesthesia waned, tachycardia progressed to a normal SR, then to RSA, then to inspiration. Transition from SR to RSA during apnea and before inspiration strengthens evidence for the respiratory center as the origin of the RSA. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by frequent disorganized atrial depolarizations typically associated with less productive atrial contractions, increased ventricular response rates and decreased cardiac output. In veterinary medicine treatment is most often aimed at decreasing heart rate in order to maximize stroke volume via pharmacologic intervention. Assessment of these therapeutic interventions to control heart rate is most often performed utilizing brief in-hospital electrocardiograms. However, twentyfour hour Holter monitor testing allows assessment of the dogs' heart rate in their normal environments. This study compares inhospital electrocardiography (ECG) and at home 24-hour Holter monitor testing for assessment of heart rates in dogs with atrial fibrillation. Sixteen dogs (9 males and 7 females) diagnosed with atrial fibrillation were assessed over 21 visits for inclusion in this study. Diagnostic and rhythm electrocardiograms were performed followed by an at home 24-hour Holter monitor test for each visit. Results were evaluated to determine minimum, maximum and average heart rates. Average heart rate for in-hospital ECG was calculated over 6 seconds. Structural heart disease was noted in 93.75% of the participants with dilated cardiomyopathy (37.5%) and chronic valvular disease (43.8%) most commonly noted. Patent ductus arteriosus and tricuspid valve dysplasia was noted in one dog each and lone AF was diagnosed in one dog. Four mixed breed dogs, 3 Irish Wolfhounds, 3 Great Danes, and 2 Labrador Retrievers were included. There were one American cocker spaniel, Collie, Doberman pinscher, miniature Schnauzer, and Boston terrier each. The average weight of the dogs was 42.4 kg (6.7-77.3 kg). In-hospital ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation as the lone rhythm diagnosis in 76% of the visits whereas additional significant arrhythmias were noted in 85.7% of Holter tests. Holter reported values were significantly lower than ECG calculated values for the mean minimum (69.5 AE 26.7 bpm vs 111.2 AE 43.1 bpm, p 5 0.01), mean maximum (191.8 AE 28.3 bpm vs 224.24 AE 48.20 bpm, p o 0.001) and mean average (111.4 AE 32.5 bpm vs 166.33 AE 35.1 bpm, p 5 0.001) heart rates respectively. We conclude that Holter monitor testing demonstrates a lower heart rate for dogs with atrial fibrillation in their normal environment compared to in-hospital ECGs. This may have significant implications as it pertains to adjusting drug therapy in these dogs. Utilizing Holter monitor testing in conjunction with in-hospital ECG gives a more complete clinical assessment of dogs in atrial fibrillation. Charles Spaniel and mixed. Median age was 3 years (range, 1-10). Dogs presented for syncope (n 5 4), exercise intolerance (n 5 2), bradycardia (n 5 1). Heart failure was not diagnosed in any dog. Bradydysrhythmias in CP dogs included high grade 2 nd or 3 rd degree atrioventricular block (n 5 6) and sinus bradycardia with 1 st degree atrioventricular block (n 5 1). Ventricular arrhythmias were documented in 4. Outcomes included euthanasia (n 5 4) three of which were cardiac related, sudden death (n 5 1), alive (n 5 1), lost to follow-up 36 months post-pacemaker implantation (n 5 1). Median survival was 12 months (range, 0-36). Dogs with sudden death or euthanasia related to cardiac disease were paced for 5, 12, 36 months. In one dog, the presence of multiform ventricular arrhythmias, troponin I of 17.8 ng/mL and difficulty maintaining capture with a temporary pacemaker led the owner to elect euthanasia prior to permanent pacemaker implantation. Bradydysrhythmias can result in clinical signs requiring pacemaker implantation in CP dogs. Progressive cardiac disease or sudden death are possible outcomes in this population. An ultrasound contrast agent Sonazoid s allows for vascular and parenchymal imaging in the liver and spleen. Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy to differentiate benign and malignant focal liver lesions in dogs. The utility of Sonazoid s for the differentiation of splenic lesions, however, has not been determined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the utility of Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography for the differentiation between benign and malignant focal splenic lesions. In a prospective study, Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography was performed for 29 dogs with focal splenic lesions. Qualitative assessment of the enhancement pattern was performed in early vascular phase, late vascular phase, and parenchymal phase. Histology (n 5 24) or cytology (n 5 5) identified 13 benign and 16 malignant lesions. In the late vascular phase, hypoechoic pattern was significantly correlated with malignancy (P 5 0.001) with a sensitivity of 81.3% [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 65.7-89.5%], a specificity of 84.6% [95% CI, 65.4-94.8%]. In the early vascular phase, hypoechoic pattern was significantly correlated with malignancy (P 5 0.02) with a sensitivity of 37.5% [95% CI, 24.7-37.5%], and a specificity of 100% [95% CI, 84.2-100%]. On the other hand, there was no significant difference between malignant and benign lesions during the parenchymal phase. The detection of hy-poechoic nodule in the early and late vascular phase with Sonazoid s -enhanced ultrasonography was strongly suspicious of canine malignant splenic lesion. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of many systemic diseases, including tumors. Lymphomas comprise one of the most common groups of tumors in cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidant/antioxidant total status and erythrocyte antioxidant defense in cats with lymphoma. Blood samples were obtained from 17 cats with lymphoma, at the diagnosis and without previous treatment and 23 healthy cats (control group). Systemic oxidative status was measured by the analysis of malondyaldehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant status (TAS) was measured by the use of a commercial kit (Randox Laboratories Ltd). In red blood cells hemolysated, were determined reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx), glutathione reductase (GSHr) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), using commercial kits.(Randox Laboratories Ltd). Kolmogorov Smirnov followed by Mann Whitney or T student tests was used to compare the groups. Median of TAS was significantly lower (p 5 0.0039) in cats with lymphoma (1.30 mmol/L) than in healthy cats (1.57 mmol/ L). There was no difference in the MDA between the groups (mean 0.658 and 0.566 mM respectively). Mean of GSH was significantly lower (p 5 0.0337) in cats with lymphoma (24.06 mg/dL) than in healthy cats (31.02 mg/dL). There were no difference in the enzymes GSHpx, GR and SOD. In conclusion cats with lymphoma showed decrease in the total (TAS) and erythrocyte oxidative defense mechanisms, considering that GSH is one of the most important antioxidant. More studies are necessary to verify if this fact may contribute to prognosis and response to the treatment. The relationship between lymphoma, chemotherapy, and oxidative stress in dogs is poorly understood. The effects of doxorubicin (DOX) are in part due to oxidative damage, and this drug is commonly used in protocols for the treatment of canine lymphoma. With the use of thiobarbituric acid-reducing substances (TBARS) as a measure of oxidation and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) as a measure of antioxidant capacity, the purpose of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress (TEAC/TBARS) in dogs with lymphoma before and after administration of DOX, compared with healthy controls. In this prospective, case-controlled study, TBARS and TEAC were measured in 14 dogs with lymphoma before and 5, 60, 120 minutes, and 2 weeks after treatment with DOX. Results were compared with those from 13 age, breed, and sex-matched healthy control dogs receiving equivalent volumes of 0.9% sodium chloride instead of DOX. Control dogs had higher mean TBARS (2.31 AE 0.67 mmol/L, range 1.40-4.42) compared to dogs with lymphoma (1.60 AE 0.40, range 0.90-2.71; P 5 0.0002). TBARS values within the lymphoma group (P 5 0.0006) increased over time. There was no difference in mean TEAC between or within treatment groups over time. Healthy dogs had increased measures of oxidation compared to dogs with lymphoma. Following DOX administration, measures of oxidation approached those of the control population. This may be explained by increased oxidation caused by DOX or, alternatively, this trend may represent a movement toward normalcy with treatment. Production of reactive oxygen species is the result of aerobic metabolism for energy production. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidant defense mechanisms in favor of the oxidants. Proteins, lipids and DNA oxidative damage can contribute to aging, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. SOD is an antioxidant enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide to oxigen and hydrogen peroxide, protecting cells from injury induced by free radicals. Lymphomas comprise one of the most common groups of tumors in dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration in dogs with multicentric lymphoma (ML) when compared to healthy dogs. Blood samples were obtained from 24 dogs with ML, at the diagnosis and 20 healthy dogs (control group). Dogs with signs of concurrent disease or that were previously treated with prednisone or chemotherapy were excluded from the study. SOD was measured in red blood cells hemolysated by the use of a commercial kit (Ransod -Randox Laboratories Ltd). Kolmogorov Smirnov followed by Mann Whitney tests were used to compare the groups. Median was significantly lower (p 5 0,0168) in dogs with multicentric lymphoma at the diagnosis (1.751,6 U/g Hb) than in healthy dogs (2.237,3 U/g Hb). In conclusion dogs with multicentric lymphoma showed decrease in erythrocyte SOD concentration when compared to healthy dogs. Further studies are necessary to verifiy if this alteration may contribute to inadequate erythrocyte survival and the development of anemia in canine lymphoma. Alimentary lymphoma is the most common anatomic form of lymphoma in the cat. Our purpose is report a prospective analysis of feline alimentary lymphoma, presenting clinicopathological, therapeutical and prognostic data, from 32 cats with diagnosis of alimentary lymphoma seen at a private Cat Clinic in Sa˜o Paulo -Brazil, from January 2004 to July 2009. All the 32 cats were treated with a combination of L-asparaginase, prednisone and chlorambucil. Response to treatment was defined as either complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or no response (NR). The following variables were evaluated for their effect on response to the treatment and survival times: age, sex, breed, infection or not by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), clinical signs, histologic and immunophenotype classification of the lymphoma and chemotherapy toxicity. Fisher's exact test was used to determine the statistical influence of these factors on the response to the treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival statistics were used to determine overall survival times and Cox regression was used to determine the influences of these variables on the duration of survival time. A P value o 0.05 was considered significant. Diagnosis of alimentary lymphoma was confirmed on the basis of microscopic examination of histologic (n 5 27/84.4%) or cytologic (n 5 5/15.6%) specimens. Sixteen (50%) were classified as lowgrade, 11 (34.4%) as high-grade and 5 (15.6%) as intermediate-grade lymphoma. Immunophenotyping was performed on 10 tumors, 6 (60%) were classified as T-cell lymphoma and 4 (40%) as B-Cell lymphoma. Serological testing for FIV and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was performed in all 32 cats, six cats were FIV -positive and none of 32 cats were FeLV -positive. Four of 6 FIV-positive cats (66.7%) had high-grade lymphoma and 2 (33.3%) had low-grade lymphoma. Historical findings included weight loss (n 5 32/100%), inappetence (n 5 19/59.4%), vomiting (n 5 19/59.4%), diarrhea (n 5 21/65.6%) and polyphagia (n 5 5/15.7%). Twenty-four cats (75%) went into CR with a median remission time of 655 AE 442 days (range 36-2010 days). Five cats (15.6%) achieved PR with a median remission time of 71 AE 43 days (range 35-127 days) and 3 cats (9.4%) had no response to treatment. FIV-negative cats had significantly longer median survival time than FIV-positive cats (687 AE 446 vs 310 AE 240 days, P o 0.05). Also, cats with low-grade lymphoma had longer remission time compared to cats with high-grade lymphoma (684 AE 493 vs 171 AE 158 days, P o 0.05). We can conclude that using a combination of L-asparaginase, prednisone and chlorambucil to treat cats with alimentary lymphoma was safe and resulted in a good outcome in most treated cats of the present study. Moreover, FIV-infection and histologic classification of lymphoma were prognostic indicators for these cats. Lomustine is an alkylating agent in the nitrosourea subclass, and used for relapsed canine lymphoma. However, lack or reduction of its effectiveness has been a problem in the clinical use. In human medicine, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) has been shown to be a cause of drug resistance against the nitrosoureas. The purpose of this study is to assess MGMT activity in canine lymphoma lines in relation to lomustine cytotoxicity. Five canine T-cell lymphoma lines (CL-1, Ema, GL-1, Nody-1 and UL-1) and a human T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat), which has MGMT activity, were used. These lines were exposed to various concentrations of lomustine with or without O 6 -Benzylguanine (BG), an inactivator of the MGMT, pretreatment and the IC 50 values were estimated by a MTT assay. The IC 50 values of Jurkat, CL-1 and Nody-1 against lomustine without BG pretreatment showed 45.0, 4 50.0 and 36.5 M, respectively, but those were significantly decreased by BG pretreatment (18.5, 11.5 and 7.5 M, respectively). In contrast, the effect of BG pretreatment was not observed in Ema, GL-1 and UL-1. MGMT activity was assessed by a fluorometric oligonucleotide assay and was detected in Jurkat, CL-1 and Nody-1, but not in Ema, GL-1 and UL-1. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of MGMT in CL-1 and Nody-1 was more than 100 times higher than that in the other lines. We conclude that MGMT is associated with the lomustine cytotoxicity in canine lymphoma lines. Our results suggest that lymphoma cells possessing MGMT activity may have low susceptibility against lomustine. Leiomyomas are the most common benign tumors of vaginal smooth muscle. Leiomyoma is a round or oval tumor, well defined and encapsulated that occurs as solitary or multiple mass, sessile or pedunculate with intraluminal or extraluminal growth. Research consistently links hormone levels with increased rates of tumors. The estrogen and the progesterone are known promoters of tumor growth by increasing levels of growth factors with mitogenic activity. The cross-reactivity between antibody anti-human estrogen and progesterone receptors with canine estrogen and progesterone receptors makes possible to use human´s kit for the determination of these receptors in dog's tissue. Determining the status of estrogen and progesterone receptors in tumors may be an important tool for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunoexpression of estrogen (ER-a) and progesterone (PR) receptors in vaginal leiomyoma of dogs. Twenty-two samples of histologically-confirmed vaginal leimyomas of bitches in anestrous and late diestrous were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Progesterone serum levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in all 22 dogs to estimate the phase of the estrous cycle. The ER-a and progesterone PR receptors were evaluated by imminohistochemistry using the manufacture´s protocol. Monoclonal anti-ER-a antibody 1D5 (M7047, Dako-Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) at a dilution of 1:50 was used to detect ER, and monoclonal anti-PgR antibody PgR 636 (M3569, Dako-Cytomation) ) at a dilution of 1:50 was used to detect PR. Of the 22 tumors, 15 (68,2%) did not express receptors for estrogen or progesterone and 7 (31.8%) expressed receptors, 1 expressed ER-a (4.54%) and 6 (27.27%) expressed PR. Thus, ER expression was lower than PR expression in vaginal leiomyoma of bitches in anestrus and late diestrus. Considering these results, one can conclude that using antiprogestagens, as a growth tumor inhibitor, in selected cases of vaginal leiomyoma can be promising. The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine differentially expressed genes in canine thyroid tumor samples when compared to normal thyroid tissue using microarray analysis and 2) to use immunohistochemistry (IHC) to confirm differential protein expression of one gene that was greater than 10-fold upregulated via microarray analysis. For gene expression, dogs were prospectively enrolled with informed owner consent if they had a likely diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The affected dogs then underwent a biopsy and a 1 cm 3 piece of tissue was saved in RNAlater for further analysis. Microarray analysis (5 FTC and 4 histologically normal thyroid glands) was performed using the commercially available Affymetrix GeneChip s Canine Genome 2.0 Array. Microarray data were imported into and analyzed using Genedata Expressionist Analyst s . A standard t-test was conducted to compare, for each probe set, the mean expression for the FTC group with that of the normal thyroid using a false discovery rate of q o 0.05 2 . A probe set was considered to be differentially expressed if it had a fold change of 2 or greater, a q-value o 0.05 and had valid expression values for all samples. There were 610 differentially expressed probe sets corresponding to 208 unique genes with characterized proteins. Eight genes had a fold change greater than 10. One of these genes was secreted frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), which was greater than 10 times up-regulated in all tumor samples versus normal thyroid, and was chosen for further analysis (IHC). For IHC, twenty archived samples of thyroid neoplasia were chosen (including 5 samples from gene expression studies) along with 4 normal samples (also from gene expression studies) and analyzed with IHC using goat anti-SFRP2 antibody. All samples were given two separate scores for distribution and intensity of staining. Thyroid tumor samples had significantly higher distribution and intensity scores (p-value o 0.01) than the normal samples, which lacked immunoreactivity for SFRP2. Results of this study indicate that SFRP2 is up-regulated in canine FTCs versus normal thyroid tissue at both the gene and protein level and may play a role in the pathogenesis of this tumor type. L-asparaginase is a bacteria-derived enzyme that is commonly used in the treatment of canine lymphoma. The drug depletes extracellular asparagine, causing rapid apoptosis of malignant lymphocytes unable to synthesize this amino acid. Unfortunately, clinical resistance typically develops after repeated administration. Resistance to this foreign protein may be due in part to the development of antibodies, which can reduce enzyme activity by several mechanisms. We hypothesized that dogs exposed to L-asparaginase during treatment for lymphoma would form circulating antibodies against this chemotherapeutic agent. The objective of this project was to develop an ELISA to detect such antibodies and to analyze the changes in dogs' titers after one or more doses of L-asparaginase. Plasma samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after drug administration. Ninety-six-well plates were coated with L-asparaginase or control antigen (both from E.coli). Following overnight incubation with plasma, antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-dog IgG and IgM antibodies. Titers were measured as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an optical density (OD) greater than two standard deviations above the background OD observed in plasma from naı¨ve dogs. Robust L-asparaginase antibody responses were observed in a majority of canine lymphoma patients that had received multiple doses of the drug. Changes in IgG and IgM titers varied with dose number and with elapsed time after administration. We conclude that circulating L-asparaginase antibodies are detectable via ELISA. In dogs with lymphoma treated with Lasparaginase, the presence of this humoral response may correlate with clinical resistance. Previously Necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME) in Pug Dogs is strongly associated by whole genome scanning and candidate gene sequencing with specific alleles and haplotypes in the DLA class II genes -DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 (K. Greer et al., in press). NME also exists in Chihuahuas and we hypothesized that the same DLA class II genetic association occurs in both Chihuahas and Pug Dogs. DNA from Chihuahuas and Pug Dogs with clinically and histologically confirmed NME was isolated from both fresh and archived paraffin embedded tissues. Healthy Chihuahuas and Pug Dogs with no clinical evidence of NME served as controls. Alleles of DLA-DQB1, -DQA1 and -DRB1 were determined by exon 2 sequencing. We reconfirmed the strong and specific DLA class II allele/haplotype association for NME in Pug Dogs. DLA class II genotyping of the Chihuahuas showed Chihuahuas to have more allelic diversity than Pug Dogs. There was no apparent association between specific DLA class II genotypes or haplotypes and NME in Chihuahuas. Therefore, NME in these two breeds either has no genetic associations in common, or if genetic associations exist, they are outside of the DLA class II genes or at other loci in the genome. The existence of a spectrum of immune encephalitides occurring predominantly in toy breeds, coupled with intense genetic selection for ''toying'', gives credence to the latter scenario. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based technique, which allows precise, non-invasive determination of the brain metabolism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of proton MRS (H 1 MRS) to study the brain of healthy dogs at 3.0 T and 7.0 T and to compare the results of the biochemical composition of the canine brain obtained at both magnetic field strengths. Four healthy male beagle dogs (1.3-3 years, mean 2.3 years) were scanned in 3 T and 7 T human MR scanners (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) under a single anesthetic procedure. The dogs were positioned in sternal recumbency for all data acquired. 3 T exams were conducted with an 8-channel receive-only phasedarray coil operated in quadrature mode, and 7 T with a transmitreceive quadrature coil. A point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence that is suitable for common GABA editing schemes was used. Two PRESS localized single-voxel spectroscopy acquisitions with 1 cm 3 and 8 cm 3 volumes [samples 5 1024; TE 5 35 ms; TR 5 2000 ms, NSA 5 128] were acquired in the canine parietal cortex and cortical-ventricular area, respectively. The spectra were analyzed with the 3DiCSI software. Excitation water suppression was optimized and higher order pencil-beam shimming was used to improve B 0 homogeneity. Results were interpreted by a human physician and a physicist. Information regarding N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr) was recorded for both 3.0 T and 7.0 T. The results obtained in our study show that 4 out of 4 dogs had excellent quality spectra for the small (1 cm 3 ) and large (8 cm 3 ) voxel at 3 T, while only 2 out of 4 dogs had high quality spectra at 7 T due to insufficient water suppression. Our study found that MR spectroscopy in a clinical 3 T scanner using an 8-channel phased array extremity coil is an effective and robust method for the in vivo study of the canine brain, however, 7 T spectra was only successfully acquired in 2 out of 4 dogs. While 3 T appears to be a reliable option for canine spectroscopy, more advanced water suppression techniques would greatly improve the results of canine spectroscopy at 7 T. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in dogs with intervertebral disc disease have been previously described but have not been correlated to surgical findings. The objective of this study was to describe the MRI findings in dogs with surgically confirmed intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and to compare imaging and surgical findings. In a prospective case series, MRI intensity of the spinal cord, and extradural compressive material were graded relative to normal spinal cord and the appearance and distribution of extradural material was described. At surgery the presence and location of fat, disc material and blood were noted. Disc material was described as mineralized or annular, consistency was noted and it was classified as acutely or chronically herniated. Hemilaminectomies were performed on 49 disc spaces. Extradural compressive material was often heterogeneous in intensity and had a variable appearance at surgery. MRI appearance of blood was extremely variable making it difficult to differentiate from mineralized disc material prior to surgery. Assessed type of disc protrusion/extrusion (acute versus chronic) correlated well between MRI and surgical assessment. We conclude that it is difficult to distinguish between mineralized disc material and hemorrhage on MR images following acute disc herniations. However, chronicity of herniation can be predicted from MRI. We hypothesize that MR imaging of spinal plasma cell tumors (PCT) is more sensitive than survey radiography in the detection of solitary and multifocal lesions. A multicenter retrospective case series of 10 dogs with a cytologic or histologic diagnosis of PCT was used to identify the typical MR appearances of this tumor type. Tumoral signal characteristics were examined with a high-field strength MR using T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and T1W post-gadolinium sequences. Other variables evaluated were signalment, clinical signs, disease progression, serum globulin concentrations, radiographic findings, lesion location and presence of spinal cord compression. Radiologic interpretation was blinded with respect to MR imaging findings. Mean age was 12 years (range 9-14). Three of 10 dogs were Labrador retrievers. No sex predilection was noted. All cases presented for paraparesis and 8 dogs showed paraspinal hyperesthesia. Serum globulins in 8 dogs were outside the reference range (2.7-3.8 g/dl) with a mean concentration of 4.6 g/dl (SD 1/À 1.16). Three dogs had focal and 5 dogs had multifocal evidence of axial skeletal osteolysis, while 2 had no identifiable lesions on radiography. All dogs had multiple identifiable spinal lesions on MR studies. All lesions identified on T2W were hyperintense relative to paraspinal musculature. Identified lesions on T1W were hypointense (4/10), isointense (3/10) and hyperintense (3/10). Degree of contrast enhancement in the affected vertebra was variable, with one showing no enhancement. STIR sequences were uniformly hyperintense and identified all lesions visible on radiography and other sequences. Importantly, in all 10 dogs, between two to twelve lesions were identified on STIR that was not seen on radiography. Eight dogs had lesions in the thoracic spine and 7 dogs in the lumbar spine, with none in the cervical spine. Sites deemed safe for biopsy were best identified using MR imaging. All dogs had 1-3 compressive spinal cord lesions not associated with fracture or subluxation, suggesting the presence of intraspinal expansile osteolysis. Compared to survey spinal radiography, MR imaging is a sensitive modality to detect vertebral sites of PCT. Lesion conspicuity is greatest on STIR sequences. PCT can be highly proliferative and expansile, resulting in invasion into the spinal canal. Little is known about the etiology of DAWS. The relative size and shape of the vertebral canal have been proposed as potential risk factors for this disorder. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if selected vertebral ratios, representing vertebral canal stenosis, could be used to differentiate between Doberman Pinschers with and without DAWS. Survey lateral radiographs of the cervical spine of 81 Doberman Pinschers with and 39 Doberman Pinschers without clinical signs of DAWS were retrospectively reviewed. Five measurements were made from the third (C3) to the seventh (C7) cervical vertebra: mid vertebral canal height (VCHm), vertebral body height (VBH), cranial vertebral canal height (VCHcr), caudal vertebral canal height (VCHcd), and vertebral body length (VBL). From these measurements, the following three radiographic ratios were calculated from C3 to C7: canal body ratio (CBR), defined as VCHm/VBH; longi-tudinal ratio (LR), defined as VCHm/VBL; caudal to cranial height ratio (CCHR), defined as VCHcd/VCHcr. The CBR and LR are suggested to represent vertebral canal stenosis. A high CCHR value indicates the presence of a funnel-shaped vertebral canal narrowed cranially in a lateral projection. All measurements were performed by the same person and a second person performed the same measurements on 65 different radiographs to evaluate interobserver agreement. Mean global CBR and LR values for Doberman Pinschers with DAWS were significantly smaller when compared with the same values for Doberman Pinschers without DAWS. For CBR, this was also true for all assessed vertebrae seperately. The CCHR value for C7 was significantly larger in Doberman Pinschers with DAWS. The CBR was significantly smaller in male dogs. The values of the three vertebral ratios were significantly associated with the respective assessed vertebrae. Only the CCHR in Doberman Pinschers without clinical signs of DAWS was significantly influenced by age; each increase of age by one month resulted in an increase of CCHR value by 0.0018. There was a very good interobserver agreement. In conclusion, the results of this study support the hypothesis that the size and shape of the vertebral canal are predisposing factors to develop clinical signs of DAWS. Moreover, our data suggest that Doberman Pinschers with a generalized relative stenosis of the vertebral canal combined with a funnel-shaped vertebral canal at the level of C7 have an increased risk to develop clinical signs of DAWS. Pathology of the cervical discs may result in severe neck pain, thoracic limb lameness and paresis, ataxia, tetraparesis and tetraplegia. The pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration is poorly understood, due in part to a lack of understanding of the histology and micromorphometry of normal cervical discs. The primary goal of this study was to undertake a detailed analysis of the micromorphometry of normal canine cervical discs, including gross structure and distribution of cellular components, and to identify differences between chondrodystrophic (CH) and nonchondrodystrophic (NCH) dogs. All five cervical intervertebral discs were harvested from 4 chondrodystrophic and 4 nonchondrodystrophic dogs which were euthanized for reasons unrelated to this study. All dogs were under 2 years of age, skeletally-mature and free of radiographic abnormalities of the spine. The discs were decalcified in EDTA and two slides from each disc stained with H&E. Slides were scanned using an Aperio ScanScope and examined using ImageScope software. Direct measurements included: width of the dorsal and ventral annulus, width of the dorsal and ventral transitional zone, height and width of the nucleus, number and average width of the dorsal and ventral annular fibers, and nuclear and total disc area. Cells were counted in 1 mm 2 sections of outer and inner annulus fibrosus (AF), transitional zone (TZ) and nucleus pulposus (NP) and categorized according to total number, shape (round or elongate), and grouping (single, paired or clustered.) Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS and significance defined as p o 0.05. The following micromorphomety measurements differed significantly between chondrodystrophic and nonchondrodystrophic dogs: ventral AF width:dorsal AF width (CH: 3.06 AE 1.10, NCH: 1.92 AE 0.96), number of ventral AF fibers (CH: 29.9 AE 6.1 vs NCH: 23.9 AE 44), dorsal AF fiber width (CH: 0.08 AE 0.03 vs NCH: 0.12 AE 0.04), and NP area:total disc area (CH: 17.24 AE 2.56 vs NCH: 25.36 AE 2.94). Cellularity decreased significantly from the outer to inner regions of the disc, while cell grouping (pairing or clustering) increased significantly. Cells in the outer regions were significantly more elongated, while those in the inner regions were significantly more rounded. No differences in any measurement attributable to disc level within the spine were noted. Although the clinical significance of these differences in disc morphometry remains to be determined, the trends in cell distribution and cellular morphology are similar to those reported in humans. Cell clustering is a recognized feature of disc degeneration in hu-mans, and future studies comparing normal with degenerative canine discs would be of interest. Improving our knowledge of normal cervical disc structure and organization will allow us to understand the mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of intervertebral disc degeneration. The aim of this study was to determine the biomechanical characteristics of the canine lumbar spine in flexion and extension following three different internal fixation techniques. 1. Cortical screws and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), 2. SOP TM locking plate system with cortical screws placed bicortically and 3. SOP TM locking plate system with cortical screws placed unicortically. Fifteen canine cadaver lumbar spines from L2-L5 were collected from dogs ranging from 23-36 kg. A fracture was simulated in each lumbar spine at the L3-L4 vertebral space by performing bilateral facetectomies and discectomy. The spines were then stabilized with one of the three fixation techniques and subjected to incrementally increasing flexion and extension bending moments in a 4-pointbending hydraulic machine. Force and displacement were recorded during each loading cycle. Fixation techniques were compared on load to failure, defined as bending or breaking of the implant or to an overall displacement of greater than 1/À 25 mm, which represented a disc space angle of 10 degrees. None of the spines fixed with the SOP plates with bicortically placed screws failed at the stabilized L3-L4 fracture site, but failed either due to fracture of the facets or an endplate of adjacent vertebrae. Four of the five specimens fixed with PMMA failed due to cracking of the PMMA and one failed due to fracture of adjacent facets. The PMMA group had less overall displacement of the entire L2-L5 spine as compared to the other groups; however, further analysis of the biomechanics at the L3-L4 disc space is warranted. Idiopathic Epilepsy (IE) is the one of the most common neurological disease in dogs with a prevalence reported between 1 and 5%. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool in veterinary medicine for the determination and classification of seizures and for the evaluation of cerebral function in patients with intracranial disorders including IE. Based on human studies, first-time short-term EEG (less than 30 minutes) has a diagnostic yield to detect pathological activity between 22 and 25%. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of a single outpatient short-term EEG recording (between 20 and 60 minutes) in detecting pathological activity in dogs diagnosed with IE and to determine whether the ability to detect pathological activity was influenced by the time between the last documented seizure and EEG recording. Twenty-three dogs were included in the study. All dogs suffered from seizure activity (focal and/or generalized seizures) with initial onset between 7 months and 5 years of age. Neurological examinations, CBC, biochemistry profile and brain MRI were normal in all dogs. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of suspected IE was made. Upon presentation, each dog was sedated to effect with propofol (1-6 mg/kg IV) to allow the setting of a canine standardized EEG electrode montage. Using a routine video-synchronized EEG system, all subjects underwent a recording that lasted for a minimum of 20 minutes up to a maximum of 60 minutes. The period of time between the last documented seizure and the EEG recording was categorized as ''acute'' (up to 7 days) or ''chronic'' (greater than 7 days). 22% (5/23) of the recorded subjects presented pathological activity of which 80% (4/5) occurred within the first 20 minutes of recording, whereas the other 20% (1/5) occurred within a 60-minute recording period. Overall, 61% (14/23) of all dogs had EEG recorded within 7 days following the last documented seizure and 39% (9/23) of all dogs were recorded within the ''chronic'' period (after 7 days following the last documented seizure). Of the 5 dogs presenting pathological activity (5/23), 5/5 dogs (100%) were recorded within the ''acute'' phase (less than 7 days). The results of this study suggests that short-term EEG recording is a useful diagnostic tool to detect pathological activity in dogs diagnosed with IE especially when the recording occurs within seven days from the last documented seizure. Sedation with propofol doesn't preclude the detection of pathological activity and it represents an ideal drug to use for initial sedation in canine EEG recording. Long-term video-synchronized EEG recording is a valid diagnostic tool to evaluate epileptic patients for seizure detection and for assessment of treatment during clinical and subclinical Status Epilepticus (SE). Canine epilepsy represents the most common neurological disease in veterinary medicine. Epileptic dogs are commonly affected by generalized and focal seizures. A canine epilepsy monitoring unit (canine EMU) was recently set up at the Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph to monitor epileptic dogs for seizure detection and long-term management of cases refractory to conventional antiepileptic drugs. Two cases out of a broad series of recorded epileptic dogs will be presented to demonstrate practical applications of long-term videosynchronized EEG recording in canine epilepsy. Case 1: ''Mojo'' is an 8 m old MC Chihuahua that was referred to the VTH-OVC neurology service for continuous episodes of head and nose twitching. ''Mojo'' was admitted to the canine EMU for long-term video-EEG recording. A standard montage was used with 11 recording electrodes (subdermal wire electrodes). The electrodes were secured in place with a proper bandage to avoid movements and disconnection. The recording lasted several hours during which ''Mojo'' experienced multiple episodes of head and nose twitching that were electroencephalographically characterized by generalized spikeand-waves activity. A brain MRI was performed on the following day and no structural abnormalities was detected. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of absence-like juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was made and treatment with Phenobarbital was started. Case 2: ''Levi'' is a 2 yo MC French Bulldog that was presented to the VTH-OVC neurology service in focal Status Epilepticus characterized by extreme confusion, foaming, compulsive circling and facial twitching. ''Levi'' was previously diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy and he was treated with Phenobarbital, Potassium bromide, and Levetiracetam. Upon presentation, ''Levi'' was admitted to the canine EMU for long-term video-EEG monitoring and management of focal SE. Constant polyphasic waves and spikeand-wave activity were recorded bilaterally and symmetrically. Treatment with diazepam was started along with repetitive intravenous boluses of Phenobarbital. Since no significant improvement was noted, Propofol infusion was initiated to suppress bursts of pathological cortical electrical activity. Drug dosages were adjusted in accordance to the video-EEG findings that were simultaneously recorded. Despite aggressive treatment with AEDs, pathological cortical electrical activity continued to subsist indicating a poor prognostic factor. Long-term video-synchronized EEG recording performed in an appositely designed canine epilepsy monitoring unit can facilitate the investigation of different aspects of phenomenology of canine seizures including the determination of a seizure versus epileptic-like activity and the source of epileptic activity (''seizure focus''). In refractory epileptic patients or dogs presented with SE, long-term video EEG is essential to monitor subject's response to treatment with different AEDs and to establish a prognosis of successful outcome. Previously presented at the American Epilepsy Society. Intracranial neoplasia is an important differential diagnosis for epileptic seizures in old dogs; however, not all intracranial neoplasias cause seizures. Most intracranial neoplasias do not act as primary seizure foci because they contain no neuronal cells; instead initiation of seizure activity is thought to depend on their effect on the adjacent neuronal tissue. The aim of this study was to identify morphologic features in magnetic resonance (MR) images that may represent risk factors for seizures. Clinical records were searched for dogs that had full clinical history, histopathologically-confirmed intracranial neoplasia, and MR imaging of the brain. Occurrence of features in MR images in dogs with recent development of seizures was compared with those that did not have seizures by means of Fisher´s exact and Mann Whitney test as appropriate. Level of significance was set at P o 0.05. A total of 68 dogs were included in the study (42 with seizures; 26 without seizures). Neoplasias included meningiomas, gliomas, choroid plexus tumors, and metastatic or invasive tumors of extracranial origin. None of these tumor types was associated with a higher risk of seizure development. Dogs that had seizures (median age: 109 months, range: 9-156 months) were older than those without (median age: 89 months, range: 18-132 months) (P 5 0.03). Dogs with neoplasias located within the frontal lobe were more likely to develop seizures (P o 0.01; Odds Ratio (OR) 5 6.79, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5 2.27-20.29), as were those whose neoplasias were associated with frontal lobe (P 5 0.02; OR 5 3.41, 95% CI 5 1.22-9.52) or parietal lobe edema (P o 0.01; OR 5 4.21, 95% CI 5 1.49-11.92). Dogs with subfalcine and/or subtentorial herniation were more likely to develop seizures (P 5 0.02; OR 5 3.57, 95% CI 5 1.28-9.96). A higher degree of enhancement after gadolinium administration was associated with seizures (P o 0.01). Potential risk factors for seizures occurring in dogs secondary to intracranial neoplasia include tumor and/or peritumoral edema affecting the frontal lobe, increased supratentorial pressure, and marked enhancement after gadolinium administration. The cellular origin of an intracranial tumor appears not to be a factor.

The pharmacokinetics of a novel bioadhesive gel formulation of midazolam administered intranasally (IN) were compared to those of parenteral midazolam solution administered IN, intravenously (IV) and rectally. Ten healthy beagles were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups in a crossover design. Parenteral midazolam solution was administered IV to group 1, rectally to group 2, and IN to group 3 (0.2 mg/kg). A 0.2% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose midazolam gel formulation was administered IN to group 4 (0.2 mg/kg). Blood was collected from the jugular vein of each dog into tubes containing lithium heparin before and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240 , and 480 minutes following midazolam administration. The protocol was repeated 4 times with a 7-day wash out period between administrations. Each dog received all 4 forms of midazolam administration. Plasma concentration of midazolam was determined using high performance liquid chromatography. Mean (1/À SD) peak plasma concentrations (C max ) of midazolam were 1.82 (1/À 0.278) g/mL (IV), 0.45 (1/À 0.09) g/L (IN gel), 0.21 (1/À 0.02) g/mL (IN solution) and 0.15g/mL (rectal). The C max following IN gel administration was significantly higher than IN solution and rectal administration (p o 0.0001). Mean plasma concentrations of midazolam following IV administration were significantly higher at 3, 6, 9 and 12 minutes post-delivery when compared to all other methods of delivery (p o 0.0001). Mean plasma concentrations of midazolam following IN gel administra-tion were significantly higher at 6, 9 and 12 minutes post-delivery when compared to IN solution and rectal administration (p o 0.0001). Time (1/À SD) to peak concentration (T max ) was 11.70 (1/À 2.63) minutes (IN Phenobarbital (PB) is currently the drug of choice for seizure management in cats due to its proven efficacy and acceptable sideeffect profile. A subset of cats will not achieve acceptable seizure control with PB alone, necessitating the addition of a second antiepileptic medication. Limited options are available in cats that are refractory to PB. The anti-epileptic drug zonisamide (ZNS) has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in cats. However, no clinical trials have been preformed to account for its efficacy. A retrospective analysis was performed on 5 cats in which ZNS was used to treat refractory seizures. To qualify, cats needed to have clinical features consistent with idiopathic epilepsy, an accurate seizure log for at least 3 months prior to and after ZNS administration, a minimum average of 2 seizures/month and serum PB levels within the therapeutic range. The mean ZNS dose was 11.54 mg/kg/day, range 6.14-17.0 mg/kg/ day. The mean serum ZNS level was 19.44 mcg/ml, range 8.8-38.6 mcg/ml. The reduction in seizure frequency of all five cats was 65.5%. Three of five (60%) cats were classified as responders (4 50% reduction in seizure frequency) with a mean seizure reduction of 95.8%. Side effects consisted of mild lethargy in one cat and decreased appetite in one cat. No changes were noted in serum biochemistry or hemogram values within the 3 months of ZNS treatment. Preliminary results indicate that ZNS is well tolerated and may be a useful therapy for refractory seizures in cats with presumptive idiopathic epilepsy. Seizures are frequently encountered in cats, and there are limited treatment options for this species. Phenobarbital (PB) has long been considered the safest and most effective anticonvulsant for use in cats. Levetiracetam has recently been shown to be a safe and effective add-on to PB for presumed epileptic cats. There are also limited options for pain management in feline patients with suspected neuropathic pain (e.g., feline hyperesthesia syndrome). The purpose of this study was to investigate in healthy cats the pharmacokinetic profile of pregabalin (PG), a new medication (and structural analog of gabapentin), that has shown efficacy as both an anticonvulsant and pain medication in humans, and as an anticonvulsant in dogs. Six healthy adult cats were included in the study. After physical and neurologic examination and minimum database (complete blood count, serum biochemistry, urinalysis), cats were administered one dose of oral PG (4 mg/kg), and serial blood samples were drawn via sampling catheter over a 36-hour period (t 5 0,15,30,60,90,120,180, 240,360,480,720,1440, and 2160 min) . Samples were analyzed via HPLC at a commercial laboratory. Resultant data were used to analyze pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, Tmin, elimination half-life, etc) using commercial software and the PG plasma vs concentration time curves. The following parameters were evaluated (mean AE SD, range): area under the curve (AUC): 133.9 AE 71.5 (99.3-192.0 mg-h/ml), absorption half-life (T 1/2 abs): 0.54 AE 0.44 (0.17-1.38 h), elimination half-life (T 1/2 elim): 10.4 AE 2.6 (8.0-14.3 h), time above suspected minimal therapeutic concentration (2.8 mg/ml): 17.6 AE 6.2 (11.0-27.5 h), maximum serum concentration (C max ): 8.3 AE 1.6 (6.4-10.0 mg/ml), and time until C max (T max ): 2.9 AE 1.2 (1.0-4.0 h). Predicted serum steady-state concentrations (maximum, minimum and average in mg/ml) were calculated for 12 hour (BID) dosing; Css-Max: 16.2 AE5.8 (10.4-23.0), CssMin: 4.9 AE 4.1 (0.3-10.9), and CssAve: 9.5 AE 3.8 (5.9-15.5) and 24 hour (SID) dosing; CssMax: 10.8 AE 3.6 (7.0-16.1), CssMin: 2.5 AE 1.3 (1.4-4.5), and CssAve: 4.8 AE 1.9 (2.9-7.7) intervals. PG at this dose had the resultant side effect of moderate sedation in 4/6 cats and achieved blood concentrations within the range considered efficacious for human seizure control (2.8-8.2 mg/ml). With T 1/2 elim of 10.4 hours, BID dosing would likely be adequate for further clinical trials, which are warranted given the favorable pharmacokinetic profile of the drug. Based on our data, we theorize that a dose of 1-2 mg/kg BID of PG would be a reasonable starting dose in cats. Elevations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate and glucose have been demonstrated following experimentally induced spinal cord trauma. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CSF lactate and glucose levels are altered following acute intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) and to determine if those changes could be correlated with clinical signs and return to function. A prospective study was designed utilizing three patient populations: normal dogs (n 5 10), dogs with acute IVDD (n 5 7), and dogs with neurologic signs unrelated to IVDD (n 5 11). IVDD was confirmed with CT evaluation. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected via cisterna magna puncture in all dogs. Fluid lactate and glucose levels were analyzed within 30 minutes of collection using a common blood gas analyzer (i-Stat s ) and a standard serum chemistry analyzer. All fluid samples were examined and those with cytologic evidence of infectious disease or demonstrating blood contamination (4 300 RBC/ul) were excluded. Groups were compared using ANOVA with p o 0.05 as significant. Glucose was ranked before ANOVA was performed. The IVDD group included dogs with both thoracolumbar and cervical lesions with Grade 2-4 disease. The duration of clinical signs prior to presentation varied from less than 24 hours to two weeks. Dogs with IVDD received variable treatment with steroids prior to presentation. A variety of conditions including neoplasia, inflammatory disease, and idiopathic seizure disorder were represented in the group of dogs with neurologic signs without IVDD. No significant differences in cerebrospinal fluid lactate or glucose levels were observed between the three groups. There are several limitations to this study which may explain the lack of significant findings. D-dimers are degradation products of cross-linked fibrin generated by the action of plasmin and, consequently, specific indicators of fibrinolysis. Plasma D-dimer concentration is a sensitive marker of systemic fibrinolytic activity and it is widely used for the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease in humans and animals. Inflammation and coagulation are interrelated processes that may affect each other. Inflammation leads to activation of coagulation, but coagulation also affects the inflammatory response. The aims of this study were: 1. To assess fibrinolytic activity in the CSF of canine patients affected by different neurological disorders by measuring CSF D-dimer concentrations, 2. To compare CSF D-dimer concentration between different etiological groups, and 3. To determine whether CSF D-dimer concentrations were related to plasma D-dimer concentrations. In addition, pre-and post-treatment CSF D-dimer concentrations were compared in dogs with steroid-responsive meningitis arteritis (SRMA) to determine if this could be a reliable indicator of response to treatment. One hundred and forty CSF samples were collected from 133 dogs. Seven dogs were sampled two times (pre-and post-treatment): 5 SRMA, 1 suspected cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and 1 meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology (MUE). Citrated blood samples were obtained from all dogs at the time of CSF sampling. Following initial CSF analysis, CSF and plasma D-dimer concentrations were detected by a quantitative immunoturbidimetric latex agglutination assay. Dogs were grouped into eleven categories according to the disease process (vascular [mainly ischemic CVAs], idiopathic epilepsy, idiopathic non-epileptic disorder, traumatic CNS disorder, SRMA, MUE, extraaxial neoplasia [mainly meningiomas], intra-axial neoplasia [mainly gliomas], extra-dural compressive spinal cord disorder, degenerative spinal cord disease, and control group [non-neurologic diseases]), and median and range of CSF D-dimer values were calculated. Statistical differences in CSF D-dimer concentrations were found between different groups (p o 0.05), with the highest CSF D-dimer values in the SRMA and the extra-axial neoplasia groups. No relationship was found between CSF D-dimer and plasma D-dimer levels by lineal regression (R 2 5 À0.02). Statistical differences were found between pre-and post-treatment CSF D-dimer concentrations in the SRMA group (p 5 0.016). Results of this study indicate that CSF fibrinolytic activity in dogs can be measured using the D-dimer assay. Diseases such as SRMA and extra-axial neoplasms induce higher concentrations of CSF D-dimers, and CSF D-dimer levels do not seem affected by plasma D-dimer concentrations, which suggest the existence of intrathecal fibrinolytic activity in some inflammatory and neoplastic CNS disorders. CSF D-dimer levels can be a good indicator of response to treatment in cases of SRMA. The underlying etiology and pathophysiology of encephalitis and myelitis in canine patients is usually enigmatic. Cytokines and chemokines are proteins that control the immune response through effects on leukocytes and other immune cells and evaluation of these molecules might provide insight into the mechanisms of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine cytokine and chemokine levels in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of canine patients diagnosed with meningoencephalitis or meningomyelitis of unknown etiology (MUE). A canine-specific, multiplex assay (Milliplex MAP, Millipore) was used to analyze interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (CCL2), interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10 (CXCL10), and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC or CXCL1) in these samples. Compared with control dogs, a number of patients with MUE showed elevations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18, GM-CSF, CXCL1, and CCL2 in serum and IL-2, IL-8, and CCL2 in CSF. These patterns suggest an environment favoring the proliferation and maintenance of lymphocyte populations (including memory cells) in the peripheral compartment (IL-2, -7, -15, CCL2), while promoting lymphocyte proliferation and survival within the CNS (IL-2, CCL2). IL-18 also supports lymphocyte proliferation and has been identified as an important cytokine contributing to CNS inflammation in other species. Serum GM-CSF and CSF CCL2 may help drive monocyte production in the periphery with subsequent recruitment into the CNS of dogs with MUE. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes responsible for maintenance and remodeling of the extracellular matrix throughout the body after cleavage from latent to active form. MMP-2 and -9 in particular have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a variety of disease processes, including tumor invasion and encephalitis. Latent MMP-2 is present in normal canine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but the presence of MMP-9 indicates pathology. This study evaluated levels of active and latent forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the CSF of dogs with CNS disease. Samples of CSF from patients with intracranial meningiomas (n 5 12), gliomas (n 5 5), choroid plexus tumors (n 5 3), lymphosarcoma (n 5 3), and inflammatory CNS disease (n 5 9) along with normal control animals (n 5 6) were evaluated using gelatin zymography. All samples showed bands consistent with latent MMP-2. Active MMP-2 was not detected in any samples. Bands consistent with latent MMP-9 were seen in CSF from patients with meningioma (n 5 1), glioma (n 5 1), choroid plexus tumors (n 5 3), lymphosarcoma (n 5 3), and inflammatory CNS disease (n 5 1). Bands matching active MMP-9 were seen with 1 meningioma, 1 glioma, 1 animal with inflammatory disease, 1 choroid plexus tumor, and 3 lymphosarcomas. Patients with detectable MMP-9 had higher nucleated cell counts in the CSF than those without (P 5 0.0009). This data suggests that MMP-9 may play a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of intracranial tumors and encephalitis afflicting canine patients. Evaluation of MMPs in CSF may prove useful in the diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of patients with intracranial disease. Tumor-immune system interactions are complex. Studies of brain tumors in humans and experimental animals have shown improved survival with immune cell infiltration; however, these tumors may create an immunosuppressive environment that impairs this response. Cytokines and chemokines mediate the immune response through effects on immune cells. The purpose of this study is to examine cytokine and chemokine levels in the CSF and serum of dogs with intracranial neoplasia. Canine-specific, multiplex cytokine/chemokine assays (Milliplex MAP, Millipore) were used to analyze transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb1, -b2, -b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 (CXCL8), IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon-gamma (IFN)-g, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC/CXCL1) in samples from dogs with intracranial meningiomas (n 5 23), choroid plexus tumors (CPT, n 5 6), lymphosarcoma (LSA, n 5 6), and gliomas (n 5 13). Evidence of immunosuppression included CSF TGFb1 elevations in several dogs with gliomas or CPT, a trend towards increased CSF TGFb2 in dogs with tumors compared to control samples, and elevations in serum IL-4 and IL-10 in a few patients. Proinflammatory changes were mainly limited to elevations of serum IL-6 and IL-18 in some dogs. Cytokines associated with lymphocyte survival and proliferation (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) were noted in the serum of a number of dogs with a variety of tumor types. There appeared to be consistent elevations of CCL2 and IL-8 in the serum and CSF of dogs with tumors when compared with controls, which may facilitate immune cell recruitment into the CNS. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disorder characterized by fluid-filled cavitations of the spinal cord leading to parenchymal disruption and generation of severe neurological signs. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (CKCS) breed is overrepresented for this condition with an incidence rate of 50%. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of transcranial magnetic motor evoked potentials (TMMEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), spinal evoked potentials (SEP) and brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) in the assessment of motor and sensory pathways throughout the central nervous system of CKCS dogs with and without SM diagnosed by MRI. Fifty CKCS dogs were evaluated. Neurologic deficits were graded 0-3 (0 5 normal, 1 5 cervical or thoracolumbar pain on palpation, 2 5 cervical or thoracolumbar pain on palpation plus evidence of neuropathic pain, 3 5 ataxia or paresis). TMMEP, SSEP, SEP, and BAER were performed on all dogs under sedation with hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg IV) and acepromazine (0.025 mg/kg IV). Onset latencies (msec) were measured for TMMEP, SSEP and SEP and I-V interpeak latencies were measured for BAER. Dogs were anesthetized for brain and spinal cord MRI (cervical, thoracolumbar, lumbar) including sagittal and transverse T2-weighted images. Transverse T2-weighted image sequences were acquired on all regions of the spinal cord affected with SM to evaluate syrinx measurements (mm 2 ) at maximum size. Based on neurologic score and MRI findings, all dogs were classified into group A (n 5 16) (neurologic abnormalities and MRIconfirmed SM), B (n 5 9) (neurologic abnormalities and no SM), C (n 5 11) (normal neurologic examination and MRI-confirmed SM), and D (n 5 14) (normal neurologic examination and no SM). There were no significant differences observed in the mean latencies of TMMEP, SSEP, SEP and BAER between groups A, B, C and D. However, a significant linear correlation was observed between the severity of neurologic dysfunction and size of the syrinx (p 5 0.017; t-test procedure, SAS) with a larger syrinx being associated with more severe neurologic signs. In conclusion, TMMEP, SSEP, SEP and BAER do not appear to be valuable tests in detecting functional abnormalities of the motor and sensory pathways throughout the central nervous system of CKCS dogs with and without neurological signs secondary to SM diagnosed by MRI. Human brain tumors express heat shock proteins (HSP), which are associated with their degree of malignancy. The up-regulation of HSPs during tumor cell growth helps keep tumor proteins stable and therefore makes them a reasonable target for therapy. The aim of this study was to determine if canine intracranial astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas express HSP 27, 72 and/or 90. An additional aim was to determine whether the expression of the HSPs was associated with Ki67 and/or Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) expression. Ki67 expression and VEGF up-regulation have been strong indicators of cell proliferation and angiogenesis during tumor growth, respectively. Twenty-two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine brain tumors (8 astrocytomas, 2 oligoastrocytomas and 12 oligodendrogliomas) underwent immunohistochemical staining using anti-HSP 27, 72 or 90 antibodies. These tumor samples were also immunohistochemically stained for Ki67 and VEGF expression. Canine mammary carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tissues served as the control samples, as both have previously been shown to express HSPs. Four non-overlapping high power fields of each stained sample were selected and cell staining was analyzed using a semi-quantitative method. All analyses were performed using SAS V 9.2 (Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics of staining percentages were calculated for all tumors tested. Staining percentages were compared between tumor types and tumor type/grade subgroups by the Kruskal-Wallis test. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided and the significance level was a 5 0.05. All three HSPs and VEGF were expressed in all tumor types. For all tumors pooled (n 5 22), there was a positive correlation between HSP27 expression in tumor vessels and Ki67 expression in tumor tissue (r 5 0.46, p 5 0.0307). For astrocytomas (n 5 8) there was a positive correlation between Ki67 and HSP 27 (r 5 0.73, p 5 0.0378). No such associations were found with HSP 72 or 90. No associations were found with any HSP variant when all oligodendrogliomas were grouped together. However, for grade 3 oligodendrogliomas (n 5 7), there were strong positive correlations between Ki67 % and HSP72 % tumor (r 5 0.84, r 5 0.0169), and between Ki67 % and HSP72% (r 5 0.795, p 5 0.0325), and VEGF % and HSP90% (r 5 0.79, p 5 0.0362). In conclusion, HSP expression was demonstrated in canine glial cell tumors. In the case of astrocytomas, the expression of HSP27 was associated with a more aggressive tumor, as noted by Ki67 expression. A similar association was found for aggressive oligodendrogliomas between HSP72 and Ki67. This study suggests that HSPs may have a role in the maintenance of aggressive canine gliomas and potentially represent a novel treatment target. This project evaluated the distribution of three serologically distinct adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors within normal feline brains, to aid in determining the AAV serotype most useful for clinical trials in feline and human gangliosidosis gene therapy. Using convection-enhanced delivery, nine healthy cats received an intrathalamic injection of 6 Â 10 11 genome equivalents of AAV genetically engineered to carry and express b-galactosidase complementary DNA (three cats received AAV serotype 1, three cats received AAV serotype 9, and three cats received AAV serotype 10). One month postsurgery, the cats were euthanized and necropsied. Brain tissue was harvested and frozen for qualitative analysis of b-galactosidase expression measured by fluorogenic enzyme assays and X-gal staining. Additionally, vector distribution was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for AAV vector-specific sequences. Qualitative analysis revealed that AAV serotype 10 produced the highest enzyme activity, but activity was detected over a narrow range compared to AAV serotype 1. AAV serotype 1 produced high enzyme activity over a wider distribution. Additionally, quantitative analysis via qPCR revealed that AAV serotype 1 achieved the greatest transduction. Although superior to a previously tested serotype (AAV serotype rh8), the AAV serotype 9 vector was not as effective as AAV serotypes 1 or 10. No evidence of vector toxicity was detected in any of the treated animals based on behavioral or histopathologic criteria. Based on the hypothesis that AAV serotypes that are efficient across species are most likely to be effective in humans, serotype comparisons were performed in mice and cats. In conjunction with data from mice, the results of this study led to selection of AAV serotype 1 for therapeutic experiments in gangliosidosis cats and for future human clinical trials. Information gained from this study also will be useful for serotype selection to utilize gene therapy to treat feline neurologic disease. Alaskan Husky Encephalopathy (AHE) is an idiopathic, fatal central nervous system disease, reported in 13 dogs. AHE resembles Leigh syndrome in humans, caused by a number of abnormalities affecting mitochondrial energy generation. The goal of this study was to determine if AHE is caused by similar defects. Six dogs with AHE (4 females, 2 males), 6-12 months of age, were examined. All dogs multifocal brain disease; bilaterally symmetrical thalamic, cerebral subcortical, midline cerebellar cortical, and medullary lesions were noted on MRI, and confirmed neuropathologically. Biochemically, no significant abnormalities were found in serum/CSF lactate and pyruvate levels, or in pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity or 2-14 C pyruvate whole cell oxidation in fibroblasts, when compared with controls. Electron transport chain enzyme activities were within normal limits in muscle and liver (complexes I, II, I 1 III, II 1 III, IV and citrate synthase) but a reduction in complex IV and V activity was noted in the cerebral cortex and thalamus compared to controls. Electron microscopy showed significant ultrastructure abnormalities in muscle and liver. Mitochondria were enlarged and pleomorphic (vacant mitochondria, disorganized cristae and concentric whorls). No genetic mutations were present in eleven candidate nuclear and mitochondrial genes known to cause Leigh syndrome in humans. We conclude that there is no evidence to support a systemic defect within the TCA cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, or respiratory chain enzymes as the cause of AHE, but mitochondrial involvement is still indicated, suggesting the disease is unlike any known cause of Leigh Syndrome, and manifests only in certain tissues. ONE YEAR OLD. G. Farace 1 , A. Beardow 1 , S. Forney 2 , K. Yee 2 , J. Allen 2 , SJ. Ettinger 2 . 1 IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME. 2 California Animal Hospital, Los Angeles, CA. Human pediatric studies have shown that Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels can be used to diagnose cardiac disease but that the cut off levels are different from those seen in adults. The aim of this study was to determine if N-Terminal Prohormone Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NTproBNP) concentrations in young dogs ( 1 year old) differ from those of older dogs. The population recruited for the CA-HVSG/IDEXX study was divided between those 1 year old and those 4 1 year old. The groups were then divided into normal dogs without cardiac disease and those with a congenital heart disease; dogs with acquired cardiac disease were not included in the analysis. The 27 normal dogs 1 year old had a mean NTproBNP of 177 pmol/L (12 to 541 pmol/L) while the 133 normal dogs 4 1 year old had a mean of 372 pmol/L (0 to 2429 pmol/L). A Wilcoxon test shows that these two populations are significantly different (p 5 0.0012). Comparing the two congenital groups the 58 dogs 1 year old had a mean of 867 pmol/L (0 to 5123 pmol/L) while the 67 dogs 4 1 year old with a congenital heart defect had a mean NTproBNP of 1251 pmol/L (0 to 8829 pmol/L). There is no significant difference between these two populations when tested with a Wilcoxon test (p 5 0.43). The difference in NTproBNP between dogs 1 and those 4 1 may suggest an age related difference in the normal population. However dogs with congenital heart disease appear to have similar NTproBNP concentrations regardless of age. This finding differs from the human studies. Currently, stereotactic brain biopsies in dogs are performed with a 14 gauge side-cutting needle; however, this procedure is associated with a significant level of morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to reduce the risks involved with this diagnostic technique, the authors wanted to evaluate a larger gauge side-cutting needle. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 14 gauge and 16 gauge side-cutting biopsy needles at four different aspiration pressures for obtaining brain tissues for histopathology in dogs. Twelve dog cadaver brains were used for sample collection. The cerebral cortex was randomly sampled using a combination of two different gauges of needles and four different aspiration pressures. These biopsies were evaluated grossly and with histopathology. The weight, surface area, architecture and degree of tissue artifact for each biopsy sample were evaluated. A total of 96 biopsy samples were obtained (12 samples for each of the 8 combinations). Both the 14 and 16 gauge needles provided adequate tissue for histological interpretation (96-100%). There was a significant relationship between the amount of aspiration pressure and the amount of tissues obtained for both gauges (p o 0.05). However, the amount of aspiration pressure did not affect the degree of tissue artifact for both gauges (P 4 0.05). Overall, we conclude the 16 gauge side-cutting biopsy needle is just as effective as the 14 gauge needle for obtaining brain tissues for histopathology in dogs. Based on Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test, the most effective aspiration pressure for both gauges was 2.0 ml. Hydrocephalus is a common congenital or acquired neurologic condition in dogs and has been managed surgically for several decades. However, there is a lack of data and long term follow up on ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement in dogs with hydrocephalus for which no active cause was identified. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and outcome of VPS treated dogs with hydrocephalus for which no active cause was determined. The clinical records data base at a UK referral hospital was searched from June 2003-2009 to identify dogs diagnosed with hydrocephalus. Dogs were only included in the study if no active, ongoing cause was identified for the hydrocephalus, and who were managed with placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The clinical records of these cases were reviewed to determine the presenting and pre-operative clinical findings, initial post-operative outcome and re-examination findings. Additional follow-up information was obtained by telephone contact with the owners and referring veterinary surgeons. Twelve dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age at onset of signs was 10 months (2-111 months) and the median duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis was 0.36 months (range 0.04-12 months). All dogs presented with signs of progressive forebrain dysfunction, seven with additional vestibular signs and three with multifocal spinal pain. Initial improvement was seen in all cases post surgery. The median time of follow up was 9.5 months (0.5-79 months). Three dogs were euthanised due to deterioration of their neurological signs after 2 weeks, 1 month and 5 months respectively. The only short-term complication reported after their 4 week re-examination was skull and cervical hyperaesthesia (n 5 4). Other complications reported were undershunting due to shunt kinking (n 5 1; 4 months post surgery) and development of seizures (n 5 1; 6 months post surgery). Thus, sustained post-operative improvement was seen in nine dogs, only one of which required revision surgery. In our study, sustained clinical improvement was seen in the majority of VPS treated cases of canine hydrocephalus for which no active underlying cause was identified. VPS placement should be considered for the management of hydrocephalus with no active underlying cause and progressive clinical signs. Neurofilament (NF) is a cytoskeletal protein in axons known to be released into the blood after spinal cord injury (SCI). This characteristic makes NF-H a candidate as a biomarker for SCI. The objective of the study was to observe the time course of NF-H concentration in plasma after different severity of SCI as well as hindlimb locomotive functional recovery. We created mild, moderate, and severe SCI in rats at T11 by MA-SCIS Impactor System. Canine SCI models were made at T13 using silicone balloon catheter compression methods (n 5 2). For two weeks after SCI, ELISA assay was performed to quantify the concentrations of NF-H in plasma. Functional recovery of the hindlimbs was evaluated by use of BBB score in rats and the Olby score in dogs. In rat SCI models, the concentration of NF-H had biphasic peaks at 16 hours and 3$4 days after SCI and declined thereafter in all severity. The overall NF-H concentration and the recovery of hindlimb locomotor function depended on the severity of the injury; the severe group being the worst and the mild group being the best. In canine SCI models, changes of post-injury NF-H levels showed different patterns in 2 dogs; NF-H levels increased sharply after injury with the peak on day-3 in first dog whereas the levels increased slowly with the peak on day-9 in the other dog. Significant motor recovery was not observed in either dog. These findings suggest that measurement of NF-H allows assessment of lesion severity and may aid in judging prognosis of SCI. NF-H is a unique biomarker of SCI and can be used to assess the efficacy of prospective neuroprotective agents in future SCI research. Acute polyradiculoneuritis (AP) is a sporadically occurring peripheral neuropathy of dogs of unknown etiology. A multicenter retrospective study is being undertaken to characterize the clinical disease course and outcome of dogs with AP and to identify prognostic indicators. A total of 86 cases of canine polyradiculoneuritis diagnosed between 1982 and 2009 were identified. Preliminary data analysis including 32 of these cases is reported here. Dogs that presented with an acute development of diffuse lower motor neuron signs and normal cranial nerves were included. Animals presenting for a relapse of a previous polyradiculoneuritis episode or clinical and/or diagnostic features consistent with myasthenia gravis, tick paralysis, botulism, or paraneoplastic neuropathies were excluded. Recorded data included: signalment, concurrent illnesses, vaccination history, raccoon encounters, number of days hospitalized, progression of clinical signs during hospitalization, and electrodiagnostic results. The severity of clinical signs at the time of presentation, rapidity of disease progression, secondary complications, survival to discharge, and clinical outcome were assigned numerical scores. Dogs that died before discharge had more rapid disease progression than those that survived (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, median progression score 1.75, 4.0 respectively, p 5 0.022). There was no significant association between initial disease severity score and outcome. These results suggest that severity of disease at diagnosis is not prognostic in dogs with AP, but that dogs with rapid disease progression are less likely to survive. The cutaneous trunci muscle (CTM) is a thin but extensive sheet of skeletal muscle that covers most of the dorsal and lateral walls of the abdomen and thorax, and is innervated by the lateral thoracic nerve. Nociceptive stimulation of the skin elicits a CTM reflex contraction. This reflex is commonly used to localize spinal lesions, but there is little data available on the CTM reflex in normal dogs. The purpose of this study was to describe the sensory field, contraction strength and latency of the CTM reflex in normal dogs of different breeds and ages. The caudal border of the CTM reflex sensory field was evaluated in 100 dogs aged 2 to 10 years and 50 dogs aged 11 years or older. Hemostatic forceps were used to stimulate the skin two centimeters from the dorsal midline, starting at the level of the seventh lumbar (L7) dorsal spinous process and moving cranially until the CTM reflex was elicited. The border of the reflex was expressed as the corresponding vertebra identified by palpating the dorsal spinous processes. The lateral borders of the CTM reflex were evaluated in 50 dogs and the distance from the midline to the lateral border was expressed as a percentage of the hemi circumference of the trunk at each of four levels (the caudal border of the scapulae, the 13 th thoracic and 3 rd and 6 th lumbar dorsal spinous processes). The mean and median values were calculated. Finally, the strength and latency of ispilateral and contralateral contraction were described at the same four levels. The CTM reflex was elicited in all dogs tested. Its caudal border was at L6 or 7 in 97% (97/100) of the 2 to 10 year old dogs and in 94% (48/50) of the old dogs. The caudal border was at L5 in three of the 2 to 10 year old dogs and at L1 and L3 in two old dogs. The lateral field of the CTM reflex occupied more than 50% of the hemi circumference of the trunk at each level tested, and was bilaterally symmetrical. The median percentage was 70% at the level of the scapulae, and it decreased caudally to 53% at the level of L6. The CTM contraction was more intense when the skin was pinched in the thoracic and cranial lumbar area than in the mid and caudal lumbar area in all dogs. There was no delay in response on the ipsilateral side, while the controlateral response was weaker than the ipsilateral response and occurred simultaneously or slightly later. The CTM reflex is reliably elicited from L6/7 cranially in the majority of dogs although the caudal border of the reflex lay in the mid to cranial lumbar spine in two older dogs. The lateral borders of the CTM reflex extend further ventrally than previously believed; the dorsal cutaneous branches of the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves provide the afferent arm of the CTM reflex and are reported to supply the dorsal third of the thorax and abdomen only. We conclude that either the sensory field of these cutaneous nerves is larger than believed, or that the lateral cutaneous nerves also contribute to the CTM reflex. This description of the normal CTM reflex provides baseline data for studies of the abnormal CTM reflex in dogs with thoracolumbar myelopathies. Acute intervertebral disc herniations occur most commonly between the eleventh thoracic and second lumbar vertebrae. Lesions in this location cause the caudal border of the cutaneous trunci reflex (CTMR) to advance cranially. We propose that changes in the caudal border of the CMTR in the immediate post operative period are predictive of outcome in dogs with acute, severe intervertebral disc herniations. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the CTMR in the post-operative period in dogs that have suffered a severe spinal cord injury due to an acute thoracolumbar disc herniation, and to compare these changes with the outcome. The caudal border of the CTMR sensory field was studied in the immediate post-operative period in 42 dogs with thoracolumbar intervertebral disc herniations, paraplegia and loss of nociception at presentation. All participating dogs had cranial migration of the caudal border of the CTMR at presentation consistent with the localization of their spinal cord injury. The caudal border of the CTMR was assessed using hemostatic forceps to stimulate the skin bilaterally approximately two centimeters from the dorsal midline 24 hr after surgery, and at discharge. A complete neurological examination was repeated a minimum of three months after injury and the outcome of each dog was recorded as successful (voluntary motor present) or unsuccessful (euthanized or paralyzed). Changes in the CTMR caudal border (static, moved caudally or moved cranially) noted in the immediate post-operative period were then compared with the outcome using a Chi Square analysis. Of the 42 dogs recruited, 30 dogs had improved three months after surgery, seven were euthanized because of ascending myelomalacia, and five remained paraplegic. Twenty-four of the dogs (57%) showed caudal movement of the caudal border of the CTMR post operatively. Twenty-two of these 24 dogs (92%) improved neurologically. Overall, the CTMR moved caudally in 73% (22/30) of the dogs that improved. The border of the CTMR moved cranially in 6 of the 7 dogs (86%) that developed ascending myelomalacia. There was a significant difference in outcome in dogs that had changes in the border of their CTMR (moving either cranially or caudally) and in dogs that had no change (p o 0.0001). In the immediate post-operative period, the CTMR is an indicator of neurological recovery in dogs with severe acute intervertebral disc herniations. Caudal progression of the caudal border of the CTMR was associated with improvement in motor function in 92% of cases, whereas a cranial movement of the caudal border of this reflex was associated with the development of ascending myelomalacia in 86% of cases. 90% of affected cats. However, the hyperthyroid state may mask underlying renal insufficiency and rates of subsequent renal disease following I-131 therapy approach 30%. Initial prospective analysis of a population of hyperthyroid cats identified pre-treatment serum creatinine concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR, as determined by nuclear scintigraphy) to be significantly associated with the development of renal disease following I-131 therapy. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was developed for each of the following scores: pre-treatment creatinine concentration, pre-treatment GFR, and a linear combination score using weighted values of creatinine and GFR, i.e. (2.6953)(creatinine) -(0.9617)(GFR). The coefficients in the linear combination were determined by a logistic regression model with the two explanatory variables. Area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity values were calculated for each model. Forty-six hyperthyroid cats were treated with I-131 and 13/46 (28%) were determined to have renal disease following therapy. For cats that developed renal disease following I-131 therapy, mean pretreatment creatinine concentration was 1.29 mg/dl (range: 0.6-2.2 mg/dl) and mean GFR was 2.01 ml/min/kg (range: 1.03-2.8 ml/ min/kg). In cats that maintained normal renal function following therapy, mean pre-treatment creatinine concentration was 0.83 mg/ dl (range: 0.2-1.7 mg/dl) and mean GFR was 2.91 ml/min/kg (range: 1.09-7.41 ml/min/kg). Estimated AUC was highest for the combination model (0.853), followed by the creatinine concentration AUC (0.798) and the GFR AUC (0.769). The Youden index, defined as max (Se1Sp-1), was used to determine the optimal cutoff value for each of the 3 models. In the combination model, a combination score 4 0.7818 (the cutoff value was chosen based on a cat with a pre-treatment creatinine concentration of 1.1 mg/dl and pre-treatment GFR value of 2.27 ml/ min/kg) predicted the development of renal disease with 85% sensitivity and 85% specificity. For the creatinine only model, a pretreatment creatinine concentration ! 1.4 mg/dl predicted the development of renal disease with 77% sensitivity and 76% specificity. In the GFR only model, a pre-treatment GFR value 2.18 mL/min/ kg predicted post treatment renal disease with 85% sensitivity and 73% specificity. The results of this analysis demonstrated the model based on both pre-treatment serum creatinine concentration and GFR afforded the best predictive power for the development of renal disease following I-131 treatment. This model was superior to models that evaluated the variables independently. Hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders in middle aged to older cats. Renal disease may be masked by hyperthyroidism and subsequent I-131 therapy of hyperthyroid cats with subclinical renal dysfunction may precipitate progression to renal failure. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate potential prognostic factors for predicting the development of renal disease in spontaneous feline hyperthyroidism. Fifty-two hyperthyroid cats were evaluated prior to I-131 therapy over a 48 month period. The diagnostic evaluation for all cats included: physical examination, CBC, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, total T4, thoracic radiographs, indirect blood pressure via Doppler manometry, single strand electrocardiography, thyroid scintigraphy with sodium pertechnetate ( 99m TcO4-), and determination of GFR via 99m Tc-Diethyltriaminepentacetic acid nuclear scintigraphy ( 99m Tc-DTPA). Nuclear studies were performed in cats sedated with either midazolam/ketamine or butorphanol. Urine protein excretion was determined by either a urine protein:creatinine (U P:C) ratio if pathologic proteinuria was suspected on routine urinalysis, or urine was tested for the presence of microalbumin (E.R.D. -Health Screen, Heska) if proteinuria was not initially detected. Specific physical examination parameters recorded in all cats included age, weight, breed, gender, and heart rate. Repeat diagnostic testing occurred no sooner than 4 weeks post I-131 therapy whereby all cats minimally had a serum creatinine measurement determined. A diagnosis of renal disease was made on the basis of increased serum creatinine levels (4 1.6 mg/dl) coupled with urine specific gravity when available. Forty-six cats completed I-131 therapy with 13/46 (28%) determined to have renal disease at the time of follow up. Pre-treatment serum creatinine levels were significantly (p o 0.02) associated with the development of renal disease as determined by logistic regression analysis. Mean pre-treatment creatinine concentration for all cats was 0.96 mg/dl (range: 0.2-2.2 mg/dl) and mean post-treatment creatinine was 1.65 mg/dl (range: 0.9-4.1 mg/dl). Pre-treatment GFR was less significantly (p o 0.08) associated with the development of renal disease. Mean GFR for all cats before treatment was 2.65 ml/min/kg (range: 1.03-7.41 ml/min/kg). The predicted chance for renal disease in a cat with a pre-treatment creatinine of 1.6 mg/dl and GFR of 2.25 ml/min/kg was 67%. No other patient factors were significantly associated with the development of renal disease post I-131 therapy. The data of the present study confirms a 30% incidence of renal disease following radioactive iodine therapy of feline hyperthyroidism. Pre-treatment serum creatinine concentration was the variable most highly correlated with a negative outcome of renal disease. We established breed specific reference intervals for serum thyroxine (T4), free T4 using equilibrium dialysis (FT4D), and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations for golden retriever (GR), keeshond (K), Alaskan malamute (AM), Siberian husky (SH), samoyed (SAM), English setter (ES), and collie (C) breeds. Healthy, purebred, fasted dogs one to nine years of age were eligible for enrolment. Intact, neutered or spayed animals were eligible to participate. Female dogs that were in estrus, pregnant, pseudo-pregnant or lactating were excluded, as were dogs on medication known to affect thyroid function. A veterinarian reviewed the health history, performed a physical examination and supervised the interpretation of data from samples collected for a complete blood count, chemistry profile and urinalysis for all dogs prior to thyroid function testing. Nine percent (57 of 621) of T4, and 7% of FT4D measured concentrations were less than the non breed-specific lower limit guideline for our laboratory (13 nmol/L TT4; 8 pmol/L FT4D). Four percent of all measured concentrations of TSH were above the conventional, non breed-specific upper limit (0.6 ng/ml) guideline. By breed, percentage of samples containing less than 13 nmol/L T4 were: K:1.5%, AM:2.1%; collie:5.3%, SAM: 6%; SH:11%; GR: 12%; ES: 26%. For FT4D, the percentage of samples containing less than 8 pcmol/L for each breed was K: 0%; SAM: 0%; C: 4.2%, AM: 6%; SH: 7%; GR: 9%; ES: 25%. Less than 1% of samples had T4 or FT4D concentrations exceeding the non breed-specific reference interval limit guidelines (50 nmol/L T4; 40 pmol/L FT4D). For TSH, the percentages of samples exceeding the standard upper limit (normal o 0.6 ng/ml) were: AM/GR/ES: 0%; SH: 1%; K: 3%; SAM: 10%; collie: 16%. For reference intervals established at the 95% confidence interval level, varibility of 2.5% at each limit is expected in a normal distribution. In this study, 9% of all purebred dogs had T4 values below the lower limit and in the English setter breed, this prevalence reached 25%. The increased prevalence of healthy purebred dogs with T4 and FT4D concentrations less than the conventional reference interval limit suggests the need for breed-specific reference intervals for evaluating thyroid function. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in cats, a form that closely resembles human type 2 diabetes. Its in-cidence rate among cats appears to be increasing, probably due to an increase in obesity and a decrease in physical activity in the cat population. Obesity increases the risk for diabetes 3-to 5-fold. Diabetes can affect cats of all ages, but most cats are over six years of age when diagnosed. Diabetic cats may go into remission and studies have shown that different insulin therapy regimens may have an influence on this. Mechanisms underlying the development of insulin resistance in cats are currently unclear and further investigations are warranted. The objective of this study was to validate an ELISA, optimized for quantitative measurements of feline insulin. The ELISA assay has recently been developed at Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden. The Feline Insulin ELISA is a simultaneous assay with a required sample volume of 10 ml. The incubation time is 120 minutes plus 30 minutes substrate incubation. A validation of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision was conducted for the ELISA. To validate the accuracy twelve feline samples were diluted with calibrator 0 and twelve additional feline samples were spiked with calibrator insulin. Capability of Detection was determined according to the methodology described in ISO11843. Cross reactivity of commercially available analogues was studied. The precision study included both repeatability and reproducibility. The repeatability study was performed with three feline samples, which were analyzed in four replicates at fourteen different occasions in one laboratory. The reproducibility or inter lab comparison was performed at four laboratories, two in Europe and two in North America. One control serum was measured in duplicate in a total of fifteen runs (1-5 runs in each laboratory). The assay range is 5-700 ng/l and the Capability of Detection was determined to be 5 ng/l. Recovery upon dilution was 79-113% (mean 95%) and recovery upon addition was 93-122% (mean 107%). The cross reactivity of glargine was determined to 8.4%, detemir to 0.008%, caninsulin to 57.4%, aspart to 5.9%, lispro to 0.00000002% and glulisine to 0.0000007% No cross reactivity to cpeptide or proinsulin was found. The repeatability study showed an intra and inter assay variation of 4.0% and 7.2%, respectively. The reproducibility study showed an intra and inter assay variation of 3.9% and 9.4%, respectively. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way ANOVA. This novel feline insulin ELISA provides analytical performance, precision and reliability equal to methods currently used in human clinical research. This method enables the performance of additional mechanistic investigations, which may contribute to a more complete understanding of the development of feline diabetes. The diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is based on the detection of ketone bodies in plasma or urine. The objective of this study was to evaluate a portable ketone meter (PKM) for the measurement of HB in peripheral and capillary blood in cats. Moreover, a cut-off value for the diagnosis of DKA should be established. Cats presented between March and November 2009 were included in the study: 11 healthy cats, 23 cats (group 1) with nonketotic diabetes mellitus (n 5 9) and diabetic ketosis (DK, n 5 14) displaying hyperglycemia, glucosuria, and increased fructosamine concentrations without metabolic acidosis (in cats with DK plasma ketone bodies were present). Cats in group 2 (DKA, n 5 15) had ketone bodies and were acidotic. HB concentrations were measured in whole blood by a PKM (Precision Xceed, Abbott GmbH, Germany) and were compared with a spectrophotometric method. In the control cats the HB concentrations were 0 mmol/l with both methods. In cats of group 1 and 2 the median difference between both methods was À0.1 mmol/l (À5.5 to 11.9). The HB values measured by the reference method were higher in 78% of the cases if the PKM values were 4 4 mmol/l. In cats of group 1 HB concentrations were 0 -5.7 mmol/l (median 0.3), in cats of group 2 4.4 -7.4 mmol/l (median 5.4). The PKM is accurate for the quantitative measurement of HB concentrations o 4 mmol/l. A cut-off value of 4 2.3 mmol/l revealed a 100% sensitivity and a 83% specificity to diagnose DKA. Pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism (PDH) is a very common endocrinopathy in dogs, generally caused by an ACTH-secreting corticotroph adenoma although the underline pathogenesis is still unknown. There is a high incidence of PDH in Poodles and familial pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism have been identified suggesting a genetic involvement. An increased CRHR1 expression was demonstrated in human and canine ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas, despite the autonomous ACTH secretion and the low portal levels of CRH. In addition, prolonged exposure of human corticotroph adenoma cells to CRF does not result in receptor desensitization. The aim of the present study was to screen the Crhr1 gene for mutations in genomic DNA from Poodles with PDH. Fifty Poodle dogs (33 female, median age of 8.71 years, range 1.5 to 14 years) with PDH were studied. The diagnosis was based on clinical signs (polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting) and cortisol levels 4 1,4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test, plasmatic ACTH levels 4 17 pg/ml, bilateral adrenal enlargement at abdominal ultrasound, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia, low urinary density. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, amplified by PCR using intronic primers to amplify 13 exons, and submitted to automatic sequence. The coding sequence was compared to the canine Boxer genomic DNA sequence available at NCBI site. We found the heterozygous allelic variation p.V97M (GTG 4 ATG) in exon 4 in one dog. To investigate if this variation is a mutation or a single nucleotide polymorphism, we studied fifty normal poodle dogs (32 female, median age of 9,38 years, range 6-16 years) and p.V97M was not found in one hundred normal alleles. The codon 97 is located in the extracellular aminoterminal domain of the CRHR1 and is extremely important for high affinity ligand binding. The molecular study of the quaternary structure of normal and mutated proteins showed a structural rearrangement of the mutated protein by changing the contact surface between the CRH and its receptor, Crhr1, resulting in a 17% higher binding energy comparing to the wild type. In conclusion, this study identified a Crhr1 gain-offunction mutation, probably responsible for ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism in a poodle dog of our cohort. Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) is a common canine endocrinopathy that results in bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and small breeds are at increased risk for developing PDH. Adrenal thickness (caudal polar width) evaluated by ultrasonographic is an important tool to determine adrenocortical hyperplasia and the current cut-off for PDH diagnosis is 0.75 cm.However, a markedly variability in adrenal thickness has been reported in normal dogs, from 0.2 to 0.7 cm, probably reflecting weight-associated variation. Our aim was to determine the size of the adrenal glands ultrasonographically in normal healthy dogs weighing 10 kg and compare these measurements in dogs with PDH with similar weight. Ultrasonographic adrenal gland evaluation was performed in 50 dogs with PDH (30 females and 20 males) from various breeds (30 Poodles, 7 Teckels, 6 Yorkshires terrier, 1 Maltese and 6 mongrel dogs) and in 109 healthy control dogs. The diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism was based upon the characteristic signs and symptoms, such as polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia, low urinary density and cortisol levels 4 1,4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test. PDH dogs had similar age in comparison with control ones (8.7 AE 2.6 vs. 7.7 AE3.4 y., p 5 0.07), but they were heavier than controls (7.7 AE 1.4 vs. 5.9 AE 2.2 kg, p o 0.001). There was no difference in breed distribution between both groups. There was no difference between left and right adrenal thickness measurements, which was positively correlated with animal weight (r 5 0.41, p o 0.001) and age (r 5 0.364, p o 0.001) in control group but not in PDH group. All dogs with PDH had bilaterally symmetrical normal shape adrenal glands. Adrenal thickness measurement in PDH dogs (0.74 AE 0.12 cm) was significantly greater than adrenal thickness in control dogs (0.5 AE 0.11, p o 0.001). ROC curve analysis suggested that adrenal thickness measurement ! 0.59 cm has the highest accuracy for PDH diagnosis. Using this cutoff 45 (90%) of PDH dogs presented at least one enlarged adrenal, whereas 28/109 (25.7%) of control animals had adrenal thickness 4 0.59 (sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 74%). Using the classical cut-off for adrenal thickness measurement of 0.75 cm, only 24 (48%) of PDH dogs of this cohort will be considered as having enlarged adrenals. In conclusion, our results indicate the need to correlate the thickness of the adrenal glands with the dog's body weight to improve the sensitivity of adrenomegaly detection in PDH dogs. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increases the risk for type 2 diabetes and vascular disease. Pituitarydependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in dogs. PDH, characterized by excessive levels of glucocorticoids, results in increased glucose and insulin levels which cause insulin-mediated effects on adipose tissue, ultimately promoting visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. This group of abnormalities is observed in obese human patients with metabolic syndrome and at least three of these events must occur simultaneously in the same individual to confirm the metabolic syndrome diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in dogs with PDH. Seventy-seven dogs (54 females, mean age of 9.5 AE 2.6 years) from various breeds with untreated PDH were evaluated in the University Guarulhos Veterinary Hospital over a period of 4 years. The diagnosis of PDH was based on clinical signs (polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, abdomen enlargement, panting), cortisol levels 4 1.4 mg/dl after dexamethasone suppression test, bilateral adrenal enlargement at abdominal ultrasound, hyperlipidemia, hyperphosphatasemia and/or low urinary density. The metabolic syndrome investigation was based on measurement of systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose paired with basal insulin levels, serum cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood pressure measurement was conducted in 62 dogs and fasting serum insulin was determined in 35 recent cases. Sixty per cent of the dogs (n 5 37/62) had arterial hypertension with an average systolic pressure of 164 AE 24 mmHg. Elevated blood levels of cholesterol (mean AE SD, 382 AE 155 mg/dl) and triglycerides (181 AE 108 mg/dl) were observed in 74% (n 5 57/77) and 75% (n 5 58/77) of the cases, respectively. Absolute basal hyperinsulinemia (37 AE 27 mUI/ ml) associated to normoglycemia (81 AE 11 mg/dl) was observed in 68.5% (n 5 24/35) of the dogs. All animals with insulin resistance had dyslipidemia (increased blood levels of cholesterol or triglycerides). Hypertension and dyslipidemia was observed in 54.8% (n 5 34/62) of the dogs in addition to visceral obesity. In conclusion, a significant number of PDH dogs of our cohort presented metabolic syndrome, confirming that hypercortisolism shares many characteristics of metabolic syndrome and should always be investigated in order to reduce morbidity and mortality of this endocrinopathy. Considerable evidence suggests that food has a significant impact on the gastro-intestinal (GI) function and the microbial ecology of the canine GI tract. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of dietary carbohydrates and animal-derived proteins with high collagen concentrations on the canine colonic microbiota. An experimental Greco-Latin square design with five healthy Beagles was utilized, feeding high-protein (HP, starch 54 g/kg, crude protein 609 g/kg), high-carbohydrate (HC, starch 438 g/kg, crude protein 194 g/kg), and balanced commercial (BC, starch 277 g/kg, crude protein 264 g/kg) diets for three weeks each. The BC diet was used for the baseline and washout phases, for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. The diets did not affect the body weight and were otherwise tolerated well, except during the HP diet all dogs developed diarrhea. Total fecal bacterial community was assessed by profiling the guanine-cytosine content (%G1C) by 72-hour cesium chloride (CsCl) equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation at 100 000Âg. No major differences between the BC and HC diet groups were observed. Fecal samples from the HP diet had a lower abundance of microbes with %G1C between 33 and 41 when compared to the BC diet samples (p 5 0.003). Moreover, the HP dietary samples contained a shoulder at the %G1C range between 46 and 50, which was completely lacking from the BC diet samples (p 5 0.02). A low %G1C shoulder (range 25-29) was observed to be present with the HP diet and lacking with the BC diet (p 5 0.05). The HP diet also resulted in a lower abundance of microbes with a %G1C between 33 and 40 as compared to the HC diet (p o 0.01). The shoulder peak present in HP diet samples at the %G1C range between 46 and 50 was completely absent in the HC samples (p 5 0.02). In contrast, the HC diet favoured bacteria with %G1C higher than 60 (p o 0.05). In conclusion, significant differences between the HP and HC diets were observed in the average %G1C profiles. The influence of the HP diet on canine fecal microbiota appears to be higher than the HC diet, probably due to the low precaecal digestibility of collagen. The phylogenetic position of the bacteria belonging to the most abundant %G1C peaks and their possible contribution to previously reported changes in fecal volatile fatty acid profiles and the development of diarrhea in the HP diet phase is currently under investigation by advanced sequence analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons. Several recent studies have shown that treatment with protonpump inhibitors may increase the prevalence of infectious disease such as community acquired pneumonia or Clostridium difficile infection in humans. Antacids are also frequently used in dogs. However, their effect on the gastrointestinal microbiota has not been reported in this species. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document the effect of a two-week treatment course with omeprazole on bacterial populations of the stomach and proximal duodenum. Eight healthy adult research dogs (4 males and 4 females) were enrolled into the study. The dogs received an average dosage of 1.1 mg/ kg of omeprazole twice a day for 15 days. The pH of gastric fluid was measured and endoscopic gastric and duodenal biopsies were harvested 30 and 15 days before starting omeprazole, on the last day of treatment, and 15 days after the end of treatment. Biopsies were snap frozen, stored at À801C, and subsequently processed for microbial identification by massive parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Indices of bacterial diversity and species richness were calculated. The proportions of bacterial groups were determined at each taxonomic level. Changes in the pH of the gastric fluid and changes in microbial diversity and composition were compared before and after treatment with Friedman and post-hoc Dunn's tests. Gastric fluid pH was significantly increased (p o 0.01) at the end of the treatment period (median: 7.1; range: 4.2-8.1) when compared to pretreatment values (median: 1.7; range: 1.5-4.4). In the stomach, omeprazole treatment significantly increased the median proportions of the order Lactobacillales (from 0.05% to 0.8%) but these proportions returned to the baseline value 15 days after the end of the treatment. In the duodenum, omeprazole reduced the median proportion of the genus Porphyromonas (from 0.1% to 0.0%), and a rebound increase of the median proportions of Helicobacter spp. was observed 15 days after the end of the treatment period (from 0.0% to 10.6%). The median proportion of the genus Comamonas was also decreased 15 days after the end of the treatment when compared to the pretreatment value (from 0.0% to 0.1%). The indices of bacterial diversity and richness were significantly decreased two weeks after the end of treatment in the stomach but not in the duodenum In conclusion, omeprazole treatment had a significant effect on the gastric fluid pH but overall did not induce major changes in the microbiome in either the stomach or the duodenum. However, the approach used here allows only the assessment of relative changes in the proportions of bacterial groups within the total population. Therefore, significant changes in the total number of bacteria in response to omeprazole treatment may not have been discovered. The role of Helicobacter spp. (H. felis -HF, candidatus H. heilmanni -HH, and H. bizzozeronii -HB) in the pathogenesis of gastric disease in dogs and cats remains poorly understood, whereas in people, gastric colonization by H. pylori is causally associated with gastric mucosal inflammation, ulceration and neoplasia. The epidemiology and major mode of transmission of Helicobacter spp. is still unknown, despite 4 20 years of research, but zoonosis is not considered an important aspect of H. pylori acquisition. Gastric infection with non-H. pylori species has, however, been associated with gastritis and MALT lymphoma in 0.25% to 6.0% of human Helicobacter infections, which suggests a zoonotic risk. This is supported by the recent PCR-based discovery of Helicobacter genus DNA in the saliva and dental plaque of 4 70% of dogs (n 5 27/38). The purpose of this study was to assess the potential risk for dog to human and dog to dog transmission of oral Helicobacter spp. Saliva and dental plaque from 28 pet dogs and endoscopic gastric biopsies from a subset of 8/28 dogs (5 vomiting, 3 healthy) were evaluated for the presence of oral cavity Helicobacter DNA by PCR with Helicobacter genus primers C97 and C05 (yielding 1200 bp 16S rDNA amplicons). The 1200 bp PCR amplicons from the oral cavity and stomach of 8 dogs were cloned using the pGEM s -T Easy vector and introduced into E. coli DH5a. Plasmid DNA from up to 10 clones per sample was sequenced with M13F and M13R primers and sequence identity was determined by comparison to databases at the Ribosomal Database Project and NCBI. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA version 3.1. Helicobacter DNA was detected in the oral cavity of 24/28 dogs. Sequence analysis revealed a predominance of Wolinella succinogenes in 8/8 dogs, representing 91.2% of oral cavity clones. Only 2/8 dogs were positive for oral Helicobacter DNA, with greatest sequence homology to HH and HF. Gastric biopsies were positive for Helicobacter DNA in 8/8 dogs, and sequence analysis was most homologous to HF in 50.8% of clones, HH in 34.9%, and HB in 14.3%. Phylogenetic analysis showed the HH sequences to be clearly distinct from HH Type 1, which is the predominant nonpylori Helicobacter spp. in human infections. Sequences from the stomach and saliva of one dog clustered very closely, suggesting similar strains of HF and HH at both sites. Wolinella-specific PCR of saliva in the other 20 dogs was positive in 16, and in a total of 24/ 28 dogs. In conclusion, W. succinogenes is the dominant Helicobacteraceae in the canine oral cavity, and these findings demonstrate lack of specificity of previously published Helicobacter genus-specific PCR primers. Our results suggest that contact with the oral cavity of dogs is unlikely to be an important source for the transmission of non-H. pylori Helicobacter infections in people. The gastrointestinal microbiota plays an integral role in gastrointestinal health and disease. The prevalence and phylogenetic description of fungal organisms and their role as part of the intestinal ecosystem have not yet been studied extensively in dogs and cats. The aim of this study was to characterize fungal organisms in canine and feline fecal samples using a culture-independent highthroughput sequencing technique. Fecal samples were obtained from a total of 36 cats and 41 dogs of different ages and breeds and living in various home environments. Samples from each species were pooled, with each pool consisting of 6 samples. To evaluate inter-animal differences in the prevalence and phylogenetic composition, fecal samples from 12 healthy dogs were analyzed individually. Genomic DNA was extracted from all pooled and individual samples. Universal fungal primers were used to amplify a part of the fungal ribosomal DNA. The generated amplicons were identified by fungal tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (fTEFAP). A total of 67,461 sequencing tags were analyzed across all samples. Obtained sequences were classified into 6 fungal phyla: Ascomycota (92.8% of all sequences), Basidiomycota (4.3%), Chytridiomycota (2.1%), Neocallimastigomycota (o 1%), Glomeromycota (o 1%), and Microsporidia (o 1%). Within the phylum Ascomycota, Dothideomycetes (35.7% of sequences) and Saccharomycetes (26.7%) were the predominant fungal classes. Further phylogenetic classification revealed 272 different fungal genera and 399 unique phylotypes across all samples. The most commonly observed fungal genera were Catenulostroma and Candida (each identified in 94.7% of dogs), followed by Penicillium (89.5%), Aureobasidium (84.2%), Myrothecium (78.9%), and Bipolaris (78.9%). Fungal sequences were identified in all 12 individually analyzed canine fecal samples (100%). Each of these samples contained multiple fungal phylotypes (median: 40, range: 10 to 92). Remarkable inter-animal differences were observed with each dog harboring a unique fungal profile. While most dogs harbored similar fungal genera, each animal had a very unique species distribution. The most commonly identified phylotypes were Catenulostroma abietis and an unclassified Candida sp. (each identified in 94.7% of dogs). These results indicate the usefulness of culture-independent molecular techniques for the characterization of fungal phylotypes in the canine and feline intestine. These findings further suggest that fungal organisms are a part of the normal intestinal ecosystem in dogs and cats. In this study, each dog harbored a unique fungal profile on the species level. Further studies are warranted to determine the role of fungal organisms in gastrointestinal health and disease. It has been reported that the canine and feline intestine harbors at least 14 different Campylobacter spp., with C. jejuni, C. coli, C. ups-aliensis, and C. helveticus being the most common. To understand the role of the various Campylobacter spp. in the pathogenesis of intestinal disease, methods for their species identification are needed. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and simple molecular assay for detection and differentiation of C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, and C. helveticus, and to evaluate their prevalence in fecal samples from dogs and cats with and without clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed to amplify conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene shared by C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, and C. helveticus on DNA extracted from fecal samples. PCR amplicons were digested with a restriction enzyme (DdeI) and the resulting fragments were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. The four Campylobacter spp. were identified based on their distinct banding patterns. To validate the specificity of the assay, PCR amplicons were verified by sequencing. To test the reproducibility of the method, ten fecal samples were analyzed in four consecutive assays. To evaluate the prevalence of the specific Campylobacter spp., fecal samples were analyzed from healthy dogs (n 5 77) and cats (n 5 33), and dogs (n 5 187) and cats (n 5 138) with clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. The proportions of dogs and cats with or without gastrointestinal signs that harbored Campylobacter spp. were analyzed using a w 2 -test (GraphPad Prism 5.0). Significance was set at p o 0.05. Sequencing results revealed that the obtained banding patterns were specific for each individual Campylobacter species. Reproducible results were obtained in 100% of the repeated assays. Campylobacter spp. were significantly more prevalent in diseased dogs (53/187; 28.3%) compared to healthy dogs (11/77; 14.3%; p 5 0.015). In the positive dogs, C. upsaliensis was the predominant species, identified in 10/11 (90.9%) healthy and 45/53 (84.9%) of diseased dogs. The prevalence of Campylobacter spp. was not significantly different between healthy cats (18/33; 54.5%) and diseased cats (57/138; 41.3%; p 5 0.169). In the positive cats, C. helveticus was the predominant species, identified in 12/18 (66.7%) healthy and 39/57 (68.4%) diseased cats. C. jejuni was identified in only 3/53 (5.7%) diseased dogs and none of the healthy dogs or any of the cats. C. coli was not identified in any of the samples. In conclusion, a rapid and reproducible molecular method for the detection and differentiation of C. jejuni, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, and C. helveticus was developed. The results suggest that C. upsalienis and C. helveticus are commonly present in fecal samples of dogs and cats with or without gastrointestinal signs. In contrast, C. jejuni has a low prevalence and was only identified in a small proportion (3/53) of dogs with gastrointestinal disease. Lactic acid bacteria are commonly part of probiotic formulations as they are thought to have beneficial effects on gastrointestinal health. In vivo colonization properties of probiotics are generally not well understood and may depend on a number of variables. Here we investigated the role of age, body weight, as well as the concentrations of lactic acid bacteria at baseline as predictors for fecal colonization of bacterial species contained in a probiotic formulation (Proviable s , Nutramax Laboratories Inc.) in healthy cats and dogs. Twelve cats (median age: 2.5 years, range: 1-7 years) and twelve dogs (median age: 3.5 years, range: 1-10 years) were enrolled. The median body weight was 4.9 kg (range: 3.8-5.9 kg) for cats and 26.4 kg (range: 5.0-36.8 kg) for dogs. A commercially available multi-species probiotic formulation (one capsule containing a total of 5 Â 10 9 cfu Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. delbrueckii, Streptococcus salivarius, and Enterococcus faecium) was administered daily for 21 days. Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus spp. were assessed by genus specific quantitative real-time PCR before (day 0), during (days 1, 8, and 17 in cats, and days 1, 5, and 17 in dogs), and after (days 26, 29, and 38 in cats, and days 23, 26, and 38 in dogs) probiotic administration. A repeated measures analysis using age, weight, and baseline populations of lactic acid bacteria as possible covariates was modeled by using an appropriate covariance structure using SAS version 9.2. When compared with younger cats, older cats had significantly higher fecal concentrations of probiotic species during the administration period compared to the after administration period for all multiple comparisons. However, this effect was not associated with any particular probiotic bacterial group. Also, cats having fewer populations of lactic acid bacteria at baseline had significantly higher fecal concentrations of probiotic species during the administration period when compared to the after period for all multiple comparisons and for all the bacterial groups analyzed. Unlike in cats, in dogs age and concentrations of lactic acid bacteria at baseline did not influence fecal colonization with probiotic species. Moreover, body weight did not influence the fecal colonization with probiotic bacteria in either dogs or cats. These results suggest that older cats are more likely to be colonized than younger cats by the lactic acid bacteria in the evaluated probiotic. Also, cats that had lower concentrations of lactic acid bacteria at baseline were more likely colonized by these probiotic species. Lastly, fecal colonization with Proviable s species was independent of individual weight (in both cats and dogs) or age (in dogs). Further studies are warranted to corroborate our findings using other probiotic formulations. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances in racing sled dogs during strenuous exercise, the cause of which is unknown. While a recent study has not shown an association between exercise and enteropathogens in sled dogs using bacterial culture, the global intestinal microbiome has not yet been studied. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the intestinal microbiota in fecal samples obtained from racing sled dogs before and after a 300 mile race. To assess the effect of 2 different types of exercise, samples were also obtained from a group of working Retrievers before and after a field trial, during which dogs ran 4.4 miles. Two fecal samples each were collected from 10 sled dogs and 9 Retrievers. Sample 1 was collected prior to, and sample 2 after exercise. For sled dogs, the sampling interval was 3 days, while the Retriever samples were obtained within 1 day. DNA was extracted from all samples, and analyzed by massive parallel 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Diversity of the intestinal microbiota was evaluated by Simpson's diversity. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to explore differences between pre-and post-exercise samples. Percentages of bacterial sequences in each sample were calculated and differences between pre-and post-samples were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Significance was set at p o 0.05. The PCA indicated a difference between pre-and post-exercise samples in the sled dogs, where proportions of Lactobacillales were significantly more abundant in post-exercise samples in 8 of 10 dogs (median (range): 5.8% (1.9-68.1%) vs. 48.1% (14.4-85.7%), p 5 0.027). An unclassified Lactobacillus sp. was found to be significantly more abundant in post-exercise samples in all 10 sled dogs (p 5 0.002). Proportions of Clostridiales were significantly lower in 7 of 10 sled dogs post-exercise (median (range): 85.5% (20.4-95.6%) vs. 48.6% (11.9-84.2%), p 5 0.049). In the Retrievers, Enterobacteriales were significantly more abundant post-exercise in all 9 dogs (median (range): 0.03% (0.00-0.15%) vs. 0.27% (0.02-0.81%), p 5 0.004). Bacterial diversity was significantly higher in post-exercise samples in the sled dogs (p 5 0.026), but not in the Retrievers. These data suggest that strenuous exercise may lead to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A significant increase in Lactobacillales was seen in sled dogs only, which may be due to the duration of exercise and may be related to metabolic changes in the GI tract. It is possible that similar changes were not found in Retrievers because samples for this group were obtained within 1 day, which may be insufficient to show a change in the microbiota. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these changes observed contribute to clinical signs reported in the sled dogs or if they reflect an adaptation to physiological changes within the GI tract that occur during exercise. Tritrichomonas foetus (T. foetus) is a flagellated protozoan parasite that has been recently recognized as an important cause of diarrhea in cats. It primarily colonizes the surface of the distal ileal and colonic mucosa, leading to chronic or intermittent diarrhea. Although many studies have confirmed the existence and pathogenicity of T. foetus in cats in many countries around the world, the history, clinical presentation, and response to treatment have not been described in a large number of naturally infected cats. The aim of this study was to collect and analyze clinical data from cats that were diagnosed with intestinal T. foetus infection. The Gastrointestinal Laboratory's database was searched for the period 2006-2009, and cats that had tested positive for fecal T. foetus were identified. The diagnosis of T. foetus infection was based on detection of the microorganism's DNA in fecal samples, using a previously described PCR assay. The veterinarians who had submitted the fecal samples were contacted and asked to fill out a questionnaire for each infected cat. Information gathered involved signalment, medical history, clinical signs, diagnostics performed, concurrent conditions, and treatment. Questionnaires for 104 cats living in North America were completed. A total of 24 breeds were represented and the median age of the cats was 12 months (range: 1-195 months). The median number of cats per household was 2 (range: 1-50), and 90.1% of the cats were exclusively indoor while 9.9% were both indoor and outdoor. Forty-six (44.2%) cats were females and 58 (55.8%) were males. The most common clinical sign was diarrhea (98.1%) with a median duration of 135 days (range: 1-2,880 days) and a fecal quality ranging from soft (40.9%) to watery (33.0%). Fifty-nine percent of cats had mucus in the feces, 45.5% had hematochezia, 42.9% had tenesmus, and 7% had melena. Forty-nine (59.0%) of 83 cats had diarrhea since adoption. Other clinical signs included anorexia (27.2%), depression (23.5%), weight loss or failure to gain weight (19.8%), vomiting (19.4%), fecal incontinence (14.9%), hyperthermia (13.8%), abdominal pain (8.9%), and increased appetite (2.9%). Fecal flotation had been performed in 85 cases, 3 (3.5%) of which were reported to be positive for coccidia. Of the 67 cats that were tested for Giardia spp., 15 (22.4%) were positive. A total of 49 cats had completed treatment with ronidazole, 29 of which (59.2%) showed clinical response to treatment. Sixteen (32.7%) cats had either partial or no improvement, or a relapse shortly after discontinuation of treatment; 10 (62.5%) of these cats had been treated with dosages of ronidazole of 30 mg/kg, q24h, for 2 weeks (n 5 4) or lower (n 5 5), while one cat had been treated for only 1 week. In 4 (8.1%) cats, the treatment was discontinued due to neurologic signs (n 5 3) and/or anorexia (n 5 3). In this study, diarrhea was the predominant clinical sign of natural intestinal T. foetus infection in cats. Other clinical signs, such as anorexia, depression, and weight loss, were also commonly present. Most treatment failures were associated with the use of lower dosages of ronidazole. An inactivated Giardia vaccine has been used but little is known concerning the impact of this vaccine on the occurrence of diarrhea in naturally exposed puppies. A retrospective cohort study was performed using medical record data from puppies seen at Banfield, The Pet Hospital. Puppies (n 5 6,000) o 6 months of age without gastrointestinal disease seen in the North Central, North East and South Central regions between January 1 st and July 31 st , 2008 were studied. All puppies were administered at least two doses of a distemper, parvovirus and adenovirus 2 containing vaccine (DA2P); two doses of Giardia vaccine were administered to 3,000 of the puppies. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to conduct the analysis and determine likelihood (hazard ratio) for diarrhea and days to diarrhea by Giardia vaccine status. Variables included in the model were Giardia vaccination status, age (at last DA2P vaccine), breed, gender, region, wellness plan status at entry into study, number of encounters after vaccination, concurrent diagnoses/examination findings. In addition, the numbers of puppies that were positive for Giardia cysts or Giardia antigen were compared between groups during the study period. Puppies administered Giardia vaccine were more likely to have diarrhea between 2 months after and within 12 months of vaccination (hazard ratio 5 1.2, 95% confidence interval 5 1.1, 1.5) when compared to puppies without Giardia vaccination. Average days to diagnosis of diarrhea were 132 days for Giardia vaccinates (n 5 464) vs.120 days for non-vaccinates (n 5 303). There were no differences in Giardia cyst or Giardia antigen detection rates between groups. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the canine Giardia vaccine is efficacious in preventing diarrhea or infection with Giardia spp. Analysis of a larger dataset, with a greater number of positive tests, may provide additional evidence. The incidence of endoscopy induced bacteremia has been extensively evaluated in human medicine. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no information available in the veterinary literature about the incidence of bacteremia in dogs undergoing routine endoscopic procedures. Anti-acid medications are frequently used in canine medicine. Studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitor treatment might induce duodenal bacterial overgrowth with oral or fecal type bacteria in humans. We hypothesized that omeprazole treatment would increase the risk of bacterial translocation in dogs. The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence of detectable bacteremia utilizing conventional blood culture techniques following gastroduodenoscopy with multiple biopsies before and after treatment with omeprazole Endoscopy with gastric and duodenal biopsies were performed on 8 healthy research dogs (4 males, 4 females) 30 and 15 days prior to treatment with omeprazole (1.1 mg/kg twice daily), on day 15 of the treatment period and 14 days after the end of treatment. Fifteen endoscopic biopsies were performed in both the stomach along the greater curvature and in the descending duodenum caudal to the papilla. Blood samples were collected using aseptic technique from each dog at the time of anesthesia induction, immediately following the end of the endoscopic procedure and 24 hours following endoscopy. The samples were immediately inoculated into blood culture bottles and monitored for both aerobic and anaerobic growth. A total of 96 aerobic and 96 anaerobic blood cultures were evaluated. There were 2 positive aerobic cultures and no growth was detected in the anaerobic cultures. Lactobacillus sp was cultured from a single sample prior to endoscopy at the end of the treatment period with omeprazole and Staphylococcus intermedius was cultured from a 24 hour post endoscopy sample 2 weeks after the end of the treatment period. Both dogs with positive culture did not show any clinical signs. The overall incidence of bacteremia as detected by positive blood culture following routine gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy in healthy research dogs is low and likely of little clinical significance. Treatment with omeprazole for 2 weeks did not appear to have a significant effect on incidence of bacteremia after endoscopic biop-sies. It is concluded that routine prophylactic antibiotic treatment in dogs undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy is not necessary. Vigorous exercise, such as running a marathon, has been associated with gastrointestinal disturbances in people. Similarly, previous studies have revealed a high prevalence of gastrointestinal abnormalities in racing sled dogs during strenuous exercise. Affected dogs frequently have diarrhea, and up to 61% of dogs develop gastric mucosal erosions and/or ulcers. Increased intestinal permeability has also been demonstrated. The cause of these changes is currently unknown. N-methylhistamine is a stable metabolite of histamine and has previously been shown to be increased in fecal samples from dogs with gastrointestinal disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if fecal concentrations of Nmethylhistamine are increased in sled dogs after a 300 mile race. A group of working Retrievers was also investigated before and after a 4.4 mile field trial to determine if the intensity of exercise would influence the outcome. Two fecal samples each were collected from 10 sled dogs and 10 working Retrievers. The sled dogs had undergone exercise training for several months, but were rested for 2 days prior to the race. In both groups of dogs, sample 1 was collected prior to exercise and sample 2 immediately thereafter. Samples were stored frozen until analysis. N-methylhistamine concentrations were measured using a stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method (control range: 8.5-175.5 ng/g). Pre-and post-exercise Nmethylhistamine concentrations were compared within groups using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between groups using a Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was set at p o 0.05. Median fecal N-methylhistamine concentrations in sled dogs were significantly higher after racing (pre-race: 176.8 ng/g feces; range: 83.3-711.1 ng/g; post-race: 2,405.6 ng/g feces; range: 28.3-5,628.9 ng/g; p 5 0.020). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the median pre-and post-exercise N-methylhistamine concentrations in the Retrievers (pre-exercise: 82.1 ng/g; range: 5.7-304.0 ng/g; post-exercise: 109.5 ng/g; range: 0.0-561.7 ng/g; p 5 0.432). Median fecal N-methylhistamine concentrations were significantly higher in sled dogs vs. Retrievers both before (176.8 vs. 82.1 ng/g; p 5 0.023) and after exercise (2,405.6 vs. 109.5 ng/g; p 5 0.012). These results indicate that strenuous exercise may increase fecal N-methylhistamine concentrations in sled dogs. This increase might be caused by histamine release due to mucosal mast cell degranulation in the gastrointestinal tract. However, it is not clear whether this may contribute to the clinical signs reported in previous studies. It should be noted that breed or population differences between sled dogs and Retrievers could not be excluded and further studies are needed to clarify a potential impact. The lack of a significant change in N-methylhistamine in the Retrievers suggests that mild exercise does not induce gastrointestinal histamine release. Using the canine minimal screening set 2 (MSS-2) and the Affymetrix v2 Platinum canine single nucleotide polymorphism (cSNP) array, serum cobalamin deficiency in the Chinese Shar Pei (Shar Pei) has recently been linked to a genomic region on canine chromosome 13. Based on human and veterinary studies, an increased serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentration has been suggested to reflect cobalamin deficiency at the cellular level. Therefore, the aim of this study was to re-evaluate previous MSS-2 and cSNP array results from Shar Peis with decreased serum cobalamin and increased serum MMA concentrations, and Shar Peis with serum cobalamin and MMA concentrations within the reference intervals. Whole blood and serum samples were analyzed from unrelated Shar Peis. Serum MMA concentrations (reference interval: 415-1,193 nmol/L) and serum cobalamin concentrations (reference interval: 252-908 ng/L) were measured, and genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood. A total of 313 microsatellite markers from the MSS-2 and 49,633 markers of the Affymetrix v2 Platinum cSNP array were evaluated. For statistical analysis of the MSS-2 results, a Fisher's exact test was used with significance set at p o 1 Â 10 À4 . An association analysis toolset (Plink v1.07) for cSNP array analysis and a Bonferroni correction for multiple statistical comparisons were used to evaluate the significance of any potential association. Significance was set at a p-value of o 1.0 Â 10 À6 . Sixty-one Shar Peis were included in this study, with 20 (32.8%) dogs having an undetectable serum cobalamin concentration (o 150 ng/L) and an increased serum MMA concentration (4 1,193 nmol/L). The MSS-2 was analyzed for all 61 Shar Peis. Data from the cSNP array were available for 34 of these dogs, with ten dogs (29.4%) having an undetectable serum cobalamin concentration and an increased serum MMA concentration. Allele 283 of the MSS-2 marker FH3619, located on chromosome 13 (22,877,770 Mb), was found significantly more frequently in Shar Peis with an undetectable cobalamin concentration and an increased MMA concentration (29 of 40 alleles, 72.5%) than in Shar Peis with normal serum cobalamin and MMA concentrations (14 of 82 alleles, 17.1%; p 5 3.2 Â 10 À9 ). Analysis of the cSNP array revealed two significant markers (21,600,902 Mb; p 5 4.1 Â 10 À7 and 22,937,592 Mb; p 5 4.5 Â 10 À7 , respectively) located in close proximity to FH3619 on chromosome 13. In conclusion, the analysis of the MSS-2 and cSNP array revealed one region on chromosome 13 that is significantly associated with undetectable serum cobalamin and increased serum MMA concentrations. The region identified in this study is approximately 5 Mb downstream of a previously identified region associated with this disorder. A METHOD FOR THE QUANTIFICATION OF SERUM AND FECAL CANINE S100A12. RM Heilmann, DJ Lanerie, JS Suchodolski, JM Steiner. Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX. S100A12 is a Ca 21 -binding protein that has been proposed to play a central role in the innate and acquired immune response. S100A12 has been reported to be increased in serum and/or plasma in human patients with various inflammatory disorders and has also been suggested to be a sensitive and specific marker for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in humans. An immunoassay for the measurement of S100A12 is currently available for use in humans, but antibodies against the human protein do not cross-react with canine S100A12 (cS100A12). Given the current lack of both sensitive and specific markers for canine patients with chronic inflammatory diseases, the aim of this study was to develop and analytically validate a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the quantification of cS100A12 in serum and fecal specimens from dogs. Antiserum against purified cS100A12 was raised in rabbits. A tracer was produced by 125 I-labeling of cS100A12. A competitive double antibody RIA was developed and analytically validated by determining assay working range, analytic specificity, dilutional parallelism, spiking recovery, and intra-and inter-assay variability. Control intervals for serum and fecal cS100A12 were established from 29 and 24 healthy dogs, respectively, using the central 95 th percentile. The working range of the assay for serum samples in a 1:20 dilution and for fecal extracts assayed in a 1:800 dilution was 118,654 mg/L and 0.5346.2 mg/g, respectively. There was no cross-reactivity with the cS100A8/A9 protein (calprotectin) complex, the closest structural analogue, over a wide range of the assay. Observed to expected ratios (O/E) for serial dilutions ranged from 97.2-146.8% (mean AE standard deviation [SD]: 122.5 AE 14.9%) for 6 different serum samples at dilutions of 1:12, 1:24, 1:48, and 1:96, and from 72.5-133.3% (mean AE SD: 103.9 AE 14.3%) for 4 different fecal extracts serially diluted from 1:100 to 1:800, four different fecal extracts diluted from 1:200 to 1:1,600, and 2 different fecal extracts diluted from 1:400 to 1:6,400. O/E for spiking recovery ranged from 87.8130.4% (mean AE SD: 100.6 AE 6.5%) for 7 different serum samples and 8 different spiking concentrations, and from 84.8-143.8% (mean AE SD: 103.7 AE 10.6%) for 7 different fecal extracts and 8 different spiking concentrations. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for 7 different serum samples were 1.5, 8.1, 6.3, 4.5, 6.6, 5.7, and 6.2%, and 2.3, 3.8, 5.5, 3.8, 4.2, 6.1, and 7.4% for 7 different fecal samples. Inter-assay CV for 7 different serum samples were 5.6, 5.9, 7.8, 5.8, 5.1, 3.3, and 6.5%, and were 5.3, 5.9, 5.7, 4.0, 2.9, 7.5, and 8.7% for 7 different fecal extracts. The control intervals for serum and fecal cS100A12 were established as 32145 mg/L and 0.51.5 mg/g, respectively. We conclude that the RIA for the measurement of canine S100A12 described here is sensitive, linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible, and will facilitate further studies to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the quantification of S100A12 in serum and fecal samples from canine patients with inflammatory conditions. Canine visceral leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) is very common in Mediterranean countries and Latin America, and is considered an emerging disease in the United States. One of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of canine leishmaniosis is meglumine antimonate (MA), which belongs to the group of pentavalent antimonials. These drugs have been associated with pancreatitis in humans infected with Leishmania spp., and it has been speculated that pancreatitis might also occur as a side effect of MA in dogs. The aim of this study was to measure serum Spec cPL s concentrations in dogs with leishmaniosis during treatment with MA, and to compare them with those of dogs with leishmaniosis not treated with this drug. A total of 36 non-uremic dogs with leishmaniosis, living in Greece, were prospectively enrolled into the study. The diagnosis of leishmaniosis was based on a compatible clinical presentation and positive serology testing (SNAP s Leishmania Test or IFAT) in all 36 dogs, with (n 5 34) or without (n 5 2) microscopic detection of the parasite in lymph-node aspirates. Of the 36 dogs, 25 (Group A) were treated with a combination of MA (Glucantime s ; 100 mg/ kg, SC, q24h; 1 dog was treated with 75 mg/kg, SC, q12h) and allopurinol (Zylapour s ; 10 mg/kg, PO, q12h) for 28 days, while 11 dogs (Group B) were treated with allopurinol alone (10 mg/kg, PO, q12h) for 28 days. Clinical signs were recorded each day by the owner. Blood samples were collected at timepoint 0 (before treatment) and at 14 and 28 days after the initiation of treatment. Serum Spec cPL concentrations were measured in all samples and a concentration of ! 400 mg/L was considered suggestive of pancreatitis. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney and Friedman's tests. A total of 23 dogs (14 in Group A and 9 in Group B) completed the study. Another 7 dogs (6 in Group A and 1 in Group B) had only one follow-up sample. None of the 36 dogs had a Spec cPL concentration ! 400 mg/L or clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis at timepoint 0. In Group A, none of the 19 dogs re-evaluated on day 14, and none of the 15 dogs re-evaluated on day 28 had a Spec cPL concentration ! 400 mg/L. Similarly, in Group B, none of the 10 dogs re-evaluated on day 14, and none of the 9 dogs re-evaluated on day 28 had a Spec cPL concentration ! 400 mg/L. There was no significant difference (p 5 0.344) of the median Spec cPL concentration among the 3 time points for the 14 dogs in Group A that completed the study. Median Spec cPL concentrations for each time point were not significantly different between the two treat-ment groups. No clinical signs suggestive of pancreatitis were observed in any of the dogs treated with MA. In the present study, MA treatment in dogs with leishmaniosis did not result in clinical or biochemical (serum Spec cPL) evidence of pancreatitis. Larger scale studies are needed to determine whether pancreatitis may occur as a rare complication in dogs treated with MA. The exocrine pancreas synthesizes enzymes (e.g., pancreatic lipase) and zymogens of digestive enzymes (e.g., trypsinogen), stores them in zymogen granules, and releases them into the pancreatic duct system in response to gastrointestinal hormones. To measure canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) in small intestinal chyme or fecal extracts in response to varying dietary components such as protein, fat, and carbohydrates, an assay with a high analytical sensitivity is needed. The aim of this study was to analytically validate a previously described radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of cPLI in chyme and fecal extracts from dogs. Chyme and fecal specimens were collected from healthy Beagle dogs with permanent jejunal nipple valve fistulas living in a research colony. Both sample types were extracted according to the protocol for the canine fecal elastase-1 assay (ScheBo s Biotech). A previously described competitive double antibody RIA was used for the measurement of cPLI concentrations in canine chyme and fecal extracts, and was analytically validated by determination of assay sensitivity, dilutional parallelism, spiking recovery, and intra-and inter-assay variability. The analytical sensitivity of the RIA was 11.9 mg/L with a calibration range between 6.3 and 400 mg/L. Chyme and fecal extracts were both analyzed in a 1:2 dilution. Observed to expected (O/E) ratios for serial dilutions ranged from 70.4% to 108.3% with a mean AE standard deviation (SD) of 88.6% AE 10.3% for three different chyme extracts at dilutions of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, and from 80.9% to 115.3% with a mean AESD of 93.8% AE 12.3% for three different chyme extracts at dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16. O/E ratios for serial dilutions ranged from 91.1% to 119.9% with a mean AE SD of 105.6% AE 9.3% for six different fecal extracts at dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:16. O/E ratios for spiking recovery ranged from 85.3% to 120.4% with a mean AESD of 102.5% AE 9.6% for six different chyme extracts and from 78.9% to 167.1% with a mean AESD of 106.2% AE 19.3% for six different fecal extracts in a 1:2 dilution. Intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) for six different chyme extracts and six different fecal extracts were 7.6%, 4.2%, 3.0%, 6.1%, 4.6%, and 2.6%, and 8.6%, 6.6%, 2.8%, 3.1%, 3.8%, and 3.2%, respectively. Inter-assay CVs for six different chyme extracts and six different fecal extracts were 8.9%, 9.8%, 7.1%, 8.1%, 7.7%, and 8.6%, and 8.1%, 7.6%, 6.0%, 4.7%, 8.5%, and 6.8%, respectively. In conclusion, the RIA for the measurement of cPLI evaluated here is sensitive, linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for use with chyme or fecal extracts from dogs. These data will facilitate the measurement of chyme and fecal cPLI concentrations in response to various dietary components. Serum Spec cPL s concentration is considered to be a sensitive and specific marker for pancreatitis in the dog. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate a large population of dogs that had their serum Spec cPL concentration measured and determine whether a breed predilection for having an increased Spec cPL result could be identified. Serum Spec cPL concentration results from dogs whose serum was submitted to the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M University over a 3 year period (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) were evaluated retrospectively. Dogs that had a serum Spec cPL concentration ! 400 mg/ L (considered suggestive for pancreatitis) or a Spec cPL concentration within the reference interval (RI; 200 mg/L) were included, provided that information on the breed, age, and sex was available. Samples with a Spec cPL concentration in the questionable range (between 201-399 mg/L) and breeds with o 15 individuals were also excluded. A total of 16,604 dogs (representing 96 breeds) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 3,482 (21.2%) had a Spec cPL concentration ! 400 mg/L. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare ages between dogs with increased and normal Spec cPL concentrations. A two-sample test of proportion was used to compare proportions of dogs that were male or female within each group. A Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportion of dogs (within each breed) with increased Spec cPL concentrations compared to the total study population (excluding the breed of interest). Odds ratios and their 95% CI were calculated. The P values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate. In dogs where the odds ratio was 4 1, a logistic regression model was fitted to adjust for the differences in age and sex. Models were tested for goodness-of-fit using the Hosmer-Lemeshow w 2 test. Additionally, models were tested for multicolinearity, overdispersion, and interaction between variables. Dogs with Spec cPL concentrations ! 400 mg/L were significantly older (median age: 9 years) than dogs with a Spec cPL in the RI (median age: 6 years; P o 0.0001). There were no differences in the proportion of males vs. females in the dogs with a Spec cPL in the RI (P 5 0.1216), however there were significantly more females than males in the increased Spec cPL group (P o 0.0001). After adjusting for age and sex using logistic regression, 11 breeds had increased odds ratios for having an increased Spec cPL concentration. The top five breeds were Miniature Pinschers (OR: 3.64), Boxers (3.49), Keeshonds (3.24), Pomeranians (2.53), and Eskimos (2.02). These results demonstrate that some breeds have a predilection for having an increased Spec cPL. Many breeds with an increased odds ratio in this study are similar to those reported in previous studies, evaluating breed prevalence for pancreatitis in dogs. Interestingly, three of the top five breeds encompass the group of breeds known as the German Spitzs. Further studies are warranted in dogs with confirmed pancreatitis. While gastrinomas are rarely reported in cats, they should be considered as a possible rule-out in patients with unexplained chronic vomiting, hematemesis, anorexia, weight loss, and/or gastric ulceration. Due to the non-specific clinical signs and the lack of specific tests, diagnosis of gastrinomas in cats remains challenging. Measurement of serum or plasma gastrin is routinely used for the diagnosis of this disease in humans and dogs. The aim of this study was to analytically validate a commercially available immunoassay intended for use in humans for the measurement of gastrin in feline serum samples, and to determine a reference interval for this assay in cats. For the analytical validation of the assay, serum gastrin concentrations were measured using a commercially available immunoassay (IMMULITE s 2000 Gastrin immunoassay, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Ltd., Deerfield, IL) in leftover feline serum samples submitted to the Gastrointestinal Laboratory. Samples with a range of serum gastrin concentrations were selected for validation. The minimum detection limit of the assay was reported by the manufacturer to be 10 pg/dL. Validation of the assay included determination of dilutional parallelism, spiking recovery, and intraand inter-assay variability. To determine the reference interval, fresh serum samples were collected from 20 healthy pet cats. The reference interval was established using the central 95 th percentile in this group of cats after food had been withheld for 12 hours. Observed to expected ratios for dilutional parallelism ranged between 76.2% and 84.9%, with a mean AE SD of 77.9 AE4.9% in three samples (concentrations: 34.9 pg/dL, 49.7 pg/dL, and 63.1 pg/dL) at 1:2 and 1:4 dilutions. Observed to expected ratios for spiking recovery ranged from 98.2% to 112.3% with a mean AE SD of 104.9 AE 5.6% for four samples (concentrations: 13.3 pg/dL, 31.2 pg/dL, 33.0 pg/dL, and 68.8 pg/dL). The coefficients of variation (CV) for intra-assay variability were: 5.9% (13.2 pg/dL mean sample value), 9.8% (19.3 pg/dL), 5.7% (38.8 pg/dL), and 3.3% (54.0 pg/dL). The CV for inter-assay variability were: 5.7% (13.2 pg/dL mean sample value), 6.2% (19.2 pg/dL), 4.1% (39.7 pg/dL), and 4.1% (55.2 pg/dL). The reference interval for feline serum gastrin concentration was established as o 10-39.5 pg/dL. These data demonstrate that the gastrin immunoassay described here is linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible for use in cats. Further studies regarding the clinical utility of this assay for the diagnosis of feline gastrinomas are warranted. For the phenotypical characterization mainly multi-colour staining flow cytometry techniques were used. Full thickness biopsies were taken from healthy adult Swiss Beagle dogs (n 5 7) and compared to endoscopical biopsies from the same dog. These results (healthy controls) were compared to endoscopical biopsies of dogs suffering from CE (n 5 11), which were enrolled into a clinical prospective study. These dogs were grouped according to the success of therapy in a ''food responsive group'' (FRD n 5 7) and an inflammatory bowel disease group (IBD n 5 4).Flow cytometry analyses of the endoscopical biopsies were performed before (n 5 11) and 6-10 weeks after therapy (n 5 10). No significant differences in the lymphocyte subpopulations between lymphocytes isolated from full thickness biopsies versus endoscopical biopsies could be observed. No significant differences could be shown comparing T cell populations from healthy control dogs with dogs suffering from chronic entropathies. However, a significant decrease (p o 0.05) in the percentage of CD41 TCRab 1 IEL in dogs suffering from IBD, compared to healthy control dogs, was found. Furthermore, there was also a significant difference between CD41 TCRab 1 IEL from FRD versus IBD dogs. There was no significant change in the IEL subpopulation in chronic enteropathy dogs, FRD and IBD dogs before and after therapy. In summary, it could be shown that endoscopical biopsies from healthy and diseased dogs can be used for flow cytometrical characterization of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes. These preliminary data indicate that flow cytometry techniques may not only provide a diagnostic tool in the characterization of the subtypes of canine chronic enteropathies but could give also further insights into the pathomechanisms of canine IBD. Constipation and opstipation is commonly seen in cats. In some instances this may be the result of megacolon. Other potential causes include spinal cord disorders, pelvic anatomical abnormalities, foreign body, neoplasia, strictures and dehydration to name a few. Recurrent constipation may eventually contribute to the develop-ment of megacolon. The impacted cat can become systemically ill with signs such as anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and straining. Initial therapy for constipation/opstipation is directed at removing the hardened feces and providing supportive care if needed. A variety of therapies can be used including rectal suppositories, enemas, oral laxatives, and prokinetic agents. In some instances manual disimpaction is required. In humans the use of PEG 3350 has been described to be highly successful in the treatment of severe constipation or fecal impaction both in adults and children. Side effects are rare, though occasionally these solutions can result in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release (SIADH). This retrospective study describes the use of PEG 3350 (Colyte s ) infusions as the predominant therapy resulting in the resolution of constipation in 9 cats. PEG 3350 is commonly used in cats for colonoscopy preparation where dosages of 50 to 125 ml/kg have been recommended. All 9 cats were admitted to the University of Saskatchewan Veterinary Teaching Hospital and received intravenous fluid therapy as well as various supportive care measures. If cats were on laxatives, these were continued at previously used dosages. All cats had clinical signs consistent with clinical constipation/impaction. Seven of the cats had multiple previous episodes of constipation. Diagnosis was established by an appropriate history, physical examination findings and radiographs (6 of 9). One cat received a 5 ml/kg warm water enema at presentation with no fecal production 12 hours prior to administering PEG 3350. One cat received a single warm water enema concurrent to PEG 3350 administration (20 ml/kg). PEG 3350 (Colyte s ) was administered via naso-esophageal tube at rates between 6 and 10 ml/kg/hr. The median total dose given was 80 ml/ kg (range 40-156 ml/kg). Median time to significant defecation was 8 hours (range 5 to 24). All cats had either radiographs or palpation to confirm that all firm feces had been passed. Side effects were limited to vomiting in one cat, however the cat had been vomiting prior to presentation. Hyponatremia was not noted in 5 cats where blood work after administration was obtained. Use of PEG 3350 solution (Colyte s ) appears to be an effective alternative or adjunctive therapy for the treatment of constipated/ impacted cats. Minimally-invasive endoscopic procedures are increasingly performed by small animal practitioners because of continuing education opportunities, affordability of endoscopic equipment, and high public demand. Successful operation of both rigid and flexible endoscopes requires technical expertise only attainable through practice. Incorporation of endoscopic simulators into veterinary medical training has been limited by cost. The purpose of this study was to develop an affordable veterinary flexible and rigid endoscopic training device (FRED). A commercial stuffed animal was acquired. Removable upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts were constructed from rubber tubing and plicated balloons. Modifications to the modules were made based upon achievements and problems identified during scoping trials to optimize scoping difficulty and realism. Normal canine gastrointestinal anatomy and basic haptic feedback were achieved. Standard endoscopic views, including retroflexed examination of the cardia, evaluation of the lesser incisura and entry into the pyloric outflow tract, were realistic and attainable. Other structures of acceptable accuracy, excluding coloration, were the lower esophageal sphincter, duodenal papilla, and ileocecocolic area. The dexterity and manipulative skills required for performance of endoscopic procedures on live small animal patients were necessary for successful navigation of the facsimile gastrointestinal tract. The FRED prototype provided a realistic simulation of gastrointestinal endoscopy. Modules were easily removed for cleaning. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether use of the simulator is associated with improved procedural time, decreased complications and improved outcome in live animal patients. Additional training modules are being developed to expand use of the FRED for other minimally invasive procedures. The ProCyte Dx is an in-house hematology analyzer that utilizes impedance technology and laser flow cytometry with optical fluorescence capabilities, and provides a complete hemogram within two minutes. The purpose of this study was to compare the IDEXX ProCyte DX with the Abbott CellDyn 3700 for routine hemogram parameters (RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, WBC and PLT) in healthy or ill dogs and cats. Within one hour of sample collection, EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood from 164 dogs and 143 cats was analyzed using the ProCyte DX (developmental software version 1.0) and CellDyn 3700 (software version 1.3). ProCyte DX and CellDyn 3700 results, including abnormal, flagged results, were compared by Deming Regression and Bland-Altman plots using EP Evaluator v8 software; test result intervals, correlation coefficients (R), root mean square errors (SEE) and mean biases are presented in the table below. There are strong linear relationships between most ProCyte DX and CellDyn 3700 results. Parameters with correlation coefficients o 0.9 may be explained by either differences in methodology (MCV and MCHC) or specific technical issues with feline platelet clumping. These data indicate that results from the IDEXX ProCyte DX correlate strongly with a reference laboratory analyzer, and that the ProCyte DX is capable of providing a rapid and accurate hemogram for the canine and feline samples. The ProCyte Dx is an in-house hematology analyzer that utilizes impedance technology and laser flow cytometry with optical fluorescence capabilities, and provides a complete hemogram within two minutes. The purpose of this study was to compare IDEXX ProCyte DX results with manually determined PCV, reticulocyte and leukocyte differential values. Within one hour of sample collection, EDTAanticoagulated blood from 164 dogs and 143 cats was analyzed using the ProCyte DX (developmental software version 1.0). From these, manual PCV values were determined for 122 canine and 72 feline samples. Reticulocyte counts were performed on 146 canine and 135 feline samples using new methylene blue-stained blood films and the Miller disc method. Experienced technicians performed 400-cell leukocyte differential counts on all samples. These percent differential counts were applied to the total leukocyte counts obtained from a validated hematology analyzer (Abbott CellDyn 3700, software version 1.3) to determine absolute differential counts. ProCyte DX and manual results, including abnormal, flagged results, were compared by Deming Regression and Bland-Altman plots using EP Evaluator v8 software; test result intervals, correlation coefficients (R), root mean square errors (SEE) and mean biases are presented in the table below. There are strong correlative relationships between the ProCyte DX 1 Units for each test result: RBC, Â 10 6 /ml; HGB, g/dl; HCT, %; MCV, fl; MCH, pg; MCHC, g/dl; WBC, Â 10 3 /ml; PLT, Â 10 3 /ml. 2 Sample number (n): Dogs, 122; Cats, 72. and manual methods. Parameters with correlation coefficients o 0.9 may be partially explained by the limitations of manual methods. These data indicate that results from the IDEXX ProCyte DX correlate strongly with most common manual hematology methods, and that rapid and accurate PCV, reticulocyte and leukocyte differential values are possible for canine and feline samples. The purpose of this study was to compare the IDEXX ProCyte DX with the Bayer ADVIA 120 and manual leukocyte differential counts in dogs and cats that were clinically normal or ill. EDTA-anticoagulated venous blood samples were submitted for routine hematology analysis; 148 dog and 58 cat samples were analyzed within 1-hour of blood collection using the ProCyte DX (developmental software version 1.1) and ADVIA 120 (software version 3.1.8.0-MS). A 200-cell manual differential leukocyte count was performed independently by 2 experienced veterinary hematology technicians on Wright-Giemsastained blood films. Results were compared by Deming Regression using EP Evaluator v8; correlation coefficients (R) were recorded. There was a strong linear relationship between the ProCyte DX and the comparison methods over a broad range of hematology values that included both clinically normal and ill animals. Correlation coefficients (R) between the ADVIA 120 and the ProCyte DX for dogs and cats, respectively, were 0.997 and 0.996 for erythrocyte counts, 0.993 and 0.988 for calculated Hct, 0.993 and 0.994 for Hb, 0.936 and 0.896 for MCV, 0.829 and 0.670 for MCHC, 0.962 and 0.823 for platelet counts, and 0.996 and 0.994 for total leukocyte counts. Correlations between manual microcentrifuged Hct and the Hct calculated by the ProCyte Dx for dogs and cats, respectively, were 0.990 and 0.983. Correlations between manual absolute leukocyte differential counts and the ProCyte Dx for dogs and cats, respectively, were 0.964 and 0.987 for neutrophils, 0.656 and 0.700 for lymphocytes, 0.666 and 0.820 for monocytes, 0.980 and 0.974 for eosinophils, and 0.428 and 0.752 for basophils. These data indicate that canine and feline complete blood cell counts obtained using the in-house analyzer, IDEXX ProCyte DX, correlate strongly with hematology results obtained from a reference laboratory and that the ProCyte DX is capable of providing a rapid and accurate five-part leukocyte differential count. The authors hypothesized that the use of clopidogrel (Plavix s ), alone or in combination with ultralow-dose aspirin (ULDA), will be safe and improve survival compared to ULDA alone in dogs diagnosed with primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (pIMHA). A prospective, randomized pilot study with three treatment groups was conducted in client-owned dogs with newly diagnosed pIMHA and treated with prednisone and azathioprine at standard therapeutic doses. Dogs with severe thrombocytopenia (o40,000 platelets/ mL), inability to tolerate oral medications, or concurrently receiving other anticoagulants or immunosuppressive agents were excluded. The primary endpoint was 90-day survival. Secondary endpoints evaluated were survival at discharge, frequency of hemorrhage and gastrointestinal signs. After informed owner consent was obtained, 24 dogs with pI-MHA were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups (clopidogrel, ULDA, or both) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. A clopidogrel single loading dose of 10 mg/kg PO was initiated on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg PO q24 hrs for 89 days. Dogs allocated to the ULDA-group received a dose of 0.5 mg/kg PO q24 hrs for 90 days. Other immunosuppressive agents were not used during the first 14 days of therapy. All dogs were monitored for any evidence of hemorrhage or gastrointestinal signs over the 90-day study period. One dog in each treatment group did not survive to discharge. At day 90, 6 out of 8 dogs in the clopidogrel group, 7 out of 8 dogs in the clopidogrel/ULDA group, and 6 out of 8 dogs in the ULDA group were alive. Survival analysis revealed no significant difference between the three treatment groups at discharge and 90 days. No evidence of hemorrhage was noted in any dog. A self-limiting diarrhea was observed in some dogs following the clopidogrel loading dose, but no significant difference in the frequency of gastrointestinal signs was identified between the three treatment groups. Results of this study suggest that there is no difference in survival to discharge or at 90 days in dogs with pIMHA treated with clopidogrel, ultralow-dose aspirin, or both. Limitations of this pilot study include small sample size, lack of blinding, lack of placebocontrols, difficulty of monitoring effectiveness of therapy, and longterm follow-up data (490 days). Larger prospective, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-control studies are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in dogs with pIMHA. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of prednisone, aspirin and the combination of the two drugs on thromboelastography (TEG) in normal dogs. Sixteen healthy purpose-bred hounds were randomized to four treatment groups: prednisone (2 mg/kg PO, q24h), aspirin (0.5 mg/ kg PO, q24h), prednisone and aspirin together at the aforementioned doses, and control. All dogs were treated for 7 days, and blood was collected for TEG on days 0, 2, 4 and 6. The TEG parameters R, K, Angle, maximum amplitude (MA), G, and Cl60 (% clot amplitude at 60 minutes) were evaluated. Data are reported as mean AE SD. Analysis was by ANOVA for repeated measures. Aspirin alone did not alter any TEG parameters. For treatment effect, G (dyn/cm 2 ) increased in the prednisone group (7315 AE 540, p 5 0.025), and prednisone/aspirin group (7709 AE 528, p 5 0.0067) compared to controls (5421 AE 566); MA (mm) also increased in the prednisone group (58.8 mm AE 2.1, p 5 0.03), and prednisone/aspirin group (60.2 mm AE 2.0, p 5 0.01) compared to controls (52.0 mm AE 2.0). For treatment-by-time effect, Cl60(%) increased in the prednisone group on day 6 (99.8 AE 0.3), compared to day 6 controls (90.7 AE 6.9, p o 0.0001) and baseline (93.3 AE 5.7, p o 0.0001). Cl60 also increased in the prednisone/aspirin group on day 6 (96.9 AE 4.3) compared to baseline (93.4 AE 4.5, p 5 0.007) and day 6 controls (90.7 AE 6.9, p o 0.003). In conclusion, prednisone treatment at 2 mg/kg/day for 7 days, with and without aspirin, increased clot strength and decreased clot lysis in normal dogs. Serotonin release from dense granules of activated platelets is implicated in vasoconstriction and clot growth associated with aortic thromboembolic disease (ATE) in cats. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 5 mg/ kg PO q48 h) and meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q24 h) on post-aggregatory serotonin production in feline whole blood. Each medication was given to 8 cats for 14 days in a randomized, placebo controlled, cross-over design. It was hypothesized that NSAID therapy would decrease platelet serotonin secretion following whole blood platelet aggregation (WBA) using adenosine diphosphate (ADP; 10 mM) or collagen (5 mg/mL) as agonists. WBA was performed before drug administration on days 0 and 7, and also on day 15. Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture using vacuum into tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate. Serotonin was measured in plasma collected after WBA with each agonist using a commercially-available ELISA assay (IBL Inc.). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures or one-way ANOVA. Compared to baseline, neither medication affected platelet serotonin secretion, regardless of WBA agonist. Baseline serotonin was not different between groups (mean AE SD (ADP): 822.1 AE 456.8 ng/ mL, mean AE SD (collagen): 1511.8 AE 552.5 ng/mL), consistent with published values. Platelet count remained stable for the duration of the study. At the tested doses, neither meloxicam nor ASA decreased postaggregatory serotonin release in feline whole blood. Further studies evaluating isolated platelets may be indicated. The diameter of 11-13 ga needles makes bone marrow core biopsy difficult in some small dogs. In this study, biopsies of the left humeral head and iliac crest were taken under anesthesia using a modified 1-inch, 15 ga needle attached to a drill (EZ-IO s Intraosseous Infusion System, Vidacare) from 17 healthy beagles weighing 6.5-11 kg. These were compared to biopsies taken from a different site on the left humeral head using a 2-inch, 13 ga Jamshidi needle. Biopsies were performed in randomized order by one investigator. Collection was repeated until a sample ! 5 mm long was obtained. Difficulty of site localization, needle insertion, and needle advancement were scored from 1 (easiest) to 5 (hardest). Biopsy sections were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to biopsy site and dog. Biopsy quality was scored from 1 (0 intratrabecular spaces free of artifact) to 5 (! 5 spaces). Biopsy sites were examined at necropsy. All biopsies captured hematopoietic tissue. Results for the procedures [mean AE SE (range)] were: All intact spaces had normal hematopoiesis. Quality significantly correlated (Spearman) with cell density (rho 5 0.66), cellularity (rho 5 0.73), and megakaryocyte counts (rho 5 0.69). These three parameters in 13 ga biopsies were underestimated by 75%, 69%, and 60% in 15 ga humeral, and by 77%, 83%, and 54% in ilial biopsies, respectively, and their medians were significantly different (Friedman). Myeloid:erythroid ratio was not significantly correlated between 13 ga and 15 ga biopsies (rho 5 0.34-0.41). Lymphocytes/ plasma cells, iron stores, and cell maturation and morphology were not different between sites. At necropsy, humeral heads had grossly moderate-to-marked hemorrhage, while ilial crests had no or minimal hemorrhage. The 13 ga biopsy sites were easily identified, while 15 ga biopsy sites were difficult to identify. In conclusion: 1) Drill-assisted 15 ga humeral biopsy is easier to perform than manual 13 ga humeral biopsy. 2) The risk for a lower quality biopsy is greater with a 15 ga needle, especially from the iliac crest. 3) A 15 ga biopsy may quantitatively underestimate hematopoiesis, which may be due to limited sample quality, but is qualitatively representative in normal dogs. The current blood groups in the dog are designated as dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Due to the immunogenic characteristics of the DEA 1.1 and 1.2, we evaluated their frequency in 206 Greyhounds and 66 non-Greyhound dogs. The ages ranged between 1 and 7 years (mean 4.0 years for Greyhounds and 3.2 years for non-Greyhounds), and there were 103 females (75 Greyhounds and 28 non-Greyhounds) and 169 males (131 Greyhounds and 38 non-Greyhounds). One hundred and thirteen Greyhounds and 24 non-Greyhounds were evaluated for the presence of naturally occurring antibodies against all the known DEAs. Prevalence of DEA groups were compared between Greyhounds and non-Greyhounds using contingency tables and Fisher's exact test. Significance was set at p o 0.05. The prevalence of 1.1 antigen was significantly lower in the Greyhounds than in the non-Greyhounds (p o 0.0001), as was the prevalence of 1.1/1.2 antigen (p o 0.0001). There were no significant differences between Greyhounds and non-Greyhounds for the frequency of 1.2, 3, 4, 5, or 7 antigens. As expected, there were significantly more ''universal donors'' in the Greyhound than in the non-Greyhound group (p o 0.0001). Serum from 137 dogs (113 Greyhounds and 24 non Greyhounds) was evaluated for the presence of naturally occurring antibodies and none of them were positive. Canine portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has been infrequently reported. Medical records of 29 cases with PVT were evaluated. PVT was documented by ultrasound (24) or direct examination at surgery (3) or necropsy (2). There was no breed or sex predilection. Median age was 7.5 years (1 month-13 years). Pre-existing conditions included hepatic (6), immune (4), endocrine (2), renal (1), and inflammatory disease (1), protein-losing enteropathy (2), neoplasia (1), and sepsis (1). Seven dogs had previous surgery or procedures including splenectomy (3), intestinal surgery (1), coil occlusion for intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (1), liver lobectomy (1), and laparoscopic liver biopsy (1). Eleven dogs had a history of prior corticosteroid administration. New diagnoses at time of PVT were neoplasia (5) and ITP (1). Presenting complaints included vomiting (13), inappetence (10), diarrhea (10), and acute collapse (9). Ten dogs presented in shock. Presenting signs included acute abdominal pain (8), abdominal distension (8), elevated body temperature (4), and petechiae (3). Twenty-seven dogs had CBC and serum chemistry analysis. Thrombocytopenia was present in 16 dogs (range, 2,000-187,000/ mL), 10 of which had concurrent anemia. Liver enzymes were elevated in 20 dogs and serum bilirubin was elevated in 12. Twenty dogs had ascites, total protein of which was o2 mg/dL in 12, and 3.7 mg/dL in 1. Treatment included anticoagulation (16), surgery (2) and thrombolysis (1). Seventeen dogs survived to discharge, 10 were euthanized due to grave prognosis and 2 died. Storage and loading of trace elements onto transport proteins is oftentimes performed by the liver, and when absorbed in excess of dietary requirements, the route of excretion of a number of these elements is via bile. Primary copper (Cu) hepatopathy has been described in a number of breeds, and dogs with liver disease of other etiologies are noted oftentimes to have excess hepatic Cu concentrations. In addition, other trace elements have been implicated in canine diseases (iron [Fe] and aluminum [Al]) or have been suggested as therapies for various disease (zinc [Zn], vanadium [V], and chromium [Cr] ). The purpose of this study was therefore to determine liver and bile concentrations for select trace elements in healthy dogs and dogs with various hepatopathies, and to determine whether concentrations are correlated with one another or between liver and bile. Paired liver and bile samples were collected from 37 overtly healthy hound-type adult dogs (group 1A), 5 healthy, adult CO-MMD 1/À Beagle-Bedlington terrier crossbreed dogs (group 1B), and 18 client-owned dogs with a variety of non-primary Cu hepatopathies (group 2). 4 adult COMMD À/À Beagle-Bedlington terrier dogs previously confirmed to have primary Cu hepatopathy (group 3) had bile collected for analysis, but liver was only available for copper assay. All dogs in group 1A, 1B, and 3 were being fed commercial dry adult maintenance dog foods, whereas group 2 dogs were fed a variety of diets based on owner and referring veterinarian preference. Group 3 dogs had been receiving penicillamine (10 mg/ kg PO q12h) which was discontinued 6 days prior to obtaining liver and bile samples. Liver and bile Al, cobalt (Co), Cr, Cu, Fe, lead (Pb), V, and Zn concentrations were assayed by a commercial laboratory, and differences analyzed by two-sample t-test with significance designated at p o 0.05; clinical significance was designated at |rho| 4 0.5. The only significant correlation noted within liver from group 1A dogs was between Cu and Zn (p o 0.001; rho 5 0.7). However, multiple positive correlations were noted within bile, including Al with Co, Fe, Pb, V, and Zn; Co with Cu, Fe, Pb, V, and Zn; Cu with V and Zn; Fe with Zn, Pb with V and Zn, and V with Zn; the only negative correlations noted were Cr with Pb and V. Trace elements with significant, positive correlations between liver and bile in 1A dogs were Al, Co, and Cr (p o 0.001 and rho 0.6 for all). Liver Co was higher in 1B dogs than 1A, and 1A 1 1B dogs (i.e. healthy dogs) had significantly higher liver Co than 2A dogs and significantly higher bile Co than group 2 1 3 dogs (i.e. hepatopathy dogs). Liver Cu in group 3 dogs was significantly higher and bile Cu was significantly lower than any other group. There were no significant differences between groups in liver or bile Al, Cr, Fe, Pb, V, or Zn concentrations. These results suggest that several trace elements may influence concentration of other elements, and that bile concentration of Al, Co, or Cr can potentially be used to predict liver concentrations. COMMD 1/À Beagle-Bedlington terriers, although asymptomatic, may have an uncharacterized defect that results in liver cobalt accumulation. Early impaired CD8 1 and CD4 1 CD25 À T cell immune responses, reminiscent of anergy, correlate with activation of CD4 1 CD25 1 T regulatory cells (Treg) in AIDS lentiviral infections. Using the FIV model, we reported previously that CD4 1 CD25 1 T regulatory cells in both the acute phase and long-term, asymptomatic phase of infection are constitutively activated and suppress CD4 1 CD25 À and CD8 1 T cell immune responses. T cell anergy is defined by G 1 cell cycle arrest and failure to proliferate in response to appropriate stimulation. Because Treg cells are known to induce G 1 cell cycle arrest in T cell targets; we asked whether Treg cells altered the expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and their inhibitors that regulate progression from G 1 to S phase. To address this question, lymphocytes were obtained from SPF negative control cats or cats chronically infected with NCSU 1 FIV and sorted by FACS into CD4 1 CD25 1 and CD8 1 populations. Following either 12 or 24 hour co-culture with CD4 1 CD25 1 cells, CD8 1 target cells were examined by western blot for changes in cyclins D 3 , E and A, retinoblastoma protein (Rb), as well as the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p15 ink4b , p21 cip1 , and p27 kip1 . Following co-culture with CD4 1 CD25 1 Treg cells, we have observed up-regulation of p21 cip1 and cyclin E with down-regulation of cyclin D 3 , and cyclin A in CD8 1 cells from FIV 1 cats; while little change was noted in p15 ink4b and p27 kip1 expression. As expected, CD8 1 targets from FIV-negative control cats were relatively quiescent with little up-regulation of p21 cip1 and cyclin E as was observed in the FIV 1 cats. Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb is consistent with irreversible commitment to S phase; and further investigation showed there was a lack of Rb phosphorylation in CD8 1 target cells consistent with late G 1 cell cycle arrest. We are currently performing FACS cell cycle analysis in CD8 1 targets, following CD4 1 CD25 1 co-culture, to confirm G 1 cell cycle arrest. Collectively these data suggest that CD4 1 CD25 1 Treg cells are activated in FIV 1 cats in vivo and induce anergy of CD8 1 T cell targets by disruption of normal G 1 to S regulatory mechanisms. Previously presented at the Keystone Symposia, Santa Fe, N, M January 2010. By Western blot immunoassay, we previously identified three immunodominant CRFK antigens (a-enolase, annexin A2, and macrophage capping protein/cap G) that are widely distributed throughout tissues and highly conserved between species. We have shown that SQ administration of FVRCP vaccines containing CRFK proteins induces CRFK, a-enolase and annexin A2 antibody levels detectable by ELISA. The purpose of this study was to assess for associations between CRFK, a-enolase and annexin A2 antibodies by ELISA and biochemical abnormalities in privately-owned cats. Residual sera submitted for biochemical analysis for 1,477 privately-owned cats were acquired. Indirect ELISAs for antibodies to CRFK cell lysate, a-enolase and annexin A2 were performed. Albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, calcium, chloride, cholesterol, globulin, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, and total protein concentrations as well as activities of creatine kinase (CK), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate transferase (AST) were compared to CRFK, a-enolase and annexin A2 %ELISA values by multiple logistic regression. Significant negative associations were identified between CRFK antibodies and glucose, creatinine, and ALP activity; a-enolase antibodies and glucose, albumin and ALP activity; and annexin A2 antibodies and glucose and albumin. A significant positive association was found between CRFK antibodies and bilirubin. Anti-CRFK, a-enolase, and annexin A2 antibodies are correlated with some biochemical abnormalities. The associations between bilirubin and creatinine concentrations and CRFK, but not a-enolase or annexin A2, antibodies suggests antibodies against additional CRFK proteins may be clinically relevant. Further studies evaluating the significance of these results are necessary. The purpose of this study was to determine if a flow cytometry protocol could identify feline anti-erythrocyte antibodies attached to red blood cells (RBC) of cats with a presumptive diagnosis of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA). EDTA-preserved whole blood from 3 anemic cats with a presumptive diagnosis of IMHA was processed concurrently with samples from non-anemic cats. Ten microliters of whole blood was washed 3 times and the RBCs incubated in fluorescence activated cell sorting buffer alone or with goat anti-feline IgM or IgG FITCconjugated antibodies (Serotec). The cells were washed and analyzed using a Cyan flow cytometer. Untreated cells were used to set the threshold for non-specific fluorescence. Three cats (2, 5, and 16 years of age) with a regenerative anemia and a presumptive diagnosis of IMHA were positive for antierythrocyte antibodies using the described protocol. The packedcell volume of the anemic cats ranged from 6% to 17%. One cat was FeLV1, tested Coombs positive, and showed 2 1 saline agglutination. The second cat also showed marked RBC saline agglutination and icteric serum. A third cat was both anemic and thrombocytopenic. All anemic cats were negative by PCR for M. haemofelis and M. hemominutum. All 3 anemic cats had RBCs that were positive by flow cytometry for IgM (mean 8.0% 1/À 3.3 std dev) and 2 that were positive for IgG (mean 3.4% 1/À 1.8) class anti-erythrocyte antibodies. The non-anemic cats' RBCs stained a mean of 0.5% 1/À 0.4 with anti-feline IgM and 0.3% 1/À 0.3 with anti-feline IgG. The conclusion from this study is that flow cytometry can be used to detect feline anti-erythrocyte antibodies in clinical cases of anemia in cats. This should be an important tool in future studies of the prevalence and pathophysiology behind immune-mediated hemolytic anemia in the feline species. Bartonella henselae has been associated with illness in cats and people. However, results of blood culture, PCR on blood, or B. henselae IgG in serum have not correlated to the presence or absence of clinical disease. In addition, results of B. henselae IgG in serum is poorly predictive of bacteremia. We recently validated a Bartonella spp. IgM ELISA using serum collected sequentially from cats experimentally infected by exposure to B. henselae infected Ctenocephalides felis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether B. henselae IgM results can be used to predict clinical bartonellosis or bacteremia. Paired samples from cats with and without fever (n 5 184), paired samples from cats with and without stomatitis (n 5 108), and samples from healthy shelter cats (n 5 51) that had been used in previous studies of Bartonella spp. IgG antibodies and Bartonella spp. PCR had been stored at -80 C. The samples were thawed and assessed in the Bartonella spp. IgM assay. The distribution of the paired sample results was evaluated by logistic regression to determine odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to determine whether Bartonella spp. IgM ELISA titer magnitude was associated with presence of fever or stomatitis. Significance was defined as p o 0.05. Results were used to calculate PPV and NPV for presence of disease and for presence of bacteremia as defined as a positive PCR assay result. Results from the analyses revealed no statistical association between Bartonella spp. IgM (positive or negative) or IgM titer magnitude and the presence of fever or stomatitis. The PPV and NPV of Bartonella spp. IgM and disease were approximately 40% in all analyses. The PPV and NPV of Bartonella spp. IgM and bacteremia based on PCR results were approximately 15% and 85%, respectively. Bartonella spp. IgM antibodies do not correlate with the presence of fever or stomatitis and are not accurate for the prediction of the Bartonella spp. bacteremia. While Ctenocephalides felis infestations are common in Thailand, little is known about the prevalence of flea-associated pathogens. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of Bartonella spp., hemoplasmas, and Rickettsia felis in client-owned cats and their fleas in Bangkok, Thailand. Blood and fleas were collected from cats that were randomly selected during June and August 2009 from a referral veterinary hospital and 2 private clinics in Bangkok. The samples were stored at À201C until being shipped to Colorado State University for analysis. Total DNA was extracted from blood and pooled fleas, and was assessed in conventional PCR assays that amplify the DNA of these particular pathogens. A total of 153 blood samples and 50 flea pools were collected from cats. Ctenocephalides felis was identified in 99.1% of all fleas. The overall prevalence rates for Bartonella spp. in blood and flea samples were 16.3% and 32.0%, respectively. Bartonella henselae and Bartonella clarridgeiae were the common Bartonella spp. amplified. The overall prevalence rates for haemoplasmas in blood and flea samples were 22.9% and 34.0%, respectively. 'Candidatus M haemominutum' and M. haemofelis were the haemoplasmas amplified. Rickettsia felis DNA was not amplified from any blood or flea sample. Combinations of Bartonella and haemoplasma DNA were amplified from some cats. The results demonstrate that Bartonella spp. and haemoplasma spp. infections are common in client-owned cats and cat fleas in Bangkok and suggest that further study of associations of these infections with clinical syndromes is indicated in the area. Conjunctivitis is a common, painful condition of cats that has the potential to induce pathologic corneal changes and consequently, in severe cases, compromise vision. Bartonella spp. have been implicated as a cause of a variety of feline ocular abnormalities including conjunctivitis. However, studies definitively confirming the association between feline conjunctivitis and Bartonella are lacking. The primary purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of Bartonella spp. DNA in conjunctival cells collected from cats with and without conjunctivitis. Participating shelter veterinarians were asked to collect blood (1 ml in EDTA; 2 ml for serum separation) and conjunctival swabs from cats with clinical evidence of conjunctivitis prior to administration of antibiotics. For every two cats with conjunctivitis, samples were requested from a healthy cat in the same shelter without conjunctivitis. Samples were stored at À20C until shipped to CSU for assessment in a conventional PCR assay that amplifies DNA of common Bartonella spp. and an ELISA for Bartonella spp. IgG antibodies. The DNA prevalence rates and seroprevalence rates were compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. Of the 70 cats with conjunctivitis, 0 had Bartonella DNA amplified from conjunctival swabs, but 10 of the 41 cats tested (24.4%) had Bartonella DNA amplified from blood and 23 of the 41 cats tested (56.1%) had Bartonella spp. IgG in serum. Of the 43 control cats, 0 had Bartonella DNA amplified from conjunctival swabs, but 10 of the 27 cats tested (37.0%) had Bartonella DNA amplified from blood and 22 of the 27 cats tested (81.5%) had Bartonella spp. IgG in serum. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of Bartonella spp. DNA amplified from conjunctival swab samples or from whole blood samples (p 5 1.0, p 5 0.115, respectively). Cats without conjunctivitis were significantly more likely to have Barton-ella spp. IgG detected in their serum than cats with conjunctivitis (p 5 0.02). The results of this study indicate that while Bartonella spp. infection was common based on the blood results, there was no association between Bartonella DNA in blood and conjunctivitis and Bartonella DNA was not amplified from conjunctival cells. These results fail to confirm an association between Bartonella spp. and feline conjunctivitis and suggest that Bartonella may not be a cause of this syndrome. The diagnosis of bartonellosis in dogs can be extremely challenging and frequently requires the use of specialized culture techniques, in combination with PCR. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the cumulative diagnostic experience using the BAPGM (Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium) pre-enrichment culture and PCR platform; (2) to describe an expanding spectrum of Bartonella species identified in diagnostic samples from sick dogs; and (3) to characterize the relationship between infection and Bartonella seroreactivity. Between 2003 and 2009, 924 samples from 663 dogs were submitted to the NCSU-CVM-VBDDL for testing using the BAPGM platform, of which 62 (9.3%) dogs were infected with one or more Bartonella sp., which included B. henselae (Bh, 46.8%), B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (Bvb, 25.8%), B. koehlerae (Bk, 4.8%), B. volanslike (Bvl, 3.2%) and B. bovis (Bb, 1.6%). Co-infection with more than one Bartonella sp. was documented in 11 dogs (17.7%). Serology results were available for 48.3% of dogs infected with Bh (42.9% were Bh seroreactive and 21.4% were seroreactive to another tick-borne pathogen [TBP, includes Anaplasma spp., Babesia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Rickettsia rickettsii]), 25% of the dogs with Bvb (25% were Bvb seroreactive, 50% were seroreactive to another TBP), and 22% of the dogs that were co-infected with Bh and Bvb (50 % seroreactive to Bh or Bvb and 50% were seroreactive to another TBP). The results of this study, in conjunction with recent seroprevalence studies, indicate that: (1) dogs are more frequently exposed to and infected with B. henselae, as compared to Bvb or other Bartonella sp; (2) co-infection with more than one Bartonella sp. is not uncommon in sick dogs; (3) and although infrequent, dogs can be infected with Bk, Bb, or a novel Bartonella sp. (Bvl). Based upon serology, 25-50% of infected dogs were concurrently seroreactive to a known tick-borne pathogen and for reasons that remain unclear, 50% of infected dogs did not have detectable Bartonella antibodies. Bartonella henselae can be a significant pathogen of cats, is considered a significant zoonotic disease, and can be transmitted by IV administration of infected blood. Blood used for transfusions is often stored in citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine (CPDA-1) solution for up to one month and it is currently unknown if B. henselae remains viable in blood stored in this solution. The purpose of this study was to determine whether B. henselae survives after storage in blood preserved in CPDA-1. Two specific pathogen free cats were inoculated intravenously with B. henselae. When infection was confirmed via a Bartonella spp. PCR assay, blood was collected from each cat and placed into commercially available sterile, closed-collection systems that contained CPDA-1 and stored at 41C. On days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, and 28, 2 ml samples were aseptically removed from each bag. The 2 ml were divided into 0.5 ml aliquots and each was plated separately onto four plates per time point. The plates were incubated and checked daily for 28 days. When colonies characteristic of B. henselae were identified, they were confirmed as B. henselae by PCR. Bartonella henselae was cultured from all samples on all plates from each time point. Due to the large numbers of colonies isolated, it could not be determined whether the organism replicated within the solution. The results of this experiment confirm that B. henselae remains viable when stored for up to 28 days in CPDA-1 solution and suggests that cats used as blood donors should be screened for this organism. Bartonella henselae is a zoonotic pathogen causing cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. We investigated the role of BadA as a pathogenic factor on inflammatory response and angiogenesis in HUVECs to help understanding the bacterial pathogenesis. We prepared the recombinant BadA protein using the pET-28a Expression System and evaluated the expression of pro-inflammatory related adhesion molecules and cytokines, and VEGF in HUVECs incubated for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment of BadA (200 ng/ml) using comparative RT-PCR and ELISA analysis. We also investigated the proliferation of HUVECS and quantitative adherence of U937 monocytes to HUVECs after BadA treatment (200 ug/ml). BadA exhibited very minimal endotoxic activity in HUVECs incubated for 24 and 48 h at a concentration of 100-1000 ng/ml. BadA also showed the enhanced ability on proliferation of HUVECs and on adherence of U937 monocytes to HUVECs. The expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA were significantly increased in HUVECs from 6 to 48 h after BadA treatment (p o 0.05). The expression levels of IL-6, IL-8 in HUVECs culture supernatant was significantly higher at 24 h and 48 h after treatment of BadA than control (p o 0.05), which is in accordance with the results of RT-PCR analysis. Interestingly, the expression of VEGF mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated at 24 h in HUVECs after BadA treatment (p o 0.001). Our data show that BadA stimulates inflammatory response in HU-VECs as well as production of VEGF, implicating BadA plays an important role in Bartonella pathogenesis including cat scratch disease and bacillary angiomatosis. Combination therapy using atovaquone (ATV) and azithromycin (AZM) is effective for the treatment of acute onset Babesia gibsoni infection. However, the incidence of relapse was high, with some clinical cases resistant to further treatment with ATV and AZM. Potentially ATV-resistant B. gibsoni variants that possessed mutations in a putative ATV-binding site of cytochrome b were predominant in these ATV-resistant cases. In this study, we conducted a survey of the cytochrome b (cytb) gene of B. gibsoni isolated from clinical cases to determine the prevalence of potential ATVresistance variants. Ninety-two blood samples were collected from dogs with clinically confirmed B. gibsoni infection and no treatment history with anti-protozoal drugs. The nucleotide sequence of cytb from the dominant B. gibsoni strain in each case was determined by direct sequencing. Many single nucleotide substitutions were detected but 12 non-synonymous substitutions were identified in cytb: M43 V (1.1%), M43I (1.1%), A108 T (2.2%), M121I (3.3%), I136 V (1.1%), A216 T (1.1%), V220I (6.5%), I226 V (12.0%), A276 V (1.1%), A290 V (1.1%), I303 V (8.7%), and P310S (16.3%). The principal ATV-resistance substitution, M121I, was detected in three cases and other substitutions possibly related to ATV-resistance were also detected. This survey determined that potentially ATV-resistant B. gibsoni strains are present in dogs in Japan. Although the frequency of these resistant strains was low, the emergence of drug-resistant B. gibsoni strains is likely to complicate therapy. Therefore, the establishment of screening methods to identify such strains and the development of new therapeutic strategies are required to limit the spread of babesiosis. FIV infection can cause declining CD4 1 T-lymphocyte counts and an immunodeficiency syndrome in infected cats. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and accurate flow cytometry method to characterize the key lymphocyte subtypes involved in the infection and immune response in FIV-positive cats. Blood samples were obtained from 47 FIV-positive shelter cats, 10 FIV vaccinated cats and 203 FIV-negative cats. IDEXX Feline Combo test kits were used to determine FIV status. Fresh whole blood was incubated with CD4, CD5, CD8, CD21 and CD61 antibody conjugates. CD61 (platelet marker) was used to exclude platelet interference, common in feline samples due to large platelets and/or platelet aggregates. The CD8 antibody used in this method was purchased from AbD Serotec (CD8Alpha-Beta, clone vpg9). Erythrocytes were then lysed using PharmLyse (BD) and the mixture was centrifuged. The resultant supernatant was removed and resuspended with 1ÂPBS/1%FBS before further centrifugation and resuspension. The resuspended cells were run on a flow cytometer (Accuri C6). CD4 and CD8 bivariate plots were used to determine percentages of CD41 T cells and CD8 1 T cells. Precision of the method was evaluated using 10 FIV-negative samples comprising same-day same-sample 3-run precision tests and same-sample 3-day precision tests. The coefficient of variation (CV) for FIV-negative CD4/CD8 same-day same-sample 3-run precision tests averaged 3.15% and CV for same-sample 3-day precision tests was 9.3%. CD4/CD8 ratios for FIV-positive shelter cats measured in this study were significantly lower (n 5 47; 0.89 AE 0.52 mean AE SD) than for FIV-negative cats (n 5 203; 1.75 AE 1.2 mean AE SD; p o 0.0001) and reflected previously published values for FIV-infected cats. The CD81 T-cell population showed two subsets, 'CD8 low intensity' and 'CD8 high intensity'. The 'CD8 low intensity' cells appeared in markedly higher numbers in FIV-positive cats compared to FIVnegative cats. The cellular analysis method reported here may be useful in staging FIV disease progression by determining T-lymphocyte subset characteristics in serially collected blood samples from infected cats. Combining CD4/CD8 ratio and the percent of 'CD8 low intensity' T-cells on a single bivariate plot may offer added benefits in such analysis. INFECTED AND VACCINATED CATS. TP O'Connor 1 , J Saucier 1 , P Andersen 1 , MR Lappin 2 and R Chandrashekar 1 . 1 IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, 2 Veterinary Medical Center, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a feline-specific retrovirus that can produce chronic immunodeficiency disorders in cats. Infected cats have a world-wide distribution; infection rates in North America have been shown to vary from 2.8% for cats routinely tested at veterinary clinics and shelters to 7.4% for symptomatic and/or at risk cats from veterinary clinics. A formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine (Fel-O-Vax s , Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) was introduced in 2002 and produces an antibody response that cannot be distinguished from the response produced in naturally-infected cats using serological assays. Investigations into assays which differentiate infected from vaccinated cats are ongoing and pose a significant challenge. We have evaluated a competition-format microtiter plate ELISA using monoclonal antibodies specific for different epitopes of FIV antigen. The HRP-labeled monoclonal antibodies bound to microtiter wells coated with FIV antigen were competed by sera from naturally infected cats but less so by sera from vaccinated cats, particularly if outside of a 15 week period immediately following vaccination. The capacity of this assay to correctly identify FIV infection in a field population was determined by testing samples from a non-vaccinated shelter cat population and comparing results to the licensed FIV antibody ELISA (PetChek s FIV Ab Assay, ID-EXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). Each of the 84 positive and 42 negative samples was correctly identified by the competition assay. Temporal samples from known non-infected, vaccinated cats were produced using 3 groups of cats (5-6 cats per group) each vaccinated with a different vaccine lot administered 3 times over a 6 week period. Serum from each of the cats was reactive in the FIV Western blot assay and FIV Ab ELISA (PetChek s FIV Ab, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) starting 2-4 weeks following administration of the initial dose of vaccine. In the competition assay, sera from vaccinated cats were reactive for a period of 15 weeks or less following vaccination and were then non-reactive. Five cats that received the full vaccine series (3 doses) in 2003 and again in 2009 were non-reactive in the competition assay prior to and 9 weeks following administration of the second vaccine series. These results show that following vaccination, the antibody response to the FIV epitopes defined by these monoclonal antibodies was transient and was limited to a period of less than 16 weeks. While this preliminary data is encouraging, further development efforts are needed to generate a robust and reliable diagnostic assay. Cats naturally infected with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) develop a syndrome that share common characteristics with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. For this reason, felines are considered a promising model for the study of HIV infection. HIV associated nephropathy is a common and concerning complication in human beings, resulting in progressive renal insufficiency. Likewise, clinic-pathological findings in FIV -naturally infected cats suggest a renal involvement. This study was undertaken to evaluate the occurrence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats infected with FIV and to verify a possible association between both diseases. To achieve these goals, 44 cats (27 females and 17 males) were prospectively monitored every 4 months for 18 months or until death. Of these cats, 20 were FIVinfected (10 females and 10 females) and 24 (17 females and 7 males) were FIV-uninfected. None of them were infected with feline leukemia virus. Every 4 months all cats were submitted to physical examination and serum creatinine and urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UP/C) measurements. Urinary protein:creatinine ratio was performed as described by Bradford, 1976 . The association between the categorized variables was evaluated with the Pearson's chi square test or the Fisher exact test. A level of significance of 5% (P o 0.05) was adopted in the tests The occurrence of CKD in FIV-infected cats was higher than in FIV-uninfected cats (45% vs 25%, P o 0.05). Proteinuria in at least one moment of evaluation was observed in 60% of FIV-infected cats and in 26.1% of non-infected cats (P o 0.05). Considering persistent proteinuria as the observation of urinary protein excretion in at least 3 consecutive moments, FIV-infected cats exhibited occurrence of 30.8% compared to 6.7% in the non-infected cats (P o 0.05). Besides that proteinuria was significantly associated with death among FIV-infected cats with CKD (P o 0.05). It was observed an association between death and CKD only in the cats infected with FIV (P o 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates a high occurrence of CKD in FIV-infected cats and proteinuria is associated with increased risk of death in these cats. The association between death and CKD in FIV-infected cats suggests FIV may contribute for the worsening of CKD, resulting in a quicker organic dysfunction and marked reduction of survival. Abnormalities of serum basal cortisol levels in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have been documented in the early as well as late stages of infection, ranging from subclinical alterations to frank adrenal insufficiency. The etiologies of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis derangement in these patients have not yet been established. The feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cat is a model for HIV infection due to similarities in biology and clinical disease, but so far nothing has been done to evaluate the HPA axis of FIV-infected cats. This study was undertaken to assess the adrenal function of FIVinfected cats using ACTH stimulation test and correlate the results with blood CD41 cell counts. To achieve these goals, 13 (7 males and 6 females) FIV-naturallyinfected cats and 14 (7 males and 7 females) FIV-uninfected and healthy cats were used. All the 27 cats belong to the same rescued colony. All the 13 FIV-infected cats were asymptomatic at the moment of ACTH stimulation tests were performed. Serum cortisol levels before and 60 minutes after an exogenous ACTH stimulation test were measured by radioimmunoassay in FIV-infected cats as in FIV-uninfected cats. The ACTH stimulation test was performed at the same day and period of the day in all 27 cats. The blood CD41 cell counts were determined by flow cytometry in all cats.Unpaired t test was used to compare the cortisol and CD41 counts between groups. A P value o 0.05 was considered significant. Results are presented as meansAEstandard deviation (SD) where appropriate. The basal serum cortisol levels were not statistically different between FIV-infected or uninfected cats (1.650 AE 1.391 vs 1.914 AE 1.603, P 5 0.653). The serum cortisol levels 60 minutes after the ACTH injection were not different between FIV-infected or uninfected cats (12.391 AE 3.600 vs 11.978 AE 3.111, P 5 0.752). The serum cortisol levels increased significantly after the ACTH stimulation in the FIV-infected group (1.914 AE 1,603 vs 12.391 AE 3.600, P o 0.0001) as well as in the FIV-uninfected cats (1.650 AE 1.391 vs 11.978 AE 3.111, P o 0.0001). The blood CD41 cell counts were significantly lower in FIV-infected cats than in FIV-uninfected cats (809.43 AE 665.24 vs 1469.60 AE 823.07 P o 0.05). Although no correlation was observed between serum cortisol levels and blood CD41 counts in FIV infected cats as well as in FIV-uninfected cats (P o 0.05). We can conclude that FIV-infected cats, differently than HIVinfected patients, may not have adrenal dysfunction. Sporadic reports of myositis can be found among clinical alterations caused by visceral leishmaniasis in dogs. The goal of this study was to determinate electromyographic alterations in dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi, with no locomotor alterations. The electromyography was made in four muscles (triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius) of 25 adult dogs from the Zoonosis Control Center (ZZC) from Arac¸atuba, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. The insertional activity was reduced in 19 dogs (76%). During electrical activity at rest, spontaneous fibrillation potentials, positive waves and repetitive complex discharges were identified in 13 animals (52). During the evaluation of the voluntary electrical activity, 18 dogs (72%) had an altered recruitment in at least one of the studied muscles, evidenced by the increase in the recruitment speed and the presence of small polyphasic potentials of short duration. The electromyographic results encountered in this study allowed the identification of 13 animals (52%) with chronic polymyositis; two (8%) at acute stage; four (16%) whose muscles had both acute and chronic inflammation; three (12%) whose electromyography was normal and three (12%) with isolated electromyographic alterations in the tested muscles, thus not allowing the determination of a polymyositis diagnosis. These alterations led to the conclusion that dogs with visceral leishmaniasis, even with no muscular alterations at physical examination, may show an impairment of the muscular system that is compatible with chronic or acute polymyositis, confirmed by electromyography. There are divergences in the literature concerning the susceptibility of domestic cats to Leishmania sp. infection and its possible association with infection by feline leukenia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The purpose of the present study was to determine if there was an association between Leishmania, FIV and FELV infections in 211 adult cats from Arac¸atuba, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil, an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis diagnosis was based on serology by ELISA (cut-off: 0.365), IFAT (cut-off: 1:40) and direct parasitological examination by needle aspiration biopsy of lymph nodes and bone marrow. Serology for FIV and FeLV was determined by the SNAP Combo FeLV Ag/ FIV Antibody Test (IDEXX Laboratories). From the 211 cats, 16 (7.58%) had amastigote forms of Leishmania sp either in lymph nodes or in bone marrow without the presence of antibodies against Leishmania chagasi; two (0.94%) were both serologically and parasitologically positives and 12 (5.68%) were only serologically positives, totalizing 30 (14.21%) infected cats. From the 30 positive animals, in four (13.33%) were detected antibodies against FIV, and in one (3.33%) we detected the FeLV without antibodies against FIV. Twenty five (83.33%) cats were infected by Leishmania sp without FIV or FeLV infections, and eight (26.66%) cats had antibodies against FIV without evidence of Leishmania sp infection. These results suggest the absence of association between Leishmania sp., FIV and FeLV infection (p 4 0.005). Originally Sporadic reports of myositis can be found among clinical alterations caused by visceral leishmaniasis in dogs. The goal of this study was to determinate electromyographic alterations in dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi, with no locomotor alterations. The electromyography was made in four muscles (triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius) of 25 adult dogs from the Zoonosis Control Center (ZZC) from Arac¸atu-ba, Sa˜o Paulo, Brazil. The insertional activity was reduced in 19 dogs (76%). During electrical activity at rest, spontaneous fibrillation potentials, positive waves and repetitive complex discharges were identified in 13 animals (52). During the evaluation of the voluntary electrical activity, 18 dogs (72%) had an altered recruitment in at least one of the studied muscles, evidenced by the increase in the recruitment speed and the presence of small polyphasic potentials of short duration. The electromyographic results encountered in this study allowed the identification of 13 animals (52%) with chronic polymyositis; two (8%) at acute stage; four (16%) whose muscles had both acute and chronic inflammation; three (12%) whose electromyography was normal and three (12%) with isolated electromyographic alterations in the tested muscles, thus not allowing the determination of a polymyositis diagnosis. These alterations led to the conclusion that dogs with visceral leishmaniasis, even with no muscular alterations at physical examination, may show an impairment of the muscular system that is compatible with chronic or acute polymyositis, confirmed by electromyography. Originally Canine visceral leishmaniasis is a disease that can cause muscular atrophy. The ethiopathology of muscular alterations remains uncertain, but is often attributed to the catabolic nature of the disease. Aiming to identify the nature of muscular lesions, biopsies of the triceps brachii, extensor carpi radialis, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscles were made from 25 dogs naturally infected with Leishmania chagasi. The biopsies were performed under general anesthesia, with the protocol accepted by the Ethical Commission from the Veterinary Medicine Course from the Sa˜o Paulo State University. The samples were evaluated by the hematoxylin-eosin stain. Only one animal (4%) had all muscular samples within normality. In two dogs amastigote forms of the parasite were identified in muscular fibers. From 25 animals with visceral leishmaniasis, 20 (80%) showed degeneration and necrosis of muscular fibers; twelve (48%) developed a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting a myositis of an immunological nature; 15 (60%) developed a reducing in the diameter of the muscular fibers; 14 (56%) showed perimysial and endomysial fibrosis and 10 (40%) displayed adipose tissue in the endomysial and perimysial region, suggesting that the inflammatory myopathy was in a chronic stage. The histopathological alterations identified in the dogs of this study therefore confirm the occurrence of polymyositis in this disease and discard the possibility of a myoatrophy solely due to the catabolic nature of the disease. Originally Chronic inflammatory diseases of feline oral cavity are extremely common in daily clinical practice. Several factors may contribute in the development of gingivitis in cats: diet, oral conformation, infectious diseases and specific breed characteristics (juvenile gingivitis of Maine Coons). The etiology and pathogenesis of gingivitis in Maine Coons are still to be determined. Dysfunctions in the cellular im-mune responses have been reported in human patients with various forms of periodontal disease. This study was undertaken to assess the possibility that an abnormality in the systemic T lymphocyte subsets is involved in the etiology of chronic gingivitis of Maine Coon cats. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 43 client-owned Maine Coon cats, 20 with chronic gingivitis (scores 3 to 4 - WA-TERS et al., 1993) , and 23 without gingivitis. All 43 cats were negative for FIV and FeLV. CD41 and CD81 T lymphocytes counts were determined by flow cytometry. Mann-Whitney test was used to statistic analyze. A P value o 0.05 was considered significant. Maine Coons with gingivitis had lower levels of CD41 T lymphocytes than Maine Coons without gingivitis (1,132.6 AE 905.7 vs 1,891.2 AE 1,240.9, P o 0.05), but no significant difference was observed in CD81 count (1,405.2 AE1,509.2 vs 859.96 AE 480.92, P 4 0.05). The CD4:CD8 ratio were also lower in Maine Coons with gingivitis (1.3 AE 1.2 vs 2.29 AE 1.01, P o 0.05). The results showed that there is a correlation between the cellular immunity (based on lower CD41 count and lower CD4:CD8 ratio) and gingivitis in Maine Coon cats. However, it is impossible to know if these findings are the cause or consequence of chronic gingivitis. Studies of CD4:CD8 ratios in the peripheral blood of human patients with periodontal disease have yield disparate results. While there are reports that the CD4:CD8 ratio is decreased in patients with juvenile periodontitis, in others the CD4:CD8 ratio does not appear to be consistently altered. Thus, the utility of immunological measures as diagnostic aids for periodontal disease in general has not been established. Important points are highlighted, as a possible familiar or breed predisposition to low cellular immunity and consequent oral disease; or other factors that can influence the gingivitis in this breed (catteries environment, respiratory viral agents) and these may cause the onset of oral disease and subsequent decrease on cellular immunity. Further studies are necessary to investigate the pathogenesis of chronic gingivitis in Maine Coon cats and correlated factors. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) are emerging pathogens in companion animals. MRSA is associated with nosocomial infections, and the organism can be transmitted by fomites. Human studies have shown staphylococcal contamination rates of stethoscopes of 66% to 100%. We hypothesized that at least 60% of stethoscopes at the CSU-VTH are contaminated with 4 20 colony-forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus spp. per square centimeter, with a small percentage of these being MRSA and MRSP. The purpose of this study was to quantify CFU of staphylococci present on the diaphragms of 100 stethoscopes and determine the percentage of organisms that are MRSA or MRSP. Blood agar was used as the culture substrate. An MRSA enrichment broth-soaked swab was rubbed across the surface area of the stethoscope diaphragm and cultured in broth. 22% of all stethoscopes cultured positive for S. aureus (7%) or S. pseudintermedius (16%). One stethoscope produced both species. MRSA was cultured from 2%, and MRSP was cultured from 5%, of stethoscopes. Staphylococci of any species were found on 93% of stethoscopes. 6% were contaminated with 4 20 CFU of any Staphylococcus species. Only 3% were contaminated with 4 20 CFU of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius. One stethoscope each was contaminated with 4 20 CFU of MRSA and MRSP. Staphylococci were present on most stethoscopes, but only a small percentage were contaminated with methicillin-resistant organisms, as hypothesized. These results indicate that stethoscopes are potential fomites in the spread of nosocomial infections, and regular disinfection of this instrument should be employed. Enrofloxacin (ENR) is has low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against susceptible clinical isolates S. pseudintermedius (SI). In dogs and cats, ENR is metabolized to ciprofloxacin (CPR). Both ENR and CPR circulate in treated animals (in varying percentages of total drug) but the contribution each active agent contributes to killing of Si remains largely unknown. We determined the rate and extent of killing of Si by ENR and CPR alone and in combination based on clinically relevant drug concentrations. For MIC testing, 10 5 cfu/ml of SI strains were exposed to doubling drug concentrations of ENR or CPR in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth and following incubation under ambient conditions, the lowest concentration preventing growth was the MIC. For kill experiments, 10 5 cfu/ml were exposed to either 2.1 or 4.1 ug/ml (maximum serum drug concentrations based on dosages) of total drug (ENR 1 CPR in varying ratios respectively 50:50, 60:40, 70:30) and the reduction in viable cells (log 10 and % kill) were recorded at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes after drug exposure. All experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results averaged. For Si isolates, ENR and CPR MIC values ranged from 0.063 to 0.125 ug/ml -being lowest for ENR. When 10 5 cfu/ml were exposed to 2.1 ug/ml of ENR or CPR, growth to a 0.19 log 10 reduction (growth -36% kill) was seen after 15 minutes of drug exposureless killing was seen with CPR. For ENR/CPR drug ratios (2.1 ug/ ml total drug) of 50:50, 60:40 and 70:30, a 0.09-0.44 log10 reduction (9-64% kill) was seen following 15 minutes of drug exposure. When 10 5 cfu/ml of SI was exposed to 4.1 ug/ml of ENR or CPR, growth to a 0.26 log 10 reduction (growth À44% kill) was seen following 15 minutes of drug exposure -less killing was seen for CPR. For ENR/ CPR drug ratios (4.1 ug/ml total drug) of 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, a 0.05 -0.34 log 10 reduction (12-54% kill) was seen following 15 minutes of drug exposure; 25-64% kill by 30 minutes. Following 180 minutes of drug exposure, 88-4 99% of bacteria were killed by ENR, CPR and all ENR/CPR ratios investigated. ENR MIC values were low against the SI strains tested -0.063 ug/ ml. ENR killed SI strains more efficiently than CPR. ENR is metabolized to CPR and both active compounds simultaneously circulate in treated animals. Investigating the killing of SI with ENR/CPR in combination is useful. ENR and CPR were not antagonistic and may be additive. Enhanced killing may be related to differences in intrinsic activity of the compounds against SI strains and both drugs in combination enhance the potency of the commercial formulation. Killing was equivalent to or greater than each compound alone when ENR and CPR were together in the kill assays. Rapid killing may serve to reduce the likelihood for resistance selection and bacterial eradication has been linked to clinical recovery. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and vector borne agents of dogs and cats in the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota. Fecal samples were examined for parasites by microscopic examination after fecal flotation and for Giardia and Cryptosporidium by a commercial immunofluorescence assay (IFA). PCR was performed on Giardia and Cryptosporidium IFA positive samples and the isolates were genotyped using the glutamate dehydrogenase and by the heat shock protein-70 genes, respectively. Cat sera were tested for antibodies against Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and FIV antibody, as well as antigens of FeLV and Dirofilaria immitis. Dog sera were tested for antibodies against T. gondii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum as well as D. immitis antigen. Total DNA extracted from blood was assessed in PCR assays for DNA of Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., haemoplasmas, and Babesia spp. (dogs only). In the 84 dog fecal samples, Giardia spp was the most common parasite (32% by IFA; 11.9% by fecal float), followed by Taenia spp. (17.8%), Toxascaris leonina (9.5%), Toxocara canis (7.1%), Cryptosporidium spp. (7.1%), hookworms (3.5%), and Cystoisospora canis (2.3%). All nine feline fecal samples were negative. Nine Giardia spp. isolates were sequenced and were dog genotypes (5 were assemblage C and 4 were assemblage D). Four of the six Cryptosporidium spp. could be sequenced and were C. canis . Antibodies against T. gondii were detected in 15% of the 82 dog sera but all sera were negative for other antibodies as well as D. immitis antigen. Of the 32 cat sera, 37.5% had antibodies against Bartonella spp. and 6% had antibodies against T. gondii . FeLV antigen was detected in 10% of the cats but all were negative for D. immitis antigen and FIV antibodies. None of the 92 dog blood samples or 39 cat blood samples was PCR positive for DNA of the target agents. Enteric parasites in dogs and Bartonella spp. antibodies in cats were common on this reservation. As many of the agents have zoonotic significance, this information should be used to develop a preventive medicine plan could be implemented for the dogs and cats on this, and similar reservations. Molecular diagnostic assays (PCR) are now commonly being offered by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Cats with respiratory diseases thought to be from feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) and feline calicivirus (FCV) are being tested, but current molecular assays do not differentiate vaccine strains from natural strains. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact vaccination has on FHV-1 and FCV molecular diagnostic assay results from nasal and pharyngeal samples collected from healthy cats after inoculation. Nasal and pharyngeal samples were collected on days -7, -3, 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21 and 28 from 12, young adult, previously vaccinated, apparently healthy, mixed sex cats housed in two groups in separate research wards On day 0, six cats were administered a modified live FVRCP vaccine intranasally (Feline UltraNasal s . HESKA Corporation) and six cats were administered a modified live FVRCP vaccine SQ (Purevax Feline 3RCP; Merial). Total RNA and DNA were extracted from the sample using a commercially available kit. Presence of FHV-1 DNA, FCV RNA, and total RNA/DNA on each sample was determined using previously published assays. FHV-1 DNA was amplified from 2 of 237 adequate samples (0.8%); one cat in the SQ group was positive on one sample (pharynx, day 0) prior to vaccination and one cat in the IN group was positive on one sample (pharynx, day 3) after vaccination. FCV RNA was amplified from 10 of 237 adequate samples (4.2%); one cat in each group was positive on one sample (pharynx, day 0) prior to vaccination. After vaccination, three cats in the SQ group were positive for FCV RNA on one sample (Cat 1-nasal day 21; Cat 2-pharynx day 10; Cat 3-pharynx day 3) and four cats in the IN group were positive for FCV RNA on multiple samples (Cat 1-pharynx days 14 and 17; Cat 2-nasal and pharynx day 14 and pharynx day 21; Cat 4-pharynx day 7 and 14; Cat 6-nasal day 28 and pharynx day 21). FHV-1 DNA and FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from apparently healthy, vaccinated cats and which could represent current subclinical infection or shedding of vaccine strains. These findings should be considered when attempting to interpret results of molecular diagnostic assay results from clinically ill cats. The inability of traditional serologic testing, such as microscopic agglutination testing (MAT), to provide reliable data in acute cases of human and canine leptospirosis has led to the development of novel testing modalities. Currently, the most commonly used novel technique is quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). This modality, performed on whole blood, has been used successfully in the diagnosis of human and animal disease and is currently offered commercially by a number of veterinary laboratories. The common usage of available bacterin based canine Leptospira vaccines presents a unique challenge for the use of whole blood qPCR as a diagnostic tool, since recent vaccination might induce an artifactual false positive result if the targeted DNA fragment is present within the vaccine. This is especially problematic in the weeks after vaccination when high vaccinal MAT titers already complicate the diagnosis of true infection. The aim of this study was to assess whether the 2 currently available (in the US) 4 serovar vaccines induce a positive qPCR reaction in healthy recently vaccinated dogs. Following owner consent -20 student and staff owned dogs at Cornell University, College of Veterinary Medicine were enrolled in the study. Each dog was randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vaccine groups: A purified sub-unit vaccine (Fort Dodge Animal Health s ) or a microfiltered bacterin vaccine (Pfizer Animal Health s ). Both vaccines included Leptospira interrogans serovars Pomona, Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae and Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. A very sensitive (has been shown to be able to identify 1-2 leptospiral bacterial copies per sample) 16S qPCR assay previously validated for use in canine blood was utilized. Whole blood for qPCR and serum for MAT testing was collected from each dog prior to vaccination (day 0), as well as 3 and 7 days after vaccination and weekly thereafter for 8 weeks. Negative (canine blood, mastermix, water) and positive controls (cultured organisms diluted in canine blood and a standard curve) were run in triplicate on each plate as were the experimental samples. Both Leptospira vaccines produced a positive qPCR reaction when assayed undiluted or diluted 1:100 in canine blood. Vaccines not including Leptospira antigens, run as controls, were negative. All blood samples drawn at all time points for all vaccinated dogs were negative for the presence of Leptospira DNA. These results suggest that recent vaccination with the commonly used canine vaccines in the United States does not interfere with the use of qPCR for the identification of acute Leptospira infection in dogs. The ability of vaccines to prevent renal colonization and urinary shedding for at least 1 year after vaccination is an important objective when vaccinating dogs against leptospirosis. Little is known about the degree of success of many vaccines in achieving this goal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vaccination on renal colonization in experimentally infected dogs more than a full year following vaccination. Forty young dogs were divided into 2 groups: Vaccinates and controls. Vaccinates received 2 doses, 3 weeks apart of a multi-valent inactivated bacterin vaccine against 4 serovars of Leptospira spp. including Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa. Controls were unvaccinated. The groups were age and sex matched, and the dogs were allowed to co-mingle during the study. An intraperitoneal and subconjunctival challenge with Leptospira kirschneri serovar Grippotyphosa was given approximately 15 months after the second vaccine. The dogs were sacrificed on day 35 following challenge. Blood was tested by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a whole cell Leptospira ELISA and Western blot and blood and urine were cultured for Leptospira spp. on multiple days. Renal histopathology was evaluated and scored in a blinded fashion from all dogs. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed on DNA purified from 2 separate urine samples as well as from frozen renal tissue from all dogs in a blinded fashion using a16S qPCR assay previously validated for use in canine blood (L16). All dogs were determined to be serologically negative by MAT (for 4 serovars), Western blot and ELISA at the time of challenge. Vaccination significantly reduced the scores of qPCR (urine and renal tissue), renal histopathology, and blood, urine, and kid-ney reisolation (p o 0.001). Renal qPCR was positive in 10/21 control cases, and 2/19 vaccinates. Positive urine reisolation or qPCR results were not observed in any vaccinates, while 16/21 controls were positive on reisolation and 11/21 controls were positive on qPCR. This study demonstrates that vaccination can protect dogs from leptospiral colonization of the kidneys and urinary shedding even when the challenge occurs more than a year after vaccination and at the time of negative serologic tests including MAT. Hemoplasma (hemotropic mycoplasma) causes hemolytic anemia in infected domestic cats. There are three species of Mycoplasma known to cause hemoplasmosis, Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), Candidatus M. haemominutum (CMhm) and Candidatus M. turicensis (CMt). Mhf is known to be more pathogenic than the other two species. Most infected cats become asymptomatic carriers; however, immunosuppressed cats are likely to experience acute onset of disease. Previously, an epidemiological study concerning hemoplasma infections in cats was carried out in Japan. The number of cats included in this study was small and clinical information was limited. In the present study, we conducted a nation-wide molecular epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmosis to investigate its infection rate, clinical characteristics, and the identity of hemoplasma species. Blood samples were collected from cats admitted to 47 hospitals located in each prefecture from March-October 2008. Upon admission, the signalment and clinical background of these cats were recorded. Total DNA was extracted from blood samples, and PCR analysis to distinguish the three causative agents of hemoplasma was performed. The final number of cats included in this study was 1,770; 465 (26.3%) were infected with one or more species of Mycoplasma. The infection rate for each species was 5.1%, 21.0% and 6.7% for Mhf, CMhm and CMt, respectively. Co-infection was observed in 98 cases (5.5%) with Mhf1CMhm evident in 28 cases (1.6%), Mhf1CMt in six cases (0.3%) and dual CMhm1CMt infection apparent in 50 cases (2.8%). All three species were present in 14 cases (0.8%). The infection rate was generally lower than that reported in the previous Japanese study. This might be due to the difference of examined cat population. Furthermore, the infection rate obtained in this study was twice as high as those reported in European countries. Several risk factors of hemoplasma infection were also detected in examined cats. Male and adult cats with a history of bite wounds possessed a significantly higher risk of hemoplasma infection. Additionally, feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infections were coincidently observed with hemoplasma infection. These results seemed to suggest that the major infection route of hemoplasma may be direct transmission. This study clarified that hemoplasma is still widespread in Japan. The majority of cats do not exhibit anemia related to hemoplasma infection; however, the cats exposed to high risk factors should be examined for hemoplasma infection to avoid acute onset of the disease in future. and clinical signs of systemic disease are commonly due to enteric or respiratory involvement. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze confirmed cases of canine disseminated histoplasmosis to identify potential factors correlated to survival. Twenty seven cases of disseminated histoplasmosis were identified over a 13 year period (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) and 25 were included in the analysis. Infections were defined as disseminated on the basis of multiple organ involvement identified on necropsy, or clinical evidence of infection beyond the respiratory tract. Historical information collected included the use of immunomodulatory (eg. corticosteroid) therapy and the length of time of clinical signs prior to diagnosis. Upon presentation, all cases had the following recorded: age, weight, gender, rectal temperature, and the presence or absence of respiratory signs. Clinical data, at initial presentation, consisted of: HCT/PCV, WBC and platelet counts, serum glucose, total calcium, total protein, hepatic enzyme (ALT, ALP) and total bilirubin levels. Single versus multiple agent antifungal therapy was recorded, as was concurrent anti-inflammatory therapy with prednisone. Survival times were calculated from the time of diagnosis to death. Censoring time was calculated from diagnosis to last known follow up for dogs still alive. Twenty one of the 25 dogs (84%) were female and 12 dogs (48%) died or were euthanized as a result of disseminated histoplasmosis. Three dogs did not receive any antifungal therapy (1 died before therapy could be administered and 2 were euthanized at the time of diagnosis due to advanced disease and poor prognosis). Median survival time was 760 days (range 1 to 4 2,555 days). Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the relationship between survival hazard and the multiple explanatory variables. The model with the best goodness of fit contained five explanatory variables that were significantly associated with survival hazard: This study identified 5 variables significantly associated with survival hazard in cases of disseminated canine histoplasmosis. This data is also being used to formulate a scoring system that will be applied to cases to further assist in determining prognosis. Multiple topical treatments are often required for clinical cure of sinonasal aspergillosis. Inadequate distribution and retention of antifungal agents may influence outcome. The objective of this study was to evaluate distribution and retention of two commonly used antifungal agents in the nasal cavity and frontal sinuses of dogs with confirmed sinonasal aspergillosis using computed tomography (CT). Nine dogs were alternately treated with clotrimazole (1% in polyethylene glycol) or enilconazole (10 mg/ml; Imaverol s , Austrichter). Frontal sinuses were trephined, debrided and flushed with saline. Each agent was mixed with iohexol to a 5% solution and administered via the frontal sinuses and nasal cavity with dogs in sternal recumbency. Five minutes after completion of infusion CT of the nasal cavity was performed. Distribution and retention was scored from 1-4 at the canine tooth, premolar four, cribriform plate and frontal sinus on both sides, to a maximum of 32. Distribution and retention was excellent in the rostral nasal cavity in 8/9 dogs, but variable in the caudal nasal cavity. Retention within the frontal sinuses was poor in 7/9 cases. No obvious difference in retention between the two agents was observed, despite the difference in viscosity. Moderate to marked leakage into pharyngeal packing was observed in three dogs but did not consistently result in a lower overall score. Distribution and retention of liquid antifungal agents within the frontal sinuses is poor in clinical cases treated with trephination. This may influence outcome unless the sinuses are periodically refilled. ABSTRACT #307 CANINE EXPOSURE TO BORRELIA BURGDORFERI AND ANAPLASMA PHAGOCYTOPHILUM IN AN EMERGENT AREA: USE OF A MULTI-TARGET ELISA AT TWO GEO-GRAPHIC SCALES. P Rand 1 , E Lacombe 1 , B Cahill 1 , S Elias 1 , and R Chandrashekar 2 . 1 Maine Medical Center Research Institute, South Portland, ME. 2 IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME. Two canine serosurveys were conducted using a multi-target ELI-SA to detect canine antibodies to the agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi [Bb]) and anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [Ap]). The first was to determine the statewide distribution of the transmission of these agents, and the second to estimate the degree of transmission in an island community considering the need for vector control. Since first recorded in Maine in the mid 1980s, these ticks have become established and abundant in south coastal areas, have invaded inland to the higher elevations, and have recently been found in northern Maine. Annually reported human cases of Lyme disease have increased rapidly within the last 10 years to nearly 1000 in 2008. We first detected Ap in Maine deer ticks in 1995. Currently $20 human cases of human anaplasmosis are being reported annually. Canine Lyme disease, already prevalent in the last decade, has become a major veterinary issue in the southern half of the state, and horses have become infected as well. Canine anaplasmosis is now increasingly diagnosed in south coastal clinics. In 2007, during the heartworm testing season, we conducted a statewide canine serosurvey using an in-clinic ELISA which detects Dirofilaria immitis antigen and antibodies to Bb, Ap, and Ehrlichia canis (SNAP s 4Dx s test, IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). Seventy-eight veterinary clinics participated, providing results on 1087 dogs. All counties were represented. Canine Ap positivity varied sharply geographically. It was highest in south coastal towns ( 76.5%), $5-8% along the midcoast, and zero in interior and northern Maine. In Maine's southernmost county, where Lyme disease is hyperendemic, 36.0% of unvaccinated dogs were Bb positive, while $4% were positive in the state's 3 northern counties (including dogs in the northernmost town). Lyme vaccination varied widely in 2007; dogs with a history of vaccination were half as likely to be seropositive for Bb. In 2009, we repeated this protocol both on a Lyme endemic island and in nearby mainland towns. Six veterinary clinics provided 4Dx data on 65 island dogs and 573 off-island dogs from 30 mid-coastal towns. Island and mainland dogs were 3.1% and 3.4% positive for Ap, respectively, far less than in south coastal towns previously. In the 25% of both island and mainland dogs that were unvaccinated for Bb, Bb seropositivity was 25.0% and 18.9%, respectively. Thus, Bb transmission frequency on the island is approaching $70% of the level seen earlier in Maine's most hyperendemic county. The use of SNAP s 4Dx s test, a multi-target test has demonstrated a sharp geographic gradient in the transmission of Ap in an emergent area, a confirmation of the extent of Bb transmission in Maine, and a quantification of transmission risk to inform a concerned community. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is a well-accepted method used to test human and animal serum samples for evidence of vector-borne infection. While IFAs usually possess very good sensitivity, they have been shown to have reduced specificity due to antibodies which cross-react with common proteins among closely related organisms. The goal of this study was to compare the IFA with ELISA-based assays that use peptides derived from speciesspecific proteins or protein sub-domains found in the following organisms of interest: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Aph), Anaplasma platys (Apl), Ehrlichia canis (Eca), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Ech), and Ehrlichia ewingii (Eew). We compared the serological results from these five assays with those from three commercially available IFAs using samples derived from dogs experimentally infected with each of the five pathogens (23 dogs tested in total). At least three time points were tested; day 0, day 14-30 pi, day 60-90 pi. All samples from day 0 of the respective infection study tested negative on the peptide-based assays, but two were seropositive for E. canis by IFA. The following table summarizes by assay the number of dogs testing positive for antibody at a minimum of one time point post-infection. None of the peptide-based assays demonstrated evidence of cross-reactive antibodies as a result of other infections. Significant cross-species reactions (!2 dogs with IFA titers 4 1:64) were identified in A. platys-infected dogs with Aph IFA, E. chaffeensisinfected dogs with Eca IFA, and E. canis, A. platys, and E. ewingiiinfected dogs with the Ech IFA. While cross-reactivity within a genus is to be expected, reactivity across genera typically occurred at a lower endpoint dilution. Our data also suggests these peptide assays possess comparable sensitivity to IFA. The assays derived from species-specific analytes may offer an alternative to IFAs with comparable sensitivity, improved specificity and greater ease-of-use. Diarrhea is a common problem in shelter cats and enteric pathogens can contribute significantly to this problem. Stress and other factors of the shelter environment may contribute to infection and shedding rates of enteric pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of common enteric pathogens in cats housed in a shelter in north central Colorado. Fecal samples were collected from 46 healthy cats within 24 hours of entrance into the shelter and again seven days after admission. At Colorado State University, feces were assayed by centrifugal flotation and microscopic examination for parasites, IFA for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts, ELISA for Clostridium difficile toxin A/B (CD toxin), ELISA for C. perfringens enterotoxin (CP toxin), and culture for Salmonella spp. and Clostridium spp. An aliquot of each sample was sent to a collaborating laboratory (IDEXX) for PCR assays to amplify DNA or RNA of feline coronaviruses (Corona RNA), feline panleukopenia virus (Panleuk DNA), Tritrichomonas foetus, Giardia, Toxoplasma gondii, C. perfringens enterotoxin A (CP DNA), Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. The results of all assays are listed in Table. Only the panleukopenia PCR assay was positive in samples from more cats on Day 7 than on entry into the shelter. The results are shown as number of positive cats. The cat with Giardia positive results was positive by all three assays on entry and only by PCR on day 7. Feline panleukopenia virus was the only pathogen with increasing numbers of positive results after admission to the shelter which is likely to indicate acquisition of the virus after entrance to the shelter, either through infection or vaccination. The stress of housing or potential for pathogen exposure did not appear to affect the enteric pathogen shedding rates in these cats. In a previous study of feces from dogs in Colorado, 16.2% were positive for agents with zoonotic potential; Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were the most prevalent and are both infectious immediately when passed in feces. Dog parks are very popular in urban areas, but to our knowledge, no studies have attempted to correlate visits to dog parks and risk of colonization by these enteric parasites. The purpose of this study is to determine whether dog park visitation is associated with an increased prevalence of Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. in dogs owned by veterinary students at Colorado State University. Feces were submitted by the veterinary student owners with a completed survey form detailing dog park attendance rates, fecal character scores, and other clinical information. Feces were examined for parasite eggs, cysts, and oocysts by microscopic examination and for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. by a commercial IFA. Positive samples were genotyped using the glutamate dehydrogenase, b-giardin and triose phosphate isomerase genes for Giardia spp. and the heat shock protein-70 gene for Cryptosporidium spp.. Prevalence rates in dogs that did and did not attend dog parks were compared between by Fisher's exact test with significance defined as p o 0.05. Feces from 52 veterinary student dogs that attend dog parks and 42 veterinary student dogs that did not attend dog parks were analyzed. In the dogs that attended dog parks, five (9.6%) were Giardia spp. positive. Two of these dogs were coinfected with Cryptosporidium spp. and one had diarrhea. Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were not detected in veterinary student dogs that did not attend dog parks. Sequence analysis was available from four Giardia spp. isolates (two assemblage D, one assemblage C, one assemblage C and D mixed infection) and one Cryptosporidium spp. isolate (C. canis). The prevalence rates between the two populations were not statistically different (Fisher's exact test; p 5 0.062). The overall Giardia spp. prevalence rate (5.3%) in veterinary student dogs was not significantly different from a previous study of healthy, client-owned dogs in the same city (24 of 220 dogs; 11.4%; p 5 0.1405). While all Giardia spp. positive veterinary student dogs visited dog parks, the results were not significantly different from dogs that did not visit dog parks. The failure to show statistical differences could merely reflect the small sample size. All Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were the host adapted genotypes suggesting the infections originated from other dogs and that the dogs were unlikely to be zoonotic health risks. Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of probiotics in veterinary medicine with conflicting results. In previous studies with Enterococcus faecium strain SF68 (FortiFlora, Nestle Purina Pet-Care), we showed that supplemented healthy cats had increased %CD41 lymphocytes over time and supplemented cats with chronic FHV-1 infection had less conjunctivitis over time than cats administered a placebo. The purpose of this study was to determine if administration of SF68 lessens diarrhea in cats housed in a shelter. Stray or feral cats housed in two separate rooms were all fed a standardized diet and were administered SF68 or a placebo mixed with their food daily for eight weeks. A standardized fecal score system was applied to all samples daily by a person masked to the treatment groups and the percentages of cats with diarrhea of ! 2 days duration were calculated. A generalized linear mixed model using a bionomial distribution with treatment being a fixed effect and the room being a random effect was used to assess for statistical differences between treatment groups. Significance was defined as p o 0.05. The percentage of cats with diarrhea ! 2 days was 7.7% for the probiotic group and 20.7% for the placebo group. This result was significantly different (p 5 0.0297). These results suggest that administration of SF68 to cats housed in shelters may lessen the numbers of days with diarrhea. As this was a short term study, this effect was likely from probiotic influences on intestinal flora rather than systemic immune enhancing effects. C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the major positive acute phase proteins in the dog. It is produced in response to infection and inflammation, but is non specific as it is part of the innate host response. In humans, CRP has shown potential as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in a variety of neoplasms namely Hodgkin's lymphoma amongst others. In dogs, CRP is elevated in multicentric lymphoma and is useful in predicting complete remission status. Spirocerca lupi (S. lupi) is a nematode of canidae which commonly infests the esophagus, forming a nodule which can undergo neoplastic transformation into a sarcoma. Both benign and malignant nodules show histopathological evidence of inflammation. Currently the determination of malignant transformation is based on histopathology samples obtained via endoscopy, an invasive and expensive procedure. Samples obtained are often falsely negative due to the necrotic periphery of the tumor. The purposes of this study were to determine if serum CRP concentration is (1) elevated in spirocercosis, (2) could be used to differentiate benign from neoplastic cases and (3) could be used to monitor response to treatment in dogs with benign spirocercosis. Medical records of dogs diagnosed with spirocercosis, at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital, University of Pretoria, were reviewed for the period 1998-2009. Twenty eight confirmed benign cases and 14 confirmed malignant cases were selected. Six benign cases had follow up serum samples collected at least 2 weeks after treatment was commenced. Twenty one dogs presented for routine ovariohysterectomy were used as controls. Serum CRP concentrations were determined as a batch on serum stored at À801C, using an automated human CRP Turbidometric Immunoassay, previously validated for use in dogs. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t-test. The mean CRP concentration of the benign cases was 60.41AE48.02 mg/l (range 0-190.6 ) and that of the malignant cases was 76.52AE44.79 mg/l (range 3.1-152-6), both values were significantly higher (po0.001) than the control group (13.39AE17.94 mg/l). There was no statistically significant difference in the CRP concentrations between malignant and benign cases (p50.3). The mean CRP concentration for the six follow up sera was 1.73AE2.8 mg/l (range 0-6.6) compared to 86.96AE66.6 mg/l (range 0-157.3) before treatment. The convalescent sera had statistically significant lower concentrations of CRP compared to the concentrations at diagnosis (p50.01). Serum CRP concentration is elevated in both the benign and malignant forms of S. lupi cases confirming the intense inflammation observed on histopathology but it can not be used to differentiate between benign and malignant cases. CRP concentrations could potentially be used to monitor response to treatment in benign spirocercosis cases in the absence of other causes of inflammation. Feline ureteral obstructions have emerged as a common problem with increasing prevalence in clinical practice over the past few decades. Ureteral strictures are rarely reported as a cause of these obstructions. The purpose of this study is to describe a series of feline patients with ureteral strictures, including historical and diagnostic findings, treatment modalities, and clinical outcomes. Data from the medical records was retrospectively reviewed for patients with suspected ureteral strictures based on ultrasonagraphy, ureteropyelography, surgical exploration, or histopathology. Ten cats were diagnosed with a ureteral stricture based on consistent findings from at least two of the above criteria. At presentation, median age was 12 years, median creatinine concentration was 3.7 mg/dl, and median renal pelvis size was 10 mm.6/ 10 cats had ultrasonagraphic hyperechoic periureteral tissue at the stricture site. Four cats had a circumcaval ureter. Six cats underwent ureteral stenting, two had surgery alone, and two had no intervention. 7/8 cats had reductions in creatinine preceding discharge and six had persistently improved creatinine and renal pelvic parameters at their most recent re-examination. All patients survived to discharge with a median hospitalization of 10.5 days. Median survival time was 4 294 days (14-858 days) with 6/10 cats still alive. Ureteral strictures may occur in cats secondary to ureteral surgery, a circumcaval ureter, impacted ureterolithiasis, or for unknown causes. With appropriate and timely intervention, the prognosis for long-term survival is good. In addition to ureteral reimplantation or ureteronephrectomy, ureteral stenting or subcutaneous ureteral bypass may be considered as therapeutic options. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis now represent the second most common canine urolith in North America. As in people, these stones have a high rate of recurrence with a suspect genetic predisposition. The risk factors for these stones are poorly understood and current medical management does not preclude recurrence. Vitamin B6 deficiency is a risk factor in humans but this has not been evaluated in the canine population. The goal of the study was to develop an assay to detect Pyridoxyl-5-Phosphate (PLP) (active form of vitamin B6) in canine serum and assess dogs with and without calcium oxalate stones. A preliminary study of vitamin levels in predisposed versus non-predisposed breeds was also performed. A High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) assay was developed using pooled canine serum from the ISU Veterinary Medical Center clinical pathology laboratory. Serum from dogs with stones and without stones were light protected and stored at À801F within 12 hours of collection. Serum concentration of PLP was obtained using a standard curve with known concentrations of research grade PLP in water for each run. Recovery was also measured for each run using a known concentration of PLP in serum. Runs with recoveries lower that 80% were not allowed. For initial assessment for differences in serum concentration, dogs were separated into CaOx group (3 dogs) and non-CaOx group (4 dogs). Vitamin B6 concentrations in canine serum were unstable at 21 and À151C. Storage at these temperatures caused a rapid loss of 20% in two days and 50% at 14 days respectively. When stored at À801C for 14 days, approximately 100% remained. Freezing and thawing the samples resulted in minimal recovery loss after three cycles. The pilot study revealed that the dogs with calcium oxalate urolithiasis were significantly lower (p value o 0.05) in vitamin B6 concentrations than those without stones, with mean concentrations of 29 ppb (SD 5 18) and 123 ppb (SD 5 70) respectively. Preliminary results comparing serum concentrations of dogs of a predisposed breed (mean levels 55 ppb) to dogs not of predisposed breeds support a lower vitamin B6 level in predisposed breeds. An HPLC assay was successfully utilized to reliably measure serum vitamin B6 levels in canine serum and a deficiency relative to dogs without urinary stones was present in calcium oxalate forming dogs. A difference in vitamin concentrations was supported in an evaluation of a breed predisposed to these stones and dogs not predisposed. Vitamin B6 deficiency may prove to be a risk factor for calcium oxalate urolithiasis and further evaluation is currently underway. This study was designed to determine the pharmacokinetics of mirtazapine, an appetite stimulant, in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and age-matched controls (AMC) after administration of a single oral 1.88 mg dose. Two cats with stable CKD from each IRIS Stage (II, III and IV) were utilized. Six age-matched cats with normal CBC, chemistry and urinalysis served as controls. Blood samples were collected prior to and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours after oral administration of 1.88 mg of mirtazapine. Mirtazapine concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic modeling was performed. Increased vocalization and affection were the only side effects noted. Mean half-life was 16.4 1/À 5.1 hours (CKD) and 12.3 1/À 1.8 hours (AMC). Mean peak plasma concentration was 110.6 1/À 30.8 ng/ml (CKD) and 79.6 1/À 21.7 ng/ml (AMC). Mean area under the curve (AUC) was 770.7 1/À 225.5 ng/mlhr (CKD) and 555.5 1/À 175.4 ng/mlhr (AMC). Mean clearance was 0.61 1/À 0.1 L/hr/kg (CKD) and 0.79 1/À 0.16 L/hr/kg (AMC). Groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney test and a statistically significant difference in AUC and clearance was found (p 5 0.03 for both). The Spearman rank test identified a significant negative correlation between creatinine and clearance (p 5 0.002). CKD delays the clearance of mirtazapine. A single low dose of mirtazapine was well tolerated and resulted in a half-life that is compatible with 48 hour dosing intervals in cats with CKD. The present study evaluates methods of measuring inulin clearance as a marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in healthy cats without collecting urine. We evaluated inulin plasma clearance (C PLASMA ) and inulin infusion clearance (C INF ) in eight healthy cats and compared GFR values that were obtained from simultaneous measurements of standard inulin clearance (C STD ) and C INF . We collected blood and urine three times every 30 minutes from 45 min of starting a continuous inulin (INULEAD INJ s ) infusion. C STD was calculated from inulin levels in urine and the serum. [C STD 5 urine inulin (mg/ml) Â urine volume (ml/min) /serum inulin (mg/ ml)/body weight (kg)]. C INF was calculated from serum inulin level and infusion dose [C INF 5 infusion dose (mg/min)/serum inulin (mg/ml)/body weight (kg)]. Inulin was administered to the cats as a bolus and AUC was determined from the transition of the inulin blood level. C PLASMA calculated from the inulin dosage was divided by the AUC. Values for C STD (n 5 8), C INF (n 5 7) and C PLASMA (n 5 7) were 3.01 AE 0.57, 2.98 AE 0.52 and 2.83 AE 0.60 ml/min/kg, respectively. We found a correlation between C STD and C INF , but C PLASMA did not significantly correlate with either C STD or C INF . These results indicated that C INF is clinically useful for measuring GFR and urine sampling is not required in healthy cats. The present study evaluates methods of measuring inulin clearance as a marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in healthy dogs without collecting urine. We evaluated inulin plasma clearance (C PLASMA ) and inulin infusion clearance (C INF ) in 18 healthy dogs and compared GFR values that were obtained from simultaneous measurements of standard inulin clearance (C STD ) and C INF . We collected blood and urine three times every 30 minutes from 45 min of starting a continuous inulin (INULEAD INJ s ) infusion. C STD was calculated from inulin levels in urine and the serum. [C STD 5 urine inulin (mg/ml) Â urine volume (ml/min) /serum inulin (mg/ml)/ body weight (kg)]. C INF was calculated from serum inulin level and infusion dose [C INF 5 infusion dose (mg/min)/serum inulin (mg/ ml)/body weight (kg)]. Inulin was administered to the dogs as a bolus and AUC was determined from the transition of the inulin blood level. C PLASMA calculated from the inulin dosage was divided by the AUC. Values for C STD , C INF and C PLASMA were 4.19 AE 0.77, 3.95 AE 0.48 and 4.13 AE 0.66 ml/min/kg, respectively. We found a correlation on C STD vs. C INF (r 5 0.57, P o 0.05), C STD vs. C PLASMA (r 5 0.55, P o 0.05), and C INF vs. C PLASMA (r 5 0.57, P o 0.05). These results indicated that C INF and C PLASMA may be clinically useful for measuring GFR and urine sampling is not required in healthy dogs. Surgical renal ablation is a well established technique for modeling feline chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of the present retrospective study was to follow up a group of animals subjected to such renal mass reduction over a period of about 4.5 years, with a special focus on the development of azotaemia, uremia, hyperphosphataemia, anemia, serum accumulation of the nephrotoxin indoxyl sulfate, clinical symptoms of CKD, and survival. Towards the end of 2004, fourteen healthy young adult cats (7 males and 7 females) underwent surgical two-stage 11/12 renal ablation. Body weight was determined and blood samples were collected in the fasting state before the start of surgery as well as repeatedly between February 2005 and June 2009. All assessments were either clinical check-ups or were performed to obtain baseline values for subsequent testing of specific interventions. The minimum wash-out period between such studies was 10 months. Between successive studies, the animals were group-housed by gender. They were fed commercially available canned moist maintenance diets with mean analyzed values of 8.9% protein and 0.36% phosphorus in the original substance. Drinking water was always available ad libitum. Changes in body weight and clinical chemistry endpoints were statistically analyzed by a within subjects ANOVA with observation time points as levels of the repeated measures factor. Because time points were not equally spaced, the levels were weighted with the number of weeks elapsed since the start of surgical renal ablation. Changes were considered as statistically reliable when the associated probability did not exceed 5% (p o 0.05). At the first time point of post-surgical assessment, all cats showed a slight reduction of body weight compared to pre-surgical values and elevated serum levels of urea and creatinine. Five animals were lost to follow up due to an acute uremic crisis necessitating eutha-nasia. In the remaining survivors, clinical symptoms of CKD were not observed until the last observation. Body weights stabilized and even increased over time. Serum creatinine and urea values slightly decreased from post-surgical values and remained mildly increased without further exacerbation during the observation period. Serum inorganic phosphate and total calcium levels decreased over time but remained well within the reference range. White and red blood cell counts were normal at all observation time points with a slight but significant decrease of erythrocyte counts over time. Blood hemoglobin levels and packed cell volume also steadily decreased to achieve levels in the low reference range at the end of the 4.5 year observation period. The majority of animals showed mild accumulation of indoxyl sulfate in blood without significant changes over time. The results confirm that cats subjected to 11/12 renal ablation may well compensate their renal function over more than four years without clinically relevant signs of CKD progression. Previous studies have shown that molecular weight (MW) of urine proteins separated by SDS-PAGE correlates well with renal biopsy findings, considering proteins ! 60-70 kilodaltons (kDa) indicative of glomerular damage and proteins o 40-50 kDa indicative of tubular damage. However, there is a lack of consistency in these studies regarding the method of urine normalization. The objectives of this study were to: 1) compare urine SDS-PAGE results using urine normalized to either specific gravity (SG) or protein concentration to determine which normalization method corresponds best with renal biopsy; 2) compare visual versus software analysis of the gels. Urine samples submitted to the Texas Veterinary Renal Pathology Service in conjunction with renal biopsies from 25 client-owned dogs with renal disease were analyzed. Each sample was normalized to both SG (diluted to 1.0025) and protein concentration (0.3 ug/ul) and run on 4-12% non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained and scanned followed by analysis using BioNumerics. Protein bands were assigned a MW based on standards, and density of each band as a percent of total density of all bands was determined. For software analysis, the sum of band densities within 3 categories was determined: low MW bands (LMW: 0-40 kDa), intermediate MW bands , and high MW bands (HMW: 70-300 kDa). Glomerular damage was identified by ! 20% density of HMW bands or ! 60% density of IMW bands. Tubular damage was identified by ! 15% density of LMW bands or o 60% density of IMW bands. Gels were also analyzed visually, based on the number and intensity of bands within each MW category. Corresponding renal biopsies were assigned a numerical severity score of 0-3 for glomerular damage and 0-4 for tubular damage. Sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of the urine SDS-PAGE analysis for determining glomerular and/or tubular damage were determined. Based on histologic evaluation, 21 (84%) of the dogs had evidence of both glomerular and tubular damage, 2 (8%) had glomerular damage only, and 2 (8%) had tubular damage only. In conclusion, urine SDS-PAGE has high sensitivity and moderate to high specificity for detecting tubular and glomerular damage as compared to renal biopsies using urine normalized to either SG or protein concentration. Visual assessment of the gels is comparable to software analysis for glomerular damage but is more sensitive for tubular damage. Feline chronic kidney disease is a slowly progressive disease with a high prevalence in older cats. Oftentimes, it is not diagnosed until cats become azotemic. The objective of the present study was to investigate age associated changes in clinical markers associated with kidney function in apparently healthy cats. A cross sectional study was conducted with 96 apparently healthy American domestic shorthair cats, 29 males and 67 females. Cats used in the study were either castrated or spayed except two intact female cats. The age of cats ranged from 1.7 to 15.9 years. Healthy cats were defined as with normal physical examination by a licensed veterinarian, normal serum chemistry profile, normal complete blood count, and normal serum thyroxine level within three months prior to the study. All cats were immunized against feline panleukopenia, calici and herpes viruses, and rabies. Blood and urine samples were collected after the cats had been fed with a nutritionally complete and balanced dry cat food for at least 3 weeks. Cats had free access to water during the study. Food was withdrawn overnight before the sample collection. Serum creatinine, urea nitrogen and phosphorus (Hitachi 912 Automatic analyzer) as well as urine specific gravity (refractometer), creatinine (Hitachi 912 Automatic analyzer), and microalbumin (E.R.D.-HealthScreen) were measured. Both urine specific gravity and urine creatinine were inversely associated with age in cats. Urine specific gravity had a significant drop after cats were 9.8 years old (95% CI: 7.1, 12.5). Urine creatinine was positively associated with urine specific gravity (r 5 0.79, p o 0.01). Age had little effect on serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and phosphorus. Urine microalbumin was not affected by age either. These data show that urine concentrating ability diminishes with age as indicated by decreasing urine specific gravity. The diminishing urine concentrating ability escalated after about 10 years of age in cats, suggesting that urine specific gravity might be an early marker for kidney disease in apparently healthy cats. Urinalysis is an important part of veterinary clinical practice. However the storage of urine samples can influence the presence of crystal formation in the urine sediment. With the advent of centralization of many of the human medical laboratories, urinary preservative tubes have become popular. To date there has been no validation of these tubes in dogs and cats. The aim of this study was to validate the use of the BD Vacutainer TM plus urinalysis preservative tube (UAP), as compared to the standard plastic tube using urine from dogs and cats. Fresh morning urine samples were obtained from 6 dogs and 5 cats. Urine was obtained by free catch sample for 1 cat and 5 dogs and by antipubic cystocentesis for 1 dog and 4 cats. At least 15 mls of urine was obtained from each animal. Within 15 minutes of urine collection, the urine taken from each dog was transferred into three UAP tubes and three plastic tubes, and the urine collected from each cat was transferred into one UAP tube and one plastic tube. Between 7-8 mls was added to the UAP tubes and at least 2 mls (range 2-20 mls) into the plastic tubes. A fresh urine sample was analysed within 60 minutes of collection from both the plastic and UAP tubes. Within 30 minutes of collec- tion, the remaining aliquots were stored at room temperature for the UAP urine preservative tubes and at 41C for the plastic tubes. Samples were further analysed at 6 hours and 24 hours after collection. Urinalysis were performed using an automated dipstick analyser (Clinitek 50 by Bayer, using Multistix 10 SG urinary dipsticks by Siemens). Urine was then centrifuged for 5 minutes using the Heraeus multifuge 1 s and Heraeus Megafuge 1.0. Visual micropsy was performed using a Nikon microscope. Urine specific gravity (SG) was performed by refractometer (Reichert Temperature compensated hand held refractometer), and pH was measured using the Metler Toledo seven easy pH meter. Welch two sample t-test and Wilcoxon Rank sum were used to determine significant differences between time and analysis. Statistics programme R was used. There was no significant difference in biochemistry, SG, or pH between the two urine tubes at any time. At 24 hours the UAP tube samples had significantly less crystalline debris than the refrigerated plastic tubes (p-value 5 0.005328). The BD Vacutainer TM plus urinalysis preservative tube can be used for urine preservation in cats and dogs without affecting the biochemical parameters. The BD Vacutainer TM plus urinalysis preservative tube is better than the refrigerated plastic tube for preventing in vivo crystalline debris formation. The measurement of cytokine concentrations within body fluids provides a means to recognize subclinical and/or unresolved infectious or inflammatory states in patients. In the urinary tract such information could be useful in identifying asymptomatic bacteriuria, recurrent infections, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions. Complicating the development of reliable testing is the inherent biological nature of urine. Urine can vary widely in composition, as indicated by the range of pH and urine specific gravity (USG) observed in healthy patients. Other contributing variables include urinary protein and carbohydrate moieties that create a matrix capable of hindering immunologic testing modalities, such as ELISA. The purpose of this study was to optimize a sandwich ELISA capable of accurately measuring IL-6 within the urine of dogs. IL-6 is one of the primary inflammatory cytokines produced in the urothelium following exposure to bacterial virulence factors. Standard dilutions of a capture polyclonal goat anti-canine IL-6 antibody and a detection biotinylated goat anti-canine IL-6 antibody were utilized to optimize the chemiluminescent quantification of canine recombinant IL-6 within a dynamic range of 4 ng/ml to 15 pg/ml. Urine obtained from purpose bred beagles and/or clinical samples spiked with 4 ng/ ml of IL-6 failed to replicate the standard curve with cytokine quantitative recoveries as low as 30% in neat samples and o 70% after 1:64 dilutions. To counteract nonspecific binding of IL-6 to matrix components, reagent diluents composed of bovine serum albumin combined with goat serum, proprietary calcium chelators, and/or proprietary non-mammalian proteins were tested. Diluents containing calcium chelation combined with non-mammalian proteins achieved the best results, improving quantitative recovery of IL-6 in the spiked samples to 4 75% for all dilutions. The increased recovery came at the cost of reducing the range of IL-6 detection to 4 ng/ ml-62.5 pg/ml. The effects of pH and USG variability on the ELISA were also assessed. Identical urine samples with an adjusted pH range of 5.5 to 9.5 revealed no appreciable effect on urine IL-6 measurements with quantitative recoveries all within 1/À 15% of each other. USG was more variable as spiked undiluted samples with USG o 1.015 had significantly (p o 0.01) lower quantitative recoveries compared to samples with USG between 1.030 and 1.040. There was no significant difference when comparing undiluted samples with USG of 1.015-1.040, however the quantitative recoveries did vary from 55%-85%. The use of matrix neutralizing agents was able to improve a previously unacceptable ELISA allowing for the measurements of IL-6 within the urine of dogs. The testing is imperfect as urine variables such as USG can alter IL-6 recovery and hence may underestimate IL-6 concentrations by as much as 45% for samples with USG o 1.015. For many tests this would be diagnostically un-acceptable however given that IL-6 is not found within the urine of healthy individuals, absolute values are less critical than relative amounts of cytokine present. There is a need for non-invasive methods to reliably identify tubulointerstitial disease in its early stages in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Proteomic techniques are powerful tools that can aid in the discovery of new biomarkers of renal injury. The objective of this study was to identify predictive biomarkers of early tubulointerstitial injury in urine of male dogs with X-linked hereditary nephropathy (XLHN) using SELDI, which is a proteomic technique that combines chromatography with mass spectrometry to detect proteins and protein fragments. Urine samples from male dogs (n 5 6) with XLHN were analyzed. Dogs with XLHN have a gene defect that causes the type IV collagen in their glomerular basement membranes to be abnormal. Affected males develop glomerular lesions and progressive tubulointerstitial injury that lead to end-stage CKD during adolescence. Samples were compared at two timepoints: 1) at the onset of a urine protein:creatinine (UPC) of persistently 4 2; and 2) at the onset of a serum creatinine ! 1.2 mg/dl (mildly azotemic). Albumin was removed from samples by affinity chromatography and samples were concentrated with ultrafiltration. Samples were normalized to protein concentration and applied to cationic (CM10), metal-binding (IMAC30), and hydrophobic (H50) chips with a SPA or CHCA matrix applied. Optimization was performed for protein concentration, buffer ratio, matrix type and concentration, and laser intensity. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed. Peak reproducibility was acceptable for the IMAC30 and CM10 chips using the SPA matrix and was marginally acceptable for the H50 chip using the CHCA matrix. The greatest number of total peaks was obtained with the IMAC30 and CM10 chips (123 and 101, respectively). Among all chips, there were 53 unique, well-defined, statistically significant peaks and/or peak regions. Of these, 33 peaks had higher intensity (implying greater abundance) in the samples obtained during the later timepoint (mass range: 2-157 kDa) while 20 peaks had higher intensity in the samples obtained during the earlier timepoint (mass range: 3-22 kDa). PCA analysis showed a clear difference between the two timepoints. Peaks and/or peak regions at approximately 4.4, 8.5, 9.7, 11.5, 20.6, 25, 51 , and 100 kDa accurately distinguished between the two timepoints and were identified by more than one chip type. In summary, the CM10 and IMAC chips using a SPA matrix produced the best results for these modified urine samples. Regarding the statistically significant peaks, more abundant protein was generally present as renal disease progressed, especially for those peaks 4 20 kDa. Peaks at 11.5 and $21 kDa are similar to those identified as markers of renal disease in a previous veterinary study, while the remaining peaks may serve as candidates for novel markers of early renal disease. Renal failure is treated by peritoneal dialysis, but the catheters often cause difficulties. We designed a new method of implanting disk-type PD catheters and compared it with the conventional straight catheters. Four healthy dogs were anaesthetized using isoflurane, placed in the dorsal position and disinfected. A catheter was inserted through a small incision made 3$5 cm above the umbilicus. The tip of the cath-eter was positioned at the bladder side for the conventional procedure, and the catheter disk was positioned between the liver and the diaphragm during the new procedure. Peritoneal dialysis was performed using 500 ml of dialysate and the amount drained and time required for drainage were measured. We collected 4 100% of the infused dialysate within 30 minutes using the new method, whereas the catheter became obstructed using the conventional procedure which rendered dialysate collection impossible. These results indicate that our new procedure is effective for performing peritoneal dialysis in small animals. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a test food on whole blood gene expression profiles when fed to cats with appendicular degenerative joint disease (DJD). Thirty-one domestic short hair cats (initial weight, 4.2 AE 1.27 kg, age, 12.1 AE 2.98 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with DJD were included in the study. All cats were fed a control food for 28 days followed by a test food. The test food contained increased levels of DHA and EPA, methionine, manganese, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on the test food. After consuming the test food for 14 days, cats with DJD had decreased expression of the 6 genes (INDO, ANXA1, MMP8, CD79a, ODC1, and STXBP2) previously identified to be up-regulated in DJD versus healthy geriatric cats. These genes are associated with cartilage degradation, B cell function, polyamine synthesis, and protein trafficking. In summary, feeding the test food to cats with DJD resulted in reversal of the gene expression patterns previously observed in the blood of cats with DJD versus healthy geriatric cats after 14 days. Furthermore, this study helps increase the understanding of how the test food may aid in improving mobility in cats with DJD at the molecular level. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM on selected arthritis related genes in whole blood when fed to dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Thirty-one beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.5 AE 1.27 kg, age, 11.0 AE 2.23 years) with lameness and radiographic changes consistent with OA in at least one joint were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM . Canine j/d contains increased levels of EPA and DHA, glucosamine, chondrotin sulfate, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food and after 14 days on canine j/d. Improved orthopedic exam scores were noted in these dogs after 14 days on canine j/d. After consuming canine j/d for 14 days, OA dogs had increased expression of 22 genes (IL-6, ADAMTS-4, IFNG, HAS2, BGN, SOX-9, ADAMTS-5, MMP3, ACP5, IL1A, TNC, HAS3, COMP, IGF-1, GHR, Xaa-Pro Peptidase, RANKL, SMAD7, PGE2, TLR9, PLOD1, and SCL2A9) that were previously demonstrated to be down-regulated in OA versus healthy geriatric dogs and decreased expression of ANXA1 that previously was shown to be up-regulated. In summary, feeding canine j/ d to dogs with osteoarthritis resulted in reversal of the gene expression patterns previously observed in the blood of arthritic versus healthy geriatric dogs after 14 days. Furthermore, this study helps increase the understanding of how Prescription Diet s canine j/d TM improves mobility in arthritic dogs at the molecular level. The aim of this study was to determine whether a therapeutic diet with increased levels of manganese, methionine, n-3 fatty acids, and reduced n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio was effective in the management of cats with historical, clinical and radiographic signs of appendicular degenerative joint disease (DJD). 47 adult cats were recruited prospectively from 21 veterinary clinics in Europe for an open-label clinical trial. The cats underwent a veterinary examination that included scoring the severity of overall arthritic changes on a scale of 1-5 for the presence of lameness, joint swelling, reduction in joint movement and pain on joint manipulation. Owners were also asked to score (on a scale of 1-5) seven aspects of their cat's mobility including the cat's willingness and ability to jump, presence of stiffness or pain, the amount of time spent playing and interacting, grooming behavior and overall activity levels. Cats were transitioned onto the therapeutic diet over 7 days and then fed the diet exclusively for 30 days after which time the clinical evaluation and questionnaires were repeated. Following feeding of the therapeutic diet, there were significant improvements seen in all of the parameters evaluated. The most marked and frequent changes seen were an improved ability to jump, reduced stiffness, increased activity, reduced lameness and reduced pain on joint manipulation. The results of this study suggest that feeding the therapeutic diet may have a significant impact on the morbidity associated with feline DJD and that comparison to a scientific control diet is warranted to confirm these observations. Previously The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of an experimental food with increased levels of manganese, methionine, n-3 fatty acids as an aid in the management of clinical signs associated with feline osteoarthritis. The food was tested in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial involving 172 client owned adult cats with clinical signs and radiographic changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Cats were assigned to receive the experimental food or a control food for 12 weeks. The cats were evaluated at 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of feeding. Cat owners evaluated 15 signs associated with mobility and behavioral changes, and veterinarians conducted orthopedic evaluations to assess overall arthritic condition, lameness, joint swelling, range of motion, and pain on palpation of each affected joint. Based on the veterinarians' evaluation of the cats presenting with moderate or severe arthritis, a significantly higher proportion fed the experimental food (61%) showed improved arthritic conditions within four weeks compared to the control food (37%). Cats pre- senting with mild arthritis signs at the start of the study responded less favorably to the dietary therapies when compared to the moderate or severe arthritic cats based on veterinary orthopedic evaluations and pet owner assessment of overall arthritic condition. Given that cats presenting with moderate or severe arthritis responded positively and more rapidly to the experimental food than to the control food within 4 weeks, the role of n-3 fatty acids, methionine and manganese in the management of cats with arthritic signs requires further investigation. Previously presented at the 19th Annual ECVIM Congress, Porto, Portugal, September 2009. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM on inflammatory biomarkers and gene expression in healthy geriatric dogs. Twenty-nine geriatric beagle dogs (initial weight, 13.51 AE 1.66 kg, age, 10.7 AE 2.33 years) were included in the study. All dogs were fed a control maintenance food for 28 days followed by Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM . Canine b/d contains increased levels of omega 3 fatty acids, lipoic acid, antioxidants from a fruit and vegetable blend, Vitamins C and E, and L-carnitine. Serum and whole blood samples were collected on the last day of the control food (day 0) and after 14 days on canine b/d. Inflammatory and hormone biomarkers as well as gene expression changes were measured. RNA was extracted according to the procedures provided in the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit Handbook (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was hybridized to an Affymetrix GeneChip Canine-2 Genome Arrays and normalized using Robust Multi-Array Average. Transcripts having a P o 0.05 (following a false discovery rate adjustment value of 0.2) and a fold change range of at least 1.25 were considered different. After consuming canine b/ d, geriatric dogs fed Canine b/d had lower IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, KC, and total cytokines. No differences in hormone biomarkers were detected. Geriatric dogs fed Canine b/d also had 1123 genes that were up or down regulated compared to day 0. Of these, genes associated with amyloid beta plaque formation were down-regulated while genes associated with clearance of beta amyloid plaque were up-regulated. In addition, genes associated with neurotransmitter signaling and cell adhesion were significantly up-regulated when geriatric dogs were fed Canine b/d compared to the day 0 on the control. This study provides gene expression evidence that support the benefits observed in geriatric dogs for memory and behavior associated responses previously shown with Prescription Diet s canine b/d TM . Non-sedated healthy adult cats (5.11/À1.7 kg) withheld from food for 12-hrs were used to 1)validate an open-flow indirect calorimetry (IC) system determining REE, 2) validate a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA) device estimating total body water (TBW) for LBM calculation, and 3) normalize REE against LBM. Using 5-point body condition scoring, 7 under-conditioned ( 2.5/5), 29 normal-conditioned (3.0-3.5/5), and 21 over-conditioned (! 4.0/5) cats in stable body weight were studied. Cats had continuous IC measurements recorded over 45-min after acclimation to a plexiglass chamber; cage flow regulated with mass flow controllers was confirmed with nitrogen dilution. IC was calibrated using span gases and alcohol combustion. Lowest values (least-observed-metabolism) were analyzed. IC intra-and inter-assay comparisons were made using CV%, ANOVA, and Bland-Altman analyses (bias, 95% limits of agreement). Daily energy expenditure (DEE; n 5 12) was estimated using doubly-labelled water. Criterion references (deuterium, sodium bromide) validated MF-BIA to determine scaling factors for resistivity settings (iterative model fitting). Optimal body posture, electrode positions, and body-segment path were determined. Criterion reference and MF-BIA volume comparisons were made using paired T-tests, Bland-Altman analyses, and Pearson's correlation test. Intra-and inter-assay MF-BIA volumes were compared using ANOVA for repeated measures and CV%. P 0.05 was considered significant. Mean REE (176.3 1/À 52.8 kcal) had 30% inter-individual CV% with intra-and inter-assay CV% ranging from 1.5-14%; differences were not significant. REE represented 61.3 1/À 14.3% DEE. Sternal posture with electrode positioning and body-segment path in neck-tail configuration was optimal. Inter-assay CV% ranged from 6.6-10.1% for TBW, 2.8-6.9% for extracellular water, 8.7-12.1% for intracellular water, and 6.6-10.1% for LBM. MF-BIA LBM significantly correlated with the criterion reference (P o 0.0001). Over-and under-conditioned cats had significantly lower and higher REE (kcal)/kg compared to normal-conditioned cats, respectively (P 0.001). However, differences disappeared when REE was normalized with LBM. For normal-, under-, and over-conditioned cats, REE (kcal)/kg was 36.6 1/À 7.7, 50.0 1/À 9.7, and 28.5 1/À 6.3, whereas REE (kcal)/LBM (kg) was 54.7 1/À 18.7, 54.8 1/À 12.9, and 54.7 1/À 18.8, respectively. IC and MF-BIA systems validated herein reasonably estimate REE and LBM in non-sedated cats and suggest that REE should be normalized using LBM rather than allometric scaling formulas. Lipoic acid is a coenzyme of several enzyme complexes involved in energy metabolism. It also functions as a biologic antioxidant attributable to its thiolane ring structure which undergoes oxidationreduction chemical reactions. Previous work has shown lipoic acid to act as an antioxidant in dogs but it is unknown what the lowest effective supplementation is for antioxidant benefits. As such the antioxidant effects of graded levels of lipoic acid inclusion in dry dog food were evaluated in 50 dogs. Racemic alpha-lipoic acid was added to a control food (C) at levels of approximately 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 150 ppm and 300 ppm on a dry matter basis for administration to the five different groups (n 5 10 per group). All other dietary constituents were held constant in the formulation. All 50 dogs (M 5 25, F 5 25) were fed the control food for 2 months prior to allocation into groups. Serum chemistry, complete blood count, vitamin E, GSH:GSSG ratio, malondialdehdyde, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, CD4:CD8 ratio, body weights and fecal scores were evaluated monthly for 3 months. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures procedure with day 0 and concentration of vitamin E in serum as covariates. The concentration of vitamin E in serum was used as a covariate because lipoic acid has been shown to spare vitamin E. Adjusted means of the GSH:GSSG ratio for the different groups were as follows; B 5 13.1 AE 2.2, 0 5 16.8 AE 2.5, 100 ppm 5 16.3 AE 1.8, 150 ppm 5 19.3 AE 1.7, 300 5 16.9 AE 1.8. Supplementation with lipoic acid resulted in a significant increase (P o 0.05) of GSH:GSSG ratios in foods for adult dogs at all inclusions administered above control. There were no significant differences between groups in which lipoic acid was added for the previous GSH:GSSG ratios, however, the highest adjusted mean occurred at the 150 ppm inclusion level. No significant improvements were noted in the other outcomes measured and, no adverse changes were observed in either clinical chemistry or complete blood count analyses at any time points. In conclusion, addition of racemic lipoic acid to dry dog food resulted in a significant antioxidant benefit with no adverse effects noted at doses lower than 150 ppm as previously reported. Specific biologic benefits other than antioxidant activity remain to be determined. A prior study showed that a high protein, low carbohydrate, moderate fiber food induced ketosis in obese cats during weight loss. The objective of this study was to determine the effect dietaryinduced ketosis on body composition during weight loss in obese cats. 16 obese cats (body condition score 4 4; 5 point scale) were randomized to be fed a dry or wet formulation of a high protein, low carbohydrate, moderate fiber food for 24 weeks. Food intake was restricted for the duration of the experiment to cause weight loss. Daily food amount was based on ideal body weight (20% body fat) energy requirements (kcal offered per day 5 0.7 Â (70 Â initial body weight (kg) 75 )). The amount of food offered daily to each animal was calculated by dividing the amount of calories to be offered by the caloric density of the food (kcal/kg). Use of this equation was estimated to allow animals to lose body weight at a rate of 0.5 to 1.5% of their initial body weight per week. Initial body composition was determined by DEXA. Ideal body weight was estimated by calculating fat-free body mass from the DEXA analysis and adding 20% fat to this total. Both groups were compared for rate of weight loss, body compositional changes as measured by DEXA, and clinical chemistry changes every 4 weeks. The study concluded when a cat attained ideal body weight or 24 weeks. Obese cats in both food groups had increased serum levels of bhydroxybutyrate (BHBA) by week 8. Cats fed the wet food maintained higher levels of BHBA throughout the study. Cats fed the dry food had BHBA levels return to baseline by week 12. No other changes in clinical chemistry were observed. The rate of weight loss did not differ between the two formulations (wet, À7.3 g/d; dry, À6.9 g/d). Most of the body weight change was related to change in body fat tissue (dry, À7.6 g/d; wet, À6.5 g/ d). Cats fed the wet formulation lost very little lean tissue (À0.8 g/d; or 4% compared to baseline) during the 24 week study. Cats fed the dry formulation gained a small amount of lean tissue 0.8 g/d) during the study. These data indicate that a low-fat, high-fiber, high-protein diet induces ketosis, provides effective weight loss, and maintains lean body mass. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of age, gender, and body weight on the body composition in grown cats. A cross sectional study was conducted with 95 healthy grown American Shorthair cats, 29 male and 66 female. All cats used in the study were either castrated or spayed except two intact female cats. The age of cats ranged from 1.7 to 15.9 years. Healthy cats were defined as with normal physical examination by a licensed veterinarian, normal serum chemistry profile, normal complete blood count, and normal serum thyroxine level within three months prior to the study. All cats were immunized against feline panleukopenia, calici and herpes viruses, and rabies. Cats were housed with 10 -12 other cats in spacious rooms with natural light that varies with seasonal changes. Cats experienced behavioral enrichment through interactions with each other, by daily interaction and play time with caretakers, large windows and sun porches to watch the natural landscape and access to toys. Cats were fed with a nutritionally complete and balanced dry cat food for at least 3 weeks before body composition measurement. Food was continuously available throughout the day until their daily caloric requirements were met. The body composition was measured with a dual x-ray absorptionmetry (Hologic; Hologic, Inc, MA). Body weight significantly affected (p o 0.05) body composition of grown cats. Age and gender had no effect (p 4 0.05) on the body composition. Bone mineral content (r 5 0.93, p o 0.01), bone min-eral density (r 5 0.67, p o 0.01), total lean body mass (r 5 0.86, p o 0.01), total fat body mass (r 5 0.87, p o 0.01), and percent fat body mass (r 5 0.64, p o 0.01) were positively while percent lean body mass (r 5 À0.63, r o 0.01) was negatively associated with body weight in grown cats. These data show that body weight is a major predictor of the body composition of healthy grown cats. Age and gender have little effect on the body composition of neutered grown cats. A study was conducted to evaluate the affect of dietary crude protein and lysine:calorie ratio in healthy adult and geriatric cats on body composition and kidney health. The study utilized 25 healthy adult (5.6 AE 0.81 years of age (range 5-7)) and 25 geriatric American short hair cats (11.1 AE 2.1 years of age (range 8-15), initially 4.64 AE 1.18 kg.Cats were blocked by age, gender, urine specific gravity, and body fat and assigned to one of five experimental maintenance foods (34% crude protein (CP), 34% CP with ideal amino acid balance, 34% CP with 5.5 lysine:calorie ratio, 44% CP, or 54% CP) for the 180 day feeding period. Chemistry screens, glomerular filtration rate, serum bone biomarkers, serum and urine kidney biomarkers, DEXA scans, and microalbuminuria were evaluated at day 0, 30, 90, and 180. No differences in kidney function as measured by glomerular filtration rate, microalbuminuria, urine specific gravity, serum creatinine, urine creatinine, or urinary biomarkers of kidney function were detected. Body weight and fat changes over time were unaffected by dietary treatment. Most interestingly, cats fed the 44% and 54% CP treatments had decreased bone mineral density (P o 0.01) at day 180, bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) (P o 0.05) at day 90, and BAP:NTX (N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) ratio (P o 0.05) at day 90 indicating greater bone turnover compared to the 34% CP 5.5 lysine:calorie ratio food. This study suggests that feeding foods containing crude protein levels of 34-54% do not affect kidney health, lean muscle mass, or fat mass in healthy adult and geriatric cats. However, feeding high CP foods (44% and 54%) appears to have negative consequences on bone mineral density through increased bone turnover. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding a low protein therapeutic renal food on lean body mass in senior cats. Hill's Prescription Diet s Feline k/d s dry (28.2% crude protein, 22.6% crude fat 0.52% phosphorus and 0.24% sodium on dry matter basis (DMB)) was fed for maintenance (average intake 46.2 AE 2.6 grams) to twelve senior cats (average age 5 10.05 AE 2.20 years (range 7 to 13 years); average weight 5 5.49 AE 1.03 kg; average creatinine 5 1.23 AE 0.07 mg/dL) for a period of four months. Cats were group housed and had free access to water. Additionally, cats were offered enrichment toys, received routine grooming, and had daily opportunities for socialization with other cats and people. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; DXA-QDR-4500, Hologic, Inc., Waltham, MA) scans were performed at months 0, 2 and 4 to assess the effect of the food on body weight, total fat mass, lean body mass and bone mineral content during the study. Cats consuming this food maintained total body weight, total fat mass, lean body mass and bone mineral content throughout the study. In summary, senior cats fed a low protein (28.2% crude protein on DMB) therapeutic food for maintenance were able to maintain body weight and lean body mass. Established reference intervals for biochemical analytes in normal adult cats are likely based on values from cats consuming diets with a low to moderate level of protein and may not accurately reflect values in cats consuming a diet high in protein. If cats consuming high protein diets have higher serum renal values, they may be inappropriately switched to a renal diet early in life based on suspicion for renal disease. The objective of this study was to determine whether healthy cats eating diets high in protein have higher serum renal values without a corresponding change in renal function. Twenty-four $3-year-old adult neutered female cats in a research colony were evaluated. Twenty-three cats were assessed to have a normal body condition score of 5/9 and to be clinically normal by physical exam, complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis. They were FeLV/FIV negative. One cat was excluded due to renal insufficiency. A single cross-over design feeding study was used, with the cats acting as their own controls. The two diets compared were Purina DM (54.24% protein) and Purina NF (28.67% protein). The diets were selected based on their protein contents and made similar with respect to carbohydrates and total fat content by adding 4.7 g vegetable oil/100 g diet to the Purina NF diet. All diets were complete and balanced to meet the known dietary needs of young adult cats. Cats were fed one diet for the first 4 weeks and the second diet for the final 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period in between these two periods. Hills adult maintenance was used as the washout diet. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, phosphorus, albumin, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured at biweekly intervals. The effect of the two diets on these analytes was assessed using a linear mixed model framework including cat identification nested within sequence as a random effect. Diets, treatment periods, a diet and treatment interaction term, and baseline measurements after the run-in and wash-out periods were included in the models. Normality of the residuals was assessed visually. Results are presented as least squared means AE standard errors. All values measured were statistically significant between the two diets but remained within their respective reference interval. In summary, dietary protein concentration appears to have a statistically significant effect on several serum biochemical analytes, and in particular BUN and albumin concentration are both increased by a diet with high protein content. However a longer feeding period may be needed to demonstrate clinical significance. This study evaluated the effects of age on cell killing ability of neutrophils and on the expression levels of specific mRNA neutrophil migration or killing function genes. Three groups of Beagle dogs were evaluated in a cross sectional study design: puppies less than 1 year of age (n 5 15), adults 1 to 7 years of age (n 5 37), and senior adults over 8 years of age (n 5 25). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA. Neutrophil phagocytosis and killing of Lactococcus lactis was assessed, and the relative abundance of mRNAs for myeloperoxidase (MPO), Lselectin, interleukin-8 receptor (IL-8R), and interleukin-1b-converting enzyme (ICE) was determined. Results showed a significant effect of age on percent bacterial killing by neutrophils with phagocytic ability at 4 and 10 years of age reduced by 25% and 39% (compared to 1 year of age), respectively. In addition, younger dogs had significantly higher levels of mRNA for IL-8R, L-selectin, and ICE. These results suggest that older dogs have depressed innate immune responses compared with younger dogs, which may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality with aging. Additional studies are needed to determine how dietary modifications can enhance neutrophil functions in adult and senior Beagle dogs. Two studies were used to evaluate the effect of dietary protein varying from 15% to over 30% dry matter (DM) protein on the senior dog's ability to maintain lean body mass (LBM). All dogs were exercised daily, and were provided with regular opportunities for socialization and environmental enrichment. Dog enrichment included toys in their enclosures, paired housing for a portion of each day, and trips to an indoor and/or outdoor group socialization area. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc., Topeka, KS, USA. In the first study, 70 beagle dogs (average age 13.8 years) were fed one of five different foods with protein concentrations, with or without added amino acids, varying from 15.4 to 30.7% dry matter (DM) protein. In all treatments, over the six month period there was a numeric increase in lean body mass. There was no linear or quadratic effect of protein or amino acid supplementation on LBM. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased linearly with dietary protein concentration, and normal albumin, hematocrit and hemoglogin were maintained. In the second study a food designed for nutritional support of animals with renal disease (Prescription Diet s k/d s ) with 14.8% (DM) protein was fed for four months to 34 healthy adult dogs (average age 13.0 years). This resulted in an increase in LBM (P o 0.05), a decrease (P o 0.05) in creatinine and BUN, and no change in albumin. In conclusion these data show that controlling dietary protein concentration to levels (15% DM) of highly digestible protein, used in some foods designed for aid in the management of renal disease is sufficient to meet the protein requirement of the senior dog. The quantity of increased fluid intake needed to produce a significant risk reduction for urolith formation in cats has not been defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of graduated increases in fluid intake on urinary relative supersaturation (RSS) for calculogenic substances in healthy cats. Six healthy adult cats fed a commercial dry maintenance food were used. Cats were housed separately in metabolic cages and allowed free access to food and water. Water intake was measured daily for 3 weeks (wk). During wk 2 and 3, 0.9% saline was administered daily to each cat at 1 Â or 2 Â their individual basal water intake determined in wk 1. All fluids were administered subcutaneously (SQ) in 2 divided doses using a standard drip administration set and a 20 g needle. A 24 h urine collection was performed at the end of each 7 day period for analysis of metabolic analytes used to calculate RSS for struvite (RSS struvite), calcium oxalate monohydrate (RSS caox mono), and RSS for calcium oxalate dihydrate (RSS caox di) using EQUIL 1.51b. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Mean water intake (mls/kg/day) for all cats was 21, 28.6, and 48.6 in wk 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Water intake was significantly increased only between wk 1 and 3. See table for Urine Volumes, pH and RSS. Subscripts indicate significant differences between weeks. In conclusion, increased fluid intake increased urine volume in all cats. Increasing fluid intake to twice basal intake was required to significantly increase urine volume and decrease RSS. The purpose of the study was to examine the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics of hydrocodone and its active metabolite hydromorphone after oral hydrocodone administration to healthy dogs. The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. Six healthy Greyhounds dogs, 3 male and 3 female, were administered commercially available tablets containing hydrocodone bitartrate 10 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg to the nearest half-tablet. The dose of hydrocodone bitartrate was 0.5 mg/kg PO. Blood was collected from jugular catheters and plasma was separated and analyzed for hydrocodone and hydromorphone concentrations by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The limit of quantification was 1 ng/mL for both analytes. All dogs tolerated oral hydrocodone well. None of the dogs vomited or became notably sedated. The mean maximum plasma concentration (CMAX) of hydrocodone was 11.7 ng/mL occurring at 0.7 hours with a terminal half-life of 1.6 hours. The mean CMAX of hydromorphone was 5.2 ng/mL occurring at 1.4 hours with a terminal half-life of 3.1 hours. Hydromorphone concentrations were above 1.9 ng/mL in all 6 dogs from at least 30 minutes through 8 hours post hydrocodone administration. In conclusion, oral hydrocodone was well tolerated in dogs at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg hydrocodone bitartrate. Plasma concentrations of hydromorphone were detected through 8 hours. Further studies assessing the analgesic efficacy of oral hydrocodone are needed. Although inhaled b 2 -adrenoceptor agonists are currently recommended for the preventive and curative treatment of acute bronchospasms in cats with naturally occurring asthma, their efficacy on cat airways remains uncertain and poorly documented. As a preliminary approach to this issue, our study aimed at comparing on isolated feline bronchi the potency, efficacy and intrinsic activity of b 2 -mimetics commonly used in human medicine. Feline bronchi were obtained from euthanized client-owned cats free from respiratory tract disease at clinical investigation and necropsy. Bronchial rings were contracted with acetylcholine 1.2 Â 10 À4 mol/l to induce 80% of the acetylcholine maximal contraction. Dose-response curves to isoproterenol (ISO), salbutamol (SAL), fenoterol (FEN), formoterol (FOR) and salmeterol (SLM) were established by cumulative additions of b 2 -adrenoceptor agonists. The remaining active tension was abolished by theophylline 3 Â 10 À3 mol/l producing a maximal relaxation. The potency (concentration of drug causing 50% of maximal relaxation induced by theophylline 3 Â 10 À3 mol/l [EC 50 ]) and efficacy (maximal effect [E max ], % of the action of theophylline 3 Â 10 À3 mol/l) of each compound were determined. The intrinsic activity (IA) was expressed as the ratio between E max of the studied drug and E max of ISO (reference compound). All b 2 -mimetics relaxed feline bronchi in a concentration-dependent manner with the following rank order of potency: FOR 4 FEN ! ISO 4 SAL. SLM potency was not determined since its relaxant effects failed to reach 50% of the relaxation induced by theophylline 3 Â 10 À3 mol/l. SAL and SLM displayed less maximal relaxant effect than the other b 2 -agonists. Significant differences in E max were found between ISO and SAL or SLM. Accordingly, the IA of both compounds was lower compared with that of FOR and FEN. E max and -log EC 50 values are reported in the following table as means AE SEM (w significantly different from ISO): b 2 -mimetics were effective at reducing muscarinic-induced tone in isolated feline bronchi. ISO and FEN are the most efficacious b 2agonists, FOR the most potent one. FEN and FOR act as full agonists of b 2 -adrenoceptors, SAL and SLM as partial agonists. These encouraging results deserve further investigations in cats with experimentally induced or naturally occurring asthma. Profender modified-release tablets (Bayer HealthCare) have been authorized and commercialized in Europe since 2008: this product contains two active substances, emodepside and praziquantel. Emodepside is a member of a new class of cyclic desipeptide compounds, acting at the neuromuscular junction by stimulating presynaptic receptors belonging to the secretin receptor family, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasites. The approved indication is ''For dogs suffering from, or at risk from, mixed parasitic infections caused by roundworms and tapeworms...''. The applicant identified that emodepside is a P-gp substrate drug, and tolerance studies in dogs showed that its margin of safety is lower in Collies than in common breeds. The multidrug resistance gene (MDR1/ABCB1) produces Pglycoprotein (P-gp) that belongs to the ATP Binding Cassette protein superfamily. P-gp is involved in the active cellular efflux of a large number of drugs and transports many structurally and pharmacologically unrelated hydrophobic compounds. In the central nervous system (CNS), P-gp is found in the capillary endothelial cells that form the blood brain barrier. So, the role of P-gp is particulary important for the protection against accumulation in the CNS of P-gp substrate drugs and their subsequent neurotoxicity. P-gp is also disposed on the biliary canalicular membrane of hepatocytes and on the apical side of enterocytes. A 4-bp deletion mutation of MDR1/ABCB1 gene was described in ivermectin-sensitive Collies and many other dog breeds (e.g Australian Shepherds, White German Shepherds). This mutation generates a premature stop codon, preventing synthesis of the complete and active protein product. Profender was administered as recommended (correct dose and 12hours fasting period) to 5 client-owned Australian Shepherd pups (2 males, 3 females) of the same litter (4-month-old, 9 to 10 kg b.w). Of these 5 pups, only one male dog developed adverse reaction 3 hours later after ingestion of the product: vomiting, mydriasis, ataxia, muscle Glycosaminoglycans are administered to cats for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory conditions including idiopathic cystitis and osteoarthritis. However, little information is available concerning effects of various products on lymphocyte profiles, cytokine production, or anti-oxidant capabilities of treated cats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether parenteral administration of an aggregans of chondrotin sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and N-acetyl-D glucosamine has systemic effects in healthy cats. Polyglycan s (Arthrodynamic, Lexington, KY) was administered to eight healthy, young adult, mixed sex cats at 0.1 ml/lb intramuscularly (IM) on days 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. On days 0, 14, 28, and 56, blood was collected and the reduced-to-oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH:GSSG) was determined as a measure of oxidative stress and the anti-oxidant capacity of plasma (Trolox units) were determined using previously published assays. %CD4 1 lymphocyte counts, %CD81 lymphocyte counts, CD4 1/CD8 1 ratio, and CD44 lymphocyte counts were determined using flow cytometry. Th1 and Th2 cytokine expression by PBMC cells was measured by real time PCR assays (IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL12, TNF alpha, IFN alpha). On days 0 and 56, complete blood cell counts, serum biochemical panels and urinalyses were performed. The data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with time as the only fixed effect. Where the effect of time was significant (P o 0.05), comparisons were made between day 0 and day 14, 28 and 56. Other than evidence of mild discomfort from the IM injections, no other clinical side-effects were noted. There were no significant changes in CBC, biochemical, or urinalysis findings over time. Significant decreases over time were detected for GSH:GSSG ratio (day 28), %CD41 lymphocytes (days 14 and 56) and CD44 lymphocytes (days 14, 28, and 56). Significant increases over time were detected for IFNalpha (days 28 and 56) and TNF alpha (days 28 and 56). Anti-oxidant capacity for all 8 cats was increased by Day 14 (Range 1.75% to 148.0%; median percentage increase 5 23.2%) but the mean results was not statistically significant when compared to Day 0 (P 5 0.0514). IL10 concentrations increased over time for 6 of 8 cats but the change in mean results over time was not statistically significant (p 5 0.2868). The results indicate that IM administration of this aggregans of glycosaminoglycans induces systemic effects in cats. Some of the findings (decreased oxidative stress, increased anti-oxidant capability, and increased IL10 concentrations) could be of potential benefit to cats with inflammatory diseases and suggest that controlled studies of clinically affected cats are indicated. St John's Wort (SJW) has been used for the treatment of nuisance barking of dogs. In humans, SJW alters the pharmacokinetics and/ or clinical response of a variety of clinically important drugs by upregulation of CYP metabolism. The effect of SJW on drugs metabolism is, however, unclear in canine medicine. Therefore, we investigated the effect of multiple administration of SJW on the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine (CsA), which has been used for atopic dermatitis was examined. The effect of multiple SJW on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) mRNA expression was also examined. After SJW (300 mg PO q24h) was administered for 4 weeks, a single cyclosporine (5 mg/kg PO) was administered in 4 Beagle dogs (SJW dogs). As a control, cyclosporine was administered without multiple SJW administration in other 4 Beagle dogs (control dogs). The whole blood concentration of CsA were determined using a high performance liquid chromatography. The liver and the intestine were taken from these dogs and their CYP mRNA expression were measured by the quantitive real time RT-PCR. The maximum whole blood concentration and the area under the curve of CsA in SJW dogs were lower than those in control dogs. The hepatic CYP2C21 and 3A12 expression and the intestinal CYP2B11 and 3A12 expression in SJW dogs were higher than those in control dogs. The present results suggest that SJW may decrease the whole blood concentration of CsA by upregulation of hepatic and intestinal CYP metabolism in dogs. English and French bulldogs are characterized by abnormal anatomy of upper airways (UA) that leads to an obstructive syndrome. These breeds have been proposed as an animal model for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in humans. The purpose of this study is to compare qualitative histopathological changes and muscle fiber type distribution of the soft palate in brachycephalic dogs with obstructive UA disease with those changes present in human patients with OSAS. All samples were obtained under permission of owners and human authorization and have been accepted by the human and veterinary ethical commission. Eleven human patients with OSAS undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and 21 bulldogs undergoing soft palate resection were included in the study. Control tissues were collected from four human patients and seven dogs with no related disorders at the time of necropsy. Samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome. Immunostaining with antibodies directed against myosin heavy chain Type II isoform was performed using standard techniques in a subset of the samples. Histological comparative findings were: 1) mucosal edema was present in both human and canine pathologic samples; (2) when severe, edema and increase endomysial connective tissue was seen within muscle fascicles; (3) fiber group atrophy was present in half of human and canine pathologic samples and absent in controls; (4) a predominance of muscle fiber type II versus type I was observed in the soft palate of canine and human patients and controls; (5) quantitative differences of fiber types was not seen between canine and human patients and controls; (6) fat infiltration within the muscle was present in similar percentage in human pathologic and control samples but was absent in canine samples. As previously suggested by others authors, UA obstructive events have the potential to cause muscle and nerve injury due to mechanical trauma induced by pharyngeal pressure swings, vibration, and muscle contractions. The main findings of our study support this scenario. The presence of fiber group atrophy, suggesting neurogenic lesion, edema and fibrosis observed exclusively in human and canine pathologic soft palate samples probably appears in response to chronic hyperstimulation and vibration. Those lesions could contribute to UA collapsibility. On the other hand, several authors described an increased proportion of fast-twitch type II fibers in UA dilator muscles of patients with OSAS, due to overuse. Our findings indicate that there is a similar proportion of fiber type II in the soft palate between patients and controls, suggesting that soft palate presents a different muscular activity in comparison with other UA dilator muscles. Our findings manifest that there are important similarities between human patients and bulldogs with an UA obstructive syndrome, confirming this breed as a good animal model for human OSAS. Rhinitis and asthma often co-exist in people, and there is growing experimental evidence to suggest that they are two points along a continuum of airways disease. The potential relationship between rhinitis and asthma in cats has not been investigated. We have developed an experimental model of feline asthma, using the aeroallergen Bermuda Grass Allergen (BGA), which histologically replicates the spontaneous condition. We hypothesized that aeroallergen sensitization and challenge evokes morphologic changes in the nasal airways of cats (airway eosinophilia, mucous cell hyperplasia) that mimic those observed in the bronchial airways of feline asthmatics. Five mixed breed cats were sensitized and challenged via aerosolization with BGA to create an asthmatic phenotype. Four cats were similarly treated with phosphate buffered saline to serve as controls. Nasal and pulmonary tissue samples were collected at necropsy. The nasal cavities of all cats were processed for light microscopy and morphometric analyses. Inflammatory cell influx in the nasal mucosa was quantified using numeric cell densities. The volume density of intraepithelial mucosubstances (e.g., goblet cells) was quantified using image analysis. All control and asthmatic cats exhibited mild rhinitis, consisting primarily of neutrophils with rare eosinophils, in the non-ciliated transitional epithelium (NTE) and respiratory epithelium (RE) lining the septum and turbinates of the rostral nasal cavity. There was no significant difference in the magnitude (numeric cell density) of rhinitis observed along the mid-septum between control and asthmatic cats. The volume density of intraepithelial mucosubstances in the dorsal meatus was not significantly different between control (2.858 AE 1.038 nl/mm 2 ) and asthmatic (3.863 AE 0.720 nl/mm 2 ) cats. There were no significant nasal morphologic or inflammatory differences observed between control and asthmatic cats. These preliminary results suggest that the nasal airways of BGA-sensitized cats are not significantly altered during the development of aeroallergen-induced feline asthma. Rapidly differentiating sepsis from non-infectious causes of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in dogs is challenging. C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is expressed by the vascular endothelium in response to stimuli including lipopolysaccharide and is significantly increased in humans with sepsis. We investigated if the N-terminal fragment of CNP (NT-pCNP), a more stable compound with greater potential for clinical utility, could serve as a biomarker for sepsis in dogs. Dogs that presented to the MU VMTH were enrolled in the sepsis group (n 5 11) if they fulfilled ! 2/4 SIRS criteria (temperature 100 or ! 103 F; heart rate !160 bpm; respiratory rate ! 40 bpm; WBC ! 12,000, 4,000 cells/uL or ! 10% bands) and had confirmed infection. Dogs in the SIRS group (n 5 17) fulfilled ! 2/4 SIRS criteria without evidence of infection. Healthy dogs served as controls (n 5 49). Serum was obtained at presentation and frozen at À801C. The NT-pCNP assay was performed by a commercial laboratory (Veterinary Diagnostics Institute). Data were compared using an ANOVA on ranks and post-hoc Dunn's MCP with p o 0.05 considered significant. Dogs in the sepsis group had significantly greater serum NT-pCNP concentrations (median, Q1, Q3; 31.2, 10.5, 34.6 pmol/l; p o 0.001) than dogs in the SIRS group (4.7, 2.9, 8.1 pmol/l or healthy controls (6.4, 4.8, 8.8 pmol/l). Using a cut off point of 10.2 pmol/l, serum NT-pCNP had a good sensitivity (82%) and specificity (94%) for differentiating sepsis from non-infectious SIRS in dogs. Serum NT-pCNP appears to be a useful diagnostic test to differentiate sepsis from non-infectious SIRS in dogs. The objective of this study was to determine the probability of death with different combinations of common point-of-care tests in a heterogeneous population of critically ill dogs and construct a prediction model from multiple variables. Data were collected from 84 dogs admitted to a referral intensive care unit. Dogs were of various breeds. Forty-four dogs were females and 41 were males with ages varying from 2-months to 13years old (mean age: 6 years). The most common diagnostic categories were sepsis (n 5 20); metabolic diseases (n 5 15), multiple trauma (n 5 12); neurologic diseases (n 5 10); and oncologic emergencies (n 5 7). Thirty-one dogs died or were euthanized during hospitalization (mortality: 37%). Venous blood pH, partial pressure of CO 2 (PCO 2 ), electrolytes (sodium, potassium and chloride), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), blood glucose and lactate were measured on admission, using point-of-care instruments (iStat, Abbott Point of Care, East Windsor, NJ and Accutrend Plus, Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The values of plasma bicarbonate, base excess and anion gap were calculated automatically. All variables were included as candidate predictors for inclusion in the model. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to predict the risk of death. We selected the predictors in the model using the backward procedure. Initially, all the candidate predictors selected were included. A sequence of hypothesis tests was applied to determine whether a given predictor should be removed from the model. The candidate predictors were selected into the model if P o 0.05 and removed from the model if P 4 0.10. The main prognostic predictors of death were BUN (P 5 0.09), pH (P 5 0.06) and PCO 2 (P 5 0.01). Risk score from a logistic regression model to predict the risk of death (the adjusted model) can be described as: (risk score) 5 38.4430 1 0.0134 Â BUN -4.9311 Â pH -0.0930 Â PCO 2 . Point-of-care testing is frequently requested as part of the evaluation of critical care patients. These tests are frequently used to improve decision making and to guide therapy. These preliminary findings suggest that blood pH and BUN are the most important predictors of death in a heterogeneous population of critically ill dogs. Future steps include validation of the model in a larger sample and applying the model in samples from other facilities. (table) . The sensitivity and specificity of the point-of care test compared to the reference method using whole blood was 96% and 100%, respectively, and 100% and 94%, respectively, using serum samples. In summary the point-of-care test was capable of discriminating between normal and increased CRP concentrations with a high sensitivity and specificity and may therefore be introduced as an inflammation screening test. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a method for evaluation of coagulation that detects viscoelastic changes in whole blood during polymerization of fibrin, and can be used to identify both hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable states in dogs. Application of TEG for serial monitoring of clinical patients assumes that changes in TEG values reflect a change in patient status. The goal of this project was to evaluate the validity of this assumption by examining whether or not TEG produces consistent results when used to monitor hemostasis in clinically healthy dogs over a period of three consecutive days. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of elapsed time after venipuncture (15 minutes vs. 1 hour) on TEG results and also compared results obtained with and without use of kaolin to activate coagulation for TEG analysis. Blood was collected from 10 healthy dogs on three consecutive days. Complete blood cell counts were performed daily; Hct% and WBC counts were within the reference interval in all samples. Thrombocytopenia was reported in four samples, and evaluation of a blood smear revealed platelet clumping in each case. The platelet count estimated from the smears was adequate. A coagulation profile, including measurement of the prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration and antithrombin activity (AT), was completed on the first day for each dog and all values were within reference intervals. TEG was performed using citrated whole blood with addition of calcium to initiate clot formation. Parameters that were evaluated included reaction time (R), clotting time (k), rate of clot formation (angle), and maximum clot strength (MA). Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA for repeated measures and a t-test or Mann-Whitney test for group comparisons. No statistically significant differences were found for TEG parameters of individual dogs measured on three consecutive days, and all values fell within established reference intervals. Comparison of TEG performed at 15 minutes vs. 1 hour post-venipuncture, and comparison of TEG performed with and without use of kaolin also showed no significant differences. Thromboelastography is a reliable method for monitoring hemostasis in dogs over a period of three days and clinically significant changes in the measured TEG values are likely due to changes in patient status. Storage of citrated whole blood at room temperature for up to one hour does not result in a significant change in TEG results for healthy dogs, and use of an activator such as kaolin may not be needed. Further experiments should be performed to assess the impact of time after venipuncture and use of a coagulation activator on TEG in patients with abnormal hemostasis. Previously presented at the Merck-Merial NIH National Veterinary Scholars Symposium, Raleigh, NC, August 2009. Cardiac arrhythmias are a recognized but poorly characterized problem in Standardbred racehorses. This study was designed to examine the prevalence, frequency and risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias and to look for evidence of myocardial injury evidenced by elevated cTnI in racing Standardbreds. Electrocardiographic recordings (ECGs) were obtained over a 12 week period from Standardbred horses racing at a single racetrack. ECGs were obtained on admission to the racetrack and within 20 minutes of completing the race using a clipless digital recording device that obtains a non-standard single lead ECG. Blood was obtained by random selection for venous blood gas/electrolyte (n 5 727 race entries) and cTnI determination (n 5 754 race entries) prior to racing. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine whether age, gender, gait, furosemide administration, ambient temperature, race classification, lifetime mark, venous blood gas parameters, or electrolyte concentration was associated with tachyarrhythmias. A total of 8658 ECG recordings were obtained from 463 trotters and 1,398 pacers entered in 4335 racestarts. Six horses developed atrial fibrillation post race (prevalence 5 0.32%, frequency 5 0.14%), one horse had atrial tachycardia prior to racing (prevalence 5 0.05%, frequency 5 0.02%), and four horses had significant ventricular arrhythmias either pre or post race (leading to disqualification and/or suspension; prevalence 5 0.21%, frequency 5 0.09%). Only 3 horses had prerace cTnI values above the reference range. There was no association between the presence of tachyarrhythmias and any of the parameters evaluated. Lack of association may be due to the small number of horses with arrhythmias. Increased concentration of cardiac troponin I [cTnI] is associated with piroplasmosis, ventricular tachycardia and short-term high intensity exercise in horses. Anecdotal reports exist of acute death in stallions during and immediately after breeding and this may be due to myocardial injury. We hypothesized that [cTnI] would increase following semen collection. Fourteen clinically-healthy, phantom-trained stallions were studied. Echocardiography was performed prior to semen collection and heart rate recorded prior to, during and after semen collection using cardiac telemetry. Fractional shortening (FS) was determined within 5 min following semen collection. [cTnI] was measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (Access AccuTI s ) pre-semen collection and at 4, 6, 12 and 24 hrs post-semen collection. After logtransformation of data, changes in [cTnI] postvs pre-semen collection were analyzed using a paired t-test. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the effect of predictors (heart rate, age, weight and FS) on change in [cTnI] . A P-value o 0.05 was considered significant. [cTnI] was available for eleven stallions (mean AE SD age 11 AE 7 yrs and weight 510 AE 86 kg). Compared with pre-semen collection [cTnI] was significantly increased at 4 (0.041 AE 0.062 ng/ml; P 5 0.018) and 6 hrs (0.054 AE 0.070 ng/ml; P 5 0.034), but not at 12 (0.031 AE 0.045 ng/ml; P 5 0.286) and 24 hrs (0.028 AE 0.047 ng/ml; P 5 0.581) post-semen collection in eight stallions. No significant association was found between the measured predictors and increased [cTnI] at 4 and 6 hrs post-semen collection. Data suggest that [cTnI] may increase after semen collection. This may not be of clinical significance, but should be considered in stallions with suspected cardiac disease. Severe hemorrhage causes a decrease in circulating volume and insufficient oxygen delivery to the heart. The clinically relevant effects of this are poorly described in the horse. This study was designed to examine the occurrence of myocardial injury and arrhythmias in horses with either severe or mild controlled hemorrhage and determine if increased cTnI concentrations are associated with arrhythmias or outcome. Eight adult horses with severe hemorrhage were studied prospectively. Serial cTnI concentrations and continuous electrocardiograms were obtained on admission and during the first 48-96 hours of hospitalization. Four blood donors (mild controlled hemorrhage) were studied in parallel. Rank sum measures for nonparametric data were used to determine associations between cTnI concentration, arrhythmias and outcome. Cardiac troponin I concentration was stratified into a scoring system. All horses with severe hemorrhage had increased cTnI concentrations (median 0.85 ng/ml, range 0.11-29.90 ng/ml; reference range o 0.07 ng/ml); Six developed significant arrhythmias (multifocal ventricular ectopy and or supraventricular premature depolarizations) that warranted therapy or monitoring and three were euthanized. All blood donors had normal cTnI concentrations and electrocardiograms. There was an association between severe hemorrhage and increased cTnI concentration (p o 0.001), and between severe hemorrhage and presence of arrhythmias (p 5 0.019). There was no association between survival and maximal cTnI, cTnI category or presence of arrhythmias (p ! 0.055). All horses with severe hemorrhage had myocardial injury and clinically significant arrhythmias were identified frequently. Horses with severe hemorrhage may benefit from cardiac monitoring. A larger population is needed to quantify risks or suggest specific monitoring and therapeutic interventions. DSTs are used to screen ponies for PPID and abnormalities in control of insulin secretion and may aid identification of ponies susceptible to laminitis. Cortisol responses are affected by season, being higher in summer/autumn. The aim of this study was to measure the cortisol and insulin responses to a standard DST in nonlaminitis prone (NP) and previously laminitic ponies (PLP) at four different times of year in the UK. Standard 19 hour overnight DSTs were performed on the same group of 6 NP and 6 PLP (although not laminitic at the time of testing) in spring (April), summer (July), autumn (October) and winter (December) in southern England, whilst the ponies were maintained out at pasture. None of the ponies were obese or showed any clinical signs of PPID. Serum cortisol analysis was by chemiluminescent assay at a commercial laboratory (Beaufort Cottage Laboratory, UK). Insulin was analysed by radioimmunoassay (Coat-A-Count, Siemens) previously validated in the authors' laboratory. Results were analysed using 1-way and 2-way ANOVAs and are presented as meanAESD. Significance was set at p o 0.05. No suppression of [cortisol] occurred in PLP in autumn. In summer, mean post-injection [cortisol] was above the reference range ( o 25 nmol/l) in both groups. Individual ponies (both NP and PLP) did not suppress [cortisol] normally in winter, however all individuals had normal cortisol suppression in spring. There were no significant differences in basal [insulin] between NP and PLP at any season. In NP, serum [insulin] post-dexamethasone was significantly higher in spring and summer compared to winter. Serum [insulin] post-dexamethasone in PLP in spring and summer (966 AE 488 mIU/ ml and 844 AE 820 mIU/ml respectively) was significantly higher than PLP in winter (26 AE 16 mIU/ml) although not significantly higher than PLP in autumn (211 AE 143 mIU/ml). Serum [insulin] post-dexamethasone in PLP in spring and summer was significantly (p o 0.001) higher than NP at all seasons. The increase in serum [insulin] in response to dexamethasone was significantly greater in PLP vs. NP in spring (726 AE 422 mIU/ml vs. 147 AE 183 mIU/ml respectively; p o 0.01) and summer (678 AE 651 mIU/ml vs. 184 AE 193 mIU/ml respectively; p o 0.05) although the fold change in [insulin] was not significantly different between groups at any point. Serum [insulin] in winter in both groups was low and responded minimally to dexamethasone injection (NP pre:10 AE 5 mIU/ml, post:28 AE 16 mIU/ml; PLP pre:13 AE 9 mIU/ml, post:26 AE 16 mIU/ml). Abnormal cortisol responses were seen in both NP and PLP in summer, autumn & winter. All ponies showed normal cortisol suppression in spring. PLP displayed exaggerated serum insulin responses to dexamethasone in spring and summer, which were significantly different from the same ponies in winter and from NP at all times of year. In winter there was a minimal change in [insulin] post-dexamethasone in both groups. In autumn and winter, the insulin responses to dexamethasone could not distinguish between NP and PLP. Previously presented at the AAEP Laminitis Research Workshop, November 2009. Insulin resistance has been implicated as a predisposing factor in horses that suffer from recurrent laminitis. A similar metabolic syndrome in donkeys with recurrent laminitis is proposed. Three hundred and ninety four new donkey arrivals at The Donkey Sanctuary, UK were evaluated over a 12 month period (October 2008-November 2009). Age, sex, body condition score (BCS out of 5), whether they were obese (BCS ! 3.5), history of previous laminitis and the occurrence of laminitic bouts within one month of sampling were recorded. Glycaemic status was assessed by means of resting glucose and insulin analysis and the derivation of surrogate (proxy) values. General linear models were performed to determine significant associations. There were 114 (28%) females and 280 (72%) geldings; 75 (19%) had a history of previous laminitis, 43 (11%) had a laminitic episode within one month of sampling and 122 (31%) were classed as obese. There was a statistically significant difference in mean serum insulin(mIU/ml), RISQI (reciprocal of the square root of insulin; [mU/L] À0.5 ) and MIRG (modified insulin-to-glucose; [mU ins ] 2 /10.L.mg gluc [Insulin o 50 mIU/ml]) values between donkeys classified as obese(20.86) and non-obese(7.31; P o 0.001), previously laminitic (23.83) and not (8.52; P o 0.001), and postsampling laminitic (22.84) and not (10.08; P o 0.001). There was also a significant difference in insulin and MIRG values between male (9.15 and 4.28) and female donkeys (17.2 and 5.13; P 0.014) with higher values in females, due to more female donkeys being obese and having a history of laminitis (P o 0.001). This study has determined mean insulin values (4.95) and associated insulin sensitivity proxy measurements (RISQ 0.6; MIRG 3.79) in non-obese donkeys with no history of previous laminitis in the UK, and has also shown that there is an association between insulin resistance/ metabolic disease and laminitis observed in donkeys. objective of this study was to document the normal range of myofiber lipid storage and the second objective was to screen horses with myopathies of unknown origin for potential LSMs. Objective 1: Frozen sections of gluteal biopsies from 65 Quarter (QH) /Paint Horses with no history of neuromuscular disease and 7 thoroughbreds on a high fat diet were stained with Oil Red O for lipid and scored (0 to 3) for 1) number of fibers containing lipid droplets, 2) density of lipid droplets within the fibers and 3) size of the lipid droplets. The sum of the biopsy score (0-9) was calculated for each horse. Ninety four % of control horses (61/65) had a lipid score o 6.0 and 6.1% (4/65) had a maximum score of 6.0. Thoroughbred scores ranged from 3.5-5.5 with a mean of 4.7. Results suggested a score of 6.0 or greater was compatible with high myofiber lipid storage. Objective 2: From Neuromuscular Diagnostic Laboratory records at the University of Minnesota horses with exertional and non-exertional rhabdomyolysis were identified which were negative for glycogen synthase 1 and ryanodine receptor mutations. In horses with exertional rhabdomyolysis, 2/18 (11%) thoroughbreds, 5/63 (7.9%) QHs with normal PAS stains and 6/80 (7.5%) QHs diagnosed with type 2 PSSM had a score of 6.0 or greater. The mean score for thoroughbreds was 2.5 AE 0.6, for QH 1.1 AE 0.3 and for QH with type 2 PSSM 1.0 AE 0.2. In Quarter Horse foals with a history of non-exertional rhabdomyolysis (NER) 13/57 (22.8%) had a score of 6.0 or greater [2.6 AE 0.4]. Among horses of various breeds experiencing NER, 4/17 (24%) had a score of 6.0 or greater [3.8 AE 0.7] and of these 3 had a history and distribution of myonecrosis compatible with a diagnosis of atypical myopathy. Urine organic acid and plasma acylcarnitine profiles obtained from two Midwestern horses suspected to have atypical myopathy revealed a pattern of marked elevations in plasma acylcarnitines and urine organic acids consistent with multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD), previously reported in European cases of atypical myopathy. Results indicate that in addition to an acquired LSM caused by MADD, potential genetic causes of LSM may also exist in horses. Oil Red O stains on fresh frozen muscle biopsy sections, urine organic acid and plasma acylcarnitine profiles during an episode of rhabdomyolysis and measurement of plasma and muscle carnitine concentrations may become valuable tools to screen for defects in lipid metabolism. Horses have limited ability to utilize poor-quality forages because fermentation by microflora occurs in the hindgut. It is often assumed that grass hay fed to horses provides 0.9 Mcal/lb and contains 10 to 12% protein on a DM basis. Other variables are important in hay quality and adequacy. This study reports a comparison of nutrient composition of 50 samples of grass hay consumed by horses in New England. The hay samples were collected during farm visits to 36 premises between July through November 2009. The premises consisted of 16 training/boarding facilities, 20 small farms/residences. The number of horses per premise ranged from 1 to 50 (median 6). All hay samples were analyzed by Equi-Analytical Laboratories, Ithaca, NY. The results are reported as dry matter basis for each component. Only 52% (26/50) of the hay sampled had acid detergent fiber (ADF) 35%, and considered of good quality. Whereas, 6% of the hay sampled had ADF 4 45% (poor quality). The digestible energy (DE) ranged from 0.84 to 1.12 Mcal/lb, mean 0.96. The crude protein ranged from 4.6 to 18.4%; 20/50 had CP o 10% and 22/50 had CP 4 12%. Nonfiber carbohydrates (NFC) ranged from 11.6 to 26.5% (mean 17.95%). Water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) ranged from 7.3 to 23.4% (mean 11.36%). The results of our report demonstrate considerable variability in the nutritional composition of the grass hay, highlighting the importance of hay analysis in order to provide adequate nutrition to horses. Adipokines are essential regulators of insulin and glucose. Adiponectin is the only adipokine reduced with obesity and is an insulin sensitizer. In species studied, adiponectin circulates as high molecular weight (HMW, 360-540 kd), low molecular weight (LMW), and trimeric/dimeric/monomeric complexes. HMW adiponectin is the metabolically active complex and is an indicator of insulin sensitivity. Only total adiponectin has been measured in the horse. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize adiponectin protein complexes in the normal horse. Sera were collected from lean (body condition score 4-6), healthy geldings (n 5 19) and mares (n 5 15), aged 2-15 years. Western blot analysis under denaturing and/or reducing conditions demonstrated complexes 180 kd. An enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELI-SA) was validated and used to quantify HMW complexes. HMW values were analyzed for normality and compared between mares and geldings using a 2-tailed unpaired t-test with p o 0.05. In equine serum, adiponectin was present as a multimer consisting of LMW (180 kd) and trimeric (90 kd) complexes under denaturing conditions and dimeric (60 kd) and monomeric (30 kd) complexes under denaturing and reducing conditions. Mean HMW concentration was 8044 AE 1508 ng/mL in mares and 6597 AE 778 ng/mL in geldings. The mean for all was 7342 AE 744 ng/mL. There was no difference in HMW adiponectin levels between mares and geldings. Adiponectin multimers are present in normal horses, with HMW adiponectin in high concentrations. A greater understanding of the role of adiponectin in equine metabolism will provide insight into the pathophysiology of diseases associated with metabolic derangements. Adipokines have essential roles in metabolic regulation and in the inflammatory response. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and vascular protective properties. The metabolically active form, high molecular weight (HMW), is low in humans with obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation. We hypothesized that HMW adiponectin levels would be reduced in horses with obesity or inflammatory conditions. Serum HMW adiponectin was measured (using a previously validated ELISA) in normal horses and compared to horses with clinical signs and/or laboratory findings consistent with inflammatory disease or obesity. All horses were between 2 and 15 years old. Inflammatory disease was scored using an increasing severity scale of 1-3. Natural log transformed data were compared between groups (normal, obese, all inflammatory, and scored groups (1, 2, 3)) using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's multiple comparison test, p o 0.05. HMW adiponectin concentrations were as follows: normal (n 5 37): 7342 AE 744 ng/mL; obese (n 5 15): 3595 AE 1108 ng/mL; score1 (n 5 29): 5409 AE 706 ng/mL; score2 (n 5 46): 4334 AE 423 ng/mL; score3 (n 5 9): 6859 AE 1299 ng/mL. Horses with inflammatory disease (all scores) had lower HMW adiponectin than normal horses. Obese horses and horses with mild (score1) and moderate (score2) inflammation had significantly lower HMW adiponectin than normal horses. HMW adiponectin is reduced in horses with obesity and mild to moderate inflammatory disease. Because of its effects on the immune response and vascular function, adiponectin may have a role in the pathophysiology of complications of obesity and inflammatory disease. Insulin resistance has been associated with predisposition to laminitis in horses and ponies and frequently accompanies nutritional obesity in this species. In humans and rodents, macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue (AT) correlates with adiposity and degree of tissue and systemic insulin resistance. These cells adopt an inflammatory phenotype, elaborate pro-inflammatory cytokines, and perpetuate adipose tissue IR in obesity. Recent reports have established depot-specific pro-inflammatory cytokine expression profiles in equine adipose tissue, but the relationship of this expression to macrophage infiltration is unknown. This study quantified the macrophage content of several AT depots of insulin-resistant (IR) and insulin-sensitive (IS) horses. Eleven mares (8 Quarter horses, 2 Thoroughbreds, and 1 Standardbred), categorized as IR (insulin sensitivity [SI] 5 0.58 AE 0.31 L Á min À1 Á mU À1 ; n 5 5) or IS (SI 5 2.59 AE 1.21 L Á min À1 Á mU À1 ; n 5 6) based on results of an insulin-modified frequently-sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test were studied. Omental, retroperitoneal, and mesocolonic AT was collected via ventral midline celiotomy; nuchal ligament and tail head AT biopsies were collected via skin incision. Tissue samples were snap-frozen and fixed in formalin. For each depot, total RNA was extracted and cDNA analyzed via real-time quantitative PCR to quantify expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2), and tissue samples were immunohistochemically stained for CD163 (macrophage surface antigen). The number of CD163 (1) cells in n 5 10 40Â fields per slide was recorded for each depot. Data were analyzed using oneway ANOVA for repeated measures or non-parametric equivalent (p 5 0.05). The expression of MCP-2 was significantly higher in omental AT compared with other depots (p 5 0.0003), and omental AT of IR horses showed greater expression than that of IS horses (p o 0.0001). The total number of CD163 (1) cells was not significantly different between depots (p 5 0.06), and no effect of insulin sensitivity was observed. CD163 (1) cells were further differentiated based on their location within the tissue (interstitial vs. perivascular). There was no difference in the number of interstitial cells between depots (p 5 0.48); however, omental adipose tissue contained a significantly greater number of perivascular cells than other depots (p 5 0.04). These data suggest a role for MCP-2 as a macrophage chemoattractant in equine AT; omental AT may have a more dynamic macrophage population than other depots. Importantly, CD163 (1) macrophages may not be the most numerous or important population in equine AT, as increased depot-specific expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (nuchal ligament) is not accompanied by an increased number of CD163 (1) cells. Polyuria and polydipsia (PU-PD) is one of the clinical signs reported with pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). The cause(s) of PU-PD are not well understood but may include osmotic diuresis consequent to glucosuria, a decrease in antidiuretic hormone release (acquired central diabetes insipidus), or direct effects of cortisol on glomerular filtration rate. The aims of this study were: 1. to determine prevalence of PU-PD based on a owner reported assessment score (n 5 25); 2. to measure urine concentration and perform reagent strip urinalysis (n 5 20); and 3. to examine for bacteriuria (n 5 22) in a group of 25 aged mares (17-24 years) being screened for PPID by clinical examination and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Blood was collected by jugular venipuncture for serum biochemical analysis and urine was collected by bladder catheterization (without sedation) shortly after hospital admission. None of the 25 mares had azotemia. Of 19 mares that had DST results supportive of PPID, PU-PD scores were 0 (normal, n 5 6), 1 (mild, n 5 3), 2 (moderate, n 5 9), and severe (n 5 1) for a total of 11/19 horses (prevalence 58%) with PU-PD as compared to scores of 0 (n 5 5) and 2 (n 5 1) in the six mares that had DST results that were not supportive of PPID. Measures of urine concentration tended to be lower in PPID-affected mares but differences were not significant. Not surprisingly, urine specific gravity values were highly correlated (r 5 0.64, p o 0.01) with urine osmolality values. All urine samples were alkaline (pH 7.5-8.5) and pigmenturia was not detected in any sample. Glucosuria was detected in two of the 19 PPID-affected mares (curiously with serum glucose concentrations of 95 and 102 mg/dl) and none of the non-PPID mares. Two of the 19 PPID-affected mares had bacteruria (50-100,000 CFU/ml group D non-enterococcus Streptococcus spp. in one mare and o 100 CFU/ ml Streptococcus equi subspecies equi and 100-500 CFU/ml Corynebacterium spp. in another mare). One of the six non-PPID mares also had bacteriuria (10-50,000 CFU/ml Enterococcus spp.). Although not assessed in a quantitative manner, it is noteworthy that more than 50% of owners of PPID-affected horses reported mild to severe PU-PD despite most horses having measures of urine concentration that would be considered within reference ranges. We have previously reported a seasonal increase in adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) concentrations in horses located in Tennessee, with higher concentrations detected in September and October. However, it was not known whether these findings were specific to this geographical location. We therefore studied a group of horses located in Texas to test the hypothesis that the same seasonal alterations in ACTH concentrations occur in two different geographical locations. Fifteen horses (9 mares, 4 geldings, and 2 stallions) with a median (range) age of 15 (4-38) years were included in the study. Appaloosa (n 5 1), Arabian (7), Quarter horse (5), and Tennessee Walking Horse (1) breeds were represented and one horse was a crossbred. Horses were sampled under fed (hay or grass) conditions approximately every month across a 12-month period (September 2007 to August 2008 . Hormones and metabolites were measured in stored serum and plasma samples at the end of the study. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. One horse suffered from diabetes mellitus, so its data were excluded from statistical analyses. Plasma ACTH concentrations were significantly affected by season (time effect; P 5 0.027), with a significantly higher mean AE SD concentration (184.5 AE 313.3 pg/mL) detected in September, compared with eight other months. Three horses had ACTH concentrations 4 35 pg/mL in the spring/summer, indicating pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction. There was no effect of season on serum insulin concentrations. We conclude that horses in another geographical location exhibit higher plasma ACTH concentrations during the late summer and autumn. The purpose of this study was to establish normal electroencephalography (EEG) parameters in horses. The specific aims were 1) validate the use of the spectral analysis EEG in adult normal anesthetized horses 2) compare EEG data to aged normal Horses donated to the KSU for problems other than intracranial diseases constituted the three study groups (adult 5 5; geriatric 5 5; PPID 5 2). Complete physical, neurologic and blood examinations were performed. EEG was performed under general anesthesia. A 12 channel montage was used to record EEG for 20 minutes. The horses then were euthanized and immediately after cerebrospinal fluid were collected and submitted for cytologic examination. Postmortem examinations of the central nervous system were performed. EEG visual inspection and spectral analysis were performed. Statistical analyses included normality tests, ordinary ANOVA and multiple comparison tests. All data were expressed as means AE standard error of the means. Statistical significance was designated a priori as P o 0.05. Significant differences between the three groups for the all four EEG frequency bands and the total power were reported. These results may influence health care recommendations for horses as they age. Differences identified may have important implications for the distinction between benign age-associated changes and age-related changes that predispose to disease. Giardia duodenalis (syn. G. intestinalis, G. lamblia) is a zoonotic flagellate parasite infecting mammals and causing gastroenteritis and diarrhea. To date, little is known about the prevalence, genotypes and zoonotic potential of Giardia affecting horses and alpacas in North America. A cross-sectional prevalence study was conducted in the New York State area, USA between February 25 th and August 24th 2009. Fecal samples were collected from 349, 1-10 week old foals and their dams on 14 different broodmare farms and from 220, 1-16 week old crias and their dams on 15 different alpaca breeding farms. All fecal samples were screened for Giardia using a direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). DNA extraction and PCR analysis of the triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes were performed on all DFA positive samples. PCR positive samples were subtyped by DNA sequencing of the tpi and gdh genes. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for data with continuous outcomes and Fisher's Exact Test used for comparison of dichotomous variables. Alpha was set at 0.05. By DFA, 27/175 (15%) of the foal, 22/174 (12.6%) of the mare, 18/110 (16.3%) of the cria and 7/110 (6.4%) of the adult alpaca fecal samples were positive for Giardia. There was no significant age difference between Giardia positive foals (median 5 18, range 5 6-46 days) and negative foals (median 5 18, range 5 4-65 days), p 5 0.99, nor Giardia positive crias (median 5 26, range 5 15-70 days) and negative crias (median 5 38, range 5 2-111 days), p 5 0.2. However, Giardia positive adult alpacas were significantly younger (median 5 3, range 5 3-4 years) than negative (median 5 6 years, range 5 2.5-11 years) adult alpacas p 5 0.02. There was no significant age difference between Giardia positive and negative mares. There was no significant difference in fecal consistency (score 1-3) between Giardia positive and negative foals or crias (p 5 0.2 and p 5 0.3 respectively). PCR analysis plus DNA sequencing of the tpi and gdh genes the identified assemblages A and B in the equine Giardia positive samples and assemblages A and E in the alpaca Giardia positive samples. Both assemblages A and B are infectious to humans and therefore equine and alpaca Giardia infections should be considered zoonotic. As Giardia shedding did not appear to be associated with diarrhea in foals or crias, the zoonotic potential of apparently healthy animals should not be discounted. Cryptosporidium spp. are zoonotic Apicomplexan protozoan parasites that may infect mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. To date, little is known about the prevalence, genotypes and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium spp. affecting horses, especially in North America. A prospective study was conducted in New York, USA between February 25 th and May 1 st 2009. Fecal samples were collected from 175 1-10 week old foals and their dams (174) on 14 different broodmare farms. All fecal samples were screened for Cryptosporidium spp. using a direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). DNA extraction and PCR-RFLP analysis of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA gene were performed on all the foal samples. PCR positive samples were subtyped by DNA sequencing of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. A Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to compare the sets of continuous data and a Fishers Exact Test used to compare dichotomous variables. Alpha was set at 0.05. On DFA, 13/175 (7.4%) foal samples and 3/174 (1.7%) mare samples were designated positive for Cryptosporidium spp., whereas on SSU rRNA-based PCR, 9/175 (5.1%) foal samples were positive. Cryptosporidium PCR-positive foals were significantly older (13-40 days, median age of 28 days) compared with negative foals (4-67 days, median 18 days, p 5 0.02). The number of foals with diarrhea or soft feces was not significantly different between positive and negative foals (p 5 0.09). PCR-RFLP analysis of the SSU rRNA gene and DNA sequencing of the gp60 gene identified the parasite as subtype VIaA14G2 of the horse genotype. This is the first report of a group of foals affected with the Cryptosporidium horse genotype, which has recently been detected in humans. As other contemporary molecular studies have identified C. parvum in foals, it seems that equine cryptosporidiosis should be considered a zoonosis. Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) occurs frequently in critically ill human patients, and is associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis and septic shock. CIRCI is caused by dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Data regarding the prevalence of HPA axis dysfunction in critically ill neonatal foals is increasing: however, the clinical significance and the method for best assessing HPA dysfunction remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare temporal changes in secretion of HPA axis hormones (adrenocorticotropin [ACTH] and cortisol) between hospitalized, term, septic neonatal foals, and term, healthy, neonatal foals at a referral hospital. Blood samples were obtained from term septic foals (n 5 15) o 7 days of age admitted to Texas A&M University, Large Animal Teaching hospital at admission (T 5 0), 24(T 5 1), 48(T 5 2), 72 (T 5 3) and 96 (T 5 4) hours, plasma was separated by centrifugation, and then stored at -80C until assayed. Foals were defined septic based upon having a positive blood culture, a sepsis score of ! 11 or both. Blood was sampled similarly in healthy term foals o 7 days of age obtained from Texas A&M Horse Center (n 5 4) or from term foals (n 5 11) admitted to the teaching hospital for reasons other than sepsis. Endogenous basal ACTH and cortisol concentrations were measured using validated immunoassays. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models to account for the repeated measures among foals. Significance was set at P o 0.05. There were no significant temporal changes in ACTH concentration over time and the temporal pattern did not differ significantly between septic and healthy foals. However adjusting for effects of time, ACTH concentrations were significantly greater among septic foals than healthy foals (P 5 0.031) The estimated magnitude of increase in ACTH was 1.5 units (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 1.94 units) in septic foals relative to healthy foals. Significant effects of sepsis and time on cortisol concentrations were noted, but the temporal changes did not vary between septic and healthy foals. At each time-point, cortisol concentrations were significantly (P o 0.05) greater among septic foals than healthy foals. The estimated magnitude of increase in cortisol was 19.2 units (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 24.3 units) in septic foals relative to healthy foals. Accounting for effects of sepsis, cortisol concentrations were significantly (P o 0.05) lower at T 5 1, 2, 3, 4 than at admission. These findings demonstrate that ACTH and cortisol concentrations are elevated in septic foals compared to healthy foals. The elevated hormone concentrations are expected in critically ill foals. However, cortisol concentrations at admission were significantly greater than at other times in all foals. How this temporal change affects the HPA axis is unclear, but this change did not impact survival in this study population. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy improves outcome in septic people with critical illness-related cortisol insufficiency (CIRCI), and may also benefit septic foals with CIRCI. However, calculation of an appropriate hydrocortisone replacement dose requires understanding of both endogenous and exogenous cortisol metabolism, which are poorly understood in foals. This study was designed to compare daily endogenous cortisol production and the pharmacokinetics of an intravenous bolus dose of hydrocortisone between neonatal foals and adult horses. Two milliliters of blood were collected every 15-20 minutes for 24 hours from 4 healthy 2-day-old foals and 4 healthy adult horses for determination of serum cortisol concentrations. Then, 1 mg/kg of hydrocortisone was given intravenously to the same 4 foals and to 4 additional healthy horses 12 hours after suppression of endogenous cortisol production with dexamethasone (0.08 mg/kg IV). Cortisol and hydrocortisone concentrations were determined using a previously validated chemiluminescent immunoassay. Data were compared between groups with Mann Whitney tests, with significance set at P o 0.05. Mean 24-hour cortisol concentration was significantly lower in foals (2.0 AE 0.4 mg/dl) than horses (2.6 AE 0.6 mg/dl), but daily cortisol production rate was significantly greater in foals (0.671 AE 0.032 mg/kg/day) than horses (0.215 AE 0.040 mg/kg/day). Foals had significantly greater hydrocortisone volume of distribution and clearance and significantly lower peak hydrocortisone plasma concentrations (Vd ss 5 1.92 AE 1.11 L/kg; Cl s 5 1.39 AE 0.11 L/kg/hr; peak 5 85.5 AE 11.8 mg/dL) than horses (Vd ss 5 0.58 AE 0.15 L/kg; Cl s 5 0.35 AE 0.07 L/kg/hr; peak 5 846.7 AE 378.0 mg/dL). These considerable differences in cortisol metabolism between horses and foals may contribute to the development of CIRCI in septic neonatal foals, and should be considered during hydrocortisone replacement therapy in foals. Sepsis is the number one cause of foal mortality. We have shown that endocrine disorders are frequent in septic foals and often associated with mortality. Thyroid hormones (TH) are important in growth and development (neural, musculoskeletal), maturation (lung, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular), and metabolism (energy, thermogenesis). Decreased TH concentrations in newborn foals are associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities, incoordination, weakness, respiratory distress, hypothermia, failure of transfer of passive immunity, and likely sepsis. Since THs are important for several developmental and metabolic processes, the goal of this study was to measure serum total triiodothyronine (tT3), free triidothyronine (fT3), total thyroxine (tT4) and free thyroxine (tT4) concentrations in septic, sick nonseptic and healthy foals, and to determine their association with severity of sepsis and survival. We hypothesized that THs will be lower in septic foals (euthyroid sick syndrome) compared to sick non-septic and healthy foals, and associated with severity of sepsis and mortality. Blood samples were collected on admission from 53 septic, 100 sick non-septic and 26 healthy foals of o 7 days of age. Foals were considered septic if they had a positive blood culture or a sepsis score ! 12. Serum tT3, fT3, tT4, and fT4 were lower in septic foals compared to healthy foals (P o 0.01), while tT3 and fT3 were lower in septic foals than in sick non-septic foals (P o 0.05). Serum fT3, tT3, and fT4 concentrations were lower in non-septic compared to healthy foals. All THs were negatively correlated with the sepsis score. THs were also associated with white blood cell count, IgG, albumin, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations. Within septic foals, serum fT3, tT3 and fT4 were lower in foals that did not survive. These findings indicate that euthyroid sick syndrome (non-thyroidal illness syndrome) is frequent in septic foals, associated with severity of sepsis and mortality, as well as with the metabolic needs (energy status) of these foals. We believe that low TH concentrations in septic foals are a consequence of the severity of the disease and likely a reflection of system inflammation. The diagnosis of equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE) is based on the presence of specific clinical, clinicopathological and sonographic abnormalities coupled with the serological detection of antibodies to Lawsonia intracellularis and/or the molecular detection of L. intracellularis in feces. Rectal swabs are generally considered the sample of choice for the PCR detection of L. intracellularis in pigs due to the ease of collection. The purpose of this study was to compare the molecular detection rate of L. intracellularis between feces and rectal swabs collected from foals with suspected EPE. Case selection was based on the presence of EPEassociated clinical signs, hypoproteinemia/hypoalbuminemia and positive titer (! 60) against L. intracellularis by immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Forty-two fecal samples and rayon-tipped rectal swabs collected from EPE-suspected cases were processed for DNA purification using an automated nucleic acid extraction system. The purified DNA was then analyzed by real-time PCR for the presence of the aspartate ammonia lyase (AAL) gene of L. intracellularis. Absolute quantitation was calculated using a standard curve for L. intracellularis and expressed as copy numbers of AAL gene of L. intracellularis per microliter of purified DNA. Furthermore, a realtime PCR assay targeting a universal sequence of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was used as quality control and as an indicator of fecal inhibition. DNA was successfully extracted from all feces and rectal swabs based on positive PCR signals for the universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The overall PCR accuracy for the detection of L. intracellularis was 90% with 38 foals testing PCR positive in feces (33 samples), rectal swabs (32) or both (27). Six foals tested PCR positive only in feces, while 5 tested positive only in rectal swabs. Feces yielded a significantly higher AAL gene copy number of L. intracellularis (meanAESD 5 908 AE 479 L. intracellularis AAL gene copies/ml DNA) than rectal swabs (50 AE 27 L. intracellularis AAL gene copies/ml DNA; Wilcoxon signed-rank Test, P o 0.0001). Feces and rectal swabs tested PCR negative from 4 EPE suspected foals. In conclusion, the results showed that feces yielded similar PCR positive results with a higher L. intracellularis AAL gene load than rectal swabs. By analyzing dual samples, the PCR accuracy for L. intracellularis increased from 76 and 79% for rectal swabs and feces, respectively, to 90%. Rectal swabs should be considered as an alternative sample type for EPE-suspected patients with decreased or no fecal output. Further, the diagnosis of EPE should be based on integrating clinical, clinicopathological, sonographic and laboratory results and not solely on PCR results. The purpose of the study reported here was to establish an animal model in order to study sequential clinical, laboratory and ultrasonographic parameters associated with experimental equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE). Further, a question of interest was whether experimentally infected foals would shed enough Lawsonia intracellularis in the environment to potentially infect sentinel herdmates. Recently weaned foals were assigned to either the challenge (n 5 3), the sentinel (n 5 3) or the control (n 5 2) group. Foals were experimentally infected via intragastric inoculation of 3 Â 10 10 L. intracellularis organisms grown in cell culture. Each experimentally infected foal was housed with a sentinel foal in order to assess fecooral transmission. All foals were monitored daily for the development of clinical abnormalities and were weighed once weekly for the duration of the study (90 days). Abdominal ultrasound examination was performed weekly. Feces were collected every other day for 60 days, then weekly for an additional 30 days for the quantitative molecular detection of L. intracellularis. Blood was collected weekly for hematological, biochemical and serological analysis. Only challenged foals developed transient clinical signs of proliferative enteropathy consisting of anorexia, depression, fever, cowpie feces and peripheral edema. Two challenged foals developed transient hypoalbuminemia. Fecal shedding of L. intracellularis was first detected in the challenged foals between days 12 and 18 post-inoculation and lasted for 7 to 21 days. Sonographic abnormalities were observed only in one challenged foal and consisted of mild increase in abdominal free fluid and moderately thickened small intestinal wall. Seroconversion was documented in all challenged foals and in one sentinel foal. The average daily weight gain of 4 infected foals (3 challenged and one sentinel foal) was significantly lower (Mann Whitney Test, P 5 0.0286) than the average daily weight gain of 4 non-infected foals (2 control and 2 sentinel foals). In conclusion, clinical EPE of variable degrees was induced in all foals infected with L. intracellularis. The clinical signs, abnormal biochemical and sonogarphic findings were transient and self-limiting. The study results emphasize the need to institute infectious disease control measures in order to prevent spread of L. intracellularis from infected to susceptible animal. Further, subclinical disease may be associated with decreased daily weight gain in infected weanling foals. Latency and reactivation are thought to be critical features of the epidemiology of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infections. Recru-descence of latent EHV-1 with subsequent viral shedding via nasal secretions is a potential source of infection for naı¨ve horses and has been implicated in outbreaks occurring in closed populations. The objective of this study was to examine the viral kinetics of EHV-1 following corticosteroid-mediated reactivation of experimentally induced latency in adult horses. A question of further interest was whether reactivated EHV-1 from a latently infected horse could potentially infect sentinel herdmates. Four horses previously infected with EHV-1 four months prior to study commencement received dexamethasone (100 mg/horse IV) on 5 consecutive days. Four naı¨ve horses served as sentinels and had direct nose-to-nose contact with the latently infected horses during the entire study period (60 days). All horses were monitored daily for the development of clinical abnormalities such as depression, anorexia, fever, nasal discharge, cough and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes. Whole blood and nasal secretions were collected daily for the molecular detection and cell culture of EHV-1. Serum was collected weekly for the detection of antibodies against EHV-1. All latently infected horses showed transient molecular detection of EHV-1 in blood and nasal secretions following administration of dexamethasone, but only one horse developed EHV-1 associated signs. Molecular evidence of lytic infection was detected only in blood and nasal secretions from one latently infected horse, while viral cultures remained negative for all horses in this group. Three out of 4 latently infected horses displayed an increase in antibody levels against EHV-1. None of sentinel horses developed EHV-1 associated signs, viremia, viral shedding or seroconversion. In conclusion, EHV-1 was successfully reactivated following corticosteroid administration in latently infected horses. However, transmission of reactivated virus to sentinel horses was unsuccessful. Failure to effectively transmit EHV-1 to susceptible sentinel horses may have resulted from the low level and short period of viral shedding in latently infected horses. Echocardiography is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that can provide valuable information in foals such as the identification of congenital cardiac abnormalities and infectious conditions such as endocarditis or pericarditis. It also provides a considerable amount of functional and morphological information in critically ill foals. Sequential examinations can be used to assess pathological alteration of cardiac dimensions and function in response to the presence of cardiac disease. Reference values for many of the conventional echocardiographic variables of adult horses have not been established in healthy Thoroughbred foals. In order to detect changes in the structure and function of the heart produced by disease, it is important to determine accurately the effect of normal growth and development on echocardiographic variables. The aims of this study were (1) to obtain measurements for a series of routinely used echocardiographic variables in foals at increasing age intervals to establish reference values for the breed, and (2) to establish the correlation between age and the measured echocardiographic variables in healthy Thoroughbred foals. Nineteen healthy Thoroughbred foals (11 male, 8 female; 61.7 AE 6.5 kg at day 7) were examined on days 7, 14, 28, 56, 84 and 112 of life. The foal's body weight and auscultatory findings were recorded at each examination. Two-dimensional (2-D) and M-mode echocardiographic examinations were performed by one of two operators with the foal standing and unsedated. Summary statistics (including the mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval for the means) for the 12 echocardiographic variables at each of the increasing age intervals were determined. Simple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the echocardiographic variables and age. No murmurs greater than grade 3 of 6 were recognised in any of the foals during the examinations. Early systolic murmurs (grades 1-3/6), with point of maximum intensity over the left heart base, were frequently identified (54.7% of total examinations). Reference values were determined for 12 routinely used 2-D and M-mode echocardiographic variables in the 19 healthy Thoroughbred foals at increasing age intervals. Although there was a trend for each of the echocardiographic variables to increase with increasing age (P o 0.001); only the 2-D measurement of aortic diameter (r 2 5 0.89; p o 0.001) and the 2-D measurement of left atrial diameter (r 2 5 0.80; p o 0.001) showed a strong linear relationship with age during the study period. The data from this study provides reference echocardiographic variables that may assist in the interpretation of the results of echocardiographic examinations of Thoroughbred foals of similar ages with suspected congenital or acquired cardiac disease. Disturbances of lipid metabolism that result in the accumulation of triglycerides in blood are suspected to occur in several disease processes of the critically ill neonatal foal (e.g. sepsis, prematurity and perinatal asphyxia syndrome). Hypertriglyceridemia has been reported in foals receiving lipid-containing total parenteral nutrition solutions and was recently associated with non-survival (Meyers et al. 2009 ). The aims of this prospective study were to compare serum TG concentrations in critically ill foals at admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) with age-matched healthy foals and to investigate the association of serum TG concentrations with historical information, clinical and diagnostic findings, severity of illness and survival. Serum TG concentrations were determined in 69 critically ill Thoroughbred foals less than 2 days of age admitted to the Scone Equine Hospital ICU and in 52 age-matched healthy Thoroughbred foals during August to November 2009. Serum TG concentrations were measured using a Vitros 350, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. Serum TG concentrations were significantly higher in sick foals admitted to the ICU (median 34 mg/dl, interquartile range (IRQ) 5 21 to 89, n 5 69) than in the healthy foals (median 22 mg/dl, IQR 5 15 to 32, n 5 52) (p o 0.001). The admission serum TG concentration of hospitalized foals with a gestational age of less than 320 days (median 5 70 mg/dl, IQR 5 44 to 224, n 5 10) was higher than the serum TG concentration of hospitalized foals with a gestational age greater than 320 days (median 5 32 mg/dl, IQR 5 20 to 71, n 5 55) (P 5 0.0084). The foal's gender, age at admission, length of hospital stay, history of dystocia or placentitis was not correlated with the foal's serum TG concentration at admission. The admission serum TG concentration was higher for hospitalized foals that had cold extremities, poor peripheral pulses, an indirect mean arterial pressure o 70 mmHg, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), a sepsis score 4 11, and required cardiovascular support (vasopressors and/or inotropes) than ICU foals that did not have these findings (p o 0.05). Foals with a serum creatinine concentration greater than 2.27 mg/dl had a higher admission serum TG concentration (median 5 50 mg/dl, IQR 5 25 to 101, n 5 45) than foals with serum creatinine concentration less than 2.27 mg/dl (median 5 27 mg/dl, IQR 5 16 to 38, n 5 24) (p 5 0.0089). Foals that died were more likely to have a high TG concentration than foals that were discharged from the hospital (p o 0.0007, odds ratio 1.012). Logistic regression analysis showed the measurement of serum TG concentration at admission to be a good parameter to assess survival, the presence of SIRS and the need for cardiovascular support. All these parameters had areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of greater than 0.75. In conclusion, measurement of serum TG concentrations at admission to the ICU was shown to have diagnostic value in critically ill foals in the first two days of life. Placentitis is a critical determinant of neonatal foal health; however there are no reports of the incidence of placentitis associated with admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. Eighty six foals admitted during 2009 to the Scone Equine Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) less than 72 hours old were included in the analysis. All placentas were examined and recorded with the foal admission, treatment and survival data in a spreadsheet which was then transferred to a statistics program for analysis (JMP 7, SAS Institute Inc, Cary NC, USA). Contingency analysis, Fishers Exact Test, Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis Tests or Logistic Regression was used as appropriate. Abnormal placentas were recorded for 17 of the 86 foals (19.8%) admitted to the ICU. Foals admitted to the ICU that were delivered from mares with a normal placenta were more likely to be older at admission to the ICU than foals from mares with placentitis (p 5 0.001, unit OR 1.3). All foals from mares with placentits were admitted to the ICU before 9 hrs of age. The probability that a foal had a gestational age of o 320 days was greater if the mare had placentitis than if the mare had a normal placenta (p 5 0.028, RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.3-11.7). The probability that the delivery was complicated by dystocia was greater if the mare had placentitis compared to mares with normal placentas (p 5 0.0015, RR 2.29; 95% CI 1.5-3.5) There was no association between the presence of placentitis and gender, the length of hospital stay or the assessment of the foal as dysmature. Foals from mares with placentitis were more likely to have perinatal asphyxia syndrome (p o 0.001, RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.5-2.3) than foals from mares with a normal placenta. There was no association of placentitis with positive blood culture, pneumonia, fractured ribs, renal failure, infectious gastrointestinal disease, umbilical infection, uroperitoneum, infectious orthopedic disease, or noninfectious orthopedic disease. Foals from mares with a normal placenta were more likely to have an initial IgG of 4 800 mg/dL than foals from mares with placentitis (p 5 0.0002, RR 5.3, 95% CI 1.4-19.7). Foals from mares with placentitis were more likely to have a low blood glucose (p 5 0.0003, unit OR 1.6) and less likely to have a low serum creatinine concentration (p 5 0.0003, unit OR 0.99) than foals from mares with normal placentas. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves for glucose and creatinine were 0.79 and 0.84 respectively. Foals from mares with placentitis were more likely to have a sepsis score ! 11, require parenteral nutrition, require inotropes or vasopressors, be recumbent at admission, have poor peripheral pulses and cold extremities than foals from mares with a normal placenta (p o 0.05). However, foals from mares with placentitis had a similar probability of survival as foals from mares with normal placentas. These data indicate that placentitis increases the probability of prematurity, dystocia, perinatal asphyxia syndrome and failure of transfer of passive immunity. Foals from mares with placentitis are more likely to present with signs of shock and more likely to require intensive supportive therapy but have the same probability of survival as foals from mares with a normal placenta. Fibrinogen concentration [FIB] is measured in sick neonatal foals as an indication of inflammation, disease severity and response to treatment. These foals are generally administered plasma in order to treat failure of passive transfer, as treatment for sepsis, and to provide additional colloidal oncotic support. Transfused plasma contains fibrinogen ([FIB] Plasma ) from the donor animal. This study was undertaken to determine if [FIB] Plasma affects post-transfusion [FIB] Foal in sick neonatal foals. [FIB]Plasma of comercially prepared fresh frozen plasma was determined using citrated plasma provided by the manufacturer for each specific plasma lot. [FIB] Foal was determined in 31 foals receiving plasma transfusions at admission and 2 and 6 hours following tranfusion completion. Two foals with extreme values were removed from analysis as outliers. Not all data points were available for all foals. Kruskal-Wallis and regression analysis were used to assess differences between sample periods and associations, significance P 0.05. Median [FIB] Plasma was 245 mg/dl (Range 152-378) and was not outside the normal range for any lot. [FIB] Foal : Admission 277 mg/ observed. The rationale being that all 'free virus' will be blocked by VN antibodies. The data was evaluated by regression analysis for fit and variance. A p-value of o 0.05 was used to determine significant differences in plaque counts observed after co-incubation with or without VN antibodies during initial 4 hour incubation. . . . Plaques developed in all wells. However, a plaque reduction between 10 and 90% was observed when VN antibodies were cocultured during phase 1 of the experiment (p o 0.05). While other effects may have been responsible for this reduction, these findings may also suggest that individual PBMC -EC combinations exhibited stronger or weaker adhesions. A plaque reduction of 10% in the VN antibody -containing wells may therefore be an indicator of 'efficient' or intensified cell-cell contact or adhesion, and a 90% plaque reduction may be suggestive of 'poor' adhesion. Future studies will focus on co-cultivating PBMC and CNS-EC with cytokines or adhesion-blocking antibodies and in the presence of VN antibodies to determine the role of adhesion molecules in CNS-EC infection with EHV-1. Lawsonia intracellularis (LI), the causative agent of equine proliferative enteropathy (EPE), is an emerging disease with an increasing economic importance in the equine industry, which has placed an emphasis on early detection and prompt treatment of mildly affected horses. The purpose of this study was to utilize multiple diagnostic modalities, along with regular monitoring, to recognize LI-exposed weanlings on an endemic farm and target these horses for additional testing to identify and treat subclinically affected horses to prevent development of clinical EPE. Monthly serum samples for the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) were and bimonthly feces for rtPCR for the aspartate ammonia lyase gene were collected from a total of 53 weanlings on an LI-endemic farm from August 2008 to January 2009. An IPMA titer of ! 60 was regarded as a positive result. Any weanling with positive IPMA or PCR tests, or clinical signs of EPE, had biochemistry blood work submitted. A total of 32/53 (60.3%) horses had positive IPMA titers and 19/32 of these horses were treated for EPE. Of these 32 horses, only 5 showed outward manifestations of EPE; 2/5 horses were hospitalized for supportive care and 1/2 hospitalized horses were euthanized. The number of horses that were hospitalized during this period was less than the year before when no laboratory diagnostics were regularly used. In conclusion, IPMA testing for L. intracellularis appears to be a useful tool when combined with careful monitoring, as well as targeted biochemical monitoring, for detecting subclinical and mild cases of EPE. Ulcerative keratitis is a frequent clinical condition affecting horses throughout the world. Although trauma is typically believed to be the initiating cause, secondary bacterial and fungal infections can result in serious sequelae such as corneal malacia. The organisms which initially infect a corneal defect are believed to originate from the normal conjunctival flora. These organisms can vary according to geographic location and season. Knowledge of these isolates, and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns, can aid practitioners in their choice of initial empirical treatment. The aim of this study was to describe the normal conjunctival flora in horses in the southern United Kingdom at three different time points throughout the year. Conjunctival swabs were obtained from 60 clinically normal horses in May (n 5 35), July (n 5 15) and November (n 5 10). Routine bacterial and fungal culture was performed and sensitivity to 6 antimicrobials (chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, gentamicin, neomycin, oxytetracycline) determined for bacterial isolates using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Bacteria were isolated from 58% of horses, and fungi from 15%. The majority were gram negative. (53%) The most frequently isolated bacterial species were Acinobacter spp (35% of isolates), Staphylococcus spp (26%) and Micrococcus spp (15%). Fungal isolates were Aspergillus spp, Mucor spp and Absidia spp. The presence of bacteria or fungi was not affected by season. Compared to similar studies in other countries, gram negative isolates were more commonly isolated, and fungi less commonly. Based on the current study, appropriate antimicrobials to prevent bacterial infection of corneal ulcers include topical gentamicin or tetracyclines. The development of resistance by bacteria to antimicrobials is a major threat to the health and welfare of humans and animals. Antimicrobial use is considered to be the key driver in the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The development of AMR can be evaluated by identifying resistance patterns of commensal bacteria, which can potentially act as pathogens and can also provide a vast reservoir of mobile resistance genes. This study aims to document the development and persistence of AMR in commensal fecal E coli isolates from horses treated with antibiotics. Fecal samples were obtained from 16 client-owned hospitalized horses treated with systemic antibiotics on the 1 st (TI) and 5 th (T2) days of treatment. A third sample was obtained from 9 horses 2 weeks after treatment. (T3) Antibiotic sensitivity testing using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method was performed on three E coli colonies from each sample. The percentage of isolates resistant to each of 8 antibiotic drug classes was compared at each time point. Isolates resistant to cefpodoxime were evaluated for Extended Spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production using a combination disc method. A substantial increase in resistance to all classes except for carbapenems was identified between T1 and T2. (Table) By T3, the percentage of resistant isolates had decreased for all classes, but had not returned to pre-treatment levels for penicillins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides. Multiple drug resistance was identified in 71% of horses at T2 and 44% of horses at T3. E coli from all horses treated with cephalosporins showed cephalosporin resistance by T2. All but one of these showed ESBL production. Commensal fecal E coli rapidly display antimicrobial resistance. Resistant isolates may persist for more than 2 weeks after treatment. This study is the first attempt to classify ES and epilepsy in a referral equine population. As in humans, such classifications are dynamic concepts but could help clinicians in the establishment of a diagnosis, a therapeutic plan or prognosis. Articular enzymatic and oxidative stresses are involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) and can be assessed by different markers, e.g. matrix metalloproteases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and F2-Isoprostane. Nutraceuticals have been used for prevention and treatment of OA, and there are in vitro evidences of their positive effect. The objective of this placebo-controlled study was to evaluate in clinically healthy ponies whether a 6-week oral supplementation, with a glucosamine-chondroitine sulfate-harpagophytum procumbens complex (G-CS-HP), would affect MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in synovial fluid (SF) as well as MMP-2 activity and F2-Isoprostane concentration before and after interleukine-1b (IL-1b) stimulation in supernatant of chondrocyte cultures (CC). Sixteen young (2 to 4 years) and clinically healthy Belgian ponies were enrolled in the study before being euthanized for anatomy teaching purposes. Eight ponies received a daily G-CS-HP oral supplement and eight ponies received a placebo. SF and chondrocytes were collected from fetlocks within 2 hours after euthanasia. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity was determined in SF and CC supernatants by zymography, and F2-Isoprostane was determined by ELISA. Data were submitted to analysis of variance. A p value o 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The G-CS-HP supplement group showed significantly reduced MMP-9 activity in SF and significantly increased MMP-2 activity. In CC supernatant, MMP-2 activity was also significantly higher before and after IL-1b stimulation in the treatment group than in the control group. F2-Isoprostane concentrations were significantly lower before and after IL-1b stimulation in CC supernatants from supplemented ponies. These data suggest that the oral supplementation with G-CS-HP tested decreased MMP-9 and increased MMP-2 activity in SF. Ex vivo results on CC support these findings, since CC supernatant has an increased MMP-2 activity. They also suggest that the inflammatory response of chondrocytes in supplemented animals may be reduced, as shown by a decreased oxidative response after IL-1b stimulation. Oxidative stress, occurring secondary to elaboration of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species by activated leukocytes, has been shown to play an important role in initiation and perpetuation of multiple organ dysfunction and failure in the setting of sepsis in multiple species. In the septic horse, the laminae are the most frequent tissue undergoing injury, and evidence of oxidative stress has been reported in an experimental black walnut extract (BWE) laminitis model. Laminitis induced with soluble carbohydrate (CHO) may be more similar to clinical disease than the BWE model due to the fact that CHO-induced animals more commonly proceed to laminar failure. However, the role of oxidative stress in the CHO model has not been reported. Banked laminar tissue collected at various time points from animals subjected to BWE and CHO protocols were used in this study. State-of-the-art immunohistochemistry (IHC) for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT; marker of nitrosative stress) was optimized using the Ventana Ultraview Universal TM system with Fast Red as the chromogen on paraffin-embedded laminar sections from CHO horses (control, n 5 8; developmental, n 5 6; Obel grade 1 [OG1], n 5 6) in order to identify and quantify the cell types positive for 3-NT. BWE laminar sections were stained as a positive control (control, developmental, and late time points; n 5 1). Very few 3-NT-positive cells were visualized in any of the samples from the CHO model compared to the large number of cells observed in the BWE model; within the CHO samples, significantly fewer positive cells were noted in OG1 samples than controls (p 5 0.04). Positive cells in the CHO model were predominantly interstitial leukocytes and endothelial cells and were limited to the laminar dermis (in contrast to the BWE model, where prominent laminar epithelial signal is present by OG1 lameness). To quantitatively assess laminar 3-NT concentrations, a commercially-available competitive chemiluminescent plate ELISA (Millipore; Temecula, CA) was used to assess total protein extracts of pulverized BWE and CHO laminar samples. No significant difference in 3-NT concentration was observed between control (n 5 8), developmental (n 5 6), and OG1 (n 5 6) samples from CHO horses. The concentration of 3-NT in BWE samples was significantly higher at the 1.5 h time point (n 5 5) than at the 0 h (control, n 5 5), 3 h (n 5 4), or OG1 (n 5 5) time points (p 5 0.028). In keeping with previous reports, these data do not support the hypothesis that nitrosative oxidative stress plays a prominent pathophysiologic role in CHO-overload laminitis and only support a transient nitrosative stress in the BWE model of laminitis. Thus, nitrosative stress (and, possibly general oxidative stress) does not appear to be the central event leading to laminar injury and failure in the CHO model of laminitis. The purpose of the study is to evaluate an in vitro model of insulin resistance which is a cause of laminitis in horses. Digital palmar vessel segments were collected from clinically healthy horses immediately after euthanasia. Four arterial and four venous rings (3 mm wide) were prepared from each horse. Each ring was mounted in a tissue bath containing Tyrode's solution at 371C by fixing one side of the ring to the floor of the bath and the other end to a force transducer interfaced with a polygraph. One ring of each vessel type was used as a control. Each of the remaining 3 rings of each vessel type was incubated for 30 min with insulin (to induce resistance), Wortmannin (PI3 kinase blocker), and PD 098059 (MAP kinase blocker), respectively. The rings were given 2 g initial tension and allowed to equilibrate for 45 min.The bath solution was gently replaced at every 15 min, drugs were added and the ring tension was readjusted to 2 g except at the final wash. After the incubation period, the rings were contracted with phenylephrine. When the contractile response reached a plateau, a single dose of insulin was added to the bath and the response of each ring was monitored for thirty min. Insulin relaxed the control rings and those treated with PD 098059 but contracted the rings pretreated with insulin and Wortmannin. The present study demonstrated successful induction of insulin resistance in arterial rings. However, the responses of venous rings were inconsistent and unreliable. The study suggests that the induction of insulin resistance in equine digital arterial rings is reliable and gives a good in vitro model for studying insulin resistance in laminitis. The study also suggests that MAP kinase may be involved in the pathology of vessels in insulin resistance. non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, a syndrome of insulin resistance sharing some similarities with equine metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone in adult horses following multiple dose oral administration. Pioglitazone hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) was administered per os for 11 doses at 24-hour intervals in an inert carrier (unflavored gelatin), mixed immediately prior to administration and plasma samples were collected. Initially, a pilot study was performed using one horse; and thereafter the drug was administered to six horses. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem dual mass spectrometry. The maximum plasma concentration (mean AESD) was 509.1 AE 413.5 and 448.1 AE 303.5 ng/mL achieved at 1.88 AE 1.39 and 2.83 AE 1.81 h following oral administration of the first and eleventh dose, respectively. Apparent half life (t 1/2 ) was 9.94 AE 4.57 and 9.63 AE 5.33 h of the first and eleventh dose respectively. There was no significant difference noted between pharmacokinetic parameters calculated on the first and eleventh doses. No adverse effects were noted in any of the horses. This study showed that in normal horses pioglitazone at a dose of 1 mg/kg administered orally at 24 h dosing intervals results in plasma drug concentrations and total drug exposure approximating, but slightly below, those considered therapeutic in human medicine (maximal plasma concentration 617 AE 129 ng/mL). Endotoxaemia is a major cause of equine morbidity and mortality. Endotoxin (LPS) plays a pivotal role in many pathophysiological states, inducing a cytokine mediated hyper-inflammatory cascade after activating mononuclear leukocytes. Hyperimmune plasma products from horses immunised against a mutant J5 strain of E. coli are currently used in the treatment of endotoxaemia. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of commercially available hyperimmune equine plasma on the clinical and leukocyte responses in a low dose LPS challenge. Secondly to determine whether hyperimmune plasma decreases TNFa production and/or bio-availability of TNF, which may be reduced by soluble TNFa receptors (sTNFaR) in the plasma. Six adult standardbred horses were used in a randomised cross over design. Purified LPS (E. Coli 055:B5; 30 ng/kg) was administered intravenously after pre-treatment with hyperimmune equine plasma (Equiplas; Plasvacc Pty Ltd; 2 L) or equivalent volume of saline. Each horse underwent both treatments (in random order), with a washout period of at least 14 days between each experiment. Clinical signs (including rectal temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate) were monitored at frequent intervals (15 min for 2 hours then every 30 min to 6 hours). Jugular blood samples were taken at the same time points. Leukocyte and platelet counts were performed using a Coulter Counter (model Z1; Coulter Electronics Inc.). Total TNFa was measured in heparinised plasma by ELISA assay (Endogen) using equine recombinant TNF for the standard curve. Bioavailable (unbound) TNFa was measured by a cell survival bioassay (L293 mouse fibroblasts). LPS caused a significant increase in rectal temperature, peaking at 39 AE 0.21C at 210 min; other clinical signs were mild. Hyperimmune plasma did not significantly affect rectal temperature, heart rate or respiratory rate. Blood leukocyte counts decreased from 12.4 AE 1.6 Â 10 9 /L at time 0 to a nadir of 4.1 AE 0.8 at 105 min, in controls, before recovering back to baseline values by 6 hours. Blood leukocyte counts were not significantly affected by hyperimmune equine plasma, reaching a nadir of 5.4 AE 1.1 Â 10 9 /L and recovering to 13.1 AE 0.2 Â 10 9 /L at 6 hours. Plasma TNFa concentrations measured by ELISA peaked at 881.9 AE 58.9 pg/ml in saline treated horses after 90 min, and hyperimmune equine plasma administration did not significantly affect the peak TNFa concentration (812.4 AE 126.1 pg/ml). However, the bioavailable (unbound) TNFa concentration measured by bioassay was significantly reduced by hyperimmune plasma pretreatment (1044.4 pg/ml AE 199.9 pg/ml compared with 1373.9 AE 107.6 pg/ml in saline treated controls; p 5 0.05). These data suggested that although the hyperimmune equine plasma did not significantly reduce the signs of endotoxemia in this experimental model, the bioavailable fraction of TNFa did appear to be moderately reduced. This effect is consistent with the presence of substances such as sTNFR in the hyperimmune plasma. Further work is required to confirm the presence and identity of these immune modulating factors. In models of acute lung injury lidocaine has beneficial anti-inflammatory actions including reduced neutrophilic inflammation. Further, it reduces inflammation and improves lung function in asthmatics. The present study tested the hypothesis that lidocaine would attenuate pulmonary inflammation and function changes in heaves-affected horses. In a randomized cross-over design, 6 heaves-susceptible horses in remission received intravenous lactated ringers solution or lidocaine hydrochloride 2% with at least 4 weeks pasture between treatments. Baseline clinical score (CS, grade 0-8) and pleural pressure change (DPpl max ) were measured, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology and CBC were assessed before treatment (during remission). Treatments were delivered as continuous infusions 4 hours before and for 68 hours during exposure to hay/straw challenge, after which measurements were repeated. Serum lidocaine concentrations were monitored daily. Data analysis was by 2-way repeated measures ANOVA (p o 0.05). At baseline, there were no significant differences between treatments in CS, DPpl max and BALF cytology. Lidocaine concentration was consistently 4 1000 ng/ml, and, as reported previously in humans, was associated with a significant reduction in peripheral eosinophils. Following challenge CS and DPpl max increased significantly from 2.4 to 4.5 and 4.5 to 12.7 cmH 2 O, respectively, but there was no difference between treatments. Total cells in BALF were significantly increased after exposure, but contrary to our hypothesis the cell numbers were significantly greater after lidocaine. Neutrophil percentage in BALF increased but there were no differences between treatments. We conclude lidocaine has no anti-inflammatory effects in heaves. Breathing cold air during strenuous exercise has been shown in multiple species to stimulate airway inflammation, producing a syndrome known as ''ski asthma''. Paradoxically, strenuous exercise is also known to increase susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Studies in our laboratory on the cellular and biochemical mechanisms of ski asthma have described a distinct pattern of cytokine expression, most notably upregulation of Th2 cytokines that might translate to suppression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), thus increasing the susceptibility of the respiratory tract to pathogens that are normally cleared through CMI. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that horses exercised while breathing cold air causes functional impairment of airway innate immune function. Horses (n 5 11) were examined in a randomized block crossover design after exercising under controlled environmental conditions: breathing room temperature air and breathing subfreezing air. Exercise challenges consisted of 5 min of walking (3.5-4 m/s), 5 min of trotting (4.5-6.0 m/s), and 2 min of cantering (7.8-9.0 m/s), titrated to the individual horse to achieve peak heart rate of 160 bpm. Airway leukocytes were harvested 5 and 48 hours post exercise challenge via bronchoaveolar lavage. Oxidative burst capacity of mononuclear cells and neutrophils was measured by flow cytometry, using phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) to stimulate oxidative burst (or omitting the PMA for measurement of basal oxidative burst), and dichlorofluorescin diacetate to convert the oxidative burst to a fluorescent signal. Phagocytic capacity was measured in the same cell populations via flow cytometry. All cells were incubated (stimulated samples at 371C and unstimulated samples at 41C) with 1 micron FITC beads added to the samples. At 5 hr after exercise while breathing cold air, basal neutrophil oxidative burst was increased (p o 0.0001) and stimulated phagocytic capacity of neutrophils was decreased (p o 0.025). No significant effect of inspired air temperature was observed in any leukocyte function assay 48 hours post exercise. The increase in neutrophil oxidative burst activity following cold air exercise may be an important mechanism contributing to damage of the airway lining, leading to pulmonary mechanical dysfunction. Increased expression of Th2 cytokines after cold air exercise (previously demonstrated in this model), may have some functional relationship with the downregulation of phagocytic capacity of neutrophils. Leukocyte function assays more specific to viral pathogen resistance may be needed to determine whether there is increased susceptibility to viral pathogens as a result of cold air exercise. Horses that are critically ill often require urgent fluid therapy to correct hypotension, hypovolemia, and volume depletion. Hypertonic sodium solution (7.2% NaCl; HSS) and 6% hetastarch (HET) are two fluids solutions used to assist in these conditions. HSS increases blood volume and pressure and HET increases plasma oncotic pressure to reduce capillary leakage/fluid loss. Although the principles of fluid resuscitation relate to volume expansion, from a physiological standpoint it is likely that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA), which modulates vasomotor tone, blood pressure and inflammation is involved. Upon HPAA stimulation, the hypothalamus secretes vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), the pituitary releases adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal gland cortex to release cortisol and aldosterone. Based on our understanding of the equine HPAA, we hypothesized that the administration of HSS or HET will induce an endocrine response to retain water and sodium (volume expansion), which will be associated with increased arterial and central venous pressure. Ten healthy horses were given HSS (4 ml/kg), HET (10 ml/kg), or 5% dextrose (10 ml/kg) in a cross-over design. Arterial and venous catheters were placed for solution administration, blood collection and blood pressure measurements. Blood samples were collected at À10, 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 270, 300, 330, 360 minutes, 12 and 24 hours. AVP, ACTH, aldosterone, cortisol, hematocrit (HCT), central venous pressure (CVP), and colloid oncotic pressure (COP) were determined. Urine samples were collected every 30 minutes. HSS induced a rapid AVP response that was followed by a mild increase in ACTH and cortisol, while aldosterone concentrations decreased. CVP increased while HCT and COP decreased from HSS. HET increased AVP, ACTH, cortisol and aldosterone concentrations. While CVP increased and HCT decreased with HET (as HSS), COP increased with HET and remained high for 24 h. Dextrose decreased COP and HCT, increased CVP but had no effect on the hormones. Urine output increased and specific gravity decreased with all three solutions. We conclude that the acute response to resuscitation solutions, in addition to rapid volume expansion, is also the result of changes in hormones that modulate vascular tone and fluid volume. Future studies will address the HPAA endocrine response in critically ill hypotensive horses. Gastric ulcers in the nonglandular stomach of horses are common and are likely caused by the presence of stomach acids. Recently, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), byproducts of the fermentation of carbohydrate by resident stomach bacteria, have been shown to decrease sodium transport across nonglandular mucosa, which leads to cell swelling and eventual ulceration. However, the role of the cellular sodium transport, specifically sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (NAKA), has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of NAKA and sodium transport in the pathogenesis of nonglandular gastric ulcer disease. Samples of nonglandular gastric mucosa were collected from horses (n 5 10) donated to the UTCVM for diseases not related to the gastrointestinal tract. Nonglandular (NG) tissue bioelectric properties were measured in an Ussing Chamber system while exposed to normal Ringers solution (NRS, control), a VFA mixture containing VFA concentrations found 2 hours after feeding a sweet feed diet (0.5 Kg/Kg BW) (VFA Mixture-AF) and a VFA mixture containing high acetic (40 mM) (VFA Mixture-HAc), in NRS, at pH 1.5, 4, or 7. After NRS or VFA exposure, tissues were removed from the Ussings Chamber system and divided into half. Half of the tissue was examined under light microscopy for swell swelling and half the tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of mRNAexpression the b1 subunit of NAKA gene using real-time PCR. NG mucosa exposed to NRS (pH 4.0 and 1.5) showed immediate significant decrease in PD, followed by a decrease in Isc and R. NG mucosa, when exposed to the VFA mixture-AF, showed a decrease in PD and Isc, similar to tissue exposed to NRS at the same pH. However, NG mucosa exposed to VFA mixture-HAc showed an immediate decrease in PD and Isc. Nonglandular cell swelling was noted in tissues exposed to the VFA mixture-AF. When the tissues were all grouped together there was no difference in relative expression of mRNA for NAKA, however, when horses were divided by age group, for horses o 5 years of age (n 5 5) relative expression of mRNA for NAKA was significantly decreased in tissues exposed to the VFA mixtures, whereas, for horses 4 12 years of age (n 5 5) relative expression of mRNA for NAKA was significantly increased compared to controls. Results suggest that VFAs present in gastric juice from excessive grain feeding, at pH 4.0, result in changes in barrier function and that this barrier function may be related to alternations in NAKA and may be age-dependent. This may account for the increased prevalence of nonglandular ulcer disease in younger horses. In the human with endotoxemia/sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs, leading to injury and dysfunction/ failure of several organs including most commonly the liver, lungs, kidney, and intestinal tract. Sepsis in the adult horse, the most common cause being gastrointestinal diseases such as enterocolitis or colon torsions, most commonly leads to injury of the digital laminae in the form of laminitis. Renal dysfunction/failure can occur in some cases (especially with enterocolitis) and mild liver dysfunction may be noted, but it is much less common to have pulmonary dysfunction/ failure. A similar SIRS has been reported in the black walnut extract (BWE) model of laminitis evidence by leucopenia, leukocyte migration into the tissues and increased inflammatory gene expression in the lung and liver. Interestingly, the carbohydrate overload (CHO) laminitis model, a model that more closely reflects the severity of laminar injury observed in clinical sepsis-related laminitis cases, does not have the same SIRS-like events (i.e. no leucopenia) as the BWE model. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine inflam-matory signaling events in hepatic, pulmonary, and renal tissue in the CHO laminitis model. Archived snap frozen samples were used from eighteen horses administered either water (CON group, n 5 6, euthanized 24 h after water administration) or 17.6 g of starch/kg body weight via nasogastric tube. Horses administered starch were euthanized after a two degree increase in rectal temperature (DEV group, n 5 6) or at the onset of Obel grade 1 lameness (OG1 group, n 5 6). Real time-quantitative PCR for IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFa, COX-1 and COX-2 was performed (see Table 1 ). Interestingly, although the kidney is the most likely to be injured of the three organs in equine sepsis, the liver underwent the greatest inflammatory signaling, most likely reflecting function of this organ in processing toxins from the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, increases in inflammatory gene expression of the organs were less than previously reported for the primary ''target tissue'' in the septic horse, the lamina. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is detected in the blood of horses after experimental alimentary carbohydrate overload and may contribute to the development of laminitis by inducing systemic inflammation. Models for endotoxemia have focused upon single bolus infusions of LPS in the past, but clinical endotoxemia has a greater magnitude and duration. The objective of this preliminary study was therefore to assess two models of prolonged (48 h) endotoxemia. Twelve healthy adult horses were randomly assigned to receive a continuous rate infusion (CRI) of LPS (80 mg total over 48 h; n 5 4), a saline CRI (80 mL/h for 48 h; n 5 4), or 8 boluses of LPS (10 mg q6h for 48 h; n 5 4). Physical parameters were recorded every 4 h and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed at -24, 8, 24, 32, and 48 h. A treatment Â time effect (P o 0.001) was detected for rectal temperature, with LPS groups differing significantly from the saline group. Mean rectal temperature was significantly higher than baseline from 4 to 12 h and again at 20 h, but did not increase significantly again after this point. With the exception of one horse, all animals treated with LPS exhibited tachycardia. Laminitis was not detected. A significant time effect was detected for area under the glucose curve, but groups did not differ significantly. No differences were detected between the two models and most horses appeared to be more tolerant of LPS after 24 h. These models increased the duration of systemic inflammation, but did not match the severity of naturally occurring disease. Acute gastrointestinal disease in the horse may be associated with a number of different processes including strangulations, impac-tions and inflammatory lesions. Endotoxemia may be a concurrent factor in a number of these conditions, affecting morbidity and mortality. Available medical treatments for systemic inflammation associated with endotoxemia may not ameliorate all of the inflammatory pathways, and other therapies are being investigated to more effectively target leukocyte activation. The evaluation of biomarkers of inflammation and clinical disease will help in understanding and assessing these conditions and the effectiveness of novel therapeutic agents. The aim of this study was to measure Activin A, a member of the TGFb family of proteins which has been validated as a plasma marker of endotoxemia in other species, in acute gastrointestinal disease in horses. Thirty horses of various breeds presenting to the University of Melbourne Equine Hospital with signs of acute gastrointestinal disease were examined in this study. Conditions were grouped into strangulating (large or small intestinal strangulations), non-strangulating (including impactions, displacements, intussusceptions) or inflammatory (colotyphlitis, peritonitis) categories, based on standard diagnostic criteria. Ten normal horses were used as controls. Jugular venous blood samples were obtained on admission, and serum and plasma stored at À801C. Samples were assayed for TNFa (Equine TNFa ELISA kit; Endogen), serum amyloid A (SAA ELI-SA Kit; Tridelta) and activin A (Quantikine Activin A ELISA kit; R&D Systems). Horses in the inflammatory, strangulating and non-strangulating categories had significantly elevated serum SAA levels compared with controls, with greatest concentrations recorded in the inflammatory group (median 709, range 276-1480 mg/ml vs normals 0-40 mg/ml). A similar trend was observed in the TNFa concentrations, although this was not statistically significant. Plasma activin A was significantly greater in the inflammatory gastrointestinal disease category (median 55.2, range 7.8-264.7 pg/ml) than the nonstrangulating category (median 24.7, range 0.2-31.0 pg/ml) or the normal horses (median 5.9, range 0.4-23.2 pg/ml). There was a significant correlation between activin A and TNFa concentrations in individual horses (p 5 0.003), but not between activin A and SAA concentrations (p 5 0.32). Although these markers of inflammation could not be used alone to distinguish between different causes of gastrointestinal disease, these results suggest that they might be useful in monitoring the severity of inflammation and/or endotoxemia in such cases. Activin A has not previously been measured in the horse, and plasma concentrations of activin A were significantly increased in gastrointestinal disease, where this protein may play a role in inflammation and endotoxemia, as in other species. This protein may be a useful biomarker for evaluating novel therapies for endotoxemia. Previous reports of thromboelastography or thromboelastometry (TE) have employed recalcification to assess coagulation in citrated equine whole blood. The objective of this study was to determine whether equine citrated whole blood undergoes changes prior to initiation of TE via recalcification which impact the results obtained with TE. Whole blood was collected by atraumatic venipuncture from 11 normal horses into siliconized glass tubes containing 3.2% citrate (9:1 blood/citrate) and held at 371C for variable times prior to initiation of TE. TE parameters evaluated were clot time (CT), clot formation time (CFT), alpha angle (a), and maximum clot firmness (MCF). Mean (SD) results were: Sample holding had a profound impact on results, with increasing coagulability developing over the 30 min time period. Equine citrated blood undergoes marked ex vivo contact activation after collection. When recalcification alone is used to initiate clotting, coagulation is entirely dependent on the FXIIa production that occurs in the sample ex vivo after collection. Since contact ac- Lameness attributed to osteoarthritis (OA) is a major cause of reduced performance and economic burden in the equine industry. Pathological changes in osteoarthritic joints include excess production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ). This inflammatory mediator upregulates metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade cartilage as well as suppresses aggrecan synthesis and total proteoglycan accumulation. It also contributes to the development of pain in OA. The compounds pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and glucosamine in the form of glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine chloride or N-acetyl glucosamine (NG) have been used for the management of equine OA. These compounds have been documented to promote chondrocyte anabolic activity and are considered disease modifying. However, their anti-inflammatory activity is less understood. To address this question, we tested whether these compounds can inhibit the inflammatory response using an equine chondrocyte culture model. We also determined whether the PPS-NG mixture when combined with an avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), glucosamine (GLU), and chondroitin sulfate (CS) mixture would exert a more potent anti-inflammatory effect. ASU, GLU, and CS individually have been shown to provide chondroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro. Equine chondrocytes (5 Â 10 5 cells/well) were incubated for 24 hrs with: control media alone, mixtures of clinically relevant concentrations of ASU 1 GLU 1 CS, PPS 1 NG, or the combination of ASU 1 GLU 1 CS and PPS 1 NG. Cells were activated for 24 hrs with IL-110 ng/ml). Supernatants were analyzed for PGE 2 production by ELISA. Immunostaining of chondrocytes for type II collagen and aggrecan verified that they continue to express the cartilage phenotype. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and the Tukey post-hoc test with significance set at p o 0.05. Activated chondrocytes pre-treated with different concentrations of PPS 1 NG significantly reduced PGE 2 synthesis (p o 0.001). Similarly, the ASU 1 GLU 1 CS mixture elicited a significant decrease in PGE 2 production (p o 0.001). Combining the PPS 1 NG mixture with the ASU 1 GLU 1 CS significantly potentiated the inhibitory effect on cytokine-induced PGE 2 production (p o 0.001). Our finding reinforces earlier reports that these compounds exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anabolic activity. Superior antiinflammatory activity may be achieved with the combination of these compounds while minimizing adverse side effects such as life-threatening gastrointestinal complications. The responsiveness of chondrocytes to this combination supports their potential utility for the management of joint inflammation in horses and other species. ( Hepcidin has been found to be the key regulator of iron metabolism. Hepcidin up-regulation causes hypoferremia during systemic inflammatory disorders in some species. Recent work has shown that equine hepcidin is predominantly expressed in the horse's liver. In this study, hepcidin gene expression was determined in liver and bone marrow of healthy horses following intramuscular administration of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). Inflammation was induced in 4 normal horses by two intramuscular injections of 5.0 ml of FCA into the neck muscle at 0 and 12 hours. Clinical evaluations as well as fibrinogen and plasma iron were measured at multiple time points between 0 and 96 hours after the first injection. Liver and bone marrow biopsies were taken immediately prior to (control) and 12 and 24 hours after the first FCA injection. Expression of the hepcidin gene in liver and bone marrow was quantified by real-time PCR. Mild swelling was observed at the injection sites. Plasma iron was significantly decreased from the pre-inoculation level at 8 h. The lowest plasma iron was observed at 36 h (30% initial value). Fibrinogen did not increase until 36 h and peaked at 48 h. Liver hepcidin messenger RNA relative expression was up-regulated (two fold) at 12 h post first FCA injection and remained increased at 24 h. Bone marrow hepcidin relative expression was not influenced by FCA injection. It was concluded that FCA administration caused rapid onset of hypoferremia and this was likely the result of up-regulated hepatic hepcidin gene expression. Equine vaccination is an important method of prophylaxis against several important infectious diseases. Serological responses to vaccination can predict efficacy and be used to compare product performance. The study described here was performed to determine whether contemporary equine vaccines in common use show significant performance differences between products as determined by serological responses. The study was conducted in 31 6-9 mth old horses housed on the same farm, with no history of vaccination or disease. Horses were assigned to three vaccination groups (each group was vaccinated with products from a single manufacturer; n 5 8 in each group) or a control group (n 5 7). Vaccination antigens included Eastern & Western Equine Encephalitis (EEE & WEE), tetanus, influenza virus and EHV-1 & 4 in each group. Products evaluated were sourced from Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Fort Dodge Animal Health, and Intervet Animal Health. Horses were vaccinated on two occasions, 3 weeks apart, and serum was collected at the times of vaccination, and approximately monthly thereafter until 3 months after the second vaccination. Serological responses were determined by ELISA (tetanus and influenza), serum neutralization titer (EHV-1&4), and plaque reduction assay titer (Eastern & Western Encephalitis). Two horses were lost from the study due to unrelated events. For statistical analysis, data values for each animal were summed over the entire time course of the experiment to deal with repeated measures. The summed values for each horse were not normally distributed and so were ranked, and a one-way ANOVA performed on the ranked data. Means were compared using Tukey's test. Statistical significance was reported when p values 0.05. (7) p o 0.05 as compared to a: 1 min, b: 10 min, c: 20 min, d: 30 min
