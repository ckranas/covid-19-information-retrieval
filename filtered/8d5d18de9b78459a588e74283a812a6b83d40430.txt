Background: Cytokine storm is the exaggerated immune response often observed in viral infections. It is also intimately linked with the progression of COVID-19 disease as well as associated complications and mortality. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm might help in reducing COVID-19-associated health complications. The number of COVID-associated deaths (as of January 15, 2021; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) in the USA is high (1,199/million) as compared to countries like India is low (110/million). Although the reason behind this is not clear, spices may have some role in explaining this difference. Spices and herbs are used in different traditional medicines, especially in countries such as India to treat various chronic diseases due to their potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Aim: To evaluate the literature available on the anti-inflammatory properties of some spices which might prove beneficial in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. Method: A detailed literature search has been conducted on PubMed for collecting information pertaining to the COVID-19; the history, origin, key structural features, and mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2; the repurposed drugs in use for the management of COVID-19 and the anti-inflammatory role of spices to combat COVID-19 associated cytokine storm. Key findings: The literature search resulted in numerous in vitro, in vivo and clinical trials that have reported the potency of spices to exert anti-inflammatory effects by regulating crucial molecular targets for inflammation. Significance: As spices are derived from Mother Nature and are inexpensive, they are relatively safer to consume. Therefore, their anti-inflammatory property can be exploited to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. This review thus focuses on the current knowledge on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 3 role of spices for the treatment of COVID-19 through suppression of inflammation-linked cytokine storm. ACE2 + cells. Altogether, their findings implied that SARS-CoV-2 might also utilize alternative pathways for entry [59] . Similar findings were also reported in another in vitro study which demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on both Cathepsin B/L (CatB/L) and TMPRSS2 for priming and entry into the host cell. Their study showed that inhibition of any one of these proteases leads to partial inhibition of viral entry. This suggested that in the absence of TMPRSS2, the virus may utilize CatB/L for its entry and vice-versa [66] . Following the entry, SARS-CoV-2 liberates its genomic material (mRNA) in the cytoplasm. It takes over the protein synthesis machinery in the host and translates the mRNA in the nucleus. Besides, it also utilizes the machinery to synthesize viral proteins and subsequently initiates viral replication [58] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f elevated IL-6 was observed in the deceased cases. Further, the cause of mortality in the deceased group was primarily due to respiratory failure (53%) [75] . A recent study was conducted to investigate the clinical features in deceased COVID-19 patients. The study showed that a majority of deceased patients were associated with comorbidities like hypertension and cardiac anomalies. Further, the majority presented with complications such as ARDS, respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, heart failure, etc. Moreover, the concentrations of the IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α were also found to be elevated [76] . A retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia demonstrated an increased expression of serum IL-6. Furthermore, a decrease in the CD3, CD4, Natural Killer (NK), and CD8 cells were also observed [71] . Cytokine profiling of the peripheral blood sample obtained from severe patients revealed an increase in the levels of the interleukins (IL) like IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Besides, it was also observed that the lymphocyte and T cell (especially CD8 + T) counts were substantially decreased while the neutrophil counts were increased [70] . Another study also showed increased levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, and TNF-α. Further, it reported similar trends for Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and Macrophage Inflammatory Protein (MIP)-1 Alpha [69] . Transcriptomic profiling of cytokines in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have revealed elevated levels of cytokines MCP-1, CXCL10, MIP-1A, and MIP-1B [77] . Increased CXCL10, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and TNF-α was also observed in severe COVID-19 patients [78] . The diabetic COVID-19 patients showed substantially increased leukocyte and neutrophil count. Further, the elevated level of IL-2 receptors, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α was also observed [79] . Altogether, the aforementioned findings indicated a pivotal role of cytokine storm in COVID -19 patients. Therefore, targeting the cytokine storm might help in attenuating the severity of disease progression. Inflammation is a vital cellular process or an immune response to injury, tissue damage, or infection in the body which assists in upholding the tissue homeostasis under traumatic or stressed conditions and regulate the host defense mechanism against pathogens [80] . The key molecular mediators of inflammation include inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α; chemokines; inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase (cox)-1, and -2; matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX); transcription factors such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB); ILs, for example, IL-1, -6, and -8. The most important mediator of inflammation is the ubiquitous expression of NF-κB transcription factor which play an essential role in the modulation of a wide array of genes encoding cell adhesion molecules, cytokines, and its receptors which helps in triggering inflammation [14] , [81] , [82] , [83] , [84] . NF-κB is a heterotrimer comprising of three subunits namely p65, p50, and an inhibitory subunit IκBα. It is mainly present in the cytoplasm, and upon activation by different inflammatory stimuli, various carcinogens, radiations such as UV-light, γ-rays, and x-rays; several free radicals, cytokines, etc. translocates into the nucleus. After translocation into the nucleus, the activated NF-κB can bind to different promoter regions of several genes and activate around 400 genes which play an important role in inflammation and various other chronic diseases [85] , [86] , [87] , [88] . NF-κB activation can regulate the various J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f hallmarks of cancer such as cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, migration, and metastasis. They also take part in instigating chemoresistance and radiation resistance. The expression of several inflammatory mediators, for instance, cox-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-α, and ILs are regulated through NF-ΚB [82] , [88] , [89] . TNF-α is the most potent pro-inflammatory cytokine discovered so far. Overexpression of this cytokine can ultimately lead to inflammation and various other chronic diseases, including cancer through the regulation of the NF-κB pathway [88] , [90] , [91] . Hence, the TNF-α blockers possess immense potential to control inflammation, and the overall global market for TNF-α blockers was valued at US$ 43.39 billion in 2017 and expected to reach US$ 181.13 billion by 2026 [81] , [90] , [92] . The macrophages mainly release a group of cytokines known as interleukins, for example, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 which play crucial roles in inducing an inflammatory response. It is now well evinced that the augmentation of expression of iNOS, cox-2, and abnormal expression of IL-1, -6 and -8 and TNF-α have been observed in case of oxidative stress that ultimately leads to inflammation [14] , [81] , [93] . IL-6 is an NF-κB-dependent cytokine that controls the activation of STAT3. STAT3, a transcriptional factor, is activated through Janus-activated kinase (JAK) 1, 2, and 3 which causes tyrosine phosphorylation, homodimerization, nuclear translocation of STAT3 where it binds to the DNA and is responsible for the induction of numerous inflammatory and immune responses. Moreover, several other transcription factors such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), activator protein-1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) are also regulated through various inflammatory cytokines which play a pivotal role in controlling the cellular stress responses [14] , [93] , [94] , [95] . The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can act as a molecular target for the prevention and treatment of different inflammatory diseases. The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f MAPK family consists of mainly three types of stress-activated protein kinase pathways viz. extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) can regulate the IL-5 level and other cytokines during inflammation [14] , [96] . The molecular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not completely known and studies are conducted globally to investigate novel drugs and targets. However, at present, there are no available drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19 specifically. Although, many studies are currently ongoing to develop and test antiviral drugs and vaccines against the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical and clinical settings; these vaccines or novel drugs might be unavailable until 2021 [45] . In the absence of novel antiviral drugs, "repurposed drugs" are often prescribed for the treatment of COVID-19 based on the symptoms [97] . Some of the repurposed drugs that are currently used or suggested against SARS-CoV-2 as well as COVID-19 associated cytokine storms and complications are mentioned in Table: 1.

Further, an open-label non-randomized clinical trial reported that HCQ caused a decline in the viral load in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, it was found that AZM further reinforced its effect but the mechanism by which the two drugs act is unknown [150] , [151] . WHO has discontinued the HCQ arm for its Solidarity Trial as it induced little or no decrease in mortality [152] . HCQ has been associated with cardiac abnormalities like QT prolongation and AZM might enhance the risk [151] . Favipiravir (T705) is an anti-influenza drug, manufactured by Toyama Chemical, Japan. It inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [117] . An open-label, non-randomized, control study reported that the treatment of infected patients with a combination of favipiravir and IFN-α checks the disease progression and results in faster viral clearance as compared to Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Favipiravir was administered orally for 14 days (1600mg twice on day 1 followed by 600mg, twice, daily for the remaining days) while IFN-α was administered via aerosol inhalation (5,000,000 U twice, daily) [116] . Lopinavir a protease inhibitor prescribed for the treatment of HIV. The oral bioavailability of lopinavir is considerably poor; therefore it is often prescribed in combination with ritonavir which boosts its exposure. It also inhibits the enzymes which metabolize lopinavir and further enhances its antiviral effect [97] . A recent in vitro study reported that lopinavir exhibits antiviral effects against HCoVs such as 229E, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV [153] . It is also reported to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [154] . WHO recently discontinued the Lopinavir/Ritonavir arm for its WHO-led Solidarity Trial conducted for the treatment of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 hospitalized patients. This was done as the drug exerted little or no decrease in mortality [152] . Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleoside analog of adenosine, manufactured by Gilead Sciences. It is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that inhibits the viral RNA-dependent polymerase and thus, interferes with viral replication [133] , [140] . It had been previously tested against the Ebola virus [155] . An in vitro study has also demonstrated its antiviral activity against viruses of the Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae as well as Filoviridae families [156] . Remdesivir also shows promising results against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in human airway epithelial cells [157] . Therefore, various studies are conducted to investigate its efficacy against the novel coronavirus infection in both preclinical and clinical settings. An in vitro study demonstrated that Remdesivir is efficacious against novel coronavirus infection [106] . The synergistic inhibitory effect of Remdesivir with emetine (a protein synthesis inhibitor) against SARS-CoV-2 is also observed in vitro [154] . Furthermore, Remdesivir also induced substantial clinical improvement, Ivermectin and niclosamide are potent anti-helminthic drugs [97] . A study demonstrated that ivermectin also shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [122] . Previously, Niclosamide had been shown effective against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola virus, rhinovirus, etc. Therefore, this broad-spectrum anti-helminthic drug might be quite promising in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 [129] . Glucocorticosteroids show anti-inflammatory effects and effectively inhibits the cytokine levels. Therefore, they might be used to combat the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that has shown promising results against COVID-19. A recent study investigated the short-term treatment with dexamethasone in SARS-CoV-2 patients with hypoxic respiratory failure. The study reported that dexamethasone was welltolerated and may help in attenuation of the hyper-inflammatory phase [113] . Methylprednisolone is an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drug [97] . It efficiently inhibits the inflammatory response. Further, methylprednisolone might also be associated with an improved outcome as well as lung function in COVID-19 patients [127] . Although these corticosteroids show effective results, their usage for the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia remains J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f controversial. As their continuous administration can suppress the immune system, it is necessary to determine the appropriate dose as well as the rationale for its usage [97] , [127] . The interleukin-6 inhibitors Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, and Siltuximab are hypothesized to be effective against COVID-19 patients. These IL-6 receptors antagonists are also tested against SARS-CoV-2 in both clinical and preclinical studies [97] , [135] . Early treatment with Tocilizumab reportedly improves the clinical outcome as well as causes a decline in mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia patients [161] . A recent study investigated the effectiveness of Tocilizumab for the treatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. It was observed that Tocilizumab was associated with a low death rate [162] . A study in severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients showed that treatment with Sarilumab exhibited promising results [163] . IL-1 promotes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and contributes significantly to cytokine storm. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, blocks both IL-1 α and IL-β. It is therefore believed to be highly effective in combating COVID-19 associated cytokine storm [164] . The Ana-COVID study has shown that it reduces SARS-CoV-2 associated hyper inflammation [100] . Baricitinib is a JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor [103] . A study showed that it improved the respiratory function in COVID-19 patients who failed to respond completely to sarilumab [165] . Further, Baricitinib reportedly decreases the SARS-CoV-2 viral load pneumonia as well as the COVID-19-associated mortality rate [103] Bromhexine hydrochloride is a mucolytic cough suppressant that also acts as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor. As TMPRSS2 is responsible for the SARS-CoV-2 entry in the host cell, bromhexine might be effective in inhibiting the virus [104] , [166] , [167] . Nafamostat mesylate inhibited MERS-CoV infection by acting as a TMPRSS2 inhibitor. A study reported that it also efficiently inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Further, it blocked the viral S protein-mediated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fusion [128] . Camostat mesylate (also known as camostat mesilate) is a serine protease inhibitor. In vitro studies have shown that camostat mesylate can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhibiting the TMPRSS2 activity. Therefore, camostat mesylate might prove promising in the treatment pf COVID-19 patients [66] , [105] . Several studies have shown that the administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin in diabetic COVID-19 patients is associated with a decrease in mortality [168] , [169] , [170] , [171] . A limited study has been conducted on Metformin in association with COVID-19 in vitro and therefore, the exact mechanism of action is unknown. However, a few possible mechanisms of action have been reported [125] , [126] . Darunavir is a potent HIV protease inhibitor [112] . Cobicistat is an effective booster that enhances the pharmacokinetics of the anti-retroviral drugs and is hence often co-administered with darunavir [172] . A pilot study (NCT04252274) showed that Darunavir/cobicistat in COVID-19 patients is well-tolerated. However, it did not show any significant improvement as compared to the control group [173] . The aforementioned findings aligned with another in vitro study which showed that Darunavir/cobicistat is ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [112] . Indomethacin, a cox inhibitor, has been reported to exhibit anti-viral effect activity against canine CoV (CCoV) as well as SARS-CoV. It inhibits viral RNA synthesis in vitro [120] . A recent study has shown that Indomethacin is also effective against the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro as well as CCoV in vivo [174] . Doxycycline, an antibacterial drug, reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. This anti-inflammatory property of Doxycycline might repress cytokine storm and prove essential in preventing lung damage associated with COVID-19. Further, a computational study revealed that Doxycycline might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease and thereby prevent the infection [115] , [175] . A retrospective study conducted on severe COVID-19 patients showed that the administration of thymosin-α1supplement substantially decreased the mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. Further, it also induced the reversion of exhausted T cells [137] . Ciclesonide, an inhaled steroid, effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. It inhibits the infection by interacting with the viral non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) [176] . A study reported three cases where ciclesonide, an inhaled steroid, attenuated COVID-19 associated pneumonia [108] . Imatinib is an Abelson (Abl) kinase inhibitor and a potent anti-cancer drug. It also modulates immune response and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Further, it also exhibits anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Therefore, it is believed that Imatinib might also be effective against SARS-CoV-2 and have an immunomodulatory effect against COVID-19 pneumonia [119] , [177] . Lactoferrin exerts immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it has been proposed lactoferrin might be used with other drugs as an adjunct to treat COVID-19 [123] . Povidone-Iodine also exhibits potent virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 [132] . The drug Tacrolimus (FK506) has been previously tested effective in inhibiting the replication of HCoVs such as SARS-CoV, NL63, and 229E. Therefore, it is proposed that it might be inhibitory against SARS-CoV-2 [136] . Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic drug which is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further, this drug inhibits IL-1β as well as IL-4 and thus exerts an anti-inflammatory effect, which might be effective in combating cytokine storm [131] . It also modulates the angiotensin II type 1 receptor/p38 MAPK/reninangiotensin system (AT1R/p38 MAPK/RAS axis) [178] . Therefore, it has been hypothesized that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Pirfenidone might be useful in combating COVID-19 associated cytokine storm as well as lung fibrosis [131] . Sirolimus (rapamycin) is a commonly used immunosuppressant. It exerts inhibition on the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. [97] , [125] A study showed that sirolimus inhibits MERS-CoV infection effectively [179] . A Phase II clinical study is initiated to investigate if sirolimus is associated with the improvement of outcomes in COVID-19 patients placebo (NCT04341675) [180] Atorvastatin treatment was also reported to be related to a reduction in the progress to death in COVID-19 patients [102] . Another study showed that the administration of Chloroquine and Clarithromycin in a COVID-19 patient with pneumonia improved the outcome [110] . The ACCORD study (EudraCT 2020-001736-95) is initiated to investigate the efficacy of drugs such as Bemcentinib, MEDI3506, Acalabrutinib, Zilucoplan, and Nebulised heparin in COVID-19 patients [98] . A study hypothesized that blocking the AT1R might be beneficial to COVID-19 patients. Losartan and Telmisartan effectively blocks the AT1R and might be useful against SARS-CoV-2 [124] . Sacubitril/valsartan is an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor [181] . Further, it has antiinflammatory activity and hence decreases the pro-inflammatory cytokines. It has been suggested that Sacubitril/valsartan can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients [134] . An in silico study shows that Disulfiram inhibits the 3CLpro enzyme. This property of disulfiram may be further tested in clinical and preclinical studies for further validation [114] . Molecular docking and simulation study also revealed that α-ketoamides, Ciprofloxacin, and Moxifloxacin bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) in silico which might be effective in inhibiting the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2 infection [109] , [138] . The drugs Setrobuvir and Cefuroxime effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in silico and hence can be used for treatment against the virus [107] . Similar findings were observed for Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir [119] . Another in silico study reported that Rivaroxaban, Saquinavir, Tadalafil, Sildenafil, Dasatinib inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease. Further, it showed that Ergotamine, Amphotericin B, Vancomycin blocks interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein with the ACE2 receptor in silico [99] . IFN-β and IFN-γ exert synergistic inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication [121] . Nitazoxanide is reported to inhibit inflammation. Apart from this, it also exerts antiviral activity against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus in vitro [130] . Daclatasvir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting the viral replication. Further, it also prevented the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [111] . Various studies have also suggested that compounds derived from natural products can also be effective in treatment against COVID-19. A recent molecular docking study evaluated the binding potential of various phytochemicals to the non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) which is associated with viral replication. The study reported that ajmalicine, alpha terpinyl acetate, curcumin, gingerol, novobiocin, piperine, rosmarinic acid, silymarin, and aranotin, sarsasapogenin, and ursonic acid exhibited binding with the Nsp15 protein. Therefore, these phytochemicals might effectively inhibit viral replication and their efficacy should be evaluated in pre-clinical as well as clinical studies [182] . Another study conducted molecular docking simulations between functional foods and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It reported that quercetrin exhibited inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in silico [183] . Curcumin also demonstrated a high binding free energy for the enzymes Cat K, COVID-19 Mpro, and SARS-CoV 3 C-like protease [184] . The natural compounds such as andrographolide, berberine, curcumin, mangiferin, nimbin, piperine, thebaine, and withaferin A exhibited a binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Further, the compounds gallic acid, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin, resveratrol, and zingiberene showed an affinity to only the ACE2 receptor. These compounds might inhibit the attachment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to the host cell [185] . (Figure: 3)  Mother Nature has bestowed us with various promising medicinal plants as well as plant-based products such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices that are abundantly consumed [186] , [187] , [188] , [189] , [190] , [191] , [192] , [193] , [194] . Apart from their high nutritional value, these are also rich in therapeutic properties [189] , [193] , [195] , [196] , [197] , [198] , [199] , [200] . Various phytochemical and natural compounds obtained from different parts of plants have been a part of traditional medicine for ages and consumed for their health benefits as well as efficacy against a plethora of diseases [201] , [202] , [203] , [204] , [205] , [206] , [2017, [208] , [209] , [210] , [211] , [212] , [213] , [214] , [215] . The leaves of the plants which are utilized for culinary purposes and consumed fresh are known as herbs. Spices, on the other hand, are consumed as dried parts of a plant. It can be a bud, root, seed, bark, berries, or even stigma of a flower [14] , [186] , [216] . In addition to their usage in culinary purposes for imparting flavor and taste to food, they are also beneficial to health. Spices and herbs, as well as their active components, have been used in various traditional medicines since time immemorial.

An important component of the essential oil is aromatic-turmerone (ATM) which is reported to have strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and thus proved to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis. It significantly inhibited the expressions of NF-κB, cox-2, p-p38 MAPK, TNF-α, and IL-6. ATM further suppressed the mRNA synthesis of IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 [342] . Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory activity of a modified pectin polysaccharide from turmeric (MTrPP) contributed to its anti-ulcer activity and thus it aided in the treatment of LPSinduced ulcer in a rat model. MTrPP worked through inhibiting the release of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-8, NF-κB, MMP-9, and cox-1, -2. It also prevented the phosphorylation of p38 thus imparting protective effects [343] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Likewise, in the case of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, administration of the same dose of cardamom for 10 weeks regulated the serum levels of triglycerides, insulin, SIRT1 besides improving the glycemic indices [412] , [413] . Moreover, the efficacy of this spice was also evaluated against NAFLD where it was found that treatment with 3 g of supplement for 3 months significantly improved the grade of fatty liver in overweight or obese individuals. It further improved the clinical symptoms of the disease by modulating the levels of glucose indices, lipids, and other biomarkers of the disease. Moreover, the administration of cardamom supplement did not show any side effects and thus it was found safe to use [414] . β-caryophyllene, one of the active compounds of cinnamon, was found to be effective against gastrointestinal disease caused due to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study has reported that administration of 126 mg βcaryophyllene daily for 8 weeks showed significant anti-inflammatory properties via downregulating the level of IL-1β. It further improved conditions of nausea, epigastric pain, and dyspepsia associated with the disease thereby proving that it can stand as a potential therapy against gastrointestinal ailments [415] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f A study evaluating the potency of essential oil from coriander has evidenced that topical administration of a lipolotion (containing 0.5% coriander oil) during UV exposure reduced the risk of UV induced erythema to some extent. The treatment was found to show minimal antiinflammatory activity and well-tolerated when applied on the skin of healthy volunteers [416] . Clinical trials investigating the potency of garlic extracts and its supplements against different diseases have reported that the spice showed significant anti-inflammatory and other beneficial properties. Supplementation of 3.6 g aged garlic extracts (AGE) daily was found to diminish the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in obese adults, thus lessening the risk of occurrence of multiple inflammatory chronic diseases associated with obesity [417] . Garlic extract supplementation also relieved pain and other clinical symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis. Administration of 1 g of the supplement for 12 weeks significantly reduced the level of resistin, an inflammatory cytokine, thus displaying anti-inflammatory effects [418] . Ginger powder supplementation was found to be effective against both RA and osteoarthritis as evidenced by several clinical studies. In the case of RA patients, on receiving 1. properties [421] . Furthermore, a pilot clinical study on the subjects at an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) has shown that ginger extract was found to be well tolerated by the subjects and did not show any adverse side effects. It regulated the levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) but did not show any change in the levels of eicosanoid. Thus further studies are essential to investigate the exact mechanism behind the chemopreventive effects of this spice [422] . Ginsenosides, the saponins extracted from ginseng, are found effective against many diseases. A clinical study investigating the potency of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) against RA, which displayed that the saponins, when administered for 28 days, led to significant improvement in clinical symptoms of the disease in terms of joint pain, swelling, tenderness, and stiffness. It also managed the dysregulated immune response and displayed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects [423] . Further, the efficiency of ginsenosides therapy (in the form of shen-fu injection) was also evaluated against gastrointestinal mucosal injury which is associated with cardiopulmonary bypass in children suffering from congenital heart disease (CHD). It was found that administration of the intravenous injection before and during the bypass surgery resulted in a reduction of characteristic injury and inflammation post-surgery in patients [424] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f The anti-inflammatory property of saffron is evaluated by many studies and thus it was thought to have protective effects against allergies such as asthma. Asthmatic patients, on receiving 100 mg/day saffron capsules for 8 weeks, showed improvement in clinical symptoms of the disease such as frequency of asthmatic attacks, usage of salbutamol inhaler, waking up at night due to asthmatic symptoms, and limitation in the activity. The severity of the disease declined, and the supplement was well tolerated by the patients without any adverse side-effects [425] . Crocin, an active component of saffron, was found to be an effective therapy against multiple sclerosis due to its efficient anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. It was found that the administration of two capsules of crocin (15mg) for 28 days showed an improvement in the antioxidant status of the body. Additionally, a reduction in inflammatory mediators such as TNFα and IL-17 in the blood of the patients was also found [426] . Sesame seed therapy was found to improve the factors of inflammation and oxidation in patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. Consumption of 40 g of sesame seed daily for 2 months resulted in a decrease in the level of IL-6 in the serum of patients, thus proving that it can serve as a potential supplementary therapy in patients with osteoarthritis [427] . A handful of clinical studies have been performed to examine the potency of turmeric against various diseases. Curcumin and curcuminoids, the active components of turmeric, are found as effective therapies over the years. These are found to be very helpful in managing metabolic syndrome and disorders. For instance, a classic combination of curcuminoid-piperine in the ratio of 100:1 was administered daily for 8 weeks to patients with metabolic syndrome. It was found to regulate the levels of CRP, MDA, SOD in patients thus imparting significant anti-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects [428] . In the case of patients with obesity/hypertension, the hot water extract of C. longa L. (WEC) was found to reduce the levels of CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), thereby amending chronic lowgrade inflammation and overall health of patients [429] . Furthermore, in T2D patients, the uptake of curcuminoid-piperine has shown a decline in the level of TNF-α and an inclined level of adiponectin. Furthermore, another study evaluating the effects of curcumin against T2D showed that the compound modulated the levels of hs-CRP and TG thereby imparting significant antiinflammatory activity [430] , [431] . The compounds are further found effective against osteoarthritis and RA. In the case of osteoarthritis, Curcuma longa L. (CL) extract showed significant anti-inflammatory effects via the down-regulation of IL-1β and anti-oxidant effects via the down-regulation of MDA and ROS. Thus, the administration of the extract was found to improve clinical symptoms of the disease such as pain and inflammation [432] . Another clinical study showed that the administration of a combination of H. procumbens, C. longa, and bromelain in the form of AINAT capsules showed similar improvements in terms of pain in osteoarthritis patients. Further, the capsules were well tolerated and thus can be used as a safe and effective replacement for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [433] . Besides, the intake of 0.5-1 g of curcumin formulation daily 90 days in two different treatment groups has shown significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects in patients suffering from RA. The treatment caused improvements in the levels of CRP and rheumatoid factor (RF) values without causing any adverse side effects [434] . A clinical study evaluating the effects of a combination of turmeric extract and Boswellia serrata as a treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has reported that the supplement is well tolerated by the patients and is safe to use. The treatment efficiently enhanced the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inflammatory status of the patients via the downregulation of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 [435] . Moreover, regular intake of curcumin was found to impart anti-inflammatory effects in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The supplement helped in reducing the levels of hs-CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α in plasma without causing any side-effects [436] . Curcuminoids were also found to relieve chronic inflammation in patients suffering from chronic pulmonary complications (CPC) resulting from sulfur mustard (SM) intoxication. Treatment with curcuminoids supplement helped in modulating inflammatory responses via reducing the levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β, hs-CRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P, and MCP-1. The supplements were also well tolerated and did not cause any adverse side effects in the patients [437] . Also, in the case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a curcumin supplement namely Theracurmin(®) was found to significantly amend the inflammatory status and levels of α1-antitrypsin-low-density lipoprotein (AT-LDL) in the blood of patients when taken for 24 weeks. This change might be useful in reducing the risk of any further cardiovascular events in COPD patients [438] . Furthermore, a nano-curcumin formulation in combination with omega-3 fatty acids was found to show neuroprotective effects against migraines. The therapy significantly reduced the levels of cox-2/iNOS which is associated with neuroinflammation and pain of the CNS. Hence, a decline in the rate and duration of repeated painful attacks and the severity of the disease was observed, making this a safe and useful therapy for the treatment and prevention of migraine [439] . Curcumin is a multipotential compound from C. longa that possesses diverse medicinal properties. It is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that is effective against numerous chronic diseases [14] , [440] , [441] , [442] , [443] . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Elevated cytokine levels or cytokine storm is considered as one of the critical process responsible for multi-organ failure and death in COVID-19 infected patients [444] , [445] , [446] . TNF-α also plays a pivotal role in pulmonary edema caused during COVID-19-associated lung diseases. Natural compounds like curcumin downregulate the levels of TNF-α [447] . Moreover, the coronavirus is also associated with the symptoms of pneumonia that causes severe respiratory distress. The treatment of the pneumonia model with curcumin was shown to decrease lung injury and inflammation through the modulation of HIF and NF-κB [448] . The treatment of curcumin in viral infected models has exhibited inhibition of cytokines, MMPs, and inflammatory cells. It also inhibited the fibrosis and expression of myofibroblasts in the lung tissues [449] . A study demonstrated the potency of a novel combination of vitamin C, curcumin and glycyrrhizic acid (VCG) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. System biology tools also found that VCG modulated various genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses via the regulation of crucial pathways such as NOD-like, Toll-like, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways [450] . TMPRSS2 is a crucial protease involved in the priming of ACE2 receptor-bound viral S protein and thus acts a therapeutic target for COVID-19 therapy [451] . study reported that curcumin showed high-affinity binding towards the viral spike glycoprotein and ACE2 receptor [185] . Another study demonstrated its binding affinity towards the viral Nsp15 protein which is associated with replication. Therefore, curcumin might cause the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inhibition of the viral replication by binding with Nsp15 [182] . Curcumin has also been reported as a potential inhibitor of  The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great threat to healthcare across the globe. The causative pathogen is a novel coronavirus and there are currently no specific treatment strategies against it. Although several studies are going on to develop a specific drug targeted towards SARS-CoV-2, it might take some more time. Several vaccine development trials are also underway, but the end products will require some time to clear the safety studies. Moreover, a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 had been reported for the first time on 14 th December 2020 in the United Kingdom (UK). This variant of concern (VOC) had been labelled as the VOC 202012/01 and had been detected in over 50 countries in the UK. Other variants such as 501Y.V2 and B.1.1.28 were also reported from South Africa (18 th December 2020) and Japan (9 th January 2021), respectively. Therefore, considering the rapid evolution of this virus and urgency of the situation, one of the best options for management and treatment is repurposed drugs. These drugs are already J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f approved for the treatment of some diseases in humans and are thus readily available in the market. In the paucity of SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs, these repurposed drugs with anti-viral or inhibitory effects are prescribed to hospitalized patients [4] , [97] . Cytokine storm or hyper inflammation is commonly observed in severe COVID-19 patients. It is associated with the progression of the disease and poor clinical outcome [482] . Respiratory failure, ARDS, and pneumonia are some of the most common and fatal COVID-19 associated complications. Therefore, some repurposed drugs are known to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects and are thus used to combat COVID-19-associated inflammatory complications [76] , [97] . Some of these repurposed drugs show very promising results. However, most of them raise serious concerns as they are reported to have adverse side-effects [97] . Therefore, it is necessary to look for alternative medicines that may be effective against the novel virus and associated health complications which cause little or no side effects. Mother Nature has provided us with several natural compounds that have been used throughout the ages for the treatment of various diseases like cancer, asthma, diabetes, respiratory and cardiovascular disorder, etc. Spices are nature"s most potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents. Besides enhancing the taste, flavor, aroma, and color of food and beverages but also imparts protection against various health ailments. These therapeutic properties of spices and culinary herbs are due to the presence of various bioactive components with significant biological activities. Besides, the consumption of spices has been proven to reduce inflammation and boost our immune response [14] . Therefore, in the absence of a drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, spices might serve as an alternative treatment for infected patients. It can serve a dual purpose of both as a means of primary prevention, as well as help mitigate the exaggerated J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f
