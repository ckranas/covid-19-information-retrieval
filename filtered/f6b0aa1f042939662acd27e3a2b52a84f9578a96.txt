Contact was sought to obtain additional data not available online, to improve the quality of data extraction, or to increase the number of outcomes from the primary study included in our review (which involved requesting frequency data to recalculate odds ratios). The requests to national statistical organisations proved successful, and pre-2000 data was provided in scanned (or digitised form). However, other data requests querying outcomes or requesting frequency data were generally unsuccessful (only one of the four authors replied).

Therefore, this item has been removed from the scale. The denominator value for the maximum number of stars a study can be awarded has been reduced from 9 to 8 due to the removal of the original question 4.

All years included in ONS 1 , with birthweight reported in 500 g increments from < 1,500 g to > 4,000 g enabling VLBW, LBW, birthweight < 3,000 g and macrosomia to be calculated. 15 and Niedhamnmer et al. 13 . The educational categories are the same in both, however those in Niedhammer et al. 13 have a larger sample size for education (n=913) compared to Niedhammer et al. 13 (n=676). HRs are used in Niedhammer et al. 13 compared to ORs used in Niedhammer et al. 15 . Decision: As the sample size for PTB by education is larger in Niedhammer et al. 13 compared to Niedhammer et al. 15 , the ORs reported in Niedhammer et al. 15 will be excluded. 5. Newcastle-Ottawa score for question 4 refers to univariate analysis reported in publication (or where ORs were calculated subsequently from frequencies). Study reports multivariate analysis (with or without smoking and additional confounding variable(s)) but not for socioeconomic exposure of interest, therefore study given 0 stars for this question. BMJ Publishing Group Limited (BMJ) disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance  Due to the changing labour market over the past 30 years for which we have collated data, occupation/social class classifications have changed in England, Wales and Scotland. To help synthesise the data, we collapsed the occupational groups which were reported to a three-class system in the UK, and a five-class system in the Republic of Ireland. For the Irish data, SEG-A (which encompassed higher and lower professionals) was used as the comparison group, intermediate occupations were SEG-B and SEG-C and all other groups were labelled 'manual occupations and other'. For the most recent data in England and Wales, and for the ROI, we used standardised published systems to aggregate the data. However, for the Registrar General's social class system which was in operation in England and Wales until 2001 and Scotland until 2000, we devised our own. Registrar General's social class The Registrar General social class classification was split into three classes, to attempt to align occupations in the 1990s/early 2000s to the Standard Occupational Classifications (used post 2001) which was routinely split into three classes. 1 Professional and managerial (used as the 'comparison group' in the meta-analysis) II Skilled occupations (non-manual) Intermediate occupations (used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) IIIM Skilled occupations (manual) IV Partly skilled occupations Partly skilled/unskilled (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the metaanalysis) V Eight classes Three classes 1. Higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations 1.1 Large employers and higher managerial and administrative occupations 1.2 Higher professional occupations 2. Lower managerial, administrative and professional occupations 1. Higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations (used as the 'comparison group' in the meta-analysis) 3. Intermediate occupations 2. Intermediate occupations (used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) 4. Small employers and own account workers 5. Large supervisory and technical occupations 6. Semi-routine occupations 3. Routine and manual occupations (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Farmers (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Higher professionals SEG-A (used as the 'comparison group' in the metaanalysis) Lower professionals Employers and managers SEG-B (termed 'intermediate' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Salaried employers Non-manual wage earners / Intermediate non-manual workers SEG-C (termed 'intermediate' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Other non-manual workers Skilled manual workers Semi-skilled manual workers SEG-D (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Unskilled manual workers Farm labourers Unknown Unknown (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) Unemployed (termed 'manual occupations and other' and used as the 'exposed group' in the meta-analysis) References: OR=odds ratio, AOR=adjusted odds ratio, CI=confidence interval, *=significant association, SEG-A=Higher professionals/ lower professionals, SEG-B=Employers and managers/ salaried employers, SEG-C= Non-manual wage earners (or intermediate non-manual workers)/ other non-manual workers and skilled manual workers, SEG-D=Semi-skilled manual workers/ unskilled manual workers and farm labourers.

Adjusted for age, parity, BMI, ethnicity, migration history, health behaviours (smoking in pregnancy, alcohol in pregnancy), psycho-social factors (not married, more deprived Index of Multiple Deprivation, less education, at risk for distress, at risk of hopelessness, not managing financially, behind with bills) and medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension). 7.
