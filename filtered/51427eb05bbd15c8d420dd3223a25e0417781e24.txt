However, the average CCD in trial 2 (modified OHCC) was significantly greater in all segments than that in trial 1 (segments 1-4: P= 0.016; P= 0.009; P= 0.004 ; P = 0.001) By modifying the OHCCposture, a deeper mean CCDcould bemaintained for 2 min than that on using conventional OHCC. The average chest compression rates were comparable in all segments in both trials. The ratio of complete recoil in all the segments was not significantly different between Study Limitations; Adverse Events the trials. These results mean that the posture modification did not increase leaning. The average compressions did not reach CC depth as recommended by guidelines (the manikin's A-Pdiameter was approximately 15 cm) . The results were obtained using a mechanical simulation model setting with a specially manufactured plywood bed (not a mattress). This setting differs from a real-life resuscitation environment.

The mean compression depth for two-hand was 38.7 mm (37.1-40.2) , which was higher than for left one-hand (36.3 mm [34.8-37.9 ]) or right one-hand (35.4 mm [33.9-37 .0]) (p < 0.001). Chest compression depth declined over time, regardlessofthetechnique (p<0.001) . The two-handtechnique hadthe advantage of producing deeper compressions than the one-hand technique. The rate of admission to the hospital was 40.5% in HCOT vs 25.5% in the TOT (P = 0.088). The pattern of compression depth change over time was similar for all techniques (p > 0.999) . The residual leaning rate was higher with two-hand (40.7 [27.9-53.5] ) than that for left one-hand (29.2 [16.4-42.0 ]) or right one-hand (25.8 [13.0-38.6] ) (p= 0.021).

This was also found for those weighing less than 50 kg and at least 50 kg in both groups (FM 23%, HM 34%, P=0.2; FM 62%, HM 56%, P=0.57) . The FM of applying chest compression did not result in a more accurately delivered compression depth compared with the HM for children and adolescents, irrespective of body weight. The HM group was better in frequency (98 vs. 86% in FM, P=0.03) and complete decompression (99 vs. 91% in FM, P≤0.001 30-60s: 42.8 ±8.7 vs 40.3 ±8.8 mm, 60-90 s: 40.5 ±8.9 vs 38.2 ±9.6 mm, 90-120 s: 40.2 ±10.2 vs 36.9 ±9.7 mm; P< 0.01 The compression and ventilation rate in lateral CPR were lower than in OTH CPR. Around 51% of participants had correct chestcompression rate (> 90 beats per minute) in the lateral CPR position and 65% of them had ten or more correct ventilations per minute.

Randomized Using the TT method, the rescuers performed CPR with higher CC quality, but more incomplete recoil than they did using the TF method. The mean compression forces delivered in the first and second minutes were 3.53 ±1.27 kg and 3.22 ±1.11 kg(P= 0.012) for TFand 4.11 ±1.80 kg and 4.04 ±1.83 kg(P= 0.568) for TT, respectively. Pairwise comparison indicates that the compression force delivered through the TF method during the first and second minute of ECC were inferior tothat delivered through the TT method.TheTF method involved greater perceived exertionthantheTT method (5.27 ±4.69 vs. 4.02 ±2.31; P= 0.007) . The median perceived exertions for the TF and TT methods were 5 and 4, respectively. For infant CPR, the TT method involved greater loading force, lower fatigue, and higher overall ECC quality than the TF method. The optimal compression force is about 3.8-4.3  Manikin study, which may not be applicable to real clinical settings (thorax characteristics, rescuer stressetc) . CPR without ventilations.

Link between compression force and other quality indicators in itself unclear. This research sought to establish the efficacy and training of two-finger versus two-thumb-encircling techniques. Randomized cross-over The two-thumb-encircling technique achieved a deeper mean compression depth over the 8 min period (2.0mm, p<0.01) , closer to the minimum recommendation of 40 mm; the two-finger technique achieved higher percentages ofcompression fraction andcomplete recoil. Caregivers preferred the two-thumb technique (64%), and of these 70% had long fingernails.

Small group and potential bias of prior practice. comparing the two-thumb encircling (TTE) The VTT generated significantly higher pressure than the TTEand the pressure difference ranged from 26.8 to 62.9 mmHg for each cycle, with a mean difference of 43.5 mmHg (95% CI [37.8, 49.2] ). The difference in pressureshowed a tendency to increase with increasing cycles of cardiac compressions. The participants' heart and respiratory rate was higher with the VTT, but they said that itwas easier to perform cardiac compressions with this technique. The VTT technique can provide an alternative compression technique for effective infant CPR, especially for the rescuerswith small hands or aweak grip.

Participants were doctors and likely very motivated and thus maybe not representative for a normal population. In addition, a Hawthorne effect might bias the results found. The compression was instructed to target one-third of the chest anteriorposterior diameter atminimum, butthesensorinsidethesimulatorwasdesignedto measure the pressure within the simulated heart. Therefore, the results cannot be directly compared with those of other studies, which have mostly used metric figures for cardiac compression depth. Only the peak pressure was measured in this study, no other quality items. This study measured the pressure generated by cardiac compressions for up to ten cycles, but outcomes after ten cycles were not assessed. comparing the over-the head 2 In addition, subjects reported that compression, ventilation, and changing compression to ventilation were easier in OTTT than in TFT.

Each technique involved a different method of ventilation, which may influence hands-off time. There was a skewed sex ratio and a higher proportion of young participants of the sample. Approximately 60% of participants were women in their early 20s. comparing TTHT (encircling) vs. 13% (IQR: [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] ; p< 0.001), more correct positioning of the hands on the chest (98% (IQR: 98-100) vs. 95% ; p= 0.045) and less time without chest compressions vs. ; p= 0.038).

In addition, a Hawthorne effect might bias the results found. comparing TTHT (encircling) When global CC quality, depth and rate of compression were compared, no significant differences were found. Results show good percentage of chest compression quality regardless the technique used (TTEHT: 80.1±25.4%; nTTT: 84.21±23.7%, p= 0.242) . Chest compression rate was between 100-120 compressions/min in both methods (TTEHT: 108±17 com/min; nTTT: 108±14 com/min, p = 0.632) . As regards depth, similar results were found (TTEHT: 36.0±5.3mm; nTTT: 37.32±3.8mm, p = 0.052) . Therefore, this method seems to be at least as efficient as current standards and may be a complementary to the TTEHT in the future.

The quality of chest compressions with the new method (thumbs with closed fists) is similar to that afforded by the traditional method.

The number of total chestcompressions of the two-thumb technique was significantly lower than in the two-finger technique and flexed twofinger technique (150 [148-159] vs. 159 vs. 162 The palm presser resulted in greater compression depth in the Palm presser vs. 39 .0 mm in the TFT, p<0.001) and no increase in hands-off time (p=0.632 30-60 s: 42.4 ± 4.9 mm, 60-90 s: 40.5 ± 5.8 mm, and 90-120 s: 38.7 ± 5.7 mm; P < 0.001) . Mean compression rate also tended to decrease with time (0-30s: 119. 3 ± 12.5/min, 30-60 s: 119.0 ±13.1/min, 60-90 s: 117.9 ±14.5/min, 90-120 s: 117.8 ± 14.9/min) , and the differences were statistically significant between 30-60 s and 60-90 s(P= 0.037) and between 30-60 sand 90-120 s(P= 0.043) .

Lim 2013 139 To compare the efficiency between overlapping (OP) and adjacent thumb positions (AP) for cardiac compressions using the encircling method in infants. Randomized In the 84 infants enrolled, the width of the sternum at Sap, and the vertical heart length from Sap were 0.85±0. 31 and 1.71±0.47cm, respectively . The length and width ofthe superimposed-thumb technique were 1.65±0. 13 and 2.73±0.22cm, respectively. The length and width of the alongside-thumb technique were 3.00±0. 48 and 3.77±0.24cm,respectively. Atotalof163patients were enrolled,medianage8.8year (4.2-14.3yr) .Amongage groups, no significant difference was observed in y_max. left ventricle, relative y_max. left ventricle, y_aorta, and y_liver_dome: 1.0 cm (0.1-1.9 cm), 0.10 unit of sternal top (0.01-0.18 unit of sternal top), 0.39 unit of sternal top (0.30-0.47 unit of sternal top) , and -0.14 unit of sternal top (-0.25 to -0.03 being under the points of compressions application. A manikin study looked at fatigue levels with the 2-thumb technique, comparing side-by-side or superimposed thumb position207 demonstrated that the superimposedthumbtechnique generated higher simulated blood pressure and pulse pressure but had a higher fatigue-rating score. Physiologic indices of fatigue showed no difference between groups. CT scansofthechest tocomparethumb(side-by-side)/fingers measurementsplacedonmanikinswereconducted to determine which method avoided compressing otherstructures when using the lower third of the sternum.208 Both methods compress other structures, but the 2-thumb method (side-by-side) performs better than the two finger method. The accuracy of using the nipple line to the xiphisternum landmarks for 2-finger chest compression was examined by Clements.209 They concluded that this method could result in abdomen and xiphisternum compression in all infants and suggested an alternate method of determining position.

AED use was more common with the provision of bystander CPR (19.1%) 21.1%, 26.3%) for no bystander AED use (p=0.11) . There was a significant interaction with age and race / ethnicity. AEDs were associated with neurologically favorable survival among children aged 12-18 years (p=0.04) The average age at diagnosis was . During follow-up, 3 of 291 children (1%) had a cardiac arrest with anappropriate AED rescue (2/51 symptomatic, 1/240 asymptomatic) . Thefirst AED rescue occurredduring exercise in asymptomatic 3-year-old boy with compound LQT1 treated with beta-blocker and videoscopic left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD).The second AED rescue occurred in a remotely symptomatic 14-yearoldboy withhigh-riskLQT2(QTc 4550ms)on a beta-blocker who previously declined aprophylactic ICD.The third AED rescue involved an asymptomatic 17-year-old girl with LQT3 on mexiletine who collapsed in school. An AED should seldom be necessary in an appropriately treated child with LQTS. Nevertheless,despite only3 AED rescues in more than 1700 patient-years, an AED can be a life saving and cost-effective part of an LQTS patient's comprehensive sudden death prevention program. The effect of asubsequent treated shockable rhythm during cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the outcome of children who suffer out-ofhospital cardiac arrest with initial nonshockable rhythm is unclear. Retrospective studyAll-JapanUtsteinRegistry,n=12402 1.42-5.36; all P<0.001 ). In the subsequent treated shockable rhythm (YES) cohort, the rate of 1-month cerebral performance category 1 to 2 decreased significantly as time to shock delivery increased (17.7% [3 of 17] for patients with shock-delivery time 0-9 minutes, 7.3% [8 of 109] for 10-19 minutes, and 0% [0 of 109] for 20-59 minutes; P<0.001 [for trend]) .

The median age for the group with subsequent treated shockable was 12y . In childrenyounger than1year(n=5154) only 26hadasubsequentshockablerhythm. In children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and initial non-shockable rhythms, subsequent treated shockable rhythm was associated with improved 1-month survival with favourable neurological outcomes. In the cohort of older children (7-17 years) , these outcomes worsened as time to shock delivery increased. There was no info about how many of these AED were applied by bystanders and how many by paramedics. Despitebeingfrom asingle country and thus prone to be relatedtothe localreality,the sample is solarge that in itself the study puts in a lot of weight. The study might further be influenced by selection bias. Data from before 2015. Prospective When compared to adults, younger children were less likely to be found in a shockable rhythm (young children 11.6%, adults 23.7%) and were less likely to have an AED used (young children 16.3%, adults 28.3%) . Older children had asimilar prevalence of shockable rhythms as adults (31.8%) and AED use (20.5%) . A multivariable analysis demonstrated that, when compared to adults, younger children had decreased odds of having an AED used (OR 0.42, , but there was no difference in AEDuse among older children and adults. Young children suffering from presumed out-of-hospital cardiac arrestsare less likely to have a shockable rhythm when compared to adults and are less likely to have an AED used during resuscitation. Secondary analysis of prospectively collected data (CARES registry (see also 5); n=481 Patients were included if they were older than 1 year of age and had a documented resuscitation attempt from October 1, 2005 through December 31, 2009 The overall survival was , and neurologically intact survival was . Acrossall age strata, asystole was the most common initial rhythm. Sixty-six patients had ashockable rhythm with increasing percentages of shockable rhythms at older ages (<30 days: 3.2% (n=2); 30 days-1 year old: 3.4% (n=7); 1-5 years old:10.1% (n=7); 5-12 years old: 22.1% (n=13); 12-18 years old: 31.8% (n=27) , p<0.05). Overall AED use for the sample was 70/481; while the provision of bystander CPR was 160/481; 72.9% received an attempted resuscitation. The overall incidence of EMS-attended and EMS treated events was 6.7 and 4.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, with no significant changes in trend. Although the proportion of cases with OHCA identified in the call and receiving bystander CPR increased over time, EMS response times also increased. Unadjusted event survival rose from 23.3% in 2000 to 33.3% in 2016 (p trend=0.007) , and survival to hospital discharge rose from 9.4% to 17.7% over the same period (p trend=0.04). Increases in survivalto hospital discharge were largely driven by initial shockable arrests, which rose from 33.3% in 2000 to 60.0% in 2016 (ptrend=0.005) . Survival after initial shockable arrests was higher if the first shock was delivered by either first responder or public AED compared with paramedics (83.3% vs. 40.0%, p=0.04) . After adjustment, the odds of event survival and survival to hospital discharge increased independent ofbaselinecharacteristics,by 7%(OR1.07, 95%CI:1.03, 1.11; p=0.001)and 8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.15; p=0.02)  The overall pre-EMS AED application rate in pediatric patients remains low, and more likely in older children, witnessed arrest, public location and of presumed cardiac origin.

The collapse to AED time tended to become shorter only in non-family member-witnessed arrests, from 11.1 min in 2005 to 8.3 min in 2009 (P = 0.07) . The overall response times (minutes) were: collapse to CPR (4.9±6.5 in 2005 to 5.3±6.1 in 2009) ; collapse to AED (11.8±4.8; 10.3±8.4) ; collapse to EMS (42.1±17.2; 37±20.7) . The collapse to defibrillation time was shorter in bystander-initiated defibrillation when compared with defibrillation by emergency responders (3.3 ± 3.7 vs. 12.9 ± 5.8 min, P< 0.001) , and was independently associated with a favourable neurological outcome after OHCA [multivariable analysis P 0.03, . A non-family member's witness was independently associated with VF as the initial rhythm [P < 0.001, ]. In multivariable analysis, the collapse to AED time was the only variable independently associated with the survival at 1 month [P = 0.045, 0.92 (0.85-0.99) ] and pre-hospital ROSC [P = 0.001, 0.82 (0.73-0.92) ]. Implementation of PAD improved the outcome after OHCA in school-age children at national level in Japan This is the first population-based prospective study, which specifically addressed the impact of public access defibrillation on the outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) in elementary and middle school children (7-15 years 21 (45.7%) were at high schools, a minority (16, 34.0%) were children (<age 19) , most (39, 83 .0%) were witnessed arrests, amajority (36, 76.6%) received bystander CPR, and 27(57.4%) were initially inventricular fibrillation (VF). Most arrests (28/40, 70%) For the critical outcome of cardiac arrest outside the ICU, we identified very-low-quality evidence from 7 pediatric observational studies (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision). All 7 studies showed that the rate of cardiac arrest outside the ICU declined after institution of a MET/RRT system (unadjusted relative risk [RR] less than 1), but none achieved statistical significance. (Brilli 2007, 236-246; Hunt 2008, 117-122; Hanson 2009, 500-504; Tibballs 2009, 306-312; Anwar ul 2010, 273-276; Kotsakis 2011, 72-78; Bonafide 2014, 25-33) There was enough potential variability between the studies (of both patient and healthcare system factors, including the baseline incidence of cardiac arrest) that a decision was made to not pool the data. For the critical outcome of all arrests (cardiac and respiratory) outside the ICU, we identified very-low-quality evidence from 4 pediatric observational studies (downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision). One study (Sharek 2007 (Sharek , 2267 (Sharek -2274 (Brilli 2007, 236-246; Sharek 2007 Sharek , 2267 Sharek -2274 Tibballs 2009, 306-312) observed a decline in deaths, and 3 did not. (Zenker 2007, 418-425; Hanson 2010, 314-318; Kotsakis 2011, 72-78) Treatment Recommendation: We suggest the use of pediatric MET/RRT systems in hospitals that care for children (weak recommendation, very-lowquality evidence). Values, Preferences, and Task Force Insights In making this recommendation, we place a higher value on the potential to recognize and intervene for patients with deteriorating illness over the expense incurred by a healthcare system by committing significant resources to implement a MET/RRT system. We recognize that the decision to use a MET/RRT system should be balanced by the existing resources and capabilities of the institution. registry study registry data Annual risk-adjusted mortality rate mortality rates: 8.4 [7.8-reduction outside 9 .0] to 8.8 [8.3-9.3] what would be p=0.11 expected based on pre-implementation trends Two pre-/post-intervention studies demonstrated a decrease in resuscitation events, though no clear decrease in mortality. One observational registry study demonstrated no change in mortality rate outside what was already expected from pre-implementation trends. This is not significantly different from the 2015 review. preterm*)))) NOT ((Animals[MeSH Terms] NOT Humans[MeSH Terms])))) NOT (("letter"[pt] OR "comment"[pt] OR "editorial" [pt] or Case Reports[ptyp])) Used the same search strategy, but restricted publication date to the range from 2015 to now (1/28/2020) . The citations of reviewed articles were also reviewed to identify potential studies missed using the search terms. The titles were reviewed for potential relevance; from the 494 publications, there were 43 potentially relevant studies. The abstracts of these studies were reviewed to determine relevance to the PICO question. From this review 24 studies were removed leaving 19 studies for more detailed evidence review. Several of these were systematic reviews; there were few new RCTs evaluating the interventions and outcomes of interest; most of the new data are from pilot studies, so the evidence is limited. A total of 12 studies were included in the final evidence review; the last study did not directly address the PICO question, but provides informative information regarding the effect of a fluid bolus on cardiac index (Long E, et al. Peds CCM 2018; 19:513-8) . Note: I tried to run the search using the terms sent to me in the evidence statement, but it kept returning an error so I just ran the above abbreviated search. This search identified 2 relevant Cochrane reviews, one included in this evidence review. The other assessed buffered solutions vs. 0.9% NS in children and adults. The only pediatric studies included in the latter were performed in dengue patients, so this review was not included. The author's overall conclusion, reviewing data from adult trials with 19,052 patients was, "We found no effect of buffered solutions on preventing in-hospital mortality compared to 0.9% saline solutions in critically ill patients. The certainty of evidence for this finding was high, indicating that further research would detect little or no difference in mortality. The effects of buffered solutions and 0.9% saline solutions on preventing acute kidney injury were similar in this setting. The certainty of evidence for this finding was low, and further research could change this conclusion. Patients treated with buffered solutions showed lower chloride levels, higher levels of bicarbonate, and higher pH. The certainty of evidence for these findings was very low. Future research should further examine patient-centered outcomes such as quality of life. The three ongoing studies once published and assessed may alter the conclusions of the review." 99 clinical trials published from 2015 to present (Feb 2020) were reviewed. Of these, by title 22 possibly addressed the PICO questions and the abstracts and citations were reviewed. Four were duplicates of studies already identified by the search, 5 were conference abstracts and 8 were citations of a trial protocol without results (17 total) , most with citations to the www.who.int/trialsearch site. The remaining 5 were not relevant. I searched www.ClinicalTrials.gov Search: I used "fluids" and "pediatric sepsis" to identify potential trials. The following were No results data were available, but it states that study recruitment is completed. The investigators intend to compare the effect of two solutions on the incidence of acute kidney injury in children resuscitated with either of the two fluids. Children receiving volumes of at least 20 ml/kg in the first hour of resuscitation as boluses would be enrolled and followed up for the proposed outcome variables. The investigators plan to enroll 708 patients over a period of 3 years. The investigators believe that the proposed study will provide the answer to the safety of normal saline which is the most widely preferred initial fluid for fluid resuscitation in children with shock due to sepsis. The purpose of the SQUEEZE Trial is to determine which fluid resuscitation strategy results in the best outcomes for children treated for suspected or confirmed septic shock. In this study, eligible children will be randomized to either the 'Usual Care Arm' or the 'Fluid Sparing Arm'. Children will receive treatment according to current ACCM Septic Shock Resuscitation Guidelines, with the assigned resuscitation strategy used to guide administration of further fluid boluses as well as the timing of initiation and escalation of vasoactive medications to achieve ACCM recommended hemodynamic targets. Included studies were randomized controlled trials or cohort studies evaluating fluid resuscitation in children with sepsis or septic shock. This evidence update excluded studies of children from Africa and excluded studies conducted in children with Dengue shock. The reason for excluding these studies is because the population of children studied in Africa are much different than children with sepsis seen in higher resource settings. Specifically, the large FEAST trial{Maitland 2011 2483} and subsequent studies conducted in this population represent a different pathophysiologic process compared with sepsis observed in children from high-resource regions as detailed below. For example, in the FEAST trial, 57% of children had malaria, 32% had a hemoglobin <5 g/dL at presentation, 37% had seizures, 39% had severe lactic acidosis (>5 mmol/L) and 83% were characterized as having respiratory distress. In addition, sickle cell disease was likely more prevalent than reported originally since a subsequent study in this same population using a molecular test identified twice the number of sickle cell disease cases (28%) than identified by family history.{Maitland 2019 420} An independent review of deaths in the FEAST trial identified the terminal clinical event (TCE) leading to death.{Maitland 2013 68} This analysis reported that mortality risk was highest in the bolus fluid resuscitated group who presented with a clinical presentation of severe shock/metabolic acidosis compared with those presenting with a respiratory or neurologic syndrome. A cardiogenic TCE was observed about twice as often (41%) as a respiratory (21%) or neurologic syndrome (21%). Mortality was especially increased in those children with a presenting hemoglobin concentration <5 g/dL (10.5% vs. 5.7% in no bolus group). Notably, only 1.7% of the fluid bolus children with an initial hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL died compared with 10.5% of the severely anemic children who received a NS or albumin bolus. Furthermore, 67.2% of the TCEs in the severe anemic group were classified as cardiogenic shock compared with 19.4% in children with a higher hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, supplemental data from the original FEAST trial{Maitland 2011 2483} reported that of the 103 severely anemic children who were not transfused within 8 hours of presentation, 52% died. Of note, 20% of the no-bolus children received blood in the first hour versus only 2% and 4% respectively in the albumin and saline groups, so early blood transfusion rather than a fluid bolus may partly explain the improved outcome in the no-bolus group. In addition, it is not widely appreciated that during the FEAST trial the protocol was amended so that children received 40 mL/kg rather than 20 mL/kg of saline or albumin. This magnified the adverse effect of the fluid bolus: 27/203 (13.3%) died following a 40 mL/kg bolus of NS or albumin vs. 14/2000 (7.0%) of no-bolus children. Besides the potential adverse effects of a fluid bolus that likely further reduced the hemoglobin concentration and added to the fluid overload in severely anemic children who need to maintain a high cardiac output to maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery, the adverse effects from a rapid bolus may be related to concomitant malaria infection and a relatively high prevalence of sickle cell disease in this population. For example, a recent adult study documented microcirculatory obstruction by malaria parasites; nonsurvivors had greater capillary obstruction than survivors.{Hanson 2015 122} In this study, admission plasma lactate in malaria patients was the strongest predictor of death, consistent with microcirculatory obstruction leading to local tissue hypoxia even if global cardiac output appears adequate. Since malaria sequestration physically obstructs the microcirculation, which limits the size of the vascular compartment, it is likely that excessive fluids increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure leading to tissue edema and increased oxygen diffusion distance in patients who already have compromised tissue oxygen delivery secondary to anemia. In support of this conclusion is the observation from a recent trial in a similar population of African children comparing 20 mL/kg of whole blood (or 10 mL/kg of pRBC) vs. 30 [1.35 -6.58 ]. Interestingly, for reasons that are not clear, the mortality risk was reversed in afebrile children who had better survival with the larger blood transfusion. These data further suggest that a large volume adversely affects outcome in this population of children where 64.1% had malaria and 28% had sickle cell disease, which also can obstruct the microcirculation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was not measured in the original FEAST trial, but was measured in the more recent blood transfusion trial. Dengue is excluded because unlike most other forms of infection-related shock, dengue is characterized by a transient increase in capillary permeability leading to loss of intravascular volume, including small proteins such as albumin. These children are characterized by signs consistent with severe hypovolemia: narrow pulse pressure and cold extremities with hemoconcentration. Indeed, the severity of pulse pressure narrowing and rise in hematocrit are used to characterize disease severity.{Ranjit 2011 90} Furthermore, Dengue occurs 7 to 10 days after fever defervescence suggesting an immune mediated process rather than a direct effect from viral infection. Early resuscitation with fluids to restore perfusion is important, but in the context of altered capillary permeability, the importance of avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation is well recognized since excessively raising capillary hydrostatic pressure leads to ascites, pleural effusions and gut edema. Thus, it is well recognized that once the child is out of shock, fluid intake must be reduced and the patient carefully monitored to avoid adverse effects from excessive fluid administration. Association between timing of antibiotic (AB) administration and PICU LOS. In the septic shock subgroup, they evaluated both the timing of AB and amount of early fluid (first two hours) with PICU LOS. Other predefined outcomes were ventilator days, PICU LOS, delta-PELOD (the decrease in the score from day 1 to 3 of PICU admission), and mortality at one year after index sepsis admission. Age, PRISM-III and severe underlying comorbidity were entered into all regression analyses. Of the 79 included, the median age was 60 (IQR, months. 49% had severe underlying comorbidity and the median PRISM III score on day of sepsis was 10.5 (6.0 -17.0 ). There were 5 deaths (6.3%) by one year; only one died during hospitalization for The timing of first antibiotic was not independently associated with any outcome on multivariate analysis. Higher 2-hour volume of fluid was independently associated with PICU LOS and more ventilator days, but PRISM score and presence of severe underlying disease were also associated with these outcomes. Time to starting vasoactive agents was not associated with disease outcome. In the septic shock cohort, administration of >20 mL/kg of fluid in the first 2 hours was associated with older age and higher PRISM scores with no difference in outcome. For the dichotomous outcomes of ventilator days >7, PICU LOS >7 days and delta-PELOD>median, there was more fluid given in the first 2 hours to children ventilated for at least 7 days: mean(SD) 36.7(34.9) vs. 20.2 (17.6) mL/kg, p=0.05, but the first 2 hours of fluid was clinically improved without the need for more aggressive therapy. In addition, even though their analysis adjusted for severity of illness (PRISM-III) and organ failure (PELOD), more severely ill children are more likely to receive more fluid. There was an association between fluid volume and longer LOS and ventilation, but this does not prove causation. 46% were transferred from an outside ED, so the volume and speed of resuscitation in that setting was not captured. This is a small cohort, especially those with septic shock (N=44), making generalizations difficult. There is no explanation of why the septic shock children were older. It is not surprising that early AB administration and larger fluid boluses in the first 2 hours was associated with longer LOS-children receiving early and more aggressive therapy were more likely to be perceived as more ill. not associated with PICU LOS>7 days or delta-PELOD. The PELOD score was much higher in those ventilated >7 days: 14.4(8) vs. 20.7(11) , p=0.007, as was the PRISM score: 10.4(6.1) vs. 14.5(8.6) The post-protocol group had a higher PIM2 score, but it is possible that the postprotocol children were more ill, as suggested by the PIM2 score, and that the protocol improved their outcome. It is also plausible that implementing the protocol increased clinician awareness and categorization of children as septic in the written notes. However, it is also plausible that the use of more rapid fluid administration adversely affected outcome (or failed to improve outcome) since many of the affected children had SAM. The trial comparing rapid vs. slower bolus administration (Sankar, et al) is consistent with this study: more rapid fluid administration may have an adverse effect in this population of malnourished children. The use of blood was also associated with increased mortality, rate of respiratory insufficiency was not different between groups. Median LOS (hours, IQR) was 96 (46-168) pre-vs. 120 (72-240) post-protocol, p=0.02. Using a logistic regression that adjusted for age, male sex, WAZ, PIM2, hematocrit, "meets sepsis criteria" and culture positive sepsis, the adjusted OR (aOR) for mortality post-protocol was not significantly increased, 1.55 (95% CI, 0.88-2.71, p=0.13). Fluid overload was more likely post-protocol, aOR = 3.45 (2.04-5.85, p<0 .001) and if >10 mL/kg of blood was infused, aOR = 5.71 (2.19-14.9) . Heart failure was more common postprotocol, aOR = 4.52 (1.43-14.29, p=0 .01). which may reflect an adverse effect, but could also be biased by being used in more severely ill children since one indication for blood transfusion was the presence of septic shock. The Fluids in Shock (FiSh) trial was designed to evaluate whether a restricted fluid bolus volume (10 mL/kg) compared with currently recommended volume (20 mL/kg) is associated with improved outcomes for children presenting to UK EDs with presumed septic shock. This was a pilot to determine the feasibility of conducting an RCT which employed conducting the research without prior consent (deferred consent). They interviewed parents who participated and wanted to know if parents would object to the trial. This was a pragmatic, open, multicentered RCT. [ISRCTN trial registration number: 15244462] Study involved 4 regional hospitals with PICUs and 9 district general hospitals with an ED but not a PICU. Covered 3 regions in "hub and spoke" model. Extensive training at each site. Inclusion criteria were age >37 weeks (corrected GA) and <16 yo; clinical suspicion of infection; and signs of shock. The latter was defined as age-adjusted hypotension or cap refill time (CRT) ≥ 3 seconds after receiving 20 mL/kg fluid bolus. Nonstandard BP ranges. Exclusion criteria included prior receipt of more than 20 mL/kg fluid bolus; conditions in which fluid resuscitation should be curtained; or children in whom full resuscitation was not within the current goals of care. Eligible patients were randomized while in acute assessment area and allocated 1:1 to either 10 or 20 mL/kg boluses as needed over a 4-hour period without prior consent. Each bolus was to be delivered over 15 mins with max bolus amount of 500 or 1000 mL for 10 vs. 20 mL/kg group. At the end of each bolus cycle, the patient was reassessed and if age-adjusted signs of shock persisted, then another bolus of the same size was given with the next 15 minutes. Fluid type and other interventions were at the discretion of the treating physician. Maximum amount of fluid that could be given within 4 hours was 120 mL/kg (excluding initial bolus). Further fluid was curtailed if shock resolved or if signs of fluid overload occurred: pulmonary edema (rales on auscultation or pulmonary edema fluid in ET tube) or new or increasing hepatomegaly. The objectives of the pilot were to test if the processes worked together and to inform the design and conduct of the full FiSh trial. Results: Conducted from 7/2016 to 4/2017 with follow up to 31 May 2017. In total, 297 children who received a fluid bolus of any size were screened. 88 (29.8%) received a bolus <20 mL/kg and 108 (51.7%) did not meet the criteria for clinical signs of shock after receiving a 20 mL/kg bolus. 18 others were excluded for meeting one or more exclusion criteria. Overall, 75 of 83 eligible patients were recruited; 40 in the 10 mL/kg group and 35 in the 20 mL/kg group. One patient from each group was not included because consent could not be obtained in a timely manner. Overall recruitment was 0.9 patients/center/month (don't know denominator). Generally, the groups were well matched, but differed in age and weight (median 11 months in 10 and 2 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) in 20 group). Median IQR for BPsys was 102 (91-114) and 104 (89-115). PIM2r score was lower than expected at 2.1%. Most met the CRT criteria for shock (76.9% in 10 and 88.2% in 20 groups). 37 (51.3% in the 10 mL and 50% in the 20 mL group) had infection confirmed; however, in five children the organism was not recorded. Of the remaining 32, 13 had bacterial infection and 18 had a viral infection, most were respiratory pathogens. One patient in 10 mL group had falciparum malaria. There were 7.7% and 5.9% deviations in the study protocol. Overall, 70% of participants required only one study fluid bolus and only 11% required more than 2 boluses; only 4 patients in the 4-hour period received 4 or more fluid boluses. The mean total volume of additional fluid received after the initial 20 mL/kg bolus over the first hour was 38% lower in 10 vs. 20 groups: 13.5 vs. 20.7 mL/kg. During the entire 4-hour period there was a significant difference: 14.5 vs. 27.5 mL/kg; mean difference of -11.2 mL/kg (95% CI: -16.6 to -5.8 mL/kg; p<0.001). It was difficult to achieve the 15 min delivery in the 20 ml/kg group. 80.9% of the 10 mL/kg group were delivered in the time desired, but only 68.2% of the 20 group were; in the latter 18.2% required more than 30 minutes. Overall, 78.7% of the 10 mL/kg boluses were delivered in the correct volume (± 10%) and within 15 minutes vs. 54 .5% in the 20 mL/kg group. [This suggests it is difficult Hard to achieve rapid delivery and is it needed?] There was no mortality. 32.4% vs. 25.6% of 20 mL/kg vs. 10 mL/kg group were transferred to the PICU; 25% vs. 11.1% required mechanical ventilation and 15.6% vs. 2.8% received inotropes, but because of the small n, none of these differences were statistically significant. Discussion: The trial processes were deemed feasible, but the population had a lower severity of illness than expected from previous data (Ref 9) impacting on the feasibility of a larger trial. UK has an aggressive vaccination program and vaccine preventable infections are now uncommon. It is notable that viral infections were more common and that most children did not have a clinical need for more than 30 mL/kg total fluid. It seems clear that the epidemiology of severe childhood infection has changed from the time when rapid fluid bolus was promoted in the early 1990s. This makes it difficult to develop uniform recommendations. In interviews, some clinicians lacked clinical equipoise favoring 10 over 20. This trial, and the study looking at more rapid fluid administration (5-10 vs 15-20) {Sankar 2017 e435} suggests that if an initial 20 mL/kg bolus is given, subsequent boluses of 10 mL/kg are safe and effective in developed countries and may limit the risk of iatrogenic fluid overload. This approach was recommended by Maitland in letter to the editor regarding this study. Data in adults suggests that NS may have adverse effects on outcome, including increased mortality and increased risk of AKI. In addition, NS use is associated with the development of a non-anion gap hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Two large observational studies in children produced conflicting results (13) (14) with one showing harm and the other no harm. Two pragmatic trials in adults (critically ill and not critically ill) showed small, but meaningful reductions in major adverse kidney events and hospital mortality (11, 12) . A large, prospective, multi-centered trial in children would help determine if there is a clinical benefit from balanced vs. unbalanced crystalloid. The purpose of this trial was a single center feasibility study to determine 1) if ED clinicians could screen, randomize and administer study fluids to children with suspected septic shock during the course of routine care; 2) ensure acceptability to patients and providers of enrollment using the exception to informed consent process; and, 3) determine whether clinicians would adhere to an RCT of fluid type with minimal study team oversight. This was a pragmatic, two-arm open-label RCT of children presenting to the ED with suspected septic shock from 1/25/18 to 8/31/18 at CHOP. Study popn was patients >6 months and <18 yr with suspected septic shock treated in the ED; suspected shock defined by clinician decision to treat suspected bacterial infection with parental antibiotics, collection of blood culture and intent to administer at least 2 fluid boluses for abnormal perfusion. Randomization sequence generated prior to the start of the study in permuted blocks and equal allocation into two groups. Clinicians were not blinded since a prior study noted that fluid allocation could be determined in most patients by the results of electrolyte profiles. Once randomized, clinical team instructed to give assigned crystalloid from time of randomization until 2359 the next day (i.e., 24-48 hours). Study was not powered to identify clinical outcomes, but these were collected, including all-cause mortality capped at 90-days, hospital LOS, hospital-free days out of 28 and major adverse kidney event at 30 days (MAKE30): defined as death, need for RRT, or persistent kidney dysfunction at hospital discharge or 30 days (Cr ≥2 times baseline (BL) or median value for age if no BL). Safety outcomes included hyperlactatemia (>4 mmol/L); hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L); hypernatremia (>155 mEq/L); hyponatremia (<128 mEq/L); hyperchloremia (>110 mEq/L); thrombosis or cerebral edema (use of hyperosmolar therapy for radiographic and clinical determination of new impending or present brain herniation). Results: 174 screened for eligibility; 115 excluded. Of 59 eligible, 50 randomized; 24 to LR and 26 to NS. About half the fluid given during study period was bolus and the remainder as maintenance. 38% of LR and 42% NS group received ≥60 mL/kg of bolus fluid. There was strong adherence to the study protocol; however, only 63% of LR children received ≥75% of their total crystalloid as LR. Two patients in LR arm did not receive 2 fluid boluses due to clinical improvement. By chance, the LR group was significantly younger (median IQR = 3.8 (2.0-10.4) yrs vs 9.7 (2.6-16.3) . About 2/3 of both groups had a comorbid condition. Median total fluid was 107 (60 to 155) in LR vs. 98 (63 to 128) mL/kg. Bolus fluid was 58 vs 53 mL/kg (median). MAKE30 occurred in 1 patient in each group and there was just one death in the NS group, so cohort was not as ill as expected. Interestingly, hyperlactatemia occurred in 15% of NS vs. 8% of LR group. Hypercalcemia occurred in 15% of NS vs. 0% in LR. Not surprisingly, hyperchloremia occurred in 27% of NS vs. 13% of LR children. There were no differences in need for vasoactive infusions or mechanical ventilation. EFIC was acceptable (93%) to caregivers. Discussion: This trial supports the use of this protocol in a larger multicenter trial. The N in this trial is too small to evaluate many of the clinical outcomes, but the low mortality and morbidity may limit the ultimate findings from a larger trial. Current guidelines advocate for aggressive fluid resuscitation of up to 60 mL/kg as boluses of 20 mL/kg, each over 5-10 mins to achieve desired HR and BP(Dellinger SSC, 2013; Davis et al pediatric ACCM guidelines recommend pushing fluids up to 60 mL/kg; monitor for crackles, hepatomegaly, increased WOB or gallop rhythm develops). In developing countries, rapid fluid delivery is challenging because of limited human resources to push-pull fluid and lack of technologic equipment. In addition, there is a fear of causing respiratory failure and the need for ventilation support, which is not available. The purpose of this study was to assess the optimal duration/speed of bolus fluid (BF) administration in the first hour during initial resuscitation that is safe and better tolerated in children with septic shock. Methods: This was an RCT from 9/2013 to 8/2014 in a tertiary ED and PICU in North India. They screened all children for septic shock: defined as suspected infection and 2 or more clinical signs of decreased perfusion (Suppl 1). Children with malaria, dengue, severe anemia, severe malnutrition, primary cardiac disease, those on noninvasive ventilation before developing shock and those with prior fluid and inotrope therapy were excluded. Obtained verbal assent then obtained delayed informed consent. Stratified into two groups: stratum A -those already on the ventilator at time of shock recognition; and stratum Bthose not on a ventilator. Used variable block randomization, using a random number table, in varying block sizes from 2 to 8. When verbal consent obtained, resident opened sealed serially numbered envelope to determine if patient was in the 5-10 min or 15-20 min fluid bolus group. Unable to blind due to nature of study, but person recording outcomes was blinded to group allocation. Primary objective was to compare difference in need for "new ventilation" and/or impaired oxygenation (i.e, increased peak oxygenation index [OI = MAP * FiO2/PaO2 * 100] by 5 in those already ventilated. in the first six and 24 hours following fluid resuscitation. They defined "newly ventilated" as due to respiratory failure, or decision to intubate for persistent hemodynamic instability even after 60 mL/kg of fluid and epi up to 0.3 mcg/kg/min. Secondary objective was to compared differences in signs of fluid overload (crackles or hepatomegaly), the proportion of children requiring ventilation for fluid overload alone, changes in OI, respiratory rates, FiO2 requirements and O2 saturation change from BL up to 24 hrs, total fluids in mL/kg at 6 and 24 h and % fluid overload at 24 h. Other parameters that were compared were the inotrope score, PELOD score, PICU LOS, and mortality. They used the same treatment protocol as they used in a study completed the year before. NS used with boluses up to 60 mL/kg in the first hour with careful monitoring for signs of fluid overload. Of note, they inserted a CVP line within the first hour in all patients (usually achieved within 30 min). Further fluid was guided by the CVP and clinical features of hypoperfusion-a lower threshold of <8 cm H2O with one or more clinical sign was needed to give more fluid. Once threshold reached, inotropes/vasopressors were titrated. They gave the FB with an infusion bag in the 15-20 min group and push-pull in 5-10 min group. In both groups, a stopwatch was used for time keeping. They analyzed results half-way through the planned enrollment per their IRB-equivalent who instructed them to stop the trial if there was a significant increase in ventilatory requirements/deaths, which it did! They performed a multivariate logistic regression using the proportion of newly ventilated at first hour as the dependent variable and factors likely to influence the outcome, decided a priori, as the independent variables. Results: 104 children were eligible; 8 were excluded for prespecified reasons, so 96 enrolled; 45 in 15-20 and 51 in the 5-10 min groups. Groups were balanced for age, PIM2, PELOD, diagnosis and hemodynamic and respiratory variables ( Table 1 ). The children were malnourished with wt-for-age z-score of -1.79(-3.01 to -1.21) in the 15-20 min group and -1.6 (-3.01 to -0.83) in the 5-10 min group. BMI z-score also low: median of -2.64 and -2.15 respectively. Median age was 6.5 years. High PIM2 score 74 (49-79) in 15-20 and 71 (43-77) in 5-10 min [I am not sure their PIM2 calculations are correct-using their data I get much lower values and observed mortality was not nearly this high]. Initial median CVP was 6 (4-9) in 15-20 min and 5 (3-6) cm H2O in 5-10 min groups. Median lactate was 2.9 (1.1-3.6) and 3.0 (0.9-3.8) mmol/L with base deficit of 8 (4.2-12.8) and 7.8 (3.9 -11.8) mmol/L. Mean (SD) SVC O2 saturation was 72%(11%) vs. 70%(12%). The proportion of children with SVC O2 saturation ≤70% was 61% in 10-15 min vs. 66% in 5-10 min group. Mean (SD) hgb was 9.7(2.2) and 10 (2.4) g/dL. Blood cultures were positive in 16% of 15-20 vs. 22% of 5-10. Cold shock was identified in 82% of 15-20 min and 85% of 5-10 min. Significantly fewer children in the 15-20 min group experienced the primary composite outcome of newly ventilated or increase in OI by 5 or more immediately after fluid resuscitation in the first 6 and 24 hours: 36% vs. 57% (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99, p=0.04) and 43% vs. 68% (RR, 0.63; 0.42-0.93, p=0.02). NNH was 5 and 4 at 6 and 24 hours, respectively. Even after the first hour, the composite outcome was significantly lower in 15-20 group: 18% vs 43%; RR, 0.41, 0.20-0.83, p=0.008). NNH was 4. There was no difference in mortality (40% vs. 33%, RR, 1.2 (0.70-2.03), p=0.5). The proportion of newly ventilated children at first hour after fluid resuscitation was only 11% in 15-20 min group vs. Shock resolution as determined by MAP, SVCO2, lactate and BD at 6 and 24 h was not significantly different. On multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors associated with the need for ventilation in the first hour, only 5-10 min FB was significantly associated after adjusting for all other factors (p=0.006). Discussion: These findings suggest that fluid should not be delivered too rapidly since at least in this population of very ill children, there was significant evidence of adverse effects. It is noteworthy that this population had a high mortality rate and most were classified as cold shock, even though the measured CVP was not elevated at baseline in most children. The findings suggest that very rapid fluid administration may transiently increase capillary hydrostatic pressure leading to increased interstitial fluid that has adverse pulmonary and likely other organ system effects. One may assume that the adverse effects would be greater in children with pneumonia, but pneumonia was the source of infection in 29% of the 15-20 min group vs. 14% in the 5-10 min group, suggesting that more of the former children should have developed respiratory failure. The latter group had more meningitis (27% vs. 20%) and abdominal infections (22% vs. 13%). This was not a severely anemic cohort and only one patient turned out to have malaria. SVC O2 saturation was not severely depressed when the CVP was inserted in the first hour of resuscitation (This group previously showed a beneficial effect of using the SVC O2 to guide therapy). It is noteworthy that the need for mechanical ventilation/worsening of OI persisted at 6 and 24 hours after the fluid bolus. They noted that the O2 saturations worsened at 1 hour and 6 hrs in the 5-10 min group (lowest sats 82% and 91%) with increasing FiO2 and peak OI from 7.2 to 16 in the 5-10 min group over the first 24 hours. This group also had a significantly higher rate of developing hepatomegaly. They note that rapid restoration of blood pressure and perfusion in the hypotensive child is important to limit endorgan injury. Thus, fluid resuscitation has to be balanced to address the concerns from causing adverse effects if infused too rapid or too slow! (i.e., need Goldilocks infusion rate). Of note, in Table 2 they document that mean first bolus was completed in 17 vs. 6 min; second in 35 vs. 13 min and third in 53 vs. 22 minutes! Thus, 60 mL/kg was given very rapidly in this population of children, especially in the 5-10 min group. Respiratory rate increased from mean (SD) of 39 (14) in the 5-10 min group to 49(14) at 1 hour compared with 38 (13) to 38(12) in the 15-20 min group, p=0.0003. FiO2 went from 70%(17%) at BL to 88%(9%) at 1 hour vs. 72%(14%) to 78%(12%), p<0.0001. CVP at catheter insertion was 5(3) cm H2O in both groups and max during 1-6 hours was 11 (4) in the 15-20 min group vs. 12 (4) in the 5-10 min group, p=0.59. From 6-24 h it was 11(3) and 13 (3), p=0.05. There were no significant differences in the MAP or SVC O2 sat between groups at any time. Lactate clearance, however, was slower in the 5-10 min group; median IQR lactate at BL, 6 hr and 24 hr was 3.0 (0.9-3.8), 2.7 (1.2-3.8) and 2.1 (1.1-3.1) mmol/L, but this was not statistically different from the 15-20 group: 2.9 (1.1-3.6) to 1.4(0.9-3.8) to 1.2 (0.9-3.3). Limitation is their protocol recommends intubation whereas some other centers may use NIPPV. Secondly, the numbers are fairly small, but protocol compliance was good and groups were well matched at BL. Separate critical review in a letter to the editor noted that the fragility index, the number of subjects with an alternative outcome, was low in this trial: An editorial by T Kortz and N Kissoon (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2017; 18:995-7) state the situation well: "Globally, sepsis is a heterogenous clinical entity characterized by differences in patient comorbidities and infectious etiologies and affected by access to care, provider knowledge, monitoring capabilities, and resource availability across and within regions that render a uniform approach to management impractical and misguided." The current WHO guidelines recommend 10-20 mL/kg of isotonic fluid over 30 to 60 minutes followed by reassessment; and, if the patient remains in shock, a repeat 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes is recommended.[WHO Updated guideline, Paediatric Emergency Triage, Assessment and Treatment: Care of Critically Ill Children. www.who.int In Jan 2018, the authors searched, CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, intensive and critical care conference abstracts, and www.Clinical.Trials.gov to identify RCTs, quasi-RCTs and cluster RCTs comparing liberal fluid therapy versus conservative fluid therapy for children and adults with septic shock. The search retrieved 8226 references and another 260 were found by searching the clinical trials registry. After removing duplicates, there were 6650 citations; 6631 were excluded through title and abstract screening. Of the remaining 19 full-text articles, only 3 met their study inclusion criteria. They identified no adult studies that met the selection criteria and only three pediatric RCTs, the FEAST trial and two small trials in India. These were previously reviewed. They conclude that liberal fluid therapy may increase mortality among children with sepsis or septic shock, but they do not comment on the differences in the underlying populations compared with higher resource centers. They searched for RCTs (12/2014) in Medline, Embase and CCRCT using terms related to fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis and septic shock. Two independent investigators identified relevant articles for inclusion. The reference lists of included articles were also examined to identify any missing articles. They specifically included articles describing hospitalized children >28 days to 18 yo. They excluded studies of lone tropical pathogens such as malaria and dengue fever. They examined any form of fluid resuscitation compared to any comparative group. Primary outcome of interest was mortality at any reported time point. Secondary outcomes were duration of ICU and hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to shock reversal as defined by the study authors, or changes in reported physiologic variables. They did not contact authors for additional information. A meta-analysis could not be conducted due to clinical heterogeneity and methodologic heterogeneity of the studies identified. The search for RCTs and nonrandomized studies identified 3,393 and 2,967 publications respectively. They Key Findings: They could only identify 3 RCTs looking at fluid bolus therapy in hospitalized children without malaria or dengue and 8 observational studies. The cohorts were small and the populations studied underwent different procedures, so unable to combine in a meta-analysis. Of note, there were no RCTs in Europe or N America. In the absence of evidence, there should be clinical equipoise for conducting a trial of high vs. low fluid volume resuscitation and evaluating the benefit or harm from different speeds of fluid resuscitation in developed countries. Other questions are when to begin vasopressor/inotropic therapy and what clinical criteria can be used to classify the type of shock and guide therapy, including guiding therapy during fluid bolus therapy to minimize the risk of adverse effects from the therapy. Since mortality rates in developed countries are relatively low, a trial would be logistically challenging and require multiple centers. Other outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, AKI, MOSD injury, etc. may be more relevant endpoints. Compounding the analysis of this type of study is knowing how to stratify patients by existing comorbidities, such as malignancy, chronic renal failure, etc. Also need to consider the effect of the time and type of other interventions, such as time to appropriate antibiotics/antivirals/antifungal agents. The role of viral infections in septic shock in children also needs further analysis-in many studies from high-resource countries it appears that children who meet severe sepsis/septic shock criteria often have a viral infection rather than a bacterial infection. The authors searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science and Scopus for relevant studies evaluating the use of colloids compared with crystalloids. A total of 11 relevant studies were found and one more was added after reviewing previous reviews. Of the 12 articles, there were no new studies not included in the 2015 CoSTR statement. Five studies assessed colloids in malaria, five studied dengue shock, the FEAST trial studied "febrile disease" and 1 examined the progression of septic shock from various causes. They concluded, "The articles analyzed did not provide evidence to suggest that colloids are superior to crystalloids. In some studies, the amount of fluid needed to achieve initial stabilization was smaller in the group given colloids. Crystalloids seem to be the preferred therapeutic option because of their effectiveness, low cost, and wide availability. Colloids may be the first choice in cases of malaria when the central nervous system is affected." Objective was to determine if a balanced (RL, Hartmann, Plasma-Lyte) solution was associated with an improved outcome compared with NS, which in large volumes may cause a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and has been associated with an increased risk of AKI in adults. Data in critically ill adults suggest increased hospital mortality with NS vs. LR (e.g., Raghunathan K, et al. CCM 2014; 42:1585-91) . Conducted a matched retrospective cohort study of peds patients (<18 yo) with severe sepsis or septic shock across 382 geographically diverse US hospitals between Jan 2000 and Dec 2013. Patients identified from the Premier Healthcare Database. Dx of severe sepsis, septic shock based on coding for either an invasive infection plus acute organ dysfunction or the ICD-9-CM code for "severe sepsis" or "septic shock." Restricted inclusion to children with an order within the first 3 days of hospitalization for blood cultures and broad-spectrum antibiotics and patient had to have orders to receive any combination of NS or LR boluses during the first 3 days of hospitalization. Excluded NICU admissions and children with unknown hospital disposition at day 30. Fluid volumes billed as 250, 500, or 1000 mL units, so analysis based on assumption (likely incorrect) that the entire billed fluid volume was given. Used mean weight for age to estimate mL/kg. Separately analyzed a small population of children who received only LR vs. only NS. Primary outcome was all-cause 30-day hospital mortality (i.e., don't know if mortality was related to infection that was coded). Secondary outcomes included new onset AKI identified by ICD-9 codes, with or without dialysis. Results: An initial cohort of 12,529 met all inclusion/exclusion criteria; only 2150 were ordered to receive at least one LR bolus; 459 received LR exclusively. There were 2117 patients in the LR any group and 2117 in the matched NS group. 82% and 79% were admitted to the PICU; 42% and 39% received a vasoactive infusion and 66% and 64% received mechanical ventilation. Blood or blood products were given to 47% and 44% of LR vs NS group. (11.9; 5.0 -18) vs. (10.5; 4.0-14) days: RR 1.35 (0.5-2.2), p= 0.01. All-cause mortality rate increased with total crystalloid volume by quartiles, but there was no difference by fluid type. There were several limitations noted by the authors: 1) claims-based data may lead to misclassification bias if ordered and administered therapies are discrepant; 2) they could not account for prehospital fluid administration; 3) the volume per kg weight was estimated based on average weight for age and assumption that total volume of billed fluid was given; 4) the NS group was younger than the LR group could have introduced more error in estimating the total volume of fluid given in these younger patients because of the rounding of fluid given based on amount billed; the accuracy of using ICD-9-CM codes for infection plus organ dysfunction codes to identify sepsis is controversial; 5) although statistical matching is designed to minimize the effect of baseline differences, it is possible there are unmeasured covariates that were not included in the matching process; and, 6) the identification and timing of surgical interventions is limited using administrative codes, which made it difficult to account for the effect of the usual surgical preference to use LR rather than NS. Conclude that in this large matched cohort study of pediatric severe sepsis and septic shock, balanced fluid resuscitation with LR was not associated with improved mortality, AKI or dialysis, even when matched by fluid volume and proportionate LR utilization. However, LR was preferentially used either as first-line fluid in patients with lower illness severity or as an adjunctive fluid in patients who received large amounts of fluid resuscitation. Furthermore, the matching algorithm was least effective in the most severely ill patients who received the largest fluid volumes. This study established equipoise for a prospective RCT. Lots of issues with confidence in diagnosis, bias in selection of fluid, knowledge about surgery where LR is more often used. Can't match fluid to sepsis event. van Paridon BM, Sheppard C, G GG and Joffe AR. Timing of antibiotics, volume, and vasoactive infusions in children with sepsis admitted to intensive care. Crit Care. 2015;19:293. They hypothesized that early antibiotics, fluid resuscitation and vasoactive infusions would be associated with fewer days of ventilation and shorter LOS in the PICU. To study this, the Alberta Sepsis Network (ASN) prospectively enrolled a cohort of children with sepsis admitted to the only two PICUs in Alberta. In this study, they retrospectively reviewed the charts of children admitted to the Stollery Children's Hospital PICU. The population include all children up to 17 yo from 4/2010 to 3/2014 admitted to the PICU. Sepsis defined as SIRS caused by suspected or proven bacterial or fungal infection with antibiotics prescribed and a CVL or arterial line in place (thus, a susbset of all sepsis cases). Septic shock defined as receiving a vasoactive drug infusion or a dose change of a vasoactive agent on the first calendar day of sepsis. Severe underlying comorbidity was defined as having a cardiac, neurologic or at least two other organ systems involved in a chronic disease prior to the onset of sepsis. Patients were excluded if they were not expected to survive >24 hours, were on palliative care, or if they had severe sepsis for ≥48 h. Time of onset was time of presentation to the ED, or if they were hospitalized, time of temp >38.2 and blood cultures drawn. They determined the time when an antibiotic infusion started, fluid boluses time and volume, and volume given in first two hours as a pragmatic definition of early bolus therapy. They also determined the volume of fluid infused until first vasoactive infusion was started, and time of vasoactive infusion from presentation. Primary outcome was association between timing of AB administration and PICU LOS. In the septic shock subgroup, they evaluated both the timing of AB and amount of early fluid with PICU LOS. Other pre-defined outcomes were ventilator days, PICU LOS, delta-PELOD (the decrease in the score from day 1 to 3 of PICU admission), and mortality at one year after index sepsis admission. Age, PRISM-III and severe underlying comorbidity were entered into all regression analyses. Results: Of 83 patients in the ASN database, 4 were excluded due to lost charts. Of the 79 included, the median age was 60 (IQR, months. 49% had severe underlying comorbidity and the median PRISM III score on day of sepsis was 10.5 (6.0 -17.0). There were 5 deaths (6.3%) by one year; only one died during hospitalization for sepsis event. Most children presented to the ED, either at an outlying hospital (46%) or at Stollery (27%). Only 2 (3%) developed sepsis while on the wards and 25% while in the PICU. Most infections were pneumonia w/ or w/o empyema (53%), meningitis (14%) or bacteremia (13%); other sites included abdominal (5%), UTI (4%), cellulitis (3%) and other (9%). Median time from presentation to acceptable AB administration was 115.0 (59-323) minutes; only 20 patients (25%) received their antibiotics within 60 mins. There were 44 children (56%) with septic shock of whom 3 died by 1 year. On univariate analysis, early AB administration was associated with higher PRISM-III score and longer PICU LOS. In the septic shock cohort, administration of >20 mL/kg of fluid in the first 2 hours was associated with older age and higher PRISM scores with no difference in outcome. For the dichotomous outcomes of ventilator days >7, PICU LOS >7 days and delta-PELOD>median, there was more fluid given in the first 2 hours to children ventilated for at least 7 days: mean(SD) 36.7(34.9) vs. 20.2 (17.6), p=0.05, but the first 2 hours of fluid was not associated with PICU LOS>7 days or delta-PELOD. The PELOD score was much higher in those ventilated >7 days: 14.4(8) vs. 20.7(11) , p=0.007, as was the PRISM score: 10.4(6.1) vs. 14.5(8.6), p=0.02, but not the presence of severe underlying disease, which trended higher in longer ventilated group, but was not significant: 40% vs. 66%, p=0.056. For PICU LOS>7 days, the presence of severe underlying disease was significantly higher in long stay patients: 33% vs. 61%, p=0.022. Only ventilator days differed significantly for the delta-PELOD groups with the smaller delta associated with longer ventilation: 10.3(11.2) vs. 5.8(5.1) days, p=0.036. Since there were so few deaths, and most deaths occurred after hospitalization, it is likely not appropriate to relate this outcome to FBT. Multiple regression analysis found that the PRISM-III score and severe underlying comorbidity were independent predictors of PICU LOS >7 days, but not time to first antibiotics. In the septic shock group, the volume of fluid boluses given in the first two hours was independently associated with longer PICU LOS (effect size 0.22 days; 95%CI, 0.5, 0.38 days per mL/kg, p=0.01). Independent predictors of ventilation >7 days were the PRISM-III score and severe underlying comorbidity. In the septic shock group, the volume in 2 hours was again associated with more ventilator days (effect size 0.09 days (0.02-0.15) per mL/kg, p=0.009. The only independent predictor of a smaller than median delta-PELOD was age (effect size 0.042 (0.004-0.08), p=0.032 in the overall group; there were no independent predictors of delta-PELOD in the shock group. Discussion: The timing of first antibiotic was not independently associated with any outcome on multivariate analysis. Higher 2-hour volume of fluid was independently associated with PICU LOS and more ventilator days, but PRISM score and presence of severe underlying disease were also associated with these outcomes. Time to starting vasoactive agents was not associated with disease outcome. They note that septic shock was defined by the decision to start vasoactive therapy; thus, some children may have responded to FBT and not required vasoactive therapy. They did not record the time of hypotension to meet more stringent definition of septic shock, although the BP threshold for hypotension may not be accurate. The mortality was remarkably low for this population of sick children (based on PRISM-III and PELOD scores), suggesting that what they were doing was effective in reducing mortality. Finally, they note that this study cannot prove cause and effect and is hypothesis-generating only. Limitations: By limiting the cohort to only those children judged to be ill enough to need an arterial line and/or CVL for frequent blood sampling, they eliminated children who may have responded to fluid bolus therapy and clinically improved without the need for more aggressive therapy. In addition, even though their analysis adjusted for severity of illness (PRISM-III) and organ failure (PELOD), more severely ill children are more likely to receive more fluid. There was an association between fluid volume and longer LOS and ventilation, but this does not prove causation. 46% were transferred from an outside ED, so the volume and speed of resuscitation in that setting was not captured. This is a small cohort, especially those with septic shock (N=44), making generalizations difficult. There is no explanation of why the septic shock children were older. It is not surprising that early AB administration and larger fluid boluses in the first 2 hours was associated with longer LOS-children receiving early and more aggressive therapy were more likely to be perceived as more ill. Zhang S, Dai X, Guo C. Crystalloid fluid administration was associated with outcomes in pediatric patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Medicine. 2018; 97:48(e12663). To evaluate the association between fluid accumulation and clinical outcomes, this study aimed to assess the variability in crystalloid administration among children with severe sepsis and septic shock at a large tertiary care hospital in China. Specifically, they evaluated the relationship between the cumulative 3-day crystalloid amount and outcome, postulating that restrictive crystalloid intake would be associated with better clinical outcome. The study population was retrospectively analyzed; cohort from 2011 through 2015 at Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Exclusion criteria were PICU stay <3 days, age <6 months or >12 years, unexpected discharge from the PICU or transfer to another facility (13/108 were transferred due to financial reasons!), and incomplete data on fluid balance. A total of 108 children were admitted to the PICU with sepsis or septic shock. Of these, 29 were excluded, 8 were <6 months, 3 had stays <3 days and 5 had incomplete data. The remaining 79 were analyzed. There was no specific protocol used for fluid administration. The daily intake and output was recorded from the chart; they did not try to estimate insensible losses. The patients were divided into a low (40 children) and highvolume (39 children) cohort based on intake above or below the median of 193 mL/kg. Of note, there is reference made to intraoperative hemodynamic parameters, but no mention of how many children had surgery and if the surgical fluid intake was considered. The primary outcome was all-cause PICU mortality. The secondary outcome was the PICU LOS following sepsis recognition. Results: The median (IQR) PRISM III on day of sepsis was 13.1 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Median age was 3.1 years. Severe sepsis was diagnosed in 33 patients on first day and 2 on second day; 44 (55.7%) had septic shock. Most infections were intraabdominal w/ or w/o bowel perforation (26, 39.2%) . Respiratory source in 12.6%, skin & soft tissue in 11.4%, primary blood stream in 7.6% and meningitis in 5.1%). Antibiotics were given w/in the first hour in 32.9%. Overall, 74.7% had a positive culture of a normally sterile site. Gram negatives were more common than gram positive organisms: 51.9% vs. 20.3%; anaerobes were identified in 17.7% of cultures and fungus in 6.3%. Viral DNA was reportedly isolated from the blood of 11 patients (13.9%) but no details are provided on which organisms were identified; antiviral agents were given to 9.8% of children. The low and high-volume groups were matched for WBC, CRP, PCT, albumin, lactate. Significant differences were present for the reason for PICU admission, primary diagnosis and underlying comorbidities (p=0.027), but no specific data are provided! The high-volume group was younger than the low-volume group ( Discussion: There was an association between total 3-day fluid intake and mortality and increased PICU LOS, but they cannot ascertain cause and effect and their analysis does not adequately consider comorbidities and reason for admission, which they state was different between the two groups. As they state in their discussion, "Because this is a retrospective study, it is not possible to distinguish whether high crystalloid administration is simply a marker of illness severity…" They correctly note that this was a small, retrospective study with a heterogeneous population. They were unable to assess interhospital variation in fluid administration and they did not assess if the antimicrobials were appropriate for the organisms subsequently identified. Limitations: This was a relatively small single center study with poor methodology since they only evaluated children who were in the PICU for 3 days and conducted their evaluation by comparing children who received less than the 3day median fluid intake to those who received more. It would have been preferable to analyze the groups by volume (ml/kg) over a continuous range rather than in a dichotomous manner. It is possible that some children responded to fluid bolus therapy and did not need to remain in the PICU for 3 days. In addition, although they reportedly adjusted for baseline PRISM score, it seems that the children who received more fluid were more ill. There is no way to know if this association is just a surrogate marker for more seriously ill children. Some children appeared to have had surgery (likely at least some of the children with bowel perforation), but no data are provided, including no data on how much fluid was given intraoperatively and if that was considered in the analysis. In addition, there is likely underlying chronic conditions in a number of these children, but no data is provided. Although invasive monitoring was done in a number of the children, no analysis of the change in parameters, such as acidosis and lactate over the 3-day period was provided. This population of children was also not typical since they had a high rate of intra-abdominal sepsis, including bowel perforation (32.9% of total with 10.1% of total population having bowel perforation). Unlike many studies in high-resource settings, this population had a high rate of positive cultures (74.7%) with gram negative (51.9%) and anaerobes (17.7%) more common. Gram positive organisms were recovered in 20.3% of children and fungus in 6.3%. They hypothesized that the exclusive use of balanced fluids (BF) for initial resuscitation in children with pediatric severe sepsis (PSS) was associated with improved survival compared with children resuscitated with unbalanced fluids (UF). Current guidelines do not make any recommendation regarding the use of NS vs. a balanced crystalloid solution like LR. Analyzed data from the PHIS database from 2004 to 2012. This data comes from 43 freestanding children's hospitals in the US. Patients were identified as have PSS based on one of the following: ICD-9 code 995.92 (severe sepsis) or 785.52 (septic shock) or an ICD-9 code for infection plus at least one code for organ dysfunction using an approach developed by Angus that was modified by Weiss. Pediatric complex chronic conditions identified from codes used to classify comorbidities. Balanced fluids (BF) defined as any recorded volume >90 mL. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included AKI, use of CRRT, hospital LOS, PICU LOS and vasoactive infusion days. Propensity score matching was used to balance groups on baseline characteristics. Other limitations to this study include the use of an administrative database with uncertain identification of PSS. PHIS data also lacks clinical details. For example, the database does not distinguish between sepsis on admission and subsequent sepsis development during the hospitalization, thus uncertain timing between when BF or UB was used compared with sepsis episode. Also, unable to determine fluid balance and volume of fluid administered. Propensity matching may introduce bias. Kortz TB, Axelrod DM, Chisti MJ and Kache S. Clinical outcomes and mortality before and after implementation of a pediatric sepsis protocol in a limited resource setting: A retrospective cohort study in Bangladesh. PLoS One. 2017; 12:e0181160. The authors recognized that compliance with pediatric sepsis algorithms improved outcome in high-resource settings, so they wanted to determine if a pediatric sepsis protocol consistent with AHA-PALS/ACCM guidelines would improve outcome. They previously were able to improve outcome in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) by implementing a treatment protocol and hoped to achieve the same with the sepsis protocol, which was implement in 2010. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at Dhaka Hospital, operated by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, which provides medical care for ~140,000 patients/year with primarily diarrheal and acute respiratory illnesses, but also treats children with sepsis. The study population was children from ages 1-59 months admitted with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Cases identified by text search of their EMR looking for "sepsis" or "septic." One year before and after the implementation of the protocol was chosen (10/25/09 through 10/25/2011). The primary author reviewed the records and reviewed notes, vital signs and lab results to determine if sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock was present using the definitions from the International Pediatric Sepsis Conference (Goldstein). Primary outcome was change in inpatient mortality after protocol implementation. Secondary outcomes included changes in rates of clinically recognized fluid overload, heart failure, respiratory insufficiency, length of hospital stay. Fluid overload was determined by the presence of any two of the following phrases in search of physician notes: fluid overload, ascites, bilateral crackles or rales, pulmonary edema, tachypnea, gallop (without hepatomegaly), peripheral edema or hepatomegaly. Heart failure defined by any of the following phrases: heart failure, cardiac failure, poor cardiac output, gallop with hepatomegaly or congestive heart failure. The protocol specifically changed their approach to delivering 20 mL/kg boluses over 10-30 mins, including children with SAM, who pre-protocol received fluid boluses over 60 min. Their records do not contain data on the duration of fluid infusion. The control period protocol for fluid bolus therapy was to give the fluid bolus over 60 min in severely malnourished children versus 10 -30 minutes in adequately-nourished children. Results: 404 charts were identified by keyword search. Of these, 76 were excluded, mostly for the term "aseptic." 328 met inclusion criteria; 143 pre-and 185 post-protocol implementation. At baseline, the populations were fairly well matched, although septic shock was diagnosed in 33% of the post-protocol group vs. 16.1% in the pre-protocol group (p=0.01). Bacteremia rates were similar: 27.3% pre-vs. 28.7% post-protocol. In the discussion, it was noted that because of the nature of the hospital, sepsis was more likely enteric in its source compared with a general hospital where malaria and respiratory infections are more common. There was a high rate of severe malnutrition (weight-for-age z-score, WAZ <-3) of 59.4% in pre-and 66.5% in post-protocol groups (p=0.32). Protocol implementation did not change compliance as 16.1% vs. 12.4% of children (pre-vs. post-protocol) received antibiotics within 60 mins and 65.0% vs. 67.6% received a fluid bolus within 60 min. Significantly more children received a blood transfusion within 60 min post-protocol: 31.9% vs. 13%. Pre-vs. post-protocol mortality was similar (32.2% vs. 34.6%, p=0.72). When just evaluating the amount of crystalloid and blood given in the children who died, the median (IQR) total volume of crystalloid were similar ( Conclusions: A guideline-based pediatric sepsis protocol did not improve outcome in a limited-resource setting and was associated with a significantly increased risk of fluid overload and heart failure, but not respiratory compromise. LOS was also increased following protocol implementation. Limitations: Case identification and complication identification based on search of notes and single investigator's classification who was not blinded to when the patient was treated. Vital signs, such as BP are uncommonly obtained. PIM2 score is a poor method to risk adjust this population since PIM2 predicted risk of mortality was about 10% of actual mortality. This likely resulted from missing lab results and the fact that high-risk PIM diagnoses are uncommon in low-resource settings. Fluid volumes of crystalloid and colloid were only available in 42/143 (29.4%) of preprotocol patients and 63/185 (34.1%) of post-protocol children. Whole blood was infused in 10 mL/kg volumes. Other limitations to this study make the results potentially biased and inaccurate. The post-protocol group had a higher PIM2 score, but this score is not well calibrated to identify risk of mortality in this population. It is possible that the post-protocol children were more ill, as suggested by the PIM2 score, and that the protocol improved their outcome. It is also plausible that implementing the protocol increased clinician awareness and categorization of children as septic in the written notes. However, it is plausible that the use of more rapid fluid administration adversely affected outcome (or failed to improve outcome) since many of the affected children had SAM. The trial comparing rapid vs. slower bolus administration (Sankar, et al) is consistent with this study: more rapid fluid administration may have an adverse effect in this population of malnourished children. The use of blood was also associated with increased mortality, which may reflect an adverse effect, but could also be biased by being used in more severely ill children since one indication for blood transfusion was the presence of septic shock. The physiologic basis for fluid bolus administration is to improve cardiac index and thus tissue perfusion. This study was designed to identify the change in CI using cardiac ultrasound obtained just before, 5 min after and then 60 min after a 10 or 20 mL/kg fluid bolus was given to children with International Consensus Conference sepsis (not shock). An increase of CI >10% following the fluid bolus is considered "fluid responsive." This was a prospective observational study in the ED at Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne which has >90,000 visits/year. It is registered with the AUS-NZ Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12614000824662). Enrollment depended on availability of the study investigator who was not involved in the patient's care. Inclusion was sepsis diagnosis and clinician decision to give a fluid bolus, which was rapidly infused by pressure bag or push-pull method. All boluses were NS. Echo was read blindly by peds cardiologist; recorded LVOT diameter and velocity-time interval (VTI) to estimate stroke volume (SV = VTI*LVOT area). CI = calculated SV*HR, which was adjusted for fever (decreased recorded HR by 10 beats/min for each 1 o C increase in temperature). Note that changes in VTI ("stroke distance") are assumed to reflect changes in the SV since they did not remeasure the LVOT diameter after the fluid bolus. (3.21-5.48 ), but at 60 min after FB it was 3.54 L/min/m 2 (-6.0%, -15.2 to 3.0%). For those boluses of 20 mL/kg the median IQR change at 5 mins was from 3.65 (2.87-4.6 ) to 4.52 (3.21-5.70 ), a median of 19% (9.55% to 31.15%). Again, at 60 min it was back to BL: 3.61 (2.65-4.10) , representing a change of -4.0% (-16.0 to 3.6%). Complete hemodynamic data are not provided, including in the supplements. Median HR was 168 (IQR, .7), representing a 6.8% increase in "SV," but the HR was lower. Only 31/49 (63%) of fluid boluses resulted in a >10% increase in CI at 5 min, thus less than 2/3 were fluid responders. This was sustained in only 4/31 (13% of initial fluid responders). Overall, 1 patient died by 28-days (2% mortality); median hospital LOS was 93 hours (48 -210) with ICU LOS for the 15 (37%) patients needing PICU admission was 97 (52-167 hours). 5 children (12%) required vasoactive drug support; 9 (22%) needed invasive ventilation and 8 (20%) had non-invasive ventilation. They note that they cannot rule out the possibility that there would have been a greater reduction in CI at 60 min due to disease progression if the fluid bolus was not given. This study suggests that a fluid bolus only has a transient effect, but I think the analysis is potentially biased by few children who had a relatively high CI at BL. Note that only 37% required PICU admission. The fall in HR after the fluid bolus suggests that the children were physiologically less stressed and explains much of the decrease in CI. Overall CI is measured by ultrasound and we don't know what changes, if any, in regional blood flow occurred, but it appears that the patient's endogenous SNS response was lower. In addition, what happened to the patient's temperature following the one-hour infusion? If it went down, there would be a smaller HR adjustment, however, temperature may have continued to go up. It would also be interesting to know what this type of study would show in a child with rotavirus-induced dehydration for example. Would CI increase and stay higher? It likely depends on how dehydrated the patient was. The observed change in STI at 60 min following the bolus suggests there was a persistent improvement in the SVI, but not more than 10% of the baseline value. There is little new information to inform clinicians on the role of fluid resuscitation after reviewing the evidence on the role of restrictive vs. liberal fluid resuscitation, balanced vs. unbalanced crystalloid, or colloid vs. crystalloid resuscitation in children with severe sepsis/septic shock. Although the number of patients is large, retrospective analysis of administrative databases is limited by the absence of important information and is only useful for generating a hypothesis and establishing the need and clinical equipoise for a prospective, randomized clinical trial. There was a consistent observation in three published trials (one retrospective cohort and two RCTs) that there is an adverse effect seen with large volumes of fluid given rapidly. The observations in the RCT by Sankar{Sankar 2017 e435} comparing 5-10 minute vs. 15-20 minute crystalloid bolus infusion adds evidence to the concern that aggressive fluid resuscitation is harmful. The pilot project by Inwald et al{Inwald 2019 421} from England was too small to yield significant effects, but there was a strong trend towards a need for more ventilation and vasoactive drug support in children randomized to 20 mL/kg fluid boluses. The retrospective analysis of a cohort of children treated in Bangladesh also observed increased adverse effects when fluid was given more rapidly and in a larger volume, but this study may be illustrative of the adverse effects of rapid fluid administration in children with significant malnutrition since weight-for-age z-score was <-3 in 60-65% of the children in the two groups.{Kortz 2017 e0181160} Their observation is supported by the trial (not reviewed) comparing moderate to large blood transfusions in under 3 hours in an African population similar to the FEAST trial who had significant anemia (<6 g/dL) with clinical symptoms (respiratory distress and/or altered mental status), most often complicating malaria and/or sickle cell disease.{Maitland 2019 420} Febrile children randomized to 30 mL/kg of whole blood had a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with those randomized to 20 mL/kg, whereas the converse was true in the afebrile children. Of note, most of the studies were performed in limited-resource settings, making it difficult to generalize treatment recommendations. In high resource settings, trials of balanced vs. unbalanced crystalloid bolus typically select for children who had received at least one 20 mL/kg bolus of fluid. Thus, there may be a population of children with early sepsis who respond to initial fluid resuscitation and do not require further aggressive therapy. Further complicating the analysis of these studies and limiting the ability to combine results together is the lack of a gold standard definition for septic shock. Various definitions are used; most often the international pediatric sepsis consensus guidelines{Goldstein 2005 2}, but these guidelines were intended to help randomize children in a clinical trial and were never designed as a tool to recognize shock. Furthermore, the vital sign thresholds in these guidelines are not evidence-based. Thus, defining shock as having a blood pressure less than this threshold or the PALS threshold is not evidence based. Moreover, blood pressure is not often available in limited resource settings and the current widespread use of oscillometric blood pressure devices adds another layer of complexity to the analysis since these devices are not accurate at lower blood pressures.{Alpert 2014 930; Holt 2011 e391} Finally, it is important to recognize that the historical indication for the safe use of rapid, large volume resuscitation was predicated on results obtained in children presenting with community-acquired bacterial infections from H. influenza and pneumococcus that have largely disappeared with effective immunization programs. Thus, the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of children with severe sepsis and septic shock today are likely substantially different, especially when considering the delay in clinical presentation in many limited resource settings. In summary, defining the role of fluid bolus therapy as part of the protocol for treating sepsis and septic shock must take into account the local context. It is highly unlikely that a consistent approach is appropriate in all settings. Clearly, the data from Africa, India, Bangladesh and other resource-limited settings suggest that children experience a worsening of their clinical symptoms are difficult to treat without the resources available in high-resource settings, such as non-invasive and invasive ventilation. Thus, a more cautious approach is appropriate, perhaps especially if the child is significantly malnourished. It is important to recognize that the bulk of sepsis mortality in limited resource settings results from complications associated with or caused by malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, malnutrition, limited access to care and late presentation. Even in high-resource settings, avoiding excessive fluid administration is important to limit the risk of AKI, respiratory failure and possibly MOSD and mortality. Other factors to consider in making treatment recommendations is the availability of resources, both personnel and equipment. The ILCOR treatment recommendations state: "We suggest using an initial fluid bolus of 20 mL kg −1 for infants and children with shock, with subsequent patient reassessment, for patients with the following disease states: • Severe sepsis (weak recommendation, low quality). • Severe malaria (weak recommendation, low quality). • Dengue shock syndrome (weak recommendation, low quality). We suggest against the routine use of bolus intravenous fluids (crystalloids or colloids) for infants and children with a "severe febrile illness" and who are not in shock (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Reassessment, regardless of therapy administered, should be emphasized so that deterioration is detected at an early stage." I suggest that an initial fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg -1 is still appropriate in high-resource settings, but I think very rapid (push pull in <15 min) administration may only be indicated when there is overt hypotension (or absence of pulses with altered mental status in the absence of a blood pressure device). Subsequent boluses based on "patient reassessment" leads to another dilemma: what are the best methods to detect if too much fluid is being given? The presence of rales and detection of hepatomegaly require a certain level of clinical skill and may be late findings. In adults, fluid responsiveness may be assessed by raising the legs, but this is not likely to be helpful in young children. Even in the PICU, there is limited data regarding which signs are reliable indicators of fluid responsiveness. Since it appears that much of the fluid bolus does not stay in the vascular compartment and does not achieve a sustained increase in cardiac index{Long 2018 513} it may be appropriate to focus more in using an approach similar to the accepted approach used in dengue patients-get the patient out of overt shock and then give smaller and slower boluses based on careful clinical reassessment. Thus, it may be appropriate to recommend that following the initial 20 10 mL/kg -1 bolus, subsequent boluses of 10 mL/kg -1 are suggested over 15-20 minutes with patient reassessment. This will reduce the rate of fluid administration and may avoid transient, marked increases in hydrostatic venous and capillary pressure that will rapidly move fluid from the intravascular to extravascular compartments. Hopefully, data from the SQUEEZE trial will provide more objective data. Finally, we don't know when vasoactive drug support is best added to support the circulation instead of more fluid resuscitation; if needed, we don't know which vasoactive agent should be used. These findings illustrate the difficulty of determining guidelines when the largest trial does not conform with current practice, although that may be changing. Most guidelines are based on low-level evidence. The following table provides more detail on the sepsis guidelines from various organizations: STEP 0: identification of high-quality reviews (as evaluated by AMSTAR 2), guidelines (as evaluated by AGREE 2) or existing ILCOR COSTR (2010 or later) that concern directly the population and intervention described above.

L., et al. (2017) (Davis, Carcillo et al. 2017) reiterates the importance of early intubation but does not specify timing other than "early." (Agree with reviewer comments from 2010). Recommendations at that time appear to be based on above data and expert consensus. From 2010, "some experts (Pollard, Nadel et al. 2007) , in an article discussing their personal management of meningococcal disease, proposed to change the time at which elective tracheal intubation is recommended, suggesting that intubation be performed if shock persists after 40-60 ml/kg of volume resuscitation instead of the 40 ml/kg previously recommended. Gray (Gray, Gour et al. 2007) argued that although early intubation in fluid refractory septic shock is desirable, the trigger for tracheal intubation should not be based solely on the volume of resuscitation fluid administered; the trigger should be based on clinical need. Russell (Ross Russell, Morley et al. 2008 ) pointed out that is important that the cardiovascular benefits of intubation are considered as well as the respiratory benefits, and anecdotally commented that waiting until the patient is moribund is too late."

It was considered of low quality due to very limited rigour (domain 3) and limited stakeholder involvement (domain 2). Considering the current absence of paediatric direct evidence, we cannot advice for or against the use of any specific vasoactive drug, nor to change the current guideline as such. The existing evidence is also too limited to advocate for any more thorough evidence evaluation by systematic review. The decision making around which vasoactive drugs to use as first-or second line is complex and likely there are differences between patient groups (interms of both etiology and physiologicalcardiocirculatory responses).Theindividual treatmentstrategy therefore shouldbe tailoredtotheindividualpatientandtitratedtospecifictargets.Goodknowledgeoftheactivity andeffectsofeachofthe vasoactivedrugs at different doses is imperative and might guide treatment choices.  There were a few studies that addressed PH in the post-operative state for children with CHD, but NONE of them included interventions/management, specifically to avoid acidosis or hypoxia (this should probably be changed to hypoxemia, I am not sure hypoxia is the word we want here) as outlined in the PICO question. I do not think this meets criteria for a formal review but based on the literature, there is clearly an opportunity to address this PICO in future research. This review focuses only on the data from 2015 through present. In summary, Chau's article has an excellent risk stratification proposal and Avila-Alvarez's review article outlines some evidence for the use of iNO in the peri-operative care of CHD patients at high-risk for PH-related issues. From what I could find, though, there were no articles in this search that specifically addresses whether attention/treatment towards hypoxia or acidosis results in improved outcomes for post-op CHD patients who are at high risk for PH/PH crisis. It may be worth revisiting the PICU question itself---I do not think it is reasonable for the 'C' in this PICO to be 'no post-operative' care---that just does not happen. A more appropriate question might be: Among infants and children with pulmonary hypertension at high risk for pulmonary hypertensive crises (P), what additional post-operative care/medications/monitoring or interventions (I), compared with routine post-operative care (C), reduce the incidence of post-op PH crisis, cardiopulmonary arrest and/or mortality (O)?

This evidence update process is only applicable to PICOs which are not being reviewed as ILCOR systematic and scoping reviews. 1° endpoint: This PICO question was addressed in the 2018 AHA Statement on CPR in Infants and Children with Cardiac Disease. Notably, they based their recommendation on a previous joint statement of the AHA and American Thoracic Society (ATS) ("Pediatric Pulmonary HTN: Guidelines from the AHA and ATS" (2015)). The search criteria of the 2018 statement was not entirely clear, but the 2015 statement was based on a systematic search performed on May 10, 2011. Therefore, the above search was limited to results from this date (5/10/2011) onwards and the references from both of the above guidelines were then added below as well. There have been no new high-quality studies addressing this PICO question, specifically whether or not any PHdirected therapies are superior to standard supportive therapies for acute PH in children. Worksheet author(s): Dianne Atkins, Arielle Levy Council AHA Date Submitted: Recommendations-For infants and children with SVT with a palpable pulse, adenosine should be considered the preferred medication. Verapamil may be considered as alternative therapy in older children but should not be routinely used in infants. Procainamide or amiodarone given by a slow IV infusion with careful hemodynamic monitoring may be considered for refractory SVT. MEDLINE: "Supraventricular Tachycardia" or "Paroxysmal Atrial Tachycardia" Limited to: 2003 to current, further limited to "All Child (0-18 years)" -512 hits.  Since 2010, 6 articles were identified that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All are retrospective observational studies. None directly compared adenosine to other intravenous drugs. Three articles found that intravenous adenosine is highly effective (64%-90%) at terminating SVT in children with the first 2 doses and with minimal adverse events. Several articles looked at a variety of drugs for the treatment of adenosine-resistant SVT. Most commonly these included procainamide, amiodarone and the newly released intravenous preparation sotalol. Procainamide and amiodarone are both moderately effective at terminating resistant SVT, with procainamide performing better than amiodarone in one study. Although the initial reports on intravenous sotalol are encouraging, experience with this drug outside of ICUs and with pediatric cardiac electrophysiology oversight is extremely limited. There is no indication to change the 2010 guideline for acute treatment of SVT.  Consensus on Science-There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of electric therapy over drug therapy or the superiority of any drug for the emergency treatment of unstable VT in the pediatric age group. Treatment Recommendation-It is reasonable to use synchronized electric cardioversion as the preferred first therapy for pediatric VT with hypotension or evidence of poor perfusion. If drug therapy is used to treat unstable VT, amiodarone may be a reasonable choice, with careful hemodynamic monitoring performed during its slow delivery.

Synchronized cardioversion was performed on 3 patients, 2 patients with unstable SVT, and 1 with refractory SVT Since 2010, 9 articles were identified that fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All are retrospective observational studies. None directly compared cardioversion to other intravenous drugs. Few pediatric patients with refractory SVT or unstable SVT or VT are included in the studies, because the incidence is quiet low. Several articles looked at a variety of drugs for the treatment of adenosine-resistant SVT. These include procainamide, amiodarone and sotalol. Procainamide and amiodarone are both moderately effective at terminating resistant SVT. In refractory cases, there is currently insufficient data to support the use of IV Sotalol for terminating SVT when other antiarrhythmic drugs fail, when cardioversion fails or for unstable tachyarrhythmias, although there are emerging studies demonstrating its safety and effectiveness. Prior consultation with a pediatric cardiologist for sotalol use and close monitoring of QTc and heart rate is required following administration of IV sotalol. There is no indication to change the 2010 guideline for treatment of unstable VT or SVT.

Overall survival to discharge among patients with subsequent VF/VT (developed at some points of the resuscitation) was also worse than survival in patients who never developed subsequent VF/pVT. An event duration of more than 15 minutes was also associated with worse course. Newborns, infants, and children who were younger than 8 years and received CPR that was initiated for bradycardia with pulses and poor perfusion had improved survival to discharge but no difference was observed for children who were older than 8 years. -Harm by performing CPR is discussed in the PICOST on recognition of cardiac arrest.

It is likely that hypoxic cardiacarrestpatientshavealreadysufferedveryseverehypoxicbraindamagebythetimeofcardiacstandstill. Inarrested heart organdonors, after withdrawal oflife-sustaining care, the first observedphysiologicalsteps are desaturation and hypoperfusion preceding bradycardia. This phase preceding terminal deterioration may last between a few minutes to 3 hours. Bradycardia only occurs during a final terminal phase and precedes death only by minutes. The studies of Khera (Khera 2019, 370) and Donoghue (Donoghue 2019 (Donoghue ,1541 showed that children who received CPR for bradycardia with pulses and poor perfusion had better outcomes than children who suffered immediate cardiac arrest (asystole or PEA) and received CPR. Altogether, outcomes were the best in the population of children who became bradycardic, received CPR butnever became pulseless. The longerthetimebetween theinitiationof CPR for bradycardiawithpulse and poor perfusion and the actual loss of pulse, the lower the chance of survival. There are currently no publications discussing the initiation of chest compressions in children with a very low-flow shock state but without bradycardia (including for instance supraventricular tachycardia). Theevidencebaseislimited,however-giventhatthishasnotyetbeenevaluatedatanypointinthelast15years-thecurrent lack of any formal 'COSTR' could be an argument for a formal review.

Repeat dose in 5 min, if no response (maximum total dose, 1 mg for child and 2 mg for adolescent). Exclusion criteria: infants with a history of heart disease, any condition predisposing to arrhythmia, obesity (>95th percentile for age) and those taking a medication known to influence the heart rate (eg, anticholinergics) None of the infants in this study developed bradycardia, a decrease in heart rate<80%ofbaseline,adecreaseinheartrateto<80bpmoradecreaseto <60 bpm at any time after atropine, although the heart rate did transiently decrease below baseline in three infants. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, haemoglobin oxygen saturation and end-tidal pCO2 did not change substantivelyfrombaseline. Noadverse eventsoccurred duringthisstudy. Themean(95% CI) dose of atropine was 40.9 (37.3 to 44)  Although this study did not establish the minimum dose of atropine that preventsortreatsbradycardia inyoung infantsand children, we foundthat5 µg/kg IV atropine is the ED50tocauseatachycardia(>20% above the baseline) in infants anaesthetised with sevoflurane. -The use of atropine for (emergency) intubation is further elaborated in a separate PICOST and will not be repeated here -Theuse ofatropine inthetreatment of specific intoxications is beyond thescopeofthecurrent PICOST -Theadult guidelines onthe Evaluationand Management ofPatients with Bradycardia andCardiac Conduction Delay in 2018 (Kusumoto 2018 e382; ACS/AHA) identified a place for atropine in among other in patients with hemodynamically unstablesinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, with anaesthetic induced sinus bradycardia or other causes of bradycardia. In patients with sinus bradycardia, atropine at dosages of 0.5 to 2 mg usually enhances automaticity, but in rare cases can be associated withintra-atrialre-entry andorsinuspauses.Thesinoatrialnoderesponsetoatropineis bimodal, lower doses (usually <0.5 mg) are associated with slower rates and acceleration with higher doses. In addition, the authors specifically recommend not to use Atropine in case of bradycardia after heart transplant. -A Chinese adult animal study evaluated the use of atropine in hypoxic bradycardia (Qian 2012 1070) and found that atropine, althoughtemporarily improving the decrease of heartrate, decreases MAP and accelerates the occurrence of cardiac arrest. -Sandhu et al (Sandhu 2010 258.e5) finally presented a case report of an 82y old woman with TakoTsubo cardiomyopathy. She complained of worsening chest pain and developed new T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram after having received a dose of atropine. Although the pathogenesis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not completely understood, catecholamine-mediated myocardial stunning due to enhancedsympathetic activity is themostwidely acceptedunderlying mechanism.Thewithdrawalof parasympatheticdriveinsuchcasesshouldexacerbatesympatheticactivity, leadingtothe genesisor worsening of diseaseactivity -Therisksofatropineinhigherdoses,whetherornotaspartofinductionmedication,hasbeen describedinseveral'neonatal'papers(Blanc19941,Gillick1974793,Oei2002146). There isno new published evidence that would suggest changes to the 2010 recommendations or warrant a new formal review. Historically, a minimum dose of atropine of 0.1 mg has been recommended to avoid paradoxical decreases in heart rate seen at low dosages. A recent observational study in infants could however not confirm this for doses as low as 5 mcg/kg. A significant increaseinheartratewasseenwithin5minutesof thislowdose,tachycardiadevelopedinhalfofallchildrenandlastedfora fewminutes.Moreover,several'neonatal'publicationshighlightedthe potentialfor'overdose'inchildrenweighinglessthan 5kg when a minimum dose of 0.1 mg would be applied.  Included studies do not have a comparator group and have extremely small number of patients (1 and 3, respectively) who had refractory bradycardia requiring pacing. Both studies are primarily in adult patients, with unknown paced patient's age in 1 st study and the 2nd study's paced patients were not <18 years. Consensus on Science-In 4 LOE 4 studies624-627 14% to 35% of young patients with sudden, unexpected death had no abnormalities found at autopsy. In 7 LOE 3 studies628-634 mutations causing channelopathies occurred in 2% to 10% of infants with sudden infant death syndrome noted as the cause of death. In 1 LOE 3635 and 2 LOE 4636,637 studies 14% to 20% of young adults with sudden, unexpected death had no abnormalities on autopsy but had genetic mutations causing channelopathies. In 4 LOE 4 studies,638-641 using clinical and laboratory (electrocardiographic, molecular-genetic screening) investigations, 22% to 53% of first-and second-degree relatives of patients with sudden, unexplained death had inherited, arrhythmogenic disease. Recommendation-When sudden unexplained cardiac arrest occurs in children and young adults, a complete past medical and family history (including a history of syncopal episodes, seizures, unexplained accidents/drownings, or sudden death) should be obtained and any available previous ECGs should be reviewed. All infants, children, and young adults with sudden, unexpected death should, if possible, have an unrestricted, complete autopsy, preferably performed by pathologists with training and expertise in cardiovascular pathology. Consideration should be given to preservation and genetic analysis of tissue to determine the presence of a channelopathy. It is recommended that families of patients whose cause of death is not found on autopsy be referred to a healthcare provider or center with expertise in cardiac rhythm disturbances. Selected articles for review included those with sudden death and genetic screening for channelopathy (56 articles) Evidence table contain studies reporting genetic evaluation in the context of channelopathy with a focus of utility of family screening (7 articles) There were no randomized trials evaluating the benefit of family screening for channelopathy in failed resuscitation. Thus the evidence is constructed using the utility of genetic screening in identifying "actionable information" or "genetic information" that may useful in the diagnosis and prevention of SD in relatives. We also included the yield of genetic screening in families and relatives regardless of whether a benefit was demonstrated. Types of genetic testing, yield of screening, specific genes screened, interpretation of genetic mutations, and assigning pathogenicity to mutations and variants varied widely among centers and in the published article. It is important to consider these issues in the interpretation of genetic screening and issuing recommendations for routine screening. Furthermore, genetic screening recommendations and interpretation requires the oversight of a cardiac genetics or inherited heart disease expert. 1. This evidence update process is only applicable to PICOs which are not being reviewed as ILCOR systematic and scoping reviews. This study shows that the yield for a positive diagnosis is low, and may require a systematic approach Class 11b Type: intervention Study Designs: STEP 0: identification of high-quality reviews (as evaluated by AMSTAR 2), guidelines (as evaluated by AGREE 2) or existing ILCOR COSTR (2010 or later) that concern directly the population and intervention described above.

Equally, for STEP 2, in case of a high-quality review, guideline or COSTR, search can be limited to beyond dates and/or scope of that  One pediatric LOE 4 study264 observed no difference in the rate of ROSC between antero-lateral and anterior-posterior electrode positions for shock delivery. One pediatric LOE 2 study, 256 2 adult LOE 5 studies, 265, 266 and 1 LOE 5 animal study263 demonstrated that transthoracic impedance is not dependent on pad position. Transthoracic impedance was increased in 1 adult LOE 5 267 study by placing the pads too close together and in 1 LOE 5 260 study when the pads were placed over the female breast. Additionally, 1 adult LOE 5 268 study showed that placing the apical pad in a horizontal position lowers transthoracic impedance. There is insufficient evidence to alter the current recommendations to use the largest size paddles/pads that fit on the infant or child's chest without touching each other or to recommend one paddle/pad position or type over another. There are limited stud es comparing self-adhesive defibrillation pads (SADPs) with paddles in pediatric cardiac arrest. One pediatric LOE 4264 study demonstrated equivalent ROSC rates when paddles or SADPs were used. One LOE 5 269 adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest study suggested improved survival to hospital admission when SADPs rather than paddles were used. One adult LOE 5 270 study showed a lower rate of rhythm conversion, and 1 small adult LOE 5 271 study showed at least equivalent success with the use of SADPs in comparison with paddles in patients undergoing cardioversion for atrial fibril-lation. Two adult LOE 5272,273 studies showed equivalent transthoracic impedance with SADPs or paddles. One adult LOE 5 266 and 2 LOE 5 animal 274, 275 studies showed that SADPs had a higher transthoracic impedance than paddles. One LOE 4276 study described difficulty with fitting self-adhesive pads onto the thorax of a premature infant without the pads touching. One LOE 5277 study demonstrated the improved accuracy of cardiac rhythm monitoring follow-ing defibrillation using SADPs compared with the combination of paddles and gel pads. Using standard resuscitation protocols in simulated clinical environments, 1 LOE 5 278 study found no significant difference in the time required to deliver shocks using either SADPs or paddles, and 1 LOE 5 279 study found no significant difference in time without compressions when SADPs or paddles were used. Either self-adhesive defibrillation pads or paddles may be used in infants and children in cardiac arrest. • Pad*; paddle*; placement; impedance; either as individual term (ti,ab,kw)  Key findings per topic: Theme 1: the use of self-adhesive pads vs paddles. Position the cardiac monitor leads or self-adhesive pads soon as possible to enable differentiation between a shockable and a non-shockable cardiac rhythm. Defibrillation paddles can be used to determine a rhythm if monitor leads or self-adhesive pads are not immediately available. Theme 2: size of pads and paddles. Select the largest possible available paddles to provide good contact with the chest wall. The ideal size is unknown but there should be good separation between the pads. Recommended sizes are: • 4.5 cm diameter for infants and children weighing <10 kg • 8-12 cm diameter for children weighing >10 kg (older than one year) To decrease skin and thoracic impedance, an electrically conducting interface is required between the skin and the paddles. Preformed gel pads or self-adhesive defibrillation electrodes are effective and are recommended for maximal delivery of the energy. Self-adhesive pads facilitate continuous good quality CPR. Do not use saline-soaked gauze/pads, alcohol-soaked gauze/pads or ultrasound gel. Theme 3: placement and location. Apply the paddles firmly to the bare chest in the antero-lateral position, one paddle placed below the right clavicle and the other in the left axilla. If the paddles are too large and there is a danger of charge arcing across the paddles, one should be placed on the upper back, below the left scapula and the other on the front, to the left of the sternum. This is known as the antero-posterior position and is also acceptable. Observational, prospective; n=48 children with VF or pulseless VT who received external shock (IHCA) Results primary endpoints (P value; OR or RR; & 95% CI) ROSC occurred in 37 (48%) of 48 'shockable' resuscitative episodes (61 events). Pads in an anteroposterior position achieved highest ROSC rate. ROSC was achieved with pads in A-P position at 10 (91%) of 11 episodes and in A-L position in 23 (70%) of 33 episodes, with paddles in A-L position in eight (80%) of ten episodes and in A-P position in two (100%) of two episodes (p 0.6). Whatever position, the prevalence of ROSC was not significantly different with pads or paddles. Prospective, observational; n=152 Emergency medical care providers from 6 medical fields Results primary endpoints (P value; OR or RR; & 95% CI) Survey before education: The rates of correct pad placement for mannequins weighing less than 15 kg and more than 15 kg were 5.8% (95% CI, 2.8%-11.2%) and 25.7%, respectively (95% CI, 19.4%-35.7%). Rates for correct pad placement (<15-kg and >15-kg mannequins) 6 months after education: 68.2% (95% CI, 56%-78.4%) and 71.2% (95% CI, 62.8%-81.5%). Paediatric emergency providers have poor understanding of pad placement, but this improves with education. Prospective, observational; n=68 Paediatric providers (50 nurses, 18 non-nurse) were 'video' evaluated for time-to-shock in a simulated VF Results primary endpoints (P value; OR or RR; & 95% CI) The median time-to-shock was 77.5 (IQR: 59-105) s. with the use of pads and 97 (IQR: 60-122) s. with the use of paddles, and did not correlate with provider factors, except previous experience with the defibrillator used in study (p 0.047). Only 32% (22/68) providers applied the paddles/pads correctly on the mannequin. The remaining 46 providers either applied pads/paddles touching each other or not at appropriate places to allow optimum energy to pass through the heart. Prior use of the study defibrillator is associated with a significantly shorter time-to-first shock as compared to prior use of any other defibrillator or no prior use of any defibrillator. The use of self-adhesive pads is steadily increasing (because of presumed improved safety, easy of use, especially if using the AP position, presumed impact on times…) but paddles are still used in many countries across Europe and this for different reasons (both educational and economic) (Krawczyk 2016 28) . The true added value vs. cost of using self-adhesive pads in children remains to be identified. The exact best location of pads or paddles has to be balanced with the complexity of application. Also, for the AP position the alternative of midchest and midback placement (as suggested by some AED devices) needs to be further explored.

Most complications will result in VF with immediate needfor defibrillation. For this reason, patients must be continuously monitored and adefibrillator must be available in the angiography room. Self-adhesive radiolucent defibrillation pads may already be placed at the beginning of the procedure in high-risk patients. In this special setting with immediate response to monitored VF, defibrillation without preceding chest compressions is recommended. As the patient is early in the electrical phase of acardiac arrest, in contrast to the guidelines for unmonitored and OHCAs, the result of defibrillation (VF termination and ROSC) can be determined before chest compressions arestarted. If needed for failed defibrillation or immediately recurring VF, immediate defibrillation may be repeated up to two times.

However, in a (in-hospital) PICO / Research Question: Recommendation: Precautions In the victim with a perfusing rhythm but absent or inadequate respiratory effort, give 1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds (12 to 20 breaths per minute), using the higher rate for the younger child (Class I, LOE C). Year of last full review: 2010 / 2015 / New question: cannot find any full review back to 1992 GL (consensus) All AHA guidelines since 1992 ('92,'00,05,'10,15) Unable to find any applicable results; AHA Guidelines back to 1992 do not provide any references for the recommendation, likely meaning it was generated by expert consensus "intubation, intratracheal" as MESH (headings) AND "Cuffed" text word in abstract AND "Children" text word in abstract LIMITED TO 2009-2019 (As this is an update on worksheet last completed in Oct 2010)  During the last 2010 review, it was found that "Both cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes are acceptable for intubating infants and children. (Class IIa, LOE C)". Since the last review there has been 3 systematic reviews, two RCT, and one retrospective review that overall support the concept that cuffed ETTs are safe and uncuffed ETTs increase the need for tube changes. The review did not appear consider reintubation risks, goals of high quality pediatric advance life support or mechanisms of human error. By continuing to support both cuffed and uncuffed you require programs offering PALS to stock and maintain 4 tubes (2 tubes per size and type) per size, potentially increasing the need for reintubation, off the chest times during CPR or providing poor ventilation (via low tidal volume or pressure delivery) and introducing possible selection error from using the wrong calculation or selecting the wrong tube/type. MRI images have shown the cricoid ring in children is actually elliptical, rather than traditionally taught as circular. 14 Therefore, there may still be a leak around a perfectly sized a circular uncuffed tracheal tube that increase pressure on other areas of the tracheal mucosa. This may be one of the reasons uncuffed exchange rates are as high as 70% before the correct size is obtained. Cuffed endotracheal tubes are associated with a higher likelihood of correct selection of tube size, thus achieving a lower reintubation rate, quicker application of ventilation, better monitoring of ETCO2 without increase risk of complications. 1, 2, 10, 12, 13, 15 Cuffed endotracheal tubes may decrease the risk of aspiration. 16, 17 If cuffed endotracheal tubes are used, cuff inflation pressure should be monitored and limited according to manufacturer's recommendations (usually less than 20 to 25 cmH2O). For the critical outcome of likelihood/incidence of cardiac arrest, we identified no evidence that addressed the effect of atropine use for in-hospital emergency intubation on cardiac arrest. For the important outcome of likelihood or incidence of shock or arrhythmias, we identified very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision) from 2 pediatric observational studies. One study of 322 emergency pediatric intubations (Jones 2013, e289-e297) showed that the use of atropine preintubation was associated with a reduced incidence of any arrhythmia (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.06-0.35), whereas the second study of 143 emergency pediatric intubations (Fastle 2004, 651-655) failed to find an association between the preintubation use of atropine and a reduced incidence of bradycardia (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, ).

A sensitivity analysis in propensity score-matched cohorts showed cricoid pressure was associated with a higher regurgitation rate (adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; p = 0.036). The same study population was presented with another primary endpoint in another paper: To evaluate the association between external laryngeal manipulation use and initial tracheal intubation attempt success in PICUs.

In propensity score-matched analysis, external laryngeal manipulation remained associated with lower initial tracheal intubation attempt success (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.95; p < 0.001). CP was not associated with lower regurgitation rate in children in PICU. ELM was associated with lower tracheal intubation success. or persistent neurological injury. Since 2008, several themes have emerged in publications related to this topic. 1) There continues to be wide practice variation in adopting ETCO2 presence in various settings, between delivery room, ED, ICU, and prehospital settings, despite recommendations for the practice. (Foy, Langhan, Bullock, Hansen). 2) In settings where adoption has occurred, several studies have compared quantitative (colormetric) to quantitative (capnography or numeric display) with small differences in the time to achieve visible change but no change in the outcome to patients with different detection devices. (Hawkes, Langhan, Hunt, Hawkes) 3) There was one randomized controlled trial demonstrating that capnography was faster than confirmation than clinical assessment in premature infants intubated in the delivery room. (Hosono) 4) There are no randomized controlled trials linking use of ETCO2 detection with clinical outcomes, nor are there likely to be any such trials since the practice has been endorsed widely and recognized as a best practice. 5) Examining rare events through large data bases with focus on quality improvement provides a new lens for considering best practice rather than relying on clinical studies. By expanding the literature search to adverse event reporting, the value of large data base research revealed several new streams of data that confirm the strength of the recommendation for ETCO2 verification and continued usage in all environments where patient is reliant on invasive airway for respiratory support. (Cook, Hawkes). However, one database failed to show difference in outcome (delayed recognition of esophageal intubation) in the setting of academic pediatric ED when ETCO2 detection was employed.

Their design can introduce unanticipated large errors through month/year confusion. The reference table was the fastest (25 (22-28) vs 35sec (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) to 48 (43-51) s) and most preferred, but errors were made using all methods. There was no significant difference in the percentage accuracy between methods (93%-97%) but the magnitude of errors made was significantly smaller using the three APLS formulae 10% (6.5-21)  Application of the Cattermole formula based on mid-arm measurement was less accurate than other methods overall, though results were better than age-based formulae for children 6-11 years of age.  There is an inverse relationship between the accuracy of BT and body weight. An adjustment factor significantly improved BT accuracy in obese children. *This adjustment factor does require waistline measurement however  The Broselow tape measurements do not provide satisfactory results for all children in the selected population, but do provide highly correlated measurements for those children with body weights between 10 and 25 kg.  The JAPAN formula B (weight (kg) = 1.949 x age (years) + 9(1-6 years), and weight (kg) = 0.506 x (7 x age(years) -3) (7-12 years)) was more accurate than the Park or Nelson formulae for estimating weight of Japanese children (using age rather than length or anthropomorphic measurements). did not meet standards of accuracy suggested by newer literature).  Children up to 14 years of age seen for elective surgery at the University Teaching Hospital of Zambia over a 7month period. Accuracy of the Broselow method vs. agebased formulae as assessed using the Bland-Altman method for mean bias, the MPE, and the PW10 and PW20. The Broselow tape performed better than all age-based formulae to predict actual weight among a sample of malnourished Zambian children. Overall accuracy was poor, even for Broselow tape.  Most accurate method for weight estimation in Auckland children aged 5-10 years is either the novel lengthbased lookup table or the existing Broselow-Luten tape.  Use of a length-based pediatric emergency resuscitation tape in the prehospital setting was associated with significantly fewer dosing errors and faster time-to-medication administration in simulated pediatric emergencies. Kelly 2011 {Kelly 2011 Study Design secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study that has been previously reported (n=410) Inclusion Criteria stable children, aged between 1 and 11 years, with a wide variety of clinical conditions. Criteria condition was such that urgent care or resuscitation was required. To externally validate the Luscombe formula using previously collected data. Method/bias/P W10%/RMSE(kg )  Population pharmacokinetic analysis using NONEM. Covariates were TBW, BMI, LBW, age, race, sex. Excess weight covariate model including developmental weight (WTfor age and length = BMIwithout overweight x length 2 ) and excess body weight (WTexcess = TBW -WTfor age and length) Midazolam clearance in obese adolescents was significantly higher compared with morbidly obese adults and increased significantly with TBW. Peripheral Vd of morbidly obese adults increased significantly with TBW non-linearly. There was no trend observed between midazolam clearance Midazolam clearance is higher in obese adolescents compared with morbidly obese adults. Possible explanations include less obesity-related suppression of CYP3A activity in obese adolescents. WTexcess influenced clearance in obese adolescents perhaps as a result of increased hepatic size and perfusion. A new allometric model is proposed to adjust for WTexcess in obese adolescents.  Mean ICC between methods was 0.968 (95% CI 0.959-0.975). Peters method estimated higher weights than Foster or BMI method. Bland-Altman plots show good agreement between methods for children <50 kg but decreased agreement >50 kg with variation by gender. Weights generated with the BMI method demonstrate strong agreement and correlation with the Peters and Foster methods of calculating LBM in patients with ideal weights below 50 kg. Superiority of one method for calculation of IBW or LBM was not demonstrated, and therefore ease of clinical use becomes the driving factor for daily application. Of the 3 methods, the BMI method is the most feasible. Clinical caution and judgment should be used when using the BMI method in children with ideal weights above 50 kg.  Comparison of previously established PK profiles in children and adults. CL (mL/min) 1522 (vs 414 in historical normal weight children, 986 in obese adults, 718 in lean adults) Vd 635 (vs 111 in historical normal weight children) Absolute Vd was comparable to previously published studies but clearance was increased in severely obese adolescents. Author interpretation: Though these results suggest that loading dose may be based on TBW and maintenance on LBW and IBW, based on pharmacodynamics and risk for respiratory depression authors suggest current practice of bolus dosing fentanyl based on IBW  Loss of lash reflex 20 seconds after propofol administration expressed as ED95 (probability of effect = 0.95) using pooledadjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) with 95% CI. Correlation between loss of lash reflex and level of sedation, change in arterial BP from baseline and at 1 and 2 minutes after propofol. ED95 for obese and non-obese patients: 2 mg/kg (95% CI 1.8-2.2) vs 3.2 mg/kg (95% CI 2.7-3.2 mg/kg). Correlation between loss of lash reflex and unarousable state was strong (p<0.001). Both groups had a similar proportion of 10 mm Hg or more decline in BP from baseline at 2 minutes The ED95 of propofol is significantly lower in obese than non-obese children based on actual body weight. Author's interpretation: Children with BMI >95 th percentile should receive induction dose of 2 mg/kg while those with BMI<85 th percentile should receive 3.2 mg/kg  Individual clearance of study subjects compared with previously published nonobese children Compared with lean body weight and ideal body weight, total body weight was the most predictive covariate for clearance. Reviewer Comments (including whether meet criteria for formal review): Our PubMed and Ovid search yielded 379 articles related to pediatric weight estimation as well as 242 articles related to pharmacokinetics, of which 103 and 20 respectively were relevant and full text manuscripts were reviewed. For weight estimation, evidence supports parental report and estimation by body-habitus adjusted anthropomorphic measurements as the most accurate means to estimate TBW. Length-based estimates without adjustment for habitus or anthropomorphic measures show systematic bias (underestimate weight of obese, overestimate malnourished, less reliable or impractical in older children). Age-based formulae, medical provider estimates, and best guess estimates are highly inaccurate. The current 2010 recommendation states "To calculate the dose of resuscitation medications, use the child's weight if it is known. If the child's weight is unknown, it is reasonable to use a body length tape with pre-calculated doses (Class IIa, LOE C)." If the child's weight is unknown, it may be reasonable to use parental estimate or to use a body length tape incorporating an adjustment for body habitus and anthropomorphic measures such as Mid Arm Circumference (MAC), coupled with a cognitive aid to determine pre-calculated doses), however, we acknowledge significant implications of such a statement. It has taken significant knowledge translation efforts to have practitioners incorporate the Broselow Tape into their practice, and to change systems at this point may undermine this work. It should also be noted that the evidence review also highlighted consistently observed errors related to use of some systems (especially the Broselow tape) for practitioners without specific training on how to use the cognitive aid; moreover, simply estimating a weight does not eliminate errors in medication dosing or delivery without additional support for the calculation of resuscitation drug doses and volumes (e.g. supplementary reference books/apps). Regarding the question of adjustment of medications for body habitus the 2010 guidelines stated the following "It is unclear if an adjustment in the calculation of resuscitation medications is needed in obese children. Use of the actual body weight in calculation of drug doses in obese patients may result in potentially toxic doses. Length-based tapes estimate the 50th percentile weight for length (ie, ideal body weight), which may, theoretically, result in inadequate doses of some medications in obese patients. Despite these theoretical considerations, there are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of adjusting the doses of resuscitation medications in obese patients. Therefore, regardless of the patient's habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitation drug doses or use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIb, LOE C)." It should be noted that without adjusting for body habitus or the addition of anthropomorphic measures, current weight estimation strategies such as the Broselow system underestimate actual body weight but may approximate ideal body weight. Furthermore, limited pharmacokinetic studies and reviews suggest that consideration of pharmacokinetic properties of individual medications as well as developmental and compositional characteristics of children (e.g., obesity) are important considerations in determining the ideal dose for a given individual. Lipophilic medications may best be dosed on actual body weight while hydrophilic medications on ideal body weight, but there is significant individual variation and very limited data from clinical pharmacokinetic studies on obese children and none at all for underweight / malnourished children. Despite a wide range of allometric scaling approaches as well as Developmental Pharmacokinetic approaches to medication dosing, no single formula or strategy accurately reflects observed pharmacokinetics in the limited pediatric data. ST segment values compared pre-arrest vs post-arrest and arrest group compared to control group. There was no significant difference in mean unprocessed ST segment values in the arrest and control groups. Utilizing signal processing, there was an increase in ST vector magnitude (p = 0.02) and instability (p = 0.008) in the arrest group. In the paired subgroup analysis, there was an increase in ST vector magnitude (p = 0.05) and instability (p = 0.05) in the pre-arrest state compared to the post-arrest state prior to discharge. In single ventricle patients, increased ST instability and magnitude were associated with rapid response events that required intervention for cardiopulmonary arrest, whereas conventional STsegment monitoring did not differentiate an arrest from control state. Prediction of Imminent, Severe Deterioration; Rusin; 2016 Retrospective, observational 25 children with parallel systemic and pulmonary circulation admitted to Texas Children's Hospital between their early neonatal palliation and stage 2 surgical palliation. Instances of cardiorespiratory deterioration (defined as the need for CPR or endotracheal intubation). Twenty cardiorespiratory deterioration events were identified in 13 of the 25 infants. Algorithm was both sensitive and specific for detecting impending events, one to two hours in advance of overt extremis (ROC Area = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.88-0.94). Automated, intelligent analysis of standard physiologic data in real time can detect signs of clinical deterioration too subtle for the clinician to observe without the aid of a computer. This metric may serve as an early warning indicator of critical deterioration in patients with parallel systemic and pulmonary circulation. Does Single Ventricle physiology affect; Retrospective, observational 100 consecutive children requiring postoperative ECMO (2007 ECMO ( -2012 The ECMO indication was failure to wean cardiopulmonary bypass (34%) and postoperative low cardiac output (66%) including 37% having extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). In SV group, decannulation and survival rates were 55% and 32%. The SV-ECMO outcomes were best in ECPR subgroup (54%), following shunt (57%) or Norwood (46%). On multivariable analysis, factors affecting odds of survival were: ECPR in patients with SV (OR: 11.84, CI: 1.11-126.07, P = .04), ECMO is valuable in patients with SV however results depend on anatomy, procedure, and support indication. Persistent markers of poor perfusion, end-organ injury, and prolonged ECMO duration are associated with mortality. Those factors could be modified by early ECMO application before organ damage, meticulous homeostasis to ensure adequate perfusion, early diagnosis, and reoperation on residual lesions to expedite weaning. composite poor outcome included death, the need for extracorporeal support, and dialysis. In neonates (age <30 days) with single-ventricle physiology (n = 43, poor outcome = 8), a lactate increase of 0.6 mmol/L/h had near perfect discriminatory ability (AUC 0.99) with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 51%, PPV of 32%, and NPV of 100%. Postoperative lactate increase rate allows discrimination between infants at high and low risk of morbidity and mortality after congenital heart disease surgery, and the lactate level can be followed serially for the treatment response. Identification of time-dependent risks; Hoffman; 2019 Prospective database collection Hemodynamic state was classified as high CO, high SVR, low SVR, and low CO using bivariate analysis of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and somatic regional NIRS saturation (rSO2R). Association with mortality. 9614/10272 hours in 214 patients: The predominant state was high CO (46% time). Low CO state without ECMO was found in 52% of patients for 9.7% time. ECMO was employed in 24 (11.2%) patients for 10.4% time. State stability was 33%, with high SVR the least (17%) and high CO (53%) the most stable. Transition from high CO increased in hours 1-12, mainly to low SVR. Transition to low CO was 18.4%, increasing in hours 1-12, mainly from high SVR. The transition risk to ECMO was 0.32%, and 0.74% during hours 1-12, only from low CO. Both low CO and ECMO had increased mortality risk. Continuous noninvasive measurement of regional cerebral and somatic NIRS saturations in the early postoperative period can predict outcomes of early mortality and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Because outcomes were strongly determined by NIRS measures at 6 hours, early postoperative NIRS measures may be rational targets for goal-directed interventions. Reviewer Comments (including whether meet criteria for formal review): Neonates s/p Stage I repair for functional single ventricle are at increased risk of cardiac arrest both pre-operatively and post-operatively compared to non-cardiac patients, cardiac patients with bi-ventricular physiology, and patients s/p other cardiac surgical procedures of less complexity. From this evidence review, the only known modification to standard practice for this population that improves outcomes in the arrest state is the rapid institution of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support instituted in the setting of a cardiac arrest (ECPR) that is recalcitrant to standard CPR. Alfousi (2014) reports 37% of the SV group having ECPR, with decannulation and survival rates of 55% and 32%. The SV-ECMO outcomes were best in ECPR subgroup (54%), following shunt (57%) or Norwood (46%) with improved odds of survival in multivariable analysis for ECPR in patients with SV (OR: 11.84, CI: 1.11-126.07, P = .04). There are no data in the setting of HLHS receiving heparin administration during CPR for an arrest of unknown etiology (particularly if shunt blockage is suspected), however following general guidelines for significant vascular occlusion, it may be worth considering administering an intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin (dose 100 U/kg if not concurrently receiving heparin, otherwise bolus dose 50 U/kg) (based on cardiac catheter guideline recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for suspected acute shunt thrombosis). For the SV patient in the pre-arrest state, there is evidence to support the use of vasodilators such as milrinone following S1P in order to effectively decrease SVR, improved serum lactate, and decrease postoperative cardiac arrest. There is also newer data to support the analysis of standard physiologic data, including ST segment analysis, to in order to identify those SV patients at increased risk of arrest. Continuous noninvasive measurement of regional cerebral and somatic NIRS saturations in the early postoperative period can predict outcomes of early mortality and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and there is evidence postoperative NIRS measures may be rational targets for goal-directed interventions.  Optimizing outcomes after cardiac arrest for the unique population of patients with single-ventricle physiology status-post superior cavopulmonary connection (Glenn or Hemi-Fontan procedure) or bicavopulmonary connection (Fontan procedure) requires a thorough understanding of anatomic and physiologic differences between both groups as well as patients with biventricular physiologies (with or without intracardiac shunting). Conventional chest compressions provide mechanical action to a single-ventricle with resultant generation of systemic blood flow (SBF). However, in contrast to biventricular physiologies, chest compressions do not provide direct stroke volume to the pulmonary circulation in patients with either Glenn/Hemi-Fontan or Fontan circulations. In these patients, pulmonary blood flow (PBF) is dependent on passive venous return from either superior vena cava (SVC; Glenn or Hemi-Fontan) or both SVC and inferior vena cava (IVC; Fontan). Although appropriate chest compression quality via AHA recommended depth or rate will maximize systemic blood flow, limitations to PBF may require additional mechanical and/or ventilatory adjustments to address elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance, backflow of PBF into the caval circulation, and the compromising impact of positive pressure ventilation on ventricular preload. As cerebral carbon dioxide (CO2) levels play a greater role than oxygen (O2) in flow distribution in the cerebral-pulmonary arteriolar hierarchy, normoventilation or mild hypoventilation decreasing cerebral vascular resistance, thereby increasing cerebral blood flow, and preserving cerebral oxygenation in patients by with Glenn/Hemi-Fontan circulations. Chest compliance also impacts PBF during chest compressions, as adequate chest recoil results in filling of both the SVC and IVC, providing important preload to the single ventricle. Although the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is lower in the single-ventricle population palliated after the Glenn/Hemi-Fontan and Fontan procedures, survival to hospital discharge rates are lower than survival to hospital discharge for overall surgical cohorts thus demonstrating important variation in survival when stratifying by unique physiologic and/or illness categories. The use of ECMO during CPR has been demonstrated to be effective in rescue of patients who fail to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
