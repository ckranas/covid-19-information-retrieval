diseases. There may also be a list of Possible Associated Conditions. These entities are generally linked pathogenetically to the main disease entry. Any asterisk after a related disease indicates that that disorder is also listed as a disease entry. Many disease entries will be followed by a three-column table that provides the reader with a listing of the pathologic findings to be expected with the disease as well as the prosection and dissection procedures necessary to demonstrate those findings. It is expected that routine hematoxylin-eosin stains will be done on all sections submitted for histologic examination. Special stains will be recommended in the Procedures column of the tables, when indicated. Any table immediately following the two columns of disease entries always refers to the disease in the right column. Prepare smears of undiluted blood.

Edema of forehead, eyelids, and base of nose, proptosis, and chemosis indicate cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. * Trauma; craniotomy wounds. Skull fracture and other traumatic lesions. For possible intrathoracic lesions, see below under "Other organs." The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)* has authority over aircraft wreckage and the legal authority to investigate and to determine the cause of air crashes. (1) The dead are the responsibility of the medical examiner or coroner. Local police will seal off the area of the crash. Other than for the purpose of determining that death has occurred, no one should be allowed to approach the bodies or any objects until the identification teams and the medical examiner or coroner have taken charge. The sudden influx of bodies after a commercial air carrier accident and the request for speedy identification of the victims would overburden almost any institution. Managing such a disaster is eased by writing a contingency plan beforehand. Temporary morgue facilities may have to be established near the scene of the crash. Refrigerated trucks may serve as storage space. A practical approach is to deal first with those bodies that seem to be the easiest to identify, in order to narrow the field for the more difficult cases. If bodies are scattered, their locations can be referenced to stakes in the ground or spray paint on pavement; only then should these bodies (or parts) and personal effects be collected. For large-scale crashes a locations can be referenced to a string-line grid benchmarked to GPS coordinates. Records and diagrams of the relative positions of victims are prepared during this phase. If bodies are still within the airplane, their positions are recorded, and photographed. The personnel of the medical examiner or coroner can augmented by D-MORT team staffed by forensic pathologists, anthropologists, dentists, morgue technicians, and investigators supplied by the National Disaster Medical System. ** The airline will provide a list of the passengers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) disaster team will make itself available to take and identify fingerprints and aid in the acquisition of other identifying data such as age, race, weight, height, and hair color and style. If dental records can be obtained, this provides one of the most certain methods of identification. A medical history indicating amputations, internal prostheses, or other characteristic surgical interventions or the presence of nephrolithiasis, gallstones, and the like will be helpful. Fingerprints (and footprints of babies) should be taken in all instances. Wallets with identification cards,jewelry, name tags in clothing, or other personal belongings may provide the fastest tentative identification. The medical examiner may elect to autopsy only the flight crew but not the passengers of an aircraft crash. However, the grossly identifiable fatal injuries should be described, photographed, and x-rayed. This may reveal identifying body changes. If comparison of somatic radiographs, dental records, fingerprints, or photographs do not identify the victim, DNA comparison must be considered. Burned or fragmented bodies of passengers and the bodies ofcrew members, and particularly the pilots, must have a complete autopsy, including roentgenographic and toxicologic examinations, which must always include alcohol and carbon monoxide determinations. Internal examination might reveal a coronary occlusion, or roentgenograms may disclose a bullet as evidence that violence preceded the crash. In some airplane crashes, particularly in light airplane accidents, suicide must be considered. In such cases police investigation is required to determine if the pilot exhibited suicidal ideation in the recent past.. When resources permit, autopsies should be performed on all deceased occupants of aircraft crashes, including passengers, in order to distinguish among blunt impact trauma, smoke inhalation, and flash fires as causes ofdeath, and to answer future questions concerning pain and suffering, intoxication, and sequence of survivorship. After a crash victim has been identified, the coroner or medical examiner will issue a death certificate. If remains of a decedent cannot be found, a judge can, upon petition, declare a passenger dead and sign a death certificate prepared by a medical examiner. *Phone # ofNTSB Command Center: 202-314-6000 **Phone # of DMORT: 800-872-6367. entry should be followed. Usually, the circumstances that led to drowning are not apparent from the autopsy findings but can be reconstructed from reports of witnesses and the police. Because the reflex drive to seek air is triggered by hypercarbia, not hypoxia, loss of consciousness and drowning can ensue after hyperventilation and breath-holding by experienced swimmers who then drown without a struggle. There are no specific autopsy findings. A search for trauma, including a posterior neck dissection, should be made in all instances. Head and cervical injuries may be responsible for loss of consciousness and drowning, usually in individuals diving into shallow water. Toxicologic examination as described below for scuba diving accidents is always indicated. With scuba diving fatalities, investigation of the equipment and circumstances is usually more important than the autopsy. Scuba fatalities should be studied by or with the aid of diving experts-for instance, members of a diving club or shop (not the one providing the gear used by the decedent) or the U.S. Navy. (1) Careful investigation of the scene and study of reports of witnesses and the police are essential. The investigation should ascertain the site of diving (currents and other underwater hazards), the estimated depth, the water temperature (exposure to cold), and a description of water clarity. Electrocution should be considered if the site has electric underwater cables (see "Injury, electric"). Cerebral concussion should be considered if explosives were used in the vicinity. Knowledge of the method of recovery of the body and the type of resuscitation efforts can aid in the interpretation of apparent wounds. The medical history of the diving victim should be sought, as it may lead to a diagnosis for which the autopsy is typically silent, such as seizure disorder, or may reveal asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis, all of which increase the risk of air trapping and arterial air embolism. Although drowning may be the terminal event in some scuba deaths, the investigation should be focused on the adverse environmental and equipment factors that place a capable swimmer at risk of drowning (see "Embolism, air" and "Sickness, decompression"). Because scuba divers risk arterial air embolism if they ascend with a closed glottis, on can attempt to document gas bubbles at autopsy, but their interpretation is problematic: Bodies recovered immediately are subjected to resuscitation efforts, which can by themselves produce extra-alveolar air artifacts, and bodies not recovered immediately tend to be found in a putrefied condition, full of postmortem gas. In the remaining cases, the pathologist must consider the potential of introducing artifactual gas bubbles by the forcible retraction of the chest plate and by sawing the calvarium. The following procedures apply primarily to scuba diving accidents. Interrogation of witnesses is important; the behavior and complaints of the decedent, if any, might help distinguish between a natural death by heart disease and an unnatural death by air embolism. External examination Eyes and ears Head (skull and brain) Chest Blood (from heart and peripheral vessels) Heart Tracheobronchial tree and lungs A Procedures Photograph victim as recovered and after removal of wet suit and other diving gear. Record condition of clothing and gear. Impound all diving equipment for study by experts, particularly scuba tank, breathing hoses, and regulators. Residual air in tank should be analyzed. Record color of skin (including face, back, soles, palms, and scalp). Palpate skin and record presence or absence of crepitation. Record extent and character of wounds. Prepare histologic specimens. Record appearance of face (including oral and nasal cavities) and of ears. Prepare roentgenograms. If air embolism must be expected, as in the presence of pneumomediastinum, follow procedures described under "Embolism, air." For evaluation of findings, see also above under "Note." If decompression sickness (Caisson Disease) is suspected, also prepare roentgenograms of the elbows, hips, and knees. Otoscopic examination. Funduscopic examination. Save vitreous for possible toxicologic and other studies. For removal of brain, see Chapter 4. Record contents of arteries of the circle of Willis and its major branches and basilar artery.

If gas is visible in coronary arteries, photograph. Photograph and aspirate gas in heart chambers. Submit samples of heart blood and peripheral blood for toxicologic study and drug screen. Examine lungs in situ. Save bronchial washings for analysis of debris. Fresh dissection is recommended. If decompression sickness is suspected, prepare Sudan stains from fresh-frozen lung sections. Complete toxicologic sampling should be carried out (see Chapter 13). Record nature of gastric contents. Remove neck organs toward end of autopsy. For posterior neck dissection, see Chapter 4. Incise tongue. For removal, see Chapter 4. For removal, see Chapter 4. For removal, prosthetic repair, and specimen preparation, see Chapter 2. Consult roentgenograms.

Air embolism;' cerebral edema in decompression sickness. Aseptic necroses (infarcts, "dysbaric osteonecrosis"), most often in head of femur, distal femur, and proximal tibia. Infarcts indicate repeated hyperbaric exposures. Nitrogen bubbles in and about joints and in periosteal vessels ("bends") occur during rapid ascent. Related Terms: Automobile accident; motorcycle accident. NOTE: A visit to the scene can make the interpretation of the autopsy findings easier. The vehicle can also be inspected in a more leisurely fashion at the impound lot. This is particularly useful for correlating patterned injuries with objects in the vehicle. Most vehicular crashes occur as intersection crashes or because a vehicle with excessive speed left a curved road. The medical examiner or coroner should gain a basic understanding of the crash mechanism so that informed descriptions can be rendered, e.g., "Impact to the B pillar of the decedent's automobile by the front of a pickup truck which failed to stop for a stop sign at an intersection, resulting in a 2-feet intrusion into the cabin; restraint belts not employed; air bag deployed; extrication required which took 15 minutes." Police are responsible for determining mechanical and environmental risk factors for the crash and for determining some human risk factors such as suicidal or homicidal intent. The pathologist determines other risk factors for crashes such as heart disease, a history of epilepsy, and intoxication by carbon monoxide, drugs, and alcohol. Suicide as a manner of death should be considered when a single-occupant vehicle strikes a bridge abutment or a large tree head-on, with no evidence of evasive action or braking. In such a situation, the standard police traffic investigation should be supplemented of interviews of the victim's family and friends. The ambulance run sheet is an invaluable source of observations that often are not available from the police. This document should be acquired in all instances, even if the paramedics determined that death occurred and did not transport. The basic autopsy procedures are listed below. Most traffic victims who die at the scene or who are dead on arrival at the hospital died from neurogenic shock caused by wounds of the head or vertebral column, or from exsanguination from a tom vessel or heart. As such, they have little lividity, and little blood is found in the vehicles. Presence ofintense lividity may indicate suffocation or heart disease as a cause of death. If postural asphyxia is suspected, the first responders to the scene should be interviewed to determine the position of the decedent in the vehicle, and the vital signs, ifany, ofthe decedent from the time of the crash to the time of extrication. Posterior neck dissection is indicated in these instances. If manifestations of heart disease, intense lividity, and absence oflethal wounds suggest that a crash occurred because the driver was dead, other drivers on the road may have observed that the victim was slumped at the wheel before the crash. The determination of heart attack at the wheel is usually simple, because most such victims realize that something is wrong, and bring the vehicle to a stop at the side of the road, or coast gently into a fixed object. In such instances, damage to the vehicle is minor, and wounds to the decedent are usually trivial. While pattemed wounds can often be matched to objects (see below), patternless wounds usually cannot be visually matched to specific objects, although an opinion can sometimes be given as to what object was struck, based on the direction of motion and position ofthe body with respect to the vehicle. Impacts with the A-pillar produce narrow vertical zones of facial laceration and fractures extending from forehead to jaw. Tempered glass shatters into small cubes on impact, and leaves so-called "dicing" wounds, which are abraded cuts arranged in a somewhat rectilinear pattern. Windshield glass leaves shallow, abraded, vertically oriented cuts on the face or scalp. With pedestrians, the lower extremities are of particular forensic interest, to determine the height and direction of impact from vehicles that left the scene. Scalp hair and blood should be collected from such "hit and run" victims and from occupants of a suspect car if police have a question as to which occupant was the driver; these exemplars can be compared to fibers and tissue recovered from the vehicle in question. Likewise, foreign material in wounds can sometimes be matched to suspect vehicles, and should be sought and retained as evidence. For pedestrians, the distance between the impact point on the lower extremities and the soles of the feet should be recorded. The legs should be opened to inspect tibial fractures; cortical fractures initiate propagation opposite to the side of impact, where they usually have a pulled-apart appearance, and then splinter the cortex at the side of impact. Abrasions are better impact markers than contusions, because subcutaneous blood extravasation can be caused not only by impact to the skin, but also from blood extravasating from underlying fractures. If no cutaneous abrasions or fractures of the leg bones are found, the skin of the legs should be incised to expose contusions. Fracture descriptions should include location in the bone (e.g., proximal metaphysis or shaft), whether the fracture is complete or incomplete, and whether the fracture is displaced or distracted. Lacerations of intervertebral disks, facet joint capsules, and ligamenta flava should not be loosely termed "fractures." The presence or absence of blood extravasation in soft tissue adjacent to the fractures should be recorded, and its volume estimated if it appears severe enough. Venous air embolism from tom dural sinuses cannot be diagnosed without a pre-autopsy chest radiograph or an in situ bubble test. If an X-ray machine is readily available, an anterior-posterior chest radiograph should be obtained in every traffic victim who dies at the scene or after a failed resuscitation attempt. If a hemothorax is suspected, the rib cuts should be placed further lateral and the chest plate reflected so that the internal mammary vessels can be inspected before the chest plate is removed. After measuring and removing the bloody effusion, the underlying serosal surfaces should be inspected for defects. Lacerations of the heart and aorta will be obvious. Tamponaded lacerations of the aorta, around which the adventitia still holds, must be noted as such. If no lacerations are found at the usual sites, lacerations of the azygous veins must be considered, especially in association with fracture dislocations of the thoracic vertebral column; other sites are the internal mammary arteries, especially with fractures of ribs I and 2 or of the sternum, and intercostal arteries with displaced rib fractures. Only after the serosal defect is identified should the organs be removed, because that procedure creates many more holes in the serosa. For that reason, as much information as possible should be gained by in situ observation. The only evidence of concussion of the heart may be a cardiac contusion or a sternal fracture. The usual clinical history suggests cardiovascular instability that is not associated with craniocerebral trauma and which does not respond to the infusion of intravenous volume agents. The autopsy assistant may saw but should not retract the skull cap and remove the brain. The pathologist should observe in situ whether shallow lacerations of the pontomedullary junction with stretching of the midbrain are present. These lesions cannot be distinguished from artifact by examining the brain later. Thus, only after appropriate in situ inspection should the pathologist remove the brain. A posterior neck dissection is required if no lethal craniocerebral or cardiovascular trauma is found, or if suffocation is suspected; neck trauma must be ruled out to diagnose suffocation in a traffic fatality. Sudden death in a patient with seemingly trivial wounds may be caused by undiagnosed trauma of the craniocervical articulation. A posterior neck dissection is required in these instances. The diagnosis of diffuse axonal injury of the brain in victims with no appreciable survival interval requires that suffocation be ruled out and that no resuscitation from a cardiac arrest has been attempted. Clinicians are quick to apply the label "closed head injury" when a victim of a traffic crash has cerebral edema on a computerized axial tomogram of the head, even if no cerebral contusions, scalp contusions, or skull fractures are evident. This may be a misinterpretation, because cerebral edema can be caused by hypoxic encephalopathy made evident after resuscitation from a cardiac arrest, or from hypoxia caused by suffocation. Procedures Possible or Expected Findings Record presence of lividity. Photograph all external wounds; measure all lacerations and any abrasions or contusions with a pattern. Collect scalp hair and blood (see below) from victims of hit and run accidents. Collect foreign material in wounds. Intense lividity and absence of lethal wounds may indicate that the crash occurred because the driver was dead from heart disease or suffocation. Wound documentation. Patterned injuries often sometimes be matched to objects in or about the vehicle (the most common patterned wound is that from tempered glass; see above under "Note"). Impact patterns in pedestrians may help to reconstruct the accident. Hair and blood of the victim may be matched to transfer evidence on a vehicle suspected of having left the scene. PART II / DISEASES AND CONDITIONS Internal examination of body cavities Heart and great vessels Abdomen Skull and brain; neck Soft tissue compartments at any location Prepare roentgenograms of chest is cases with head impact and skull fractures. Collect samples for toxicologic study from all victims, including passengers. Create pleural window to detect pneumothorax. If blood is seen, examine internal mammary vessels (see under "Note"). Measure volume of blood in cavity bleeds, and note whether chambers of heart and great vessels are collapsed or filled. Record evidence of cardiac contusion, sprain of intracardiac inferior vena cava, laceration of pericardial sac, and fracture of sternum. Laceration of heart or great vessels (measure volume of blood). Follow routine procedures for dissection of heart and great vessels (see Chapter 3) . In situ bubble test to confirm venous air embolism. Record evidence of trauma and volume of blood in peritoneal cavity; estimated volume of blood in retroperitoneal soft tissues. Autopsy assistant may saw the skull but pathologist should inspect brain in situ and remove it personally. For removal and specimen preparation of brain, see Chapter 4. Record brain weight. Posterior neck dissection is indicated if there is no craniocerebral or cardio-vascular trauma, or if suffocation is suspected. Record evidence of trauma and estimate volume of blood. Venous air embolism.' Evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication. Pneumothorax, hemothorax, e.g., after laceration of internal mammary vessels. Evidence of significant hemorrhage. Indirect evidence of cardiac concussion. Evidence of exsanguinating wounds. Evidence of cardiovascular disease that may have felled the driver before the crash. In European countries, the concentration is expressed in promille (grams per liter). In the United States, it has become customary to refer to concentration by percentage (grams per deciliter), and values in these units have been written into legislation and included in the uniform vehicle codes. Unless qualified, the use of promille or percentage does not indicate whether the result of the analysis is weight/weight, weight/ volume, orvolume/volume. Another common way ofexpressing concentration, milligrams per deciliter, has also been used to indicate alcohol concentrations. The method ofexpressing concentration must be clearly specified whenever the alcohol level is mentioned. The desired expression canbe derived from the toxicologic report by using the following equation: I,000~g/mL =100mg/dL =0.10g/dL =21.74 mmollL =1.0 promille =0.10% What Is the Legal Interpretation of Alcohol (Ethanol) Intoxication? Objective impairment of driving ability is observed at threshold blood alcohol concentrations of .035-.040 g/dL. As of August 2005 all states and the District of Columbia have adopted laws that make it criminal offense for a driver to operate a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 g/ dL or greater. Many states have an enhanced penalty for high concentrations such as 0.15 g/dL or above. Several states have zero tolerance laws, under which drivers who are minors are legally operating only if their blood alcohol concentration is 0.02 g/dL or less, and in some states, not detectable at all. Blood alcohol concentrations obtained at autopsy are valid until putrefaction begins. Specimen tubes with sodium fluoride should be used, and the specimen should be stored in the refrigerator. If the air space above the blood samples in the container is large, alcohol can evaporate and a falsely low blood alcohol level can result. Putrefactive changes before autopsy or during storage may cause a falsely high blood alcohol concentration. Ethanol can be produced in the specimen container; this is more likely in the absence of a preservative. Because fluoride inhibits bacteria far more than fungi, higher fluoride concentrations are required for the inhibition of fungal growth (4) . Although there is no major difference in the alcohol concentrations ofblood samples from the intact heart chambers and the femoral vessels (5), autopsy samples from pooled blood in the pericardial sac or pleural cavity are unsatisfactory. We therefore recommend that blood be withdrawn from peripheral vessels. Is There Normal "Endogenous" Blood Alcohol (Ethanol) in a Living Person? Blood alcohol concentrations are generally believed to be negligible in the absence of ingested alcohol. "Endogenous" ethanol in human blood exists at a concentration of about 0.0002 g/dL, which is below the limit of detection for most methods (6) . First in such a list would be postural asphyxia, for example, in drunks who fall asleep face down. Also, depressant drugs in the tricyclic, analgesic, barbiturate, and benzodiazepine classes all potentiate the effect of alcohol (7) . Also included in such a list would be infancy and childhood; ischemic heart disease;' chronic bronchitis and emphysema;' other chronic debilitating diseases; poisoning with carbon tetrachloride' or carbon monoxide;' and other causes of hypoxia.' How Can One Estimate Blood Alcohol (Ethanol) Concentrations From Vitreous, Urine, or Tissue Alcohol Levels and From Alcohol in Stomach Contents? The ratio of serum, plasma, urine, vitreous, and various tissues has been compiled by Garriot (8) . The values may vary considerably. For vitreous, the ratios varied from 0.46-1.40. These variations may depend on whether blood alcohol concentrations were increasing or decreasing at the time of death. Most other body fluids and tissues showed ranges closer to 1. Most urine values were above the blood alcohol concentrations. In another study (9) , the blood/vitreous (BN) ratio in the early absorption phase was 1.29 (range, 0.71-3.71; SD 0.57) and in the late absorption and elimination phase, the BN ratio was 0.89 (range, 0.32-1.28; SD 0.19). Blood ethanol concentrations probably can be estimated using B =1.29V for early absorption and B = 0.89V for later phases. A urinelblood ethanol ratio of 1.20 or less indicates that the deceased was in the early absorption phase. How Can One Use Alcohol (Ethanol) Concentrations in Postmortem Specimens to Estimate the Blood Alcohol Concentration at Various Times Before Death? With certain limitations, one can base calculations of this kind on the assumption that the blood alcohol level decreases from its peak at a fairly constant rate of 0.015-Q.018g/dL/h until death (10) . If blood is not available, conversion factors (see above) must be used. Alcoholics have been reported to metabolize at a rate of up to 0.043 g/dL/h (6) . Example: The driver of an automobile drinks at a party until midnight. He leaves his host at about 1:30 a.m. and is involved in a head-on collision at 2:15 a.m. He dies in the emergency room at 6:35 a.m. There are multiple injuries and the patient exsanguinates. The autopsy is done at 1:30 p.m. Although this appears quite unlikely, let us assume that no satisfactory blood sample was obtained before death and that no blood or plasma expanders were given. If under such circumstances the alcohol concentration in the vitreous was found to be 0.157 g/dL, what was the alcohol concentration in the blood at the time of the accident? Vitreous and blood alcohol concentrations may be assumed to have remained unchanged after death. Therefore, the blood alcohol level at the time of death must have been approx 0.157 (vitreous humor alcohol) x 0.89 (conversion factor, see above) = 0.14g/dl. The time interval between the accident (2:15 a.m.) and death (6:35 a.m.) is 4 hand 20 min or 4 1/3 h. If we assume that the decedent was not an alcoholic and that the blood alcohol concentration was decreasing from its peak at a constant rate of 0.015 g/dL/h, then the concentration at the time ofthe accident is estimated to have been 0.14 (concentration at time of death) + (4 1/3 x 0.015) = 0.140 + 0.065 = 0.205 g/dL or 0.2%. The blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident could have been lower if the victim stopped drinking later than 1h or 1 1/2 h before the accident. In the latter case, the peak alcohol level would have occurred after the accident, reflecting the time to absorb the latest drink. The blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident could have been lower or higher if the time when the patient stopped drinking, the time of the accident, or the time of the death is uncertain. The blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident could have been higher if the victim was a chronic alcoholic. The elimination rate in such persons may be as high as 0.040 mg/dL, which would change the figures in our example above to 0.140 + (4 1/3 x .040) =0.140 + 0.173 = 0.313 g/d1 or 0.3%. Only rough estimates are possible. First, the peak blood alcohol level must be determined or calculated, as described in the previous paragraphs. Tables (see below) are available that relate blood alcohol level to the minimal amounts of whiskey, wine, or beer that must have been consumed (10) . However, tables of this type are often based on the minimum amount of alcohol circulating in the body after specific numbers of drinks; such tables do not yield reliable results if used conversely. Furthermore, inasmuch as drinking and elimination of alcohol may take place concomitantly, over a longer period the total amount of alcohol consumed may have been much greater than the tables would indicate. It cannot be lower. According to these tables, 6 pints of ordinary beer or 8 fl oz of whiskey would be the minimal amounts needed to produce a blood alcohol level of about 200 mg/dL in a person weighing 140-180 pounds. The total body alcohol can be calculated from the blood alcohol level by using Widmark's formula: Average concentration of alcohol in entire body = .68 Concentration of alcohol in the blood In a person weighing 70 kg, the blood alcohol concentration would be increased 50 mg/dL (0.05%) by the absorption of 1oz of ethanol (20z of 100-proof whiskey). Strength of alcohol is measured in "proof'; absolute alcohol is 200 proof. Therefore, in the United States, alcohol content as volume percent is half the proof (for example, 100-proof whiskey contains 50% alcohol by volume). The alcohol content of various beverages is shown in the following table. Approximate Alcohol Content in Various Beverages t tOata from Glaister, Rentoul E. Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, 12th ed. E & S Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1966 with permission. tWithin 1 h after consumption of diluted alcohol (approx 15%) on an empty stomach, assuming body weight of 140-180 pounds (63.6-81.7 kg) reproduced from (11) with permission. *One ounce (about 30mL) of whiskey or 120z (about 355mL) of beer. What Is the Toxicity of Alcohol Other Than Ethanol? In general, the toxicity increases as the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol increases. Thus, butyl alcohol is two times as toxic as ethyl alcohol: but isopropyl alcohol is only twothirds as toxic as isobutyl alcohol and one-half as toxic as amyl alcohol. Primary alcohols are more toxic than the corresponding secondary isomers (10) .

Saccular atherosclerotic aneurysms are more common than dissecting aneurysms, which are very rare. With congenital cerebral artery aneurysm: coarctation of aorta;* manifestations of hypertension;* and polycystic renal disease. With mycotic aneurysm: infective endocarditis;* pulmonary suppurative processes; and pyemia. Aneurysm, Dissecting Aortic (See "Dissection, aortic.")

Heart Aorta and cervical arteries Brain If infective endocarditis* is suspected, culture using the method described in Chapter 7. For dissection of carotid and vertebral arteries, see Chapter 4. For removal and specimen preparation, and cerebral anteriography, see Chapter 4.  If a foreign body is discovered during a medicolegal autopsy or if the discovery of a foreign body may have medicolegal impli-cations (e.g., presence of a surgical instrument in the abdominal cavity), the rules of the chain of custody apply. For the handling of bullets or bullet fragments, see "Injury, firearm." If analysis offoreign material is required, commercial laboratories may be helpful. Bolus (See "Obstruction, acute airway!') Burns NOTE: Fatal bums should be reported to the medical examiner's or coroner's office. The questions to be answered by the pathologist depend on whether the incident was accidental, sui-cidal, or homicidal, and whether the victim survivied to be treated in the hospital. A pending death certificate should be issued if the fire and police investigators are not sure of the circumstances at the time of the autopsy. For electrical bums, see under "Injury, electrical." For victims who were treated at the hospital, autopsy procedures should be directed toward the discovery or confirmation of the mechanism of death, such as sepsis or pulmonary embolism.* Death can be caused primarily by heart disease, with other-wise minor bums and smoke inhalation serving as the trigger that leads to lethal ventricular arrhythmia. Because carbon monoxide concentrations are halved approx every 30 min with 100% oxygen therapy, the pathologist must obtain the first clinical laboratory test results for CO-hemoglobin. Soot can be detected with the naked eye 2 or 3 d after inhalation of smoke. Ambulance records should be examined to determine whether a persistent coma might have been caused by hypoxic encephalopathy following resuscitation from cardiac arrest at the scene. Admission blood samples should be acquired to test for COhemoglobin and alcohol. This may not have been done in the emergency room. Persons suffering from chronic alcoholism succumb to fire deaths more often than persons who do not drink. A very high initial serum alcohol concentration suggests a risk factor for the fire and presence of chronic alcoholism. Patients with chronic alcoholism typically are deprived of alcohol when they are in the bum unit and this can cause sudden, presumably cardiac, death,just as it occurs under similarcircum-stances, not complicated by bums. Under these circumstances, the heart fails to show major abnormalities. This mode of dying seems to have no relationship to the presence or absence of liver disease.  If the body is found dead and charred at the scene, prepare whole body roentgenograms, before and after removal of remanants of clothing. See also under "Identification of the body" and "External examination" in Chapter 13). One or two fingerpads may yield sufficient ridge detail for identification. If this is not possible, ante-and postmortem somatic and dental radiographs must be compared for identification, or DNA comparison must be used.  External examination, heart and lungs Abdominal cavity and liver See below under "Cardiomyopathy, dilated." Record volume of ascites. Record actual and expected weight of liver. Request iron stain. See below under "Cardiomyopathy, dilated." Alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic cardiomyopathy rarely coexist. However, in genetic hemochromatosis,* cirrhosis and heart failure are common findings. Cardiomyopathy, Dilated (Idiopathic, Familial, and Secondary Types) NOTE: For general dissection techniques, see Chapter 3. External examination  Heart Other organs and tissues Record actual and expected weights. Record ventricular thicknesses and valvular circumferences. Evaluate relative atrial and ventricular chamber sizes. Procedures depend on expected findings or grossly identified abnormalities as listed in right-hand column. NOTE: Huntington's disease maps to the short arm of chromosome 4. The gene is widely expressed but of unknown function; it contains a CAG repeat sequence, which is expanded (range, 37 to 86) in patients with Huntington's disease. A sensitive diag-nostic test is based on the determination of this CAG sequence, which can be done on fresh-frozen tissue or blood (1) . In the absence of genetic confirmation, sampling of organs and tissues cannot be excessive because a complex differential diagnosis must be resolved. NOTE: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) often is a complication of obstetrical mishaps such as abruptio placentae or amniotic fluid embolism,* or it complicates malignancies (such as adenocarcinomas or leukemia*) or bacterial, viral, and other infections. Other conditions such as aortic aneurysm* or hemolytic uremic syndrome* are known causes also. Ifthe nature of the underlying disease is known, follow the procedures under the appropriate heading also. NOTE: This is a cause of diarrhea. Microscopic colitis is associated with older age; collagenous colitis is associated with female sex (1). The colon is grossly normal but microscopically, increased lymphocytes in the lamina propria and a subepithelial band of collagen is found. If only the lymphocytic infiltrate is found, the term "lymphocytic colitis" or "microscopic colitis" should be applied. A trichrome stain should be ordered in all instances, because the collagen band may be difficult to see without the special stain. I Death, Anaphylactic Synonym: Generalized anaphylaxis. NOTE: Autopsy should be done as soon as possible after death. Neck organs should be removed before embalming. If death is believed to be caused by drug anaphylaxis, inquire about type of drug(s), drug dose, and route of administration (intravenous, intramuscular, and oral or other). This will determine proper sampling procedures-for instance, after penicillin anaphylaxis. Allergy to bee stings, wasp stings, fire ants, and certain plants may also be responsible for anaphylaxis. However, envenomation also can be fatal in the absence of anaphylaxis. External examination Search for injection sites or sting marks. If such lesions are present, photograph and excise with 5-cm margin. Freeze excised tissue at -70°C for possible analysis. Prepare chest roentgenogram. Foam in front of mouth and nostrils. Swelling of involved tissue. Antigen-antibody reaction in involved tissues. Antibodies against suspected antigen. Laryngeal edema may recede soon after death. Foamy edema in trachea and bronchi; diffuse or focal pulmonary distention ("acute emphysema") alternating with collapse; pulmonary edema and congestion; accumulation of eosinophilic leukocytes. Eosinophilic leukocytes in red pulp. Death, Anesthesia-Associated. NOTE: There are many possible causes of anesthesiaassociated death that are not drug-related, such as acute airway obstruction* by external compression, aspiration, arrhythmia of a heart not previously known to be diseased, tumor, or an inflammatory process. Some ofthe complications are characteristically linked to a specific phase of the anesthesia, and many are not revealed by customary morphologic techniques. The task for the pathologist charged with investigating an anesthesia-associated death is to reconstruct the chain of physiologic events culminating in cessation of vital signs. Autopsy morphology plays a supporting role; the main investigations center around the record left by the anesthesiologist, testing of anesthesia equipment, and toxicological testing. A consulting anesthesiologist can divine much more information from the anesthesia and recovery room records than can the pathologist, and can suggest avenues of further investigation. Therefore, the most important step in these autopsies is to obtain the anesthesiaassociated records and to secure the consulting services of an independent anesthesiologist. The changes in the vital signs during and after anesthesia will help to focus the investigation toward a cardiac mechanism ofdeath or depression ofbrainstem function as a terminal mechanism. When information is gathered about drugs and chemical agents that have been administered or to which the victim may have had access, the pathologist must keep in mind that some non-medical chemicals and many drugs are known to affect anesthesia. Drugs and their metabolic products, additives, stabilizers, impurities, and deterioration products (one of which can be carbon monoxide) may be present and can be identified in postmortem tissues. Therefore, all appropriate body fluids and solid tissue should be submitted for toxicological examination. If the anesthetic agent was injected into or near the spinal canal, spinal fluid should be withdrawn from above the injected site into a standard toxicologist's collection tube with fluoride preservative. If the anesthetic agent was injected locally, tissue should be excised around the needle puncture marks at a radius of 2-4 em. Serial postmortem analysis of specimens may permit extrapolation to tissue concentration at the time of death. The time interval between drug administration and death sometimes can be calculated from the distribution and ratio ofadministered drugs and their metabolic products. For a review of anesthetic death investigation, see ref. (1) . Halothane anesthesia and some other anesthetic agents may cause fulminant hepatitis and hepatic failure. The autopsy procedures suggested under "Hepatitis, viral" should be followed. NOTE: For special autopsy procedures in postoperative deaths, see Chapter 1. In some instances, procedures described under "Death, anesthesia-associated" may be indicated. For a review of investigational procedures and autopsy techniques in operating-room-associated deaths, see ref. (1) . If the autopsy will involve anatomy or dissection techniques that are unfamiliar, the pathologist should not hesitate to invite the surgeon to the autopsy. In patients who develop a cerebral infarction after open heart surgery, arterial air embolism should be considered as a possible cause. The diagnosis often must be based on excluding other causes because the air has been absorbed prior to death. If a patient dies rapidly, the hospital records may be incomplete or scanty. For example, if a patient bleeds to death despite attempted repair of hepatic lacerations, hospital records may not suffice to reach the correct cause-of-death opinion; personal accounts from the surgeon and anesthesiologist may be needed. Autopsy data on patients dying following thoracic surgery may be found in ref (2) . D Death, Restaurant (See "Obstruction, acute airway.") Death, Sniffing and Spray Related Terms: Glue sniffing; sudden sniffing death syndrome. NOTE: No anatomic abnormalities will be noted at autopsy. Sudden death may occur after cardiac dysrhythmia or respiratory arrest. Procedures Possible or Expected Findings Lungs Brain If poison had been inhaled at the time when death occurred, tie main bronchi. Submit lungs in glass container for gas analysis. Submit samples of small bronchi for histologic study. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Submit samples of fresh or frozen brain for toxicologic study. Submit samples in glass containers (not plastic) for toxicologic study. Trichloroethane, fluorinated refrigerants, and other volatile hydrocarbons are most often involved in the "sudden sniffing death syndrome." Spray death may occur in asthma sufferers using pressurized aerosol bronchodilators. Freons and related propellants may also be responsible for sudden death. Toxic components of glue-such as toluene-accumulate in the brain of glue sniffers. Also present in various glues are acetone, aliphatic acetates, cyclohexane, hexane, isopropanol, methylethyl ketone, and methylisobutyl ketone. Aerosols may occlude the airway by freezing the larynx. Carbon tetrachloride sniffing may cause hepatorenal syndrome (see also under "Poisoning, carbon tetrachloride"). Death, Sudden Unexpected, of Adult NOTE: Medicolegal autopsies are usually indicated, and appropriate procedures should be followed. Ifanaphylactic death is suspected, see also under that heading. For all unexpected deaths, the pathologist should learn the circumstances of the death, in order to determine whether the mechanism of death was rapid or slow, and to guide the selection of ancillary tests. Whenever paramedics attended a person, the run sheet should be obtained to look for a history of recent drinking or ofchronic alcoholism may be an important clue. The combination of a history ofalcoholism, a negative test for ethanol, and absence ofcardiovascular disease, should suggest alcohol withdrawal as the cause ofa sudden death. The list of"Possible or Expected Findings" below is not complete. For general toxicologic sampling, see Chapter 13. Possible Associated Conditions: Atrial septal defect;*bicuspid aortic valve;* coarctation,* hypoplasia, or interruption (type A) of aortic arch; coronary artery from main pulmonary artery; right atrial arch; patent ductal artery;* right pulmonary artery from ascending aorta; subaortic stenosis;* tetralogy of Fallot;* ventricular septal defect. * (In approx 50% of the cases, one or more of these associated conditions are found.) Defect, Atrial Septal NOTE: The basic anomaly is a defect of the atrial septum, usually at the oval fossa (in 85%). Possible complications in unoperated cases include atrial arrhythmias, congestive heart failure; paradoxic embolism; plexogenic pulmonary hypertension «10%), and pulmonary artery aneurysm. Possible surgical interventions include surgical and transcatheter closure of defect. For Deficiency, Vitamin C Synonyms: Hypovitaminosis C; scurvy. External examination and skin Other organs Bones, joints, and soft tissues Record extent and character of skin lesions; prepare sections of skin. Describe appearance of gums, and prepare sections. Record evidence of bleeding. For removal, prosthetic repair, and specimen preparation of bones and joints, see Chapter 2. Hyperkeratotic hair follicles with perifollicular hemorrhages (posterior thighs, anterior forearms, abdomen); petechiae and ecchymoses (inner and posterior thighs); subcutaneous hemorrhages. Gingivitis. In rare instances, gastrointestinal or genitourinary hemorrhages. Hemorrhages into muscles and joints. Subperiosteal hemorrhages occur primarily in distal femora, proximal humeri, tibiae, and costochondral junctions (scorbutic rosary). Deficiency, Vitamin D Synonyms: Hypovitaminosis D; rickets. NOTE: Features or rickets may be found in familial hypophosphatemia (vitamin D-resistent rickets; Fanconi syndrome). Vitreous or blood (serum) Other organs Prepare skeletal roentgenograms. In infants with suspected rickets, record size of anterior fontanelle and shape of head; state of dentition; and shape of costochondral junctions, wrists, long bones, and spine. Submit samples for calcium, magnesium, and phosphate determination. Procedures depend on expected findings or grossly identified abnormalities as listed in right-hand column. Weigh parathyroid glands and submit samples for histologic study. Submit samples of intestine for histologic study. For removal, prosthetic repair, and specimen preparation, see Chapter 2. In infantile rickets, diagnostic sites for histologic sampling are costochondral junctions, distal ends of radius and ulna, and proximal ends of tibia and humerus. For adults, see under "Osteomalacia." In infants, rachitic changes at costochondral junctions; in adults, osteoporosis* and osteomalacia*-with or without pseudofractures (Milkman's syndrome (1) . NOTE: The term spinocerebellar degeneration encompasses a variety of lesions whose classification is controversial. A new approach has come from linkage analysis and molecular biology. For instance, Friedreich's ataxia, the classic form of hereditary ataxia, is due to an intronic expansion of a GAA tri-nucleotide repeat. Other forms are also identified by their specific gene loci. Neuropathologic examination still is important and ample sampling is suggested, which should include cerebral cortex, basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus), thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain (red nucleus and substantia nigra), pons (pontine nuclei), spinal cord (at cer-vical, thoracic, and lumbar levels), optic tract, optic nerves with lateral geniculate nucleus, and sensory and motor peripheral nerves. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 5. Enlargement of head. Poor demarcation between cortex and gelatinous white matter. Extensive demyelination and vacuolation of white matter, particularly subcortically. Optic atrophy. Degeneration, Striatonigral (See "Atrophy, multiple system.") Related Term: Thirst. NOTE: Possible underlying conditions not related to inaccessibility of water include bums, exposure to heat, gastrointestinal diseases, recent paracentesis, renal diseases, and use of diuretic drugs. See also under "Disorder, electrolyte(s)." External examination Vitreous Urine Prepare histologic sections of blisters, ulcers, or skin abrasions. Submit sample for sodium, chloride, and urea nitrogen determination. Skin turgor may be decreased and eyes may be sunken. Microscopic changes help to decide whether skin lesions are antemortem or postmortem. Sodium concentrations more than 155 meqlL, chloride concentrations more than 130 meq/ and urea nitrogen concentrations between 40 and 100 meq/dL indicate dehydration. Absence or minimal amount of urine. Dementia (See "Disease, Alzheimer's.") Drug abuse, Amphetamine(s) NOTE: Methamphetamine abuse may be suggested by poor condition of the dentition. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("Ecstasy") abuse is often suggested by friends with whom the decedent was abusing drugs. Follow procedures described under "Dependence, drug(s)." Drug abuse, Cocaine NOTE: Cocaine is spontaneously hydrolyzed by blood esterases, even after death. However, one of its major metabolite, benzoylecgonine, is routinely identifiable by immunoassay screening tests. When cocaine is abused concurrently with heroin or other depressant drugs, it may be difficult to ascribe deth to a single agent, unless circumstances clearly point to a rapid cardiac mechanism or a slow brainstem depression mechanism. NOTE: If narcotic paraphernalia and samples of the drug itself are found at the scene of the death, they should be submitted for analysis. Helpful information about the nature of a drug may be obtained from witnesses. State crime laboratories may provide much assistance. If name of drug is known, see also under "Poisoning,..." The slang name of a drug may be insufficient for identification because these names often are used for different compounds at different times of places. Opoid narcotics can be injected intravenously, or subcutaneously, or snorted. Death may occur with such speed that the bodies may be found with needles and syringes in the veins or clenched in the hands. Drug abuse may be associated with a multitude of local (see below) or systemic complications, including malaria* and tetanus. * As stated in Chapter 13, for a growing number of analytes, most notably tricyclic antidepressants, peripheral blood is preferred over central blood. Peripheral blood is aspirated by percutaneous puncture before autopsy, from the femoral vein or the subclavian vein. The authors prefer the femoral approach in order to avoid any question of artifact in the diagnosis of venous air embolism. It may be pru-dent to add NaF to some of the samples.  Related Term: Childhood dermatomyositis (or polymyositis) associated with vasculitis; dermatomyositis (or polymyositis) associated with neoplasia or collagen vascular disease; primary idiopathic dermatomyositis; primary idiopathic polymyositis. Possible Associated Conditions: Carcinoma (lung, stomach, intestine, and prostate in males; breast, ovary, and uterus in females; miscellaneous sites in both sexes); lymphoma* (rare) and other malignancies (1); lupus erythematosus;* mixed connective tissue disease; progressive systemic sclerosis;* rheumatoid arthritis;* Sjogren's syndrome;* and others. Vasculitis of childhood polymyositis (dermatomyositis). External examination and skin Heart Lungs Esophagus and gastrointestinal tract Photograph grossly involved skin.

Perfuse one lung with formalin. Submit samples from all segments for histologic study.  Arteritis* and phlebitis* with thrombosis, fibrosis, and infarctions. Steatohepatitis and manifestations of diabetes mellitus* may be found (2) . Myositis with muscular atrophy and fibrosis; vasculitis in childhood cases. Polyneuropathy (rare) (5). Arthritis. Diabetes Mellitus Synonyms: Type I (insulin-dependent or juvenile-onset) diabetes mellitus; type II (insulin-independent or adult onset) diabetes mellitus; secondary diabetes mellitus (e.g., due to drugs or pancreatic disease). NOTE: In infants of diabetic mothers, macrosomia and congenital malformations must be expected. Record size and weight of placenta and total weight and length, crown to rump length, and crown to heel length of infant. Compare with expected measurements (see Part III). Expected histologic finding in-clude hyperpla-sia with relative increase ofB cells of the islands of Langerhans with interstitial and peri-insular eosinophilic infiltrates, decid-ual changes of the endometrium, enhanced follicle growth in the ovaries, and Leydig cell hyperplasia. Possible Associated Conditions: Acanthosis nigricans; acro-megaly;* amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; * ataxia telangiectasia;* Fanconi's anemia;* Friedreich's ataxia;* gout;* hemochro-matosis; *hyperlipoproteinemia; * hyperthroidism;* obesity;* Turner's syndrome;* and many others, too numerous to mention. NOTE: The term "Caroli's syndrome" often is used for cases that also show histologic features of congenital he-patic fibrosis or other manifestations of fibropolycystic liver disease,* whereas the name "Caroli's disease" refers to idiopathic dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts, without associated abnormalities. Possible Associated Conditions: Choledochal cyst* and related extrahepatic biliary abnormalities (1); congenital hepatic fibrosis; * cysts of kidneys (renal tubular ectasia or medullary sponge kidney; autosomal-recessive polycystic kidney disease, and rarely, autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [2] )* and of pancreas. Record volume of effusions. Prepare smears of fresh blood or of buffy coat, or make thick-drop preparation. Submit sample for xenodiagnosis or animal inoculation and for serologic study. Record weight. In chronic Chagas' disease, perfuse intact heart with formalin (Chapter 3) and slice fixed heart in a frontal plane so as to create anterior and posterior halves. Prepare photographs. Histologic samples should include conduction system. Include several sections of atrial (auricular) walls for histologic study of autonomous ganglia. Perfuse at least one lung with formalin. Leave affected hollow viscera intact and fill with formalin. Cut fixed organs in half, photograph, and cut histologic sections on edge. Record liver weight and submit samples for histologic study. Record weight. Prepare photographs of abnormalities. Weigh and examine. Prepare histologic sections. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Autopsy is desirable in suspected cases because the diagnosis can only be firmly established after neuropathologic examination. Serologic studies are not available. Unfortunately, all tissues (not just the brain and spinal cord) may remain infectious even after prolonged fixation and histologic processing. Thus, the autopsy recommendations for most other infectious diseases do not apply here. This is a reportable disease in some states. Special precautions are indicated and therefore, the procedures described here should be followed strictly (1) (2) (3) (4) : All persons in the autopsy room must wear disposable long-sleeved gowns, gloves, and masks. Contamination of the autopsy table should be prevented by covering it with a disposable, non-permeable plastic sheet. Autopsy generally should be restricted to the brain. If organs in the chest or abdomen need to be examined, this is best done in situ. To prevent aerosolization of potentially infectious bone dust, a hood or other protective device should be used while opening the skull with a Stryker saw. After completing the autopsy, instruments and other potentially contaminated objects should be autoclaved in a steam autoclave (1 h at 134°C). Porous load is considered more effective than gravity displacement autoclaves. Immerse autopsy instruments in distilled water before and during autoclaving, in order to protect them from corrosion. Ifno autoclave is available, chemical disinfection (see below) is a satisfactory alternative. Disposable items should be put in a container for infectious hospital waste and ultimately incinerated. Contaminated objects not suitable for autoclaving (such as the Stryker saw) should be soaked with a2NNaOH solution for 1 h (alternatively, 1 NNaOH may be used for 2 h). Contaminated surfaces should be thoroughly washed with the same solution. Aluminum should be treated for 2 h with a fresh 5% NaOCI (sodium hypochlorite) solution with at least 20,000 ppm free chloride. Wash waters should be collected; if no autoclave is available, 2 N NaOH or >4 volumes of 5% sodium hypochlorite bleach should be added to the water and left for a minimum of 2 h before being discarded. Before removing the body from the autopsy room, it should be sponged with 5% sodium hypochlorite. To deactivate CJD infectivity, tissue blocks, 5 mm or less in thickness, should be fixed in formalin in a formalin-totissue ratio of at least 20: 1 for at least 48 h and then soaked in concentrated formic acid (95-100%) for I h, followed by another 48 h of formalin fixation. The fixation fluid should be collected and decontaminated, as described earlier for wash water. Glassware and tissue carriers should also be decontaminated as previously described. After this deactivation, the tissue blocks can be processed in a routine fashion. At any stage of these procedures, special care must be taken to avoid cuts with potentially contaminated glassware, blades, or other objects. Parenteral exposure to potentially contaminated material also should be avoided. Remains of patients who have died of the disease should not be accepted for anatomy teaching for students. If specimens are prepared for pathology collections, they should be handled with great caution. Morticians and mortuary workers should be warned of possible hazards posed by tissues of patients with transmissible spongiforme encephalopathies; they should be advised about proper use of disinfectants. Clinical laboratories that receive autopsy tissues or fluids must be warned about the infectious nature of the material. If possible, decontamination should be done at the site where the autopsy was done. For the shipping of potentially infected material, see Chapter 15. Increased concentrations of NSE (5). Spongiforme changes, astrocytosis, neuronal loss, amyloid plaque formation, PrP deposition, and proliferation of activated microglia (6). Cerebrospinal fluid Brain Submit sample for neuron-specific enolase (NSE). For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4 and above under "Note." Submit fresh-frozen material for confirmation of diagnosis by histoblot technique on protease K-digested frozen tissue or Western blot preparations on brain homogenates. Immunohistochemical localization ofPrP and HLA-DR protein on paraffin-embedded tissue is possible. Disease, Demyelinating (See "Degeneration, spongy, of white matter," "Encephalomyelitis, all types or type unspecified," "Leukodystrophy, globoid cell," "Leukodystrophy, sudanophilic," "Sclerosis, multiple;' and "Sclerosis, Schilder's cerebral.") Disease, Diffuse Alveolar Synonym: Diffuse pulmonary disease. NOTE: Autopsy procedures are listed under the more specific diagnoses, such as "Hemosiderosis, idiopathic pulmonary," "Lipoproteinosis, pulmonary alveolar," "Microlithiasis, pulmonary alveolar," "Pneumonia, lipoid," and "Syndrome, Goodpasture's." Glycosphingolipid storage in cornea; lens opacities; dilated vessels in conjunctiva and lens; thrombi in blood vessels (5). Disease, Fibropolycystic, of the Liver and Biliary Tract NOTE: "Fibropolycystic disease of the liver and biliary tract" comprises a group of well defined conditions, which may occur together and hence need a collective designation. The conditions include autosomal-recessive (infantile) and auto-somal dominant (adult) polycystic disease of the liver; Caroli's disease or syndrome;* choledochal cyst,* congenital hepatic fibro-sis,* multiple biliary microhamartomas, and related disorders. For autopsy procedures, see also under more specific designations.

NOTE: If the diagnosis had not been confirmed prior to death, samples of liver, skeletal muscle, blood, and fascia (for fibroblast culture, see below) should be snap-frozen for enzyme assay, which will determine the specific deficiency. Types Ia and b, III, VI, and hepatic phosphorylase B kinase deficiency (types IXa, b and c) are hepatic-hypoglycemic disorders, whereas types V and VII affect muscle energy processes. Type II also affects the musculature, whereas type IV may cause cirrhosis and death in infancy from extreme hypotonia. Determination of type of glycogenosis usually can be based on (I) pattern of glycogen storage in liver, (2) presence or absence of nuclear hyperglycogenation in liver, (3) cytoplasmic lipid in liver, (4) presence or absence of liver cirrhosis, and (5) presence or absence of glycogen and basophilic deposits in skeletal muscles. Possible Associated Conditions: Fanconi syndrome* or gout* with type Ia glycogenosis; neutropenia, recurrent infections, and Crohn's disease with types Ib or Ie. Glycogen primarily in retinal ganglion cells and ciliary muscle. Glycogen in sympathetic nerve ganglia and neurons of cranial nerves in type VII. Gouty arthritis. Disease, Graft-Versus-Host NOTE: This disease occurs most commonly after bone marrow transplantation. The disease has also occurred after transfusion of viable lymphocytes, for example, to patients with cancer or leukemia. * In patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), autopsy also may reveal recurrence of the underlying disease such as leukemia. Possible Associated Conditions: Alphal-antitrypsin deficiency;* amyloidosis;* ankylosing spondylitis;* primary sclerosing cholangitis;* Sjogren's syndrome. * See also below under "Possible or Expected Findings." NOTE: In many instances, either chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease* had been diagnosed clinically, but sometimes, the distinction is difficult to make, even at autopsy. Many features described below occur in chronic ulcerative colitis but some manifestations of Crohn's disease or conditions that may occur in all types of inflammatory bowel disease also are listed so that both positive and negative findings can be recorded properly. Osteoporosis;* ankylosing spondylitis;* arthritis of peripheral joints; periarthritis; hypertrophic osteoarthropathy;* tendinitis (particularly of ankle and Achilles tendons). Disease, Iron Storage (See "Hemochromatosis.") Related Terms: Atherosclerotic heart disease. NOTE: The most common anatomic finding at autopsy in subjects older than 30 yr is coronary atherosclerosis. Unusual under-lying or associated conditions include chronic aortic stenosis or regurgitation; coronary artery anomalies; coronary artery dissection; coronary embolism; coronary ostial stenosis (due to calcification of aortic sinotubular junction or, rarely, to syphilitic aortitis); coronary vasculitis (for instance, in polyarteritis nodosa* or acute hypersensitivity arteritis); hyperthyroidism,* gastrointestinal hemorrhage; * hypothyroidism, * idiopathic arterial calcification of infancy; intramural coronary amyloidosis; pheochromocytoma, polycythemia vera; * pseudoxanthoma elasticum,* radiationinduced coronary stenosis; severe pulmonary hypertension (with right ventricular ischemia); sickle cell disease;* and others. If bypass surgery had been performed, see "Surgery, coronary bypass."  Macular rash (4). Multifocal fibrinopurulent pneumonia with sparing of the bronchi and bronchioles. Exudate is rich in phagocytes, fibrin, and karyorrhectic debris. Synonym: Lyme arthritis NOTE: This infection is caused by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdoiferi, which is transmitted from rodents to human by the hard deer ticks, Ixodes dammini, 1. ricinus, and others.

Related Terms: Dry drowning; fresh-water drowning; near-drowning; salt (sea)-water drowning (see the following table). Primary Drowning ("Immediate Drowning") Deaths occurring within minutes after immersion, before or without resuscitative measures Deaths from hypoxia and acidosis caused by glottal spasm on breath holding. There may be no evidence of water entering stomach or lungs and no appreciable morphologic changes at autopsy. NOTE: The diagnosis is one of exclusion. The pathologist should help the police to determine: I) How did the person (or dead body) get in the water, and 2) why could that person not get out of the water? It is not enough to ask if a person could swim but investigators should find out how well (what strokes did the victim know?) and how far he or she could swim. The inquiry must include the depth of the water and must address hazards such as undertow or underwater debris, and the behavior Deaths occurring from within 30 min to several weeks after resuscitation, because of metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, or infective or chemical pneumonitis Deaths from hypoxia and acidosis caused by obstruction of airway by water related to: Hypervolemia Hemolysis Hyponatremia Hypochloremia Hyperkalemia of the victim immediately before submerging. Deaths of adults in bathtubs and swimming pools are usually from natural, cardiac causes, or they are suicides, unless the victim was drunk. Diatom tests (1) have not proven useful in the United States but there is enthusiasm for such tests among European pathologists. The distinction between hyponatremic deaths in fresh water and hypernatremic deaths in salt water derives from experimental studies; in practice, one cannot reliably predict the salinity of the immersion medium from autopsy studies. Because many bodies of drowning victims are recovered only after the body floats to the surface, decomposition will often obscure even the nondiagnostic findings such as pleural effusions, which are often associated with drowning. External examination and skin (wounds) Organ samples for diatom search Serosal surfaces and cavities If identity of drowning victim is not known, record identifying features as described in Chapter 13. Prepare dental and whole-body roentgenograms. Submit tissue samples for histologic study of wounds. Inspect inside of hands. Collect fingernail scrapings. Record appearance and contents of body orifices. Record features indicative of drowning. Photograph face from front and in profile. Take pictures of all injuries, with and without scale and autopsy number. Remove vitreous for analysis. If diatom search is intended, clean body thoroughly before dissection to avoid contamination of organs and body fluids with algae and diatoms (see below). Submit sample for toxicologic study. Sample early during autopsy, before carrying out other dissections. Use fresh instruments for removal of specimens to avoid contamination. Submit subpleural portion of lung: subcapsular portions of liver, spleen, and kidneys; bone marrow; and brain. Store samples in clean glass jars. For technique of diatom detection, see below. Record volume of fluid in pleural spaces. Photograph petechial hemorrhages. Photograph layerwise neck dissection if strangulation* is suspected. Open airways posteriorly, and photograph, remove and save mud, algae, and any other material in tracheobronchial tree. Record size and weight of lungs. There may be wounds that were inflicted before drowning occurred-for instance, in shipwrecks or vehicular and diving accidents. Other wounds may be inflicted after deathfor instance, from ship propellers or marine animals. Sometimes, premortem and postmortem wounds can be distinguished histologically. Object (hair?) held by hands in cadaveric spasm. Cutis anserina and "washerwoman" changes of hands and feet are of no diagnostic help. Foreign bodies; semen (see also under "Rape"). Foam cap over mouth and nose. In the autopsy room, water running from nose and mouth is usually pulmonary edema or water from the stomach. High concentrations of alcohol indicate intoxication (see under "Alcoholism and alcohol intoxication"). Evidence of alcohol intoxication may be found. Diatoms may occur in the liver and in other organs of persons who have died from causes other than drowning. Comparison with diatoms in water sample from area of drowning may be helpful. Penny-sized or smaller hemorrhages may indicate violent respiratory efforts or merely intense lividity. Presence of pleural fluid suggests drowning.  For diatom detection (l) , boil 2-5 g oftissue for 10--15 min in 10 rnL of concentrated nitric acid and 0.5 rnL of concentrated sulfuric acid. Then, add sodium nitrate in small quantities until the black color of the charred organic matter has been dispelled. It may be necessary to warm the acid-digested material with weak sodium hydroxide, but the material must soon be washed free from alkali to avoid dissolving the diatoms. The diatoms should be washed, concentrated, and stored in distilled water. For examination, allow a drop of the concentrate to evaporate on a slide, and then mount it in a resin of high refractive index. All equipment must be well-cleaned, and distilled water must be used for all solutions. There are several variations and adaptations of this method. Drug Abuse, Amphetamine(s) NOTE: Methamphetamine abuse may be suggested by poor condition of the dentition. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ("Ecstasy") abuse is often suggested by friends with whom the decedent was abusing drugs. Follow procedures described under "Dependence, drug(s)."

(1) gunshot and shotgun wounds of the head involving dural sinuses; (2) injury to large veins, particularly cranial sinuses (during neurosurgical procedures) and veins ofthe neck (knife wounds, surgery) or uterus (criminal abortion); (3) insufflation offallopian tubes (particularly in pregnancy or during menstrual period); (4) infusion of blood components or crystalloid; (5) malfunctioning of dialysis machines; (6) subclavian vein catheterization in the semi-Fowler position; and (7) fracture in the hub of a central venous catheter used for parenteral nutrition. Possible causes of arterial air embolism include: (1) open heart surgery involving the aorta, left atrium, or left ventricle; (2) positive-pressure ventilation in newborn infants; and (3) underwater ascent with closed glottis (see Accident, Diving) Ifair embolism is suspected, the autopsy should be performed as soon after death as possible. Decomposition gases may be produced within a few hours. Roentgenography of the whole body may detect large quantities of air, and the roentgenograms may serve as a guide to the most advantageous way of dissection. The postmortem diagnosis of arterial air embolism is made largely on the basis of medical history and circumstances. The autopsy serves to rule out competing conditions. The diagnosis of venous air embolism is made by chest roentgenography before the autopsy (1). The air in the right chambers of the heart can be confirmed at autopsy by aspiration into a syringe. The formerly recommended procedure of clamping the internal mammary vessels below the sternoclavicular joints, and then cutting across the sternum distal to these clamped vessels so that the sternoclavicular joint area remains intact, is designed to prevent the production of a vacuum that pulls air into the veins. The procedure is not necessary if the air is welldocumented by roentgenography before autopsy. At autopsy, a large fatal pulmonary air embolism is readily apparent. The right atrium and ventricle are distended with fine, frothy, brightred blood, which also may distend the pulmonary arteries and superior vena cava. Microbiologic examination ofblood and pericardial sac contents may help to rule out the presence of gas-forming bacteria that may simulate air embolism (Fig. II-I). However, the presence of putrefactive emphysema in any part of the body points toward a bacterial origin of the gas. Differentiation of air and decomposition gases at the autopsy table with the pyrogallol test is described below. A 2% pyrogallol solution is prepared (it should be waterclear). Two lO-mL syringes (syringe A and syringe B) are loaded with 4 mL of the pyrogallol solution in each, without permitting any air to enter the system. Immediately before the solution is used, 4 drops of 0.5 N NaOH is aspirated through the needle of syringe A to adjust the pH to about 8 (1 drop per 1mL of solution); the mixture will turn faint yellow. Six mL of gas is then aspirated from the heart or blood vessels. The needle is immediately sealed with a cork or replaced by a cap, and the syringe is vigorously shaken for about 1 min. In the presence of air, the pyrogallol solution will turn brown. If the solution remains clear, decomposition gases were present. In the latter instance, 4 drops of 0.5 N NaOH and 6 mL of room air should be aspirated into syringe B, which is then also sealed and shaken for 1 min. The mixture should turn brown, thus serving as a Fig. 11·1 . Gas-forming bacteria simulating air embolism. The pericardial sac is opened and filled with water. The heart is kept submerged with a pair of scissors. The coronary arteries have been incised with a scalpel. Note gas bubbles and foam on the water surface. No discoloration of 2% pyrogallol was noted. Blood cultures were positive for Enterococcus organisms. Microscopically, gram-negative rods were found in most tissues. control that the pyrogallol solution had been properly prepared. Syringe B may also serve as a reserve. If only one syringe is used, the decomposition gas can be expel1ed and room air can be aspirated for the control test. If only small amounts of gas can be aspirated, the volume of the pyrogallol solution should be decreased so that the gas-fluid volume ratio is at least 3:2. If no bacterial gas formation is present, the edges of the pericardial incision are elevated and the pericardial sac is fil1ed with water. Clamping of the ascending aorta and venae cavae prevents the escape of gas into these vessels. The heart is held under water while the coronary arteries are incised, and the escape of bubbles is recorded. When the right coronary artery is opened, care must be taken that the right atrium is not incised. Air in the coronary arteries indicates systemic embolism. The heart chambers are then incised. When there is gas in any of the arteries or heart chambers, gas bubbles rise to the surface of the water in the pericardial sac ("bubble test"). Sometimes the vessels have to be somewhat compressed in order to cause the gas to escape. Because large amounts of air or other gases cause the heart to float, it must be kept submerged before the vessels and chambers are incised. Basically the same procedure is used for demonstrating the presence of gas in the superior or inferior vena cava and the pelvic veins (for example, in cases of criminal abortion). In this situation, the abdominal cavity is filled with water and the inferior vena cava and its tributaries are incised. In support of the diagnosis of systemic arterial air embolism, the skull vault may be removed without puncturing the meninges, so that the cerebral arteries can be inspected for gas bubbles. The demonstration of gas bubbles in the meningeal vessels and in the circle of Willis is meaningful only when the neck vessels are still intact and the internal carotid artery and basilar artery have been clamped before the brain is removed. In acute cases, gas bubbles will be visible within the cerebral vessels. They are released under water when the clamps are removed and the vessels are slightly compressed. For the collection of gas from blood vessels or cavities, a system oflittle quantitative reliability is an air-tight, water-filled glass syringe with a needle. The needle is inserted into the vessel or cavity in question and gas is carefully aspirated. A combined qualitative and quantitative method has been described by Kulka (2,3) (see Fig. 11 -2). He devised an apparatus for gas collection and described it as shown in Fig. 11 -2 and caption. The entire system is filled with mineral oil so that, when the funnel is level with the upright bottle, the oil fills only about half of the funnel. In operation, the funnel is first raised to a position 30-40cm above the level of the upright bottle. All the cocks are opened and the position is held until every trace of gas has been driven from the system through the needle, which is thereby coated on the inside by a film of oil. After all air has been expelled, the cocks are closed and the funnel is lowered to its original position. As a precautionary measure and control, the air-tightness of the whole system should be tested before operation. This is done by inserting the needle into musculature or skin and attempting aspiration in the manner described in the next paragraph. To make the test, the bottle is inverted and the needle is inserted into the cavity in question. When the needle is in position, all cocks are opened. The funnel is lowered about 70-90 cm, or until adequate suction is created. This aspirates the contents of the cavity, which may consist of air or other gases, either pure or mixed with blood or other liquid. Any gas or liquid entering this system may be observed through the wall of the short bent glass tubing. In a positive test, gas bubbles will collect in the bottle above the level of the oil. If desired, this gas can be saved for further examination by closing all the cocks and returning the bottle to its upright position (4). The volume ofintravenous air needed to cause death in adults depends of the cross sectional area of the cardiac cavity or great vessel that is the site of the gas lock, which in tum depends on the position of the decedent at the time of the embolism (5). 100 mL of gas can pass through an intravenous hub in just a few seconds. Small amounts of air entering the systemic circulation may cause death within minutes. Delayed air embolism with fatal outcome may also occur. Other organs If purpura is present, prepare photographs and record extent. Submit sample (from right atrium) for microbiologic study. Collect blood from right atrium and right ventricle.

Large amounts of debris in the blood vessels of all sections of the lungs may be considered to be lethal if there is no other cause of death. Small amounts in one or more blocks of pulmonary tissue are more likely incidental (1). A small uterine tear is more likely followed by a fatal amniotic fluid embolization than is a large tear, which may result in fatal hemorrhage or fibrinogen depletion. Chorioamnionitis, intrauterine pneumonia, and positive lung cultures of the mother indicate infection of the amniotic fluid. Record weight and sample for histologic study.

Hepatitis, Chronic Synonyms and Related Terms: Autoimmune hepatitis; chronic viral hepatitis B (with or without D) and C. NOTE: The term "chronic hepatitis" is not a complete etiologic diagnosis and related names such as chronic active (aggressive) hepatitis, chronic active liver disease, and chronic per-sistent hepatitis are obsolete. Most cases in these categories represent autoimmune hepatitis or chronic viral hepatitis B or C. Many other liver diseases, including drug-induced hepatitis, inborn errors ofmetabolism (e.g., alphal-antitrypsin deficiency* or Wilson's disease*), developmental disorders, and chronic biliary diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis also may present as chronic hepatitis. Ifchronic hepatitis was the cause ofdeath, submassive hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis* is usually present, often with manifestations ofportal hypertension,*hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome,* and with ascites or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

In many cases of fulminant hepatitis, tests for known hepatitis viruses are negative (3, 4) . Homicide NOTE: Not all of the following procedures can be carried out or will be required in all cases, nor will this checklist be sufficient in all instances. Consult also the entries indicating the cause of death, such as "Injury, firearm" or "Injury, stabbing." If the victim is an infant, see all under "Infanticide." Before the body arrives or before autopsy is begun: 1. Investigate the scene where the body was found and where the crime may have been committed (these may be two separate locations). If this is not possible, study the report and photographs submitted by the investigator or the police. Study all available information. Request previous medical records and roentgenograms of the victim. 2. Emphasize to first responders and autopsy personnel that the body of the victim should not be undressed, washed, or otherwise disturbed until it has been inspected by the pathologist. Embalming is not permitted before completion of the autopsy. Advise first responders or transporters to put paper bags over the hands of the victim. This will protect possible evidence, such as hair from the assailant. 3. Prepare record sheets to document the time of arrival and release of the body; chain of custody for the body and specimens; the name, age, sex, and other information about the victim; the names ofthe technician, pathologist and guests; and the specimens taken. 4. Prepare roentgenographic and photographic equipment. After Body Arrives but Before Autopsy Is Begun: 1. If the body is left unguarded-for instance, overnight-a lock should be placed on the refrigerator or cool room where the deceased is kept, and the key should be retained by the technician. 2. If the pathologist is not accustomed to a busy autopsy room, he or she should feel free to ask all persons other than the pathologist(s), technicians, and law enforcement personnel who are not immediately involved in the actual performance of the autopsy to leave the morgue. 3. The body temperature of the victim can be recorded at the autopsy facility, but this is rarely useful, particularly if the victim seems to have been deadfor longer than a day ortwo or ifthe body had previously been stored in arefrigeratoror cool room. Insert thermometer deep into the anus (about 7-8cm). Record temperature and manner and time of procedure. 4. Aspirate vitreous from one or both eyes and store the specimen in a refrigerator. 5. Prepare roentgenograms. In each case, a decision must be made whether roentgenograms should be made of the entire body or only of parts of it-or not at all-and whether they should be made before the victim is undressed, after the victim is undressed, or at both times. 1. Take overall survey photographs that depict the anterior surfaces of the body as it is on arrival to the facility, before any undressing, manipulation for roentgenographs, or cleaning. 2. Take close-up photographs of any trace evidence such as fibers or flakes of gunpowder before undressing or cleaning. 3. Photograph the face of the victim for identification purposes after it has been cleaned of any blood and foreign matter. To avoid perspective distortion from wide angle lenses, the lens should be about 4 ft from the face. 4. Photograph all injuries and other forensically significant findings after blood and foreign matter have been cleaned off the body. A moist towel is useful; brushes are too abrasive. Two photographs should be taken of each finding. One should include the autopsy number and a scale. A second photograph should be taken without any extraneous objects. Collection and Documentation of Evidence: 1. Fingerprinting can be done before or after the autopsy but should be done in all homicide cases. In cases involving close contact between assailant and victim, fingernail scrapings or clippings (use a new clipper) and hair with roots should be collected, and its source should be identified (hair pulled from scalp, axillae, and pubis is identified as that of the victim; hair in hands or under fingernails or on clothing of victim may be from the assailant). Hair exemplars can be collected in cases of homicide by firearm but are rarely of use. If the body is decomposed or mutilated or for any other reason has not been identified, prepare roentgenograms ofthe head, neck, and torso before the autopsy (the radiographic appearance is altered by the autopsy). These can be used for comparison purposes if antemortem films are located. If films of the extremities are needed they can be prepared after the autopsy. Dental roentgeno-.grams are taken, usually after the autopsy, when investigators have located antemortem dental records. Detailed descriptions and sizes of clothing, with photographs of clothing, can be useful then there is no putative identity. 3. In cases in which sexual assault may have been involved, collect pieces of clothing that may contain seminal fluid stains. Follow procedures described under "Rape." 4. Preserve clothing or part of clothing as evidence. Wet clothing should be dried before it is stored in labeled and sealed bags. The Autopsy: 1. The measured length and weight, extent of rigor, and color and distribution of livor should be recorded, along with the state of preservation, nutrition, and hydration. Do not omit examination of the hands, particularly of the volar surfaces. 2. If air embolism is suspected, see procedure described under Part II "Embolism, Air". If pneumothorax is suspected, see procedure described under Part II "Pneumothorax". If there is evidence of strangulation or other neck injury, perform a layerwise dissection of the neck that includes the hyoid bone and tongue. 3. Prepare diagrams of wounds and identify their location by anatomic region. For wounds of the torso, state the distance from the soles of a foot and the distance laterally from to the right or left of the midline. 4. Submit samples of wounds for histologic study when there is any question of the age of the wounds. 5. The records should show when body fluids and tissues were collected for laboratory analysis, the volume and appearance of such specimens, and what was done with them. If most of the toxicology specimens are collected immediately after the internal examination has commenced, the time of the internal examination serves as the collection time. In all instances, the following items should be collected: blood ofvictim for DNA comparison and toxicologic study (determination of alcohol, carbon monoxide, and drug concentrations will be requested most frequently); vitreous; urine; gastric contents; at least one solid organ specimen for toxicologic study (liver and brain have the most comparison data If an extracerebral congenital malformation is suspected, follow procedures described under "Malformation, Arnold-Chiari." If cerebrospinal fluid is aspirated with a syringe, record volume. Record weight of brain; record size of brain in relation to inner dimensions of skull. Describe size of ventricles. Other procedures depend on expected findings or grossly identified abnormalities as listed in right-hand column. If a surgical shunt is present, its location should be recorded and both ends of the implanted specimen that was used for shunting may be submitted for microbiologic study. If the shunt is not patent, record site and nature of obstruction.  Related Terms: Antibody-mediated hydrops fetalis; erythroblastosis fetalis;* nonimmune hydrops fetalis. NOTE: The classic example of antibody mediated (Rh incompatibility) hydrops fetalis is hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis*). However, nonimmune hydrops fetalis also may be caused by hematologic disorders, e.g., alpha-thalassemia* (1) or it may have no known cause. Infec-tions, e.g., with human parvovirus Bl9 (2), cytomegalovirus, or syphilis;* heart and vascular diseases (3) (cardiac tumors, cardi-omyopathy,* myocarditis,* arterial calcification, and others); storage disease (4); tumors (including neonatal leukemia*); and many other fetal (e.g., congenital chylothorax* or lymphatic dysplasia; pulmonary sequestration and cystic adenomatoid malformation) or maternal conditions, e.g., maternal thyrotoxicosis, also may cause nonimmune hydrops fetalis. If coronary insufficiency or myocardial infarction is suspected, follow procedures described under "Disease, ischemic heart." For coronary arteriography, see Chapter to. Record distribution of atherosclerotic lesions in aorta. Samples for histologic study should include aorta, coronary arteries, and peripheral arteries. See also above under "Heart." Submit samples of head, corpus, and tail for histologic study. If applicable, see also under "Diabetes mellitus." For special procedures and stains, see above under "Heart." Other procedures depend on expected findings or grossly identified abnormalities as listed in right-hand column. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Obesity* is a common finding. Eruptive xanthomas (palms, elbows, knees) in some but not all types of hyperlipoproteinemia. Most prominent in apoprotein CII deficiency.

Manifestations of diabetes mellitus* and hypothyroidism* in some cases of type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia. Cerebral infarct (stroke*) in type 3 hyperlipoproteinemia. Hypernatremia (See "Disorder, electrolyte(s).") Hyperoxaluria Synonyms and Related Terms: Oxalosis; primary hyperoxaluria type I (a1anineglyoxylate aminotransferase deficiency); primary hyperoxaluria type II (D-glyceric acid dehydrogenase deficiency); secondary hyperoxaluria (see under "Note"). NOTE: In ethylene glycol poisoning,*oxalatecrystals in media ofsmall arteries, with associated ischemic lesions. Similardeposits may occur after long-term hemodialysis (1). These conditions must be distinguished from the genetic disease. Also, oxa-Iate nephropathy may be a complication of short bowel syndrome. If patient with congenital hyperoxaluria underwent liver or combined liverlkidney transplantation (2) , see also under these headings. Remove vitreous for biochemical evalvation. Submit tissue (i.e., fascia lata) for karyotype analysis. Polycystic ovaries, testicular adrenal rests (4 NOTE: There are no diagnostic autopsy findings for hypoxia. Possible causes of acute hypoxia include anesthesia-associated death,' compression of the torso by a vehicle, diving accident,' exposure to toxic gases-forinstance, carbon monoxide poisoning;' mechanical failure ofan oxygen supply system, as in an airplane; and sudden mechanical airway obstruction,' as in aspiration ofa foreign body orstrangulation. Causes ofchronic asphyxia include prolonged exposure to high altitude and chronic pulmonary disease. Profound medial hypertrophy of small pulmonary arteries and of pulmonary veins from chronic exposure to hypoxia. Acute pulmonary edema may also occur in chronic hypoxia. Procedures depend on expected findings or grossly identified abnormalities as listed in right-hand column. Malnutrition. Empty and collapsed colon; small amounts of gray and dry meconium in terminal ileum; meconium masses in dilated and hypertrophied mid-ileum; liquid contents in proximal intestine (1); appendicitis; bowel perforation.

Possible Associated Conditions: Klippel-Feil syndrome;* osteogenesis imperfecta;* osteomalacia;* Paget's disease of bone;* rheumatoid arthritis; rickets; syringobulbia; syringomylia. * Compression and secondary ischemic injury to lower brain stem and spinal cord. See also above under "Skull and spine" and under "Possible Associated Conditions." Incompetence,••• (See "Insufficiency,..•") Related Terms: Battered-child syndrome; child-abuse or child-neglect death. NOTE: Vitreous should not be aspirated until the skull has been opened and trauma ruled out, because there is a risk of artifactual damage to the retina. In the presence of craniocerebral trauma the pathologist can opt to examine the eyes by removal, fixation, and histologic study; or retinal photography. Follow general procedures described under "Homicide" and, if necessary,. the procedures described under "Rape." External examination See above under "Note." Prepare roentgenograms of entire body. See above under "Note." In other situations, or after study of the fundus, submit sample of vitreous for chemical and possible toxicologic study. Umbilical cord attachment Prepare histologic sections of umbilicus. and end of umbilical cord Blood Submit sample for toxicologic study. Consider retaining dried blood on filter paper for possible DNA testing for paternity investigation. If there is a possibility that the cadaver represents a stillbirth, see Part II, "Stillbirth". If infant is thought to have died shortly after birth, determine the location of air in the intestinal tract; roentgenograms may be helpful. Save stomach contents and record amount. Other organs See also under "Homicide." In the abused child, bruises, hematomas, burn marks, or other patterned injuries. In any child, diaper rash, Mongolian spots, self-inflicted fingernail scratches, skin infections, and emaciation. In the previously battered child, fractures in various states of healing. In hypertonic dehydration,' sodium concentrations more than 150meq/L. This may be caused by organic disease, improper medical treatment, or physical neglect. If infant was born alive, inflammatory changes may be found, depending on survival interval. For the hydrostatic lung test, see "Stillbirth." The test is unreliable. Extraneous material in air passages indicates that child was alive. Air reaches the stomach after 15 min, the small intestine after 1-2 h, the colon after 5-6h, and the rectum after l2h. There is no difference in the speed of gas propulsion between full-term and premature infants. Bacterial gas production and previous resuscitation attempts are potential sources of errors. In questionable stillbirth, presence of milk proves that infant was alive and had been nursed. Traumatic lesions and signs of neglect may be present. Unilateral ulcers in visceral zoster. In rare instances, diffuse meningoencephalitis may occur. Limited necrotic and inflammatory lesions in the cord or brain stem at the level of the affected ganglion are common. Posterior hom myelitis (3). Ganglion cell necrosis; lymphocytic infiltration, hemorrhage, and, later, fibrosis. As a rule, only one ganglion is severely involved, but less severe lesions may occur in the ganglia that are immediately adjacent. Diffuse lymphocytic infiltration; demyelination; axonal destruction; fibrosis. Conjunctivitis; keratitis; iridocyclitis; retrobulbar neuritis; neuroretinitis; occlusion of retinal vessels. Evidence of hematologic malignancies (2) or other conditions, as listed above under "Note." Infection, Middle Ear (See "Otitis media.") Infection, Pneumocystis carinii Synonym: Pneumocystosis. NOTE: (1) Collect all tissues that appear to be infected. (2) This organism cannot be cultured at present but is frequently associated with viral, bacterial, or fungal infections that can be diagnosed by culture. (3) For rapid staining of aspirates, use Gram-Weigert stain, which will stain cysts of Pneumocystis carinii and also fungi and bacteria. Pneumocystis carinii is best demonstrated with Grocott's methenamine silver stain. (4) No special precautions are indicated. (5) Usually, no serologic studies are available. (6) This is not a reportable disease. Injury, Fire (See "Burns.") Injury, Firearm NOTE: Protect all drains of autopsy table, which will prevent accidental loss of bullets or bullet fragments. Recovery of bullet fragments and pellets can also be improved by passing tissue fragments, blood, and other appropriate materials through a fine nonmetallic sieve. Caution must be exercised because sharp edges andjagged projections ofbullets and bullet fragments may cause injury (1). This applies particularly to the Black Talon bullet. Bullets and bullet fragments should not be touched with forceps or other metal instruments that may produce artifactual markings; they must be placed in properly labeled evidence containers, and the chain of custody must be preserved. From a birdshot wound, at least 10 pellets should be recovered. The firearms examiner will divide the total pellet weight by 10 and derive median pellet weight. From a buckshot wound, all pellets should be recovered. In many of these cases, procedures described under "Homicide" must also be followed. Do not excise wounds before completion of autopsy (see below). As an academic exercise, excised firearm wounds may be used later for analysis of metal traces by neutron activation or for tests for carboxyhemoglobin. In practice, however, a high quality photograph is adequate to establish the presence or absence of gunpowder stippling or soot deposition toward the end of establishing the range of fire. The dimensions of the stippled areas and soot deposits should be recorded. After completion of external examination, dry the wet clothing and keep as evidence. Clothing may also be used for possible test firing or for stain, powder, or particle analysis. External examination If identity of victim is unknown, follow procedures described in Chapter 13. Prepare initial roentgenograms of the body regions that have been shot, before disrobing of body, and then lateral films of body regions with bullets. Follow up with films of other body regions as needed in the course of autopsy. If the body is decomposed to the extent that the external examination cannot be relied upon to determine cutaneous gunshot perforations, prepare roentgenograms of the entire body before autopsy. Record location and number of bullet holes in all layers of garments, indicating whether the involved area is bloodstained or shows gunpowder or soot. If there are several cutaneous perforations, number or letter each consecutively and refer to these numbers in all records. Location of bullet holes should be described by recording distance from soles of feet or top of head, and from midline of body. Prepare diagrams and photograph holes, with and without labels. Photographs should show surrounding garments and extent of blood stains. In hairy areas, shave around bullet wounds for better photographic documentation. For evaluation of distance from where a shot had been fired, see Fig. 11 Additional roentgenograms during the autopsy may be needed to find bullets embolized to the femoral veins or down the spinal canal. Systemic roentgenograms may reveal bullets from obscure entrance wounds, particularly in decomposed bodies, old bullets, bullets in the skin flaps reflected at autopsy, or bullets external to the body in clothing. Bullet(s) may have been arrested in hollow viscus or blood vessel and may have been transported to distant sites by peristalsis or bloodstream ("bullet embolus"). Bullets may be deflected in unexpected directions from bony surfaces. Soot ("smudging") and gunpowder stippling may occur around entrance wound, depending on the muzzle-to-skin distance. There may also be an impression from a recoiling handgun or from a power piston. Wounds may be stellate, round, jagged, or slit-like, with or without wide margins of abrasion. Primer residues on hand of suicide victim after use of a handgun. Fatal secondary injuries, particularly hemorrhages. Alcohol intoxication is a frequent finding. Fig. 11·3 . Bullet wounds. Differences in the appearance of cutaneous wounds of entrance and of exit and differences in wounds of entrance according to the distance between muzzle and skin at the moment of fire. Entrance wounds often differ from exit wounds in that the former are usually surrounded by a narrow zone of abrasion. If the muzzle of a gun is in close contact with the skin at the moment of fire, the combustion products will be blown into the wound and will not be visible on the surface. For close-range wounds, the stippling of the skin around the wound, produced by particles of burned and unburned powder, becomes progressively more dispersed as the range of fire increases and is ordinarily not perceptible if the range has been greater than 24 inches (  Synonyms and Related Terms: Acute radiation syndrome; chronic (delayed) radiation injury; radiation enterocolitis; radiation nephritis; radiation pneumonitis. NOTE: Procedures and expected findings depend on type of radiation damage, whether acute or chronic, localized or whole-body irradiation. If suspected radiation injury was associated with the administration of radionuclides such as 32p, 131 1, or 198Au, follow procedures suggested in Chapter 11. In fatal 355 whole-body irradiation, findings are most likely related to bone marrow injury, and the suggested procedures and expected findings are those described under "Pancytopenia." Record extent of oropharyngeal and intestinal ulcerations and hemorrhages. Late complications include malignant tumors (carcinoma, leukemia,* lymphoma*), manifestations of hypothyroidism,* and cataracts. Organ changes in localized radiation injury depend on site of irradiation (lung, brain, kidney, intestine). The skin is involved in both acute (erythema) and chronic (atrophy, epilation) radiation injury. Related Terms: Cutting injury; knife injury. NOTE: In many of these cases, procedures described under "Homicide" must also be followed.

Make histologic sections of larynx and epiglottis. Hemophilus injluenzae (cannot always be isolated from larynx  Synonyms and Related Terms: Acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia. Multiple subtypes have been identified; they are characterized by cell surface markers, chromosomal abnormalities, staining reactions, and morphologic features. NOTE: At the time of autopsy, most leukemias have been properly classified and often treated. In these cases, the goal of the autopsy is to document the extent of the disease and the presence of complications. If the leukemia had not been classified or if the features might have changed from the time of the last work-up (e.g., in suspected cases of superimposed diffuse large cell lymphoma [Richter's syndrome]), material should be snap-frozen and studied in more detail. If the patient was treated by bone marrow transplantation,* see also under that heading.

NOTE: At the time of autopsy, most lymphomas have been properly classified and often treated. In these cases, the goal of the autopsy is to document the extent ofthe disease and the presence of complications. If the lymphoma had not been classified or if the features might have changed from the time of the last work-up, material should be snap-frozen and studied in more detail. If the patient was treated by bone marrow transplantation, * see also under that heading. For current terminologies of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas as well as for staging criteria, appropriate hematologic textbooks should be consulted. Possible Associated Conditions: Acquired immunodeficiency diseases (e.g., after organ transplantation; human immunodeficiency virus-l infection); autoimmune disease (e.g., celiac sprue,*rheumatoid arthritis,* systemic lupus erythematosus,* or Sjogren's syndrome*); chemotherapy with or without radiation treatment; Epstein-Barr virus infection; human T-cell leukemia virus infection; inherited diseases with immunodeficiency (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome; * common variable immunodeficiency disease, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome); radiation. The lesions are found most commonly in the urinary bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, but may also occur at many other sites, including skin (1) and upper respiratory tract (2). NOTE: (I) Collect all tissues that appear to be infected. (2) Usually, cultures are not indicated. (3) Request Giernsa or Wright stain. Tissue blocks should be rinsed of blood and be as thin as possible before fixation in refrigerated buffered and neutral 10% formalin solution. This is to avoid precipitationofformalin pigment that may be confused with malaria pigment. The formalin solution should be used in a ratio of 100 parts formalin to one part tissue and should be agitated every few hours. If one is dealing with tissues that contain formalin pigment, this pigment may be removed with a bleaching solution. (4) Usually, no special precautions are indicated.

Mitral stenosis* may be a cause of microlithiasis (mostly intra-alveolar ossification). * Cor pulmonale and heart failure (1) (l) , see also under that heading. (1) Collect all tissues that appear to be infected. (2) Viral isolation, especially with EBV, is not diagnostically useful, due to long incubation periods. (3) NOTE: These diseases are characterized by a deficiency of a variety of hydrolases, resulting in accumulation of gly-cosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) and glycolipids within lysosomes of fibroblasts, macrophages, white cells, and parenchymal cells of many organs (1, 2) . Mucopolysaccharides are also excreted in the urine. The general approach is similar in all types. Formalin may dissolve all of the stored material and leave empty vacuoles in the involved cells. Therefore, frozen sections should be utilized or tissues should be fixed in absolute alcohol. The accumulated material will show intense metachromasia if stained with toluidine blue. It will also stain with PAS, alcian blue, and colloidal iron. Oil red a will also stain the material from frozen sections. For specimen preparation for elec-tron microscopy, see Chapter IS.

(4) Special precautions may be required (see Chapter 6). (5) Serologic studies may be helpful once a specific etiologic agent is suspected. Thus, collect serum at the time of autopsy or procure serum that was collected prior to death. (6) This may be a reportable disease. Related Terms: Acute interstitial pneumonia (Hamman-Rich syndrome); desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP); idiopathic organizing pneumonia (or "bronchiolitis obliterans with patchy organizing pneumonia [BOOP]" or "cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis"); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis (LIP); nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) (or "cellular interstitial pneumonia" [eIP]); usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP); fibrosing alveolitis; pulmonary alveolitis; and many others. NOTE: The conditions listed under "Related Terms" are histologic variants of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. VIP is synonymous with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (1). Diffuse alveolar damage is the histologic finding in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome* (ARDS) causing interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis. This is an acute condition, referred to as acute interstitial pneumonia when it occurs as an idiopathic form of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia. Possible Associated Conditions: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome* (AIDS) in patients with with LIP or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (2,3); trauma and shock in ARDS. Secondary pulmonary fibrosis from inhalants (extrinsic allergic alveolitis or pneumonia; pneumoconiosis*), in drug-induced pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (microgranulomatous hypersensitivity reaction of lung), rheumatoid arthritis,* Sjogren's syndrome,* and other collagen-vascular diseases; primary biliary cirrhosis in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (2). External examination  Postmortem chest roentgenograms provide the only reliable and permanent record of a pneumothorax and its main complication, mediastinal shift due to a tension pneumothorax (Fig.  11-4) . If roentgenograms cannot be prepared, a reasonably reliable diagnosis still can be made if the prosector inserts a needle through the lateral chest wall. The needle should be connected to a water-filled flask. Ifa pneumothorax is present, gas bubbles appear in the flask as shown in Fig. 11 -5. One can also expose the intact parietal pleura and observe if the lung tissue is separated from the parietal pleura by gas. Incising the thorax at the base of a water-filled skin pocket is the least reliable method. Infants can be totally submerged under water before the chest cavity is incised. However, care must be taken not to make an accidental incision into the underlying lung tissue. Poisoning, All Types or Type Unspecified NOTE: If a specific substance is suspected-for instance, arsenic or ethylene glycol-follow procedures described under the appropriate entry. Similar entries can be found for poisons whose general character or source is known-for instance, gas or mushroom poisoning. For some substances, the appropriate entry can be found under "Abuse,...," "Death,...," or "Dependence, ..." In all instances, routine sampling of toxicologic material should be done as described in Chapter 13. If no specific substances can be incriminated, the toxicologist must be provided with all available clinical information, as shown in Chapter 13. In most cases of fatal poisoning, the coroner or medical examiner must be notified. Poisoning, Alkaloid NOTE: See under specific name of alkaloid-for instance, "Dependence, cocaine," "Poisoning, atropine," "Poisoning, digitalis," or "Poisoning, strychnine." Only a fraction of this large group of plant poisons has been listed. Whether the specific name of the alkaloid is known or unknown, complete toxicologic sampling is recommended. Poisoning, Antimony OTE: Toxicologic material should be submitted for anal ysis, as suggested under "Poisoning, arsenic." Iatrogenic antimony toxicity may occur after treatment with antimony compounds for conditions such as filariasis, fungal infections, and schistosomiasis.* External examination and eyes Pharynx and gastrointestinal tract Heart, liver, and kidneys Record skin changes and eye abnormalities. For toxicologic sampling of contents, see Chapter 13. Submit tissue samples for histologic study. Request frozen sections for Sudan stain. If exposure was from du t in smelting work, dermatitis and conjunctivitis may be present. Severe gastroenteritis in acute poisoning. If victim drank antimony trichloride, ulcerative pharyngitis and gastritis may be present. Fatty changes of myocardium and hepatic and renal parenchyma. Poisoning, Arsenic NOTE: Toxicologic material will be contaminated by bringing it in contact with fluids. Keratinized tissues take up arsenic from solutions. Put plastic bags over hands of victim. If exhumed bodies are investigated for arsenic poisoning, include material from surrounding soil and coffin along with tissues submitted for chemical analysis. Interpretation of toxicologic findings: After fatal poisoning, arsenic concentrations in the liver tend to exceed 0.5-1.0 mg/IOO g wet tissue. In acute poisoning, arsenic concentrations in hair may reach 3 !1g/g (1) and in nails 8 !1g/g. Organs Collect all contents, particularly in accidental poisoning in children. Body dry and warm after death. Mydriasis. Iatrogenic atrioventricular block (1) . Fruits of Atropa belladonna or seeds of Datura stramonium may be found. No characteristic findings. Poisoning, Barbiturate(s) NOTE: This type of poisoning has become uncommon. Barbiturates may cause sudden death. In all instances, concomitant alcohol intoxication* must be ruled out. Standard toxicologic sampling is sufficient. Blood Bile Urine Esophagus and stomach Liver and brain Procedures Submit samples of blood from portal vein and peripheral veins or heart for toxicologic study. Refrigerate for possible toxicologic study. Record total volume and pH value. Request tests for protein, glucose, and ketones; request drug screen. Submit all contents and record their character.

For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Peripheral neuritis. Synonyms: Bromine poisoning; bromism. NOTE: The lethal dose is about 0.2 g in children and I g in adults (ingested). After fatal methyl bromide poisoning, headspace gas chromatography revealed a subclavian blood concentration of 3.0 microgram/mL whereas inorganic bromide concentrations were 530 micrograms/mL in the blood (1). Tissue concentrations were lower than those in the blood. Toxicologic samples should include liver and kidneys. Chemical bums on face and conjunctivitis indicate direct exposure; skin pustules over body and nodose bromoderma of the legs indicate bromism. Blood is best suited for bromide determination. After ingestion of bromide, necrosis with brown discoloration of mucosa of upper gastrointestinal tract may be present. After inhalation of bromide, swelling and inflammation ofmucous membranes in upper and lower respiratory tracts may be present. There may be pulmonary edema. Pneumonia occurs in bromism. Organs to be analyzed for Cd should have no contact with water or be contaminated with blood; they should be sealed in polyethylene bags. Cd leaks into fixation fluid. Postmortem blood concentrations are very high and no indicator of the antemortem values (1).

Collect renal tissue for light microscopic and electron microscopic study. Sample for toxicologic study. Submit samples for histologic study also. Poisoning, Carbon Monoxide NOTE: If the victim had been in a fire, see also under "Bums." Carbon monoxide poisoning may rarely be responsible for automobile accidents. Relatively low carboxyhemoglobin concentrations may contribute to death if there is concomitant poisoning-forinstance, with alcohol or drugs, particularly sedatives. Anemia, atherosclerotic heart disease, and chronic pulmonary disease also increase sensitivity to carbon monoxide. Ifblood had been withdrawn at time of hospital admissionfor instance, for crossmatching-submit this for carboxyhemoglobin determination. If no blood can be obtained, see under "Heart, kidneys, and other organs." For quick-orienting qualitative tests, for quantitative methods of carbon monoxide determi-nation, and for interpretation of toxicologic findings, see below. Request also determination of hemoglobin concentrations and of blood alcohol. Request drug screen. For shipping of blood and tissues for carbon monoxide determination, see Chapter 15. It should be noted that losses of up to 60% of the original saturation occurred when blood was kept in uncapped container at room temperature for 2 Yz wk or at 4°C for 3 wk. External examination Blood Heart, kidneys, and other organs Brain Record color of fingernails, particularly in heavily pigmented persons in whom lividity is difficult to discern. Record appearance of blood and submit sample of postmortem blood for toxicologic study. See also above under "Note." If no blood can be obtained, prepare water extract of spleen, kidneys, or other organs. Request determination of carbon monoxide content and of carbon monoxide-binding capacity of this mixture. Submit tissue samples for histologic study. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Pink skin and fingernails; bullous edema of skin; decubital ulcers. Blood tends to be cherry red. For interpretation of toxicologic findings, see below. Necrosis of papillary muscles in the heart or myocardial infarction may occur. Renal tubular degeneration may also be found. Acute kidney failure* has been observed after rhabdomyolysis complicated by compartment syndrome (2) . Hemorrhagic necrosis of basal ganglia (lenticular nucleus in globus pallidus); diffuse petechial hemorrhages in white matter; cerebral edema. Acute hydrocephalus in infants (3) . Many methods of carbon monoxide determination have been described. Currently, carboxyhemoglobin is detected in most medical examiner toxicology laboratories by visible spectrophotometry or gas chromatography. In hospitals, carboxyhemoglobin is frequently detected and reported in the course of routine arterial blood gas analysis. Pink discoloration of skin and organs usually indicates the presence of more than 30% carboxyhemoglobin (but rule out cyanide poisoning* and exposure to cold*). In a healthy, middle-aged person, a carboxyhemoglobin concentration greater than 50-60% is usually fatal. If the victim was anemic or suffered from chronic lung disease, particularly emphysema* or atherosclerotic heart disease, the concentration may be lower. In association with alcohol, sedatives, and other drugs, carboxyhemoglobin levels may also be much lower and yet fatal. A heavy cigarette smoker may have a carboxyhemoglobin concentration of 8-10%, and higher levels may occur in police officers and other persons exposed to automobile exhaust in dense traffic. If the victim survived the carbon monoxide poisoning for several hours, postmortem blood samples usually will fail to show the presence of carboxyhemoglobin. In these instances, blood taken at the time of admission to the hospital may still be available and of particular value. If the victim had spent 1 h in fresh air before death, 40-50% of the carbon monoxide will have been removed, and 8-10% will have been removed during each subsequent hour. Even though clearance may be complete, death may still occur-primarily from brain damage and infectious complications in prolonged coma. or delayed by only a few hours, particularly after inhalation of carbon tetrachloride. Sudden death probably is caused by cardiac dysrrhythmia. Alcohol concentrations should be determined in all cases or, if death was delayed, evidence of drinking at the time of exposure should be sought. Alcohol considerably increases the hazards of carbon tetrachloride. NOTE: See also under "Bronchitis, acute chemical" and under "Poisoning, gas." Hydrochloric acid is sold by plumbing supply houses and pool supply companies as muriatic acid. It is a liquid. Chlorine is a water-soluble gas. As supplied for pool sanitation, liquid chlorine is usually acidic. For convenience, chlorine and hydrochloric acid are discussed here together. Prepare photographs of face. Conjunctivitis and cyanosis in chlorine gas poisoning; burns of lips from hydrochloric acid. See also above under "Larynx and trachea." Photograph opened esophagus and stomach. Sample for histologic study, particularly if there is doubt whether a perforation was antemortem or postmortem. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Severe pulmonary edema, bronchopneumonia, and swelling of mucous membranes in chlorine poisoning. Arterial thrombosis may occur. Pulmonary fibrosis may develop after prolonged survival. Swelling and ulceration of mucous membranes in chlorine poisoning; acute laryngotracheitis. Tracheoesophageal perforation. Corrosion of mucosa with thickening, hemorrhage, and blackish discoloration after ingestion of hydrochloric acid. Antemortem and postmortem perforation may occur. Glomerular capillary thromboses. Hemorrhages in white matter (1). Poisoning, Cyanide Synonym: Hydrocyanic acid (hydrogen cyanide) poisoning. NOTE: Hydrocyanic acid (hydrogen cyanide, HCN) is a water-soluble gas. Its salts, sodium cyanide and potassium cyanide are sold as "eggs" to the jewelry industry. Hydrocyanic acid is formed when cyanide salts are dissolved in acidic solutions. Containers from which the poison might have been ingested or inhaled should also be submitted for toxicologic examination. For cyanide screening tests in the autopsy room and for interpretation offindings, see below. Caution: Stomach may still contain cyanide gas, formed by acidic reaction of cyanide salt. It may be best to open the stomach under a hood (1). The odor is quite characteristic for cyanide poisoning but most persons are unable to smell this odor. It is helpful to know in advance if any person in an office or laboratory can smell cyanide. Forensic pathologists who can smell the compound state that it has its own specific odor, which differs from the often quoted smell of bitter almonds. Autopsies also can be done in a negatively pressured isolation room (1). For odor, see above under "Note." Bright red skin color is not always present. Corrosion around mouth and in oral cavity may be found after ingestion of potassium or sodium cyanide. Blood is fluid and sometimes bright red. If potassium or sodium cyanide was ingested, brown-red mucosal corrosion may be present in stomach or in upper digestive tract. Pulmonary edema. For odor, see above under "Note." If death was not instantaneous, there may be hyaline thrombi in small blood vessels, minute hemorrhages, and necroses of lenticular nuclei. This test can be used for blood and gastric contents (2) . Dip squares of filter paper in a small amount ofsaturated picric acid. Let these squares dry until barely moist. Place a drop ofthe material to be tested-e.g., blood or gastric contents--on a piece of paper. Let material dry for a moment, and then place one drop of 10% sodium carbonate in the center of the material to be tested. Ifcyanide is present, a reddish purple color will chromatograph out from the material. The higher the concentration of cyanide the more blue the color will be. It is possible to recognize whole blood because the blood turns a rather dark brown and the reddish to purple color is clearly visible. High concentrations of sulfide interfere by giving a false-positive test. Another screening test is done as follows (3) . Dip filter paper into normal blood. Then treat the paper with potassium chlorate, whereupon brown methemoglobin forms. Place this preparation into the fluid suspected of containing cyanide (e.g., blood, gastric contents, pulmonary edema fluid). If bright red cyanmethemoglobin forms, the reaction is positive. If the concentration of cyanide in the stomach is high and the concentration in the lungs is low, cyanide was ingested. Alternatively, if the pulmonary cyanide concentration is high and the concentrtaion in the gastric contents is low, hydrogen cyanide most likely was inhaled. Occasionally, minimal cyanide levels will be present in decomposed bodies. Related Term: Digoxin toxicity. NOTE: Certain drugs may interfere with correct digitalis determination. Blood Heart Vitreous Procedures Submit sample of peripheral blood for digoxin radioimmunoassay. Freeze fresh myocardium for digitalis extraction. Submit sample for digoxin radioimmunoassay.

NOTE: If cause of food poisoning is unknown, submit suspected food for aerobic and anaerobic cultures, Gram stain of smears, and routine toxicologic study. This should include tests for heavy metals (antimony, cadmium, and lead) that may have leaked from old cooking utensils. Test for the presence of staphylococcal enterotoxin are done only in specialized laboratories. If botulism is suspected, follow procedures described under that heading. Mushroom poisoning also is listed as a separate entity. If Salmonella food poisoning is suspected, see under "Fever, typhoid." See also under "Enteritis" or "Enterocolitis" or under another specific heading such as "Dysentery, bacillary."

External examination and skin Rabies NOTE: (I) In most instances, an autopsy limited to the brain is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. (2) Rabies virus is especially infectious and thus, universal precautions should be strictly followed (see Chapter 6) . Avoid the use of scalpels whenever possible. The generation ofaerosols should be assidu- See above under "Note." If a complete autopsy is done, sample heart, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, submaxillary salivary glands, and adrenal glands; freeze or refrigerate sampled tissues and submit for viral study (see below under "Brain and spinal cord"). Obtain serum for serologic studies. Freeze or refrigerate cerebral tissue immediately after removal and submit frozen to special laboratory for fluorescent antibody staining. Take these sections from hippocampus or brain stem. Place the refrigerated tissues in 50% neutral glycerol saline solution for preservation. Fix remaining brain and spinal cord tissue in 15% formalin and submit for histologic study. As an alternative to freezing of tissue, immunoperoxidase methods for detection of rabies viral antigens can now be applied to formalin-fixed tissue (1 In almost all instances, the procedures described under "Assault" and under "Homicide" must also be followed. See also refs. (1) and (2) . For the evaluation of bite marks, photographs with and without scales and black and white film should be used. A forensic dentist is required to compare the victim's bite marks to the teeth of suspects. Swabs of possible sperm or other fluids must be sent to the crime lab for proper evaluation. External examination Other organs and tissues Genital organs Comb pubic hair over a towel and then pull sample; also, pull samples of hair from head. Collect fingernail clippings and place in containers marked "right" and "left." Collect blood, hair, fibers, and residues of urine or saliva and/or semen that may have stained the victim's clothing or that may be found on the skin of the victim. For study of stains and scrapings, see below. Introduce sterile dry cotton swab into the posterior vault of the vagina or-preferablyinto the cervical canal. Prepare smear on glass slide and send to crime laboratory for identification of sperm (see also above under "Note" Using a sterile cotton swab moistened with sterile saline, lift suspected dried spermatic fluid from hair or skin of external genitalia, perineum, buttocks, or other sites. Stains on clothing will be extracted by forensic laboratory personnel. Let specimens air dry in absence of sunlight and then place in paper bags or envelopes and seal. Smears are made for the demonstration of spermatozoa, cytologic changes, bacteria, and other possible findings (Some crime labs prefer to make their own smears from the swabs). Other samples are used for the determination of acid phosphatase, as described below. Usually, the survival time of morphologically recognizable spermatozoa in the vagina is less than 24 h, but on occasion this may be much longer. Thus, within the first 24 h after coitus, 64% of cervical smears have been found to be positive for spermatozoa. At day 10, spermatozoa have been found in 13% of the smears. Obviously, if the assailant had had a vasectomy, spermatozoa will not be found at any time. Spermatozoa have been found in the vagina of some women several days or weeks after death. Dried stains (see above) may give positive results after longer intervals. Acid phosphatase activities greater than 5 Bodansky units (for method, see above) indicate that probably less than 12 h have elapsed since the time of intercourse (I) . In another study, vaginal swab specimens showed acid phosphatase activities of more than 2,000 King If there is evidence of parotid involvement, other salivary glands should also be studied. Parotid gland can be biopsied from scalp incision. Submaxillary gland can be removed with floor of mouth. For sampling and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4.

Synonyms and Related Terms: Bilharziasis; Schistosoma haematobium infection; Schistosoma japonicum infection; Schis-tosoma mansoni infection. NOTE: Unless specifically stated, the changes listed below refer to chronic schistosomiasis mansoni and japonica. (1) Collect all tissues that appear to be infected. (2) Request direct examination for Schistosoma. The following procedures have been described and recommended (1). For demonstration of Schistosoma eggs, compress 4-mm tissue fragments-for instance, mucosa of the urinary bladder-between glass slides. If this gives negative results, digest a 5-g portion of tissue in potassium hydroxide. For the recovery of adult worms of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium, remove the viscera en bloc and rinse with water. Separate the intestines from the mesentery. Subsequently, perfuse the portal vein system, the liver, and one lung with saline (2) . Then pass the perfusion fluid through a monofilament nylon cloth with an aperture size of 180 11m. Submerge the cloth in water and examine with a dissecting microscope. Fix worms in formalin solution. Examine the intestinal mucosa directly. From the urinary bladder, ureters, and surrounding connective tissue, worms can be recovered as follows. Inject water into the tissue until the tissue increases 2 or 3 times in thickness. Then compress the tissue gently with a glass plate. Cut slices 0.1-0.2 cm in thickness. Compress these slices between the glass plate and the stage of a dissecting microscope and examine for the presence ofadult worms. Many worms also will be present in the fluid expressed from the tissue as it is cut. For the counting of eggs in tissues, urine, and feces, see ref. (1) . Immunodiagnostic methods (ELISA and imrnunoblot) also have been developed Prepare skeletal roentgenograms. There are no diagnostic laboratory tests but it still is advisable to save a blood sample.

Submit samples of all major organs, including endocrine glands, lymphatic and fat tissue, bone, and bone marrow for histologic study. Hunger edema; skin changes secondary to vitamin deficiencies. Hypoproteinemia. Atrophy; hemosiderosis of spleen. Degree of atrophy varies from organ to organ; atrophy of fat tissue, lymphoid tissue, and gonads usually is most pronounced. Severe infections, such as tuberculosis,* may be present without having been apparent clinically. Steatohepatitis, Nonalcoholic (NASH) NOTE: The morphologic findings in the liver are indistinguishable from those in alcoholic liver disease* (1). Follow autopsy procedures described under "Disease, alcoholic liver." If the patient had received a liver transplant, procedures described under "Transplantation, liver" should be followed also. Possible Associated Conditions: Celiac sprue (rare); diabetes mellitus* (type 2); hyperlipidemia; malnutrition* from bulemia (rare); morbid obesity with liver failure particularly after episodes of rapid weight loss (e.g., after recent gastroplasty); lipodystrophy; mild obesity;* short bowel syndrome (rare); total parenteral nutrition. * Stenosis, Congenital Valvular Pulmonary Related Terms: Isolated (pure, simple, or dome-shaped) pulmonary stenosis. NOTE: The pulmonary valve is usually acommissural in isolated congenital pulmonary stenosis. With other coexistant congenital heart disease (such as tetralogy), the pulmonary valve is usually bicuspid and hypoplastic, but may be unicommissural or dys-plastic and tricuspid. Heart and great vessels; peripheral pulmonary arteries Brain Procedures Culture any grossly infected valve. For general dissection techniques, see Chapter 3. Record weight of heart, thickness of ventricles, and annular circumferences. For removal and specimen preparation, see Chapter 4. Infective endocarditis* of pulmonary valve and tricuspid valve; infective endarteritis at bifurcation of pulmonary trunk. It is preferable to have autopsies of fetuses and stillborns performed by pathologists experienced in perinatal pathology. If such personnel are not immediately available, the attending pathologist may nevertheless collect important information. If attempts to induce abortion appear to have caused the death of the mother, see "Death, abortion-associated." The placenta should be immediately procured from the delivery room should it not arrive in the laboratory with the fetus. This will avoid the possibility of the placenta being discarded by the delivery room staff. No fetal autopsy is complete without a careful examination of the placenta (see Part I, Chapter 2). Pathologic changes of placenta that are causative of stillbirth are summarized in Ref. 1 . Fascia lata or other aseptically obtained tissue should be collected for tissue culture for karyotype analysis. If the fetus is at all autolyzed, then the fascia lata cells may not grow in tissue culture. Therefore, if the fetus shows any evidence of autolysis, tissue should be taken aseptically, from placenta immediately beneath the chorionic plate. A portion ofplacenta and liver should also be snap-frozen for possible molecular analysis. The initial stage of the autopsy should include photography and radiography, taking anterior-posterior and lateral views. The photographs will record the degree of maceration, which can be roughly correlated with the duration of fetal demise before delivery [1] External measurements should include body weight, circumference ofhead, chest and abdomen, crown-rump length, crown-heel length, and foot length. These measurements are compared with Tables of standards for normal fetuses (see Part III of this book). Assessment of growth retardation may be based on these data. A careful external examination should search for abnormalities such as jaundice, bulging fontanel, cranial bone softening, hyper-or hypotelorism, choanal atresia, external ear anomalies, cleft lip, cleft palate, macroglossia, micrognathia, colobomata, cystic hygroma, shortened neck, contractures, omphalocele, gastroschisis, abnormal external genitalia, anal atresia, absent vagina, sacral pits, open neural tube defects, hemihypertrophy, syndactyly, clinodactyly, transverse palmar creases, or incomplete descent of testes. The organ bloc may be removed in the manner similar to the adult, using the technique of Letulle (see Chapter 2) . If the thyroid gland is noted to be in its usual location and if it appears normal, then the tongue may be left in the body. In macerated fetuses, it is suggested that the organ bloc be fixed overnight in formalin solution prior to dissection. To aid adequate fixation, the following simple steps may be done: I) wash the organ bloc thoroughly prior to fixation; 2) place multiple transverse cuts through the liver and lungs; 3) dissect the posterior leaves of the diaphragm away from the adrenal glands and kidneys; 4) bivalve the adrenal glands and kidneys in the coronal plane; 5) instill formalin in the lumen of the intestine, using a syringe; and 6) gently instill formalin into both ventricles of the heart, being careful to avoid the ventricular septum. The procedure for dissection of the organs is similar to that of the adult except: 1) The venous and arterial connections of the heart, including the patency of the ductus arteriosus must be determined before the heart is removed; 2) The esophagus must be opened posteriorly prior to its complete removal so that esophageal atresia or tracheo-esophageal fistula may be recognized and photographed prior to further dissection; 3) The location of the appendix and of the testes should be recorded. Until the intestine has been examined for stenosis or atresia, the mesentery should be left attached. The degree of autolysis as seen grossly and with histologic examination of both the fetus and the placenta can be used to estimate the duration of time between fetal death and delivery (2, 3, 4) . Trichrome stain is useful for better visualizing histologic features in severely autolyzed tissue. To remove the brain, Benecke's technique of one of its modifications may be used. Stillbirth vs Livebirth. A decision has to be made whether the infant was born alive or was stillborn. The hydrostatic lung test, described in the previous edition, appears unreliable. The presence of gas in the lungs does not rule out stillbirth. After death, air can be introduced into the lungs, or putrefaction gases might be present. However, air artificially introduced after death will not distend the alveoli and can be squeezed out, whereas this does not seem to be the case after active ventilation. The distribution of fat in the fetal zone of the adrenal cortex may indicate whether intrauterine death was acute, more prolonged, or chronic (3). This is particularly helpful if the stillborn baby is macerated. If the mother died also, see under "Death, abortion-associated" Strangulation NOTE: In many instances, procedures described under "Hom-icide" must also be followed. If a rope or some other material had been used (see also under "Hanging"), leave ligature in place until autopsy can be done. See also under "Hypoxia." Toxicologic sampling, particularly for alcohol, should be done in all instances (Chapter 13). results than body fluids. (2) Universal precautions should be strictly followed. The generation of aerosols should be minimized. To sterilize tissue surfaces in preparation for culture, swab the surface with povidone iodine. Avoid searing the tissue surface since this will produce an aerosol. Keep no more than one scalpel in the dissecting area at anyone time. Have an assistant available with clean, gloved hands to receive specimens in containers, so as to minimize the degree of contamination on the outside of the containers. For cleaning procedures and related information, see Chapter 6. (3) HIV-l in tissue may be demonstrated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or immunofluorescence. (4) For immunocytochemical and molecular studies, fix tissue in ethanol or Carnoy's solution. The virus can be identified using PCR in most tissues, whether fresh, frozen, or fixed in ethanol. (5) Serologic tests as well as direct fluorescent antibody tests are avail-able for many of the expected infections. (6) This is not a reportable disease.

For expected bone marrow changes, see above under "Synonyms and Related Terms." Autopsy procedures are similar to those recommended for most cases of leukemia, with particular attention paid to intercurrent infections and thrombocytopenic hemorrhages.
